It is also not clear how intravenous inotropic therapyand mechanical cardiac assist devices (MCAD) affect cognitive function.METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional cognitive preliminary study evaluated252 potential heart transplant candidates assessing functions in memory, motor,and processing speed. Patients were divided into three HF groups based onseverity of disease: group 1 outpatients (n = 113), group 2 in-patients requiringinotropic infusion (n = 83), and group 3 inpatients likely requiring MCAD support(n = 56). Aggregate z-scores for memory, motor, and processing speed andindependent samples t tests assessed intergroup differences on 13 cognitivemeasures.RESULTS: A broad pattern of cognitive impairment was observed within the advancedHF group; fewer deficits were found in group 1 outpatients and more severedeficits in group 3 MCAD subjects. A difference in motor functions was observedas the earliest abnormality, with group 3 showing significant changes comparedwith group 1. The most dramatic changes were seen in domain mental processingspeed along with specific verbal and visual memory functions, which were slowerin group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive deficits are common in advanced HF and worsen withincreasing severity of HF.

VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of ourpediatric patients while supported with a VAD.DESIGN: In this prospective study, pediatric patients who underwent VADplacement, and their parents, were administered a generic Pediatric Quality ofLife Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD implant, when feasible, after the acutepostoperative period, and then periodically until heart transplant or death.Their final scores while on support were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls, outpatients with severe heart disease, and childrenafter heart transplant.RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VADsupport greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was 10.0 Â± 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months. Eleven(85\\\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\\\%) patient remaining alive onsupport. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was 1.4(0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total andphysical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups. Self-reportedpsychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy controls only.Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all three comparisongroups for all three categories (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: A large deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patientssupported by a VAD compared with outpatient management of severe heart disease orpostheart transplant patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group withmore severe heart failure.

Thedisease is highly prevalent in the elderly population and often follows a course of progressive disability and deterioration. An estimated 15 000 patients withend-stage heart failure could benefit from heart transplant each year. Yet, as a result of a significant shortage of donor organs, only 2500 hearts are donatedannually, and approximately one-third of patients awaiting heart transplant dieeach year. Mechanical circulatory support, primarily in the form of leftventricular assist devices (LVADs), has come to the forefront of treatment forsevere congestive heart failure by providing a feasible alternative to patientswho might otherwise die awaiting heart transplant. The arrival of LVADs hasresulted in a dramatic shift in the management of heart failure, one that willundoubtedly affect and include a vast proportion of elderly patients. While LVADsrepresent a surgical approach to a disease that has traditionally been managedmedically, the pharmacological application throughout the perioperative periodremains of critical importance. Five primary classes of drugs bear specificapplication to the LVAD population: (i) drugs that provide haemodynamic support; (ii) antimicrobials; (iii) anticoagulants and antiplatelets; (iv) agents thatpromote myocardial recovery; and (v) miscellaneous other medications. Drugs that provide haemodynamic support are subdivided into inotropes, vasopressors andpulmonary vasodilators. Some combination of these medications is usuallyadministered within the perioperative period in order to maintain stable patient haemodynamics and assure proper LVAD function. Antimicrobials are of paramountimportance in the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods to minimise the risk of infection, an unfortunately common complication of LVAD therapy that can havepotentially morbid consequences. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications are necessary for certain types of LVADs and serve to curb the incidence of devicethrombus formation and associated embolic phenomena. Pharmacotherapeutic agentsthat facilitate myocardial recovery are being investigated as adjuncts to LVADsupport so that bridge to recovery can become a realistic outcome for a growingnumber of LVAD patients.

However, expansion of this technology is still limited bycomplications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential toidentify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditionalcardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base tosupport these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did notidentify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potentialpredictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely arelatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasivetechniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements andvalidated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting ofCF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) considerpotential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTNmanagement is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the newreliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research andmanagement possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the CF-LVAD patient population move forward.PMCID: PMC4385742 [Available on 2016-05-01]: 25284807  [pubmed - indexed for medline]104. heart fail rev. 2015 may;20(3):317-22. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3.hypertension: an unstudied potential risk factor for adverse outcomes duringcontinuous flow ventricular assist device support.wasson lt(1), yuzefpolskaya m, wakabayashi m, takayama h, naka y, uriel n, jorde up, demmer rt, colombo pc.author information: (1)newyork-presbyterian, columbia university medical center, 622 west 168thstreet, ph12-134, new york, ny, 10032-3720, usa.in end-stage heart failure, left ventricular assist devices (lvads) represent an exciting new frontier in which post-device implantation survival approaches that of heart transplant. however, expansion of this technology is still limited bycomplications that impact morbidity and mortality. thus, it is essential toidentify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. one such predictor may be hypertension (htn). not only may chronic htn as a traditionalcardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term lvad support, but htn may also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.although current guidelines identify blood pressure (bp) control as important to outpatient continuous flow (cf) lvad management, there is no evidence base tosupport these guidelines. indeed, our comprehensive literature search did notidentify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation htn as a potentialpredictor of adverse cf-lvad outcomes. htn among cf-lvad patients is likely arelatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasivetechniques to measure bp in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. fortunately,recent research has elucidated the meaning of doppler bp measurements andvalidated a slow-cuff deflation system for bp measurements in the setting ofcf-lvad support. therefore, cf-lvad researchers and clinicians may (1) considerpotential mechanisms relating htn to poor outcomes, (2) realize that htnmanagement is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the newreliable and valid methods for outpatient bp measurement that make research andmanagement possible. it is critical and now feasible that research on htn in the cf-lvad patient population move forward.pmcid: pmc4385742 [available on 2016-05-01]',heartDevices

Electronicaddress: aileen.clarke@warwick.ac.uk.Comment in    J Heart Lung Transplant. 2014 Apr;33(4):344-6.BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced heart failure may receive a left ventricularassist device (LVAD) as part of a bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy. The UnitedKingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton,CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed tocompare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program.METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Basewere analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomeswere time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences ofHT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistateeconomic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was fromthe NHS, discount rates were 3.5\\\%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years(QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GBÂ£) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs HMII.RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulativeincidence of HT was low for both groups (11\\\% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued4.99 lifetime QALYs costing Â£258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84QALYs costing Â£231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for HWvs HM II were Â£23,530 ($37,349) and Â£20,799 ($33,014), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a betterclinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was morecost-effective.

Electronic address:aileen.clarke@warwick.ac.uk. (2)Division of Health Sciences, Warwick MedicalSchool, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom. (3)NationalHeart Lung Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.BACKGROUND: A previous cost-effectiveness analysis showed that bridge totransplant (BTT) with early design left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) foradvanced heart failure was more expensive than medical management while appearingless beneficial. Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and thirdgeneration LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimatecomparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flowLVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS.METHODS AND RESULTS: A semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHScosts data and patient data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database(BTDB). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY werecalculated for patients receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotropesupported medical management. LVADs cost Â£80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices anddelivered greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilisticincremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was Â£53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95\\\%CI:Â£31,802-Â£94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates weresensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the device cost by15\\\% decreased the ICER to Â£50,106 ($79,533)/QALY.CONCLUSIONS: Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefitsat higher costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK thresholdof Â£20,000 to Â£30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now beginsto approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently recommended by the British NHS.

The question addressed was: Can the temporary use of right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute rightventricular failure after cardiac surgery? More than 183 papers were found using the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer theclinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patientgroup studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers aretabulated. Indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assistdevice insertion. Significant reductions in central venous pressure (P = 0.005)and mean pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.01) were reported during and afterRVAD support. Furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (P <0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05), right ventricular strokework (P < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (P < 0.05) were alsoseen. Assessment by one study showed that on Day 7 after RVAD removal, the right ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40\\\%. Dynamicechocardiography studies performed before, during and after RVAD placementdemonstrated that after RVAD implantation, right ventricular end-diastolicdimensions (P < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (P < 0.05) and right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) increased. Although several studiessuccessfully weaned patients from an RVAD, there were several complications,including bleeding requiring surgical intervention. However, this may be reduced by using percutaneous implantation (bleeding incidence: 4 of 9 patients) ratherthan by a surgically implanted RVAD (bleeding incidence: 5 of 5 patients).However, mortality is higher in percutaneous RVAD patients rather than insurgical RVAD (80-44\\\%) patients. Causes of death cited for patients on an RVADincluded multiorgan failure, sepsis, thromboembolic events, reoccurring rightheart failure and failure to wean due to persistent right ventricular failure.

Carolina.Alba@uhn.on.caBACKGROUND: The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted CirculatorySupport (INTERMACS) scale classifies advanced heart failure patients according tohemodynamic status. This study assessed the usefulness of the INTERMACS scale to predict outcomes in advanced heart failure patients undergoing mechanicalcirculatory support (MCS).METHODS: Fifty-four patients underwent MCS implantation from 2001 to 2007. Group A included 27 patients at INTERMACS level 1 and 2. Group B included 27 atINTERMACS level 3 and 4. Patient characteristics pre-MCS implant, incidence ofcomplications during support, and survival between groups were compared.RESULTS: Before MCS implantation, Group A had significantly lower cardiac index, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic pulmonary pressure, higher central venous pressure, and lower urine output (p < .05). After MCS, Group A had a lowerincidence of infections (17\\\% vs 46\\\%; odds ratio [OR], 0.25, 95\\\% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.06-0.6) and a higher incidence of liver injury (39\\\% vs 11\\\%; OR5, 95\\\% CI, 1.15-25). Mortality at 30 days was higher in Group A (38\\\% vs 11\\\%; OR, 4.8; 95\\\% CI, 1.1-21); however, the mortality after 30 days post-MCS support wassignificantly higher in Group B (0\\\% vs 18\\\%, p < .05).

Recently, continuous flow VAD (CVAD) has emerged as an attractiveclinical option for long-term mechanical support of HF patients, withbridge-to-transplant outcomes comparable with pulsatile flow VAD (PVAD).Continuous flow VADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than thefirst-generation PVAD. Despite the widespread clinical use, CVAD support has beenassociated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, and aortic valve insufficiency. Speculation that diminished arterial pressure pulsatilityassociated with continuous flow devices may be contributing to thesecomplications has sparked much debate over CVAD support.

Unloading of the left ventricle with animplantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonaryvascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in acohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy.METHODS: Pulmonary haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eightHeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplantby virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4\\\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\\\%(24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortalitywas 7.7\\\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\\\% (10 of 11). Baseline and post-VAD pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic PAP (mmHg), meanPAP, TPG (mmHg) of 57 Â± 9.5, 42 Â± 4.4 and 14 Â± 3.9 reduced to 32 Â± 7.5, 18 Â± 5.5 and 9 Â± 3.3, respectively. PVR reduced from 5 Â± 1.5 to 2.1 Â± 0.5 Wood units (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In selected heart failure patients with secondary PH, use ofcentrifugal LVAD results in significant reductions in PAP, TPG and PVR, which areobserved within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months.

Mechanicalcirculatory support using VADs has been an essential therapeutic tool forpatients with severe heart failure waiting for a heart transplant in clinicalsite. Adaptive control of VADs that automatically adjust the pump output withchanges in a patient state is one of the important approaches for enhancedtherapeutic efficacy, prevention of complications and quality of lifeimprovement. However adaptively controlling a VAD in the realistic situationwould be difficult because it is necessary to model the whole including the VADand the cardiovascular dynamics. To solve this problem, we propose an applicationof attractor selection algorithm using stochastic behavior to a VAD controlsystem.

Gastrointestinal (GI)bleeding has been frequently reported within this population.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart MateII from January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence,etiology, and management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regressionanalysis was conducted to identify related risk factors.RESULTS: A significant incidence of GI bleeding (22.8\\\%) occurred in ourpredominantly destination therapy (DT) (93\\\%) population. Fifty-seven percent ofthe patients with bleeding episodes bled from the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54\\\% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37\\\% from ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35\\\% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI) tract. Previous history of GI bleeding(odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95\\\% CI, 2.2-228.6; p=0.008), elevated internationalnormalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9; p=0.02), and low platelet count(OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were independent predictors of GIhemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in older patients (mean, 70 years;p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60\\\%) rebled from the same site. Managementstrategies included temporarily withholding anticoagulation, decreasing the speedof LVADs, and using octreotide.

We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwentimplantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile(HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and theeffect on body mass index (BMI).METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30Â kg/m(2) who underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for weight change. In the 30-daysurvivors, end points of the study were continued LVAD support, heart transplant,or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass surgery and was excluded.RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria, BMI was 35.6 Â±4.4Â kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 Â± 5.5Â kg/m(2) (mean BMIchangeÂ -2.5Â kg/m(2); PÂ = .063), with a mean follow-up time of 301.6 Â± 255.5 days.The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9Â kg/m(2) (PÂ = .016 vsbaseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1Â kg/m(2) increase in BMI.BMIÂ <30Â kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\\\%), 5 of 19 (26\\\%) inXVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\\\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 XVE, 2 HMII) or50\\\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was 4.6Â kg/m(2)(PÂ = .003).CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30Â kg/m(2) provided significantweight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in recipients of the continuousflow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a heart transplant after LVADinsertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6Â kg/m(2) (PÂ = .003). LVAD implantationprovides a period of hemodynamic support for obese patients with advanced heartfailure, during which time opportunity may be available for weight loss.Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater weight loss thannonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may be necessary toachieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous flow LVAD.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was toinvestigate the effects of myocardial redox state on the activities of MMP-2 and -9 implicated in cardiac remodeling in end-stage heart failure patients supportedby left ventricular assist device (LVAD).METHODS AND RESULTS: During heart transplant (HT) surgery, myocardial specimens(MS) from right ventricular walls and LV walls were obtained from 7 LVADrecipients (LVAD group, MS n=35) and from 7 stable HT candidates on medicaltherapy (MT group, MS n=35). Myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression,tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and -4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1 and aminothiol concentrations were measured. MMP-2 and -9 activities were evaluatedalso by incubating MS with different amounts of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH). MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression were lower in the LVAD group,whereas myocardial TIMP-1 and -4 concentrations were comparable to those of MTpatients. Higher GSH and TGF-Î²1 concentrations were found in LVAD-recipients.Only GSH concentrations were inversely related to MMP-2 and -9 activities. Invitro, GSH had an inhibitory effect on MMP-2 and -9 activities.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD recipients show reduced myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression when compared to medically treated patients. Changes of myocardialredox state, predominantly GSH-dependent, appear to modulate MMP-2 and -9activities by an inhibitory effect dependent on thiol content.

Methods applied at the right timebefore the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance forsurvival and prolong life.CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient with heart failure in dilatativecardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood circulatory support andextracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO), followed by a 13-dayimplantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa Heart EXT, was used as abridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant (OHT).

Ventricular assist devices were placed as a bridge totransplant in 110 patients. We focused our analysis on the 2 most common causesof end-stage heart failure requiring transplantation: idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy (n = 201) and coronary artery disease (n = 213). Data includinggender, age, date of transplant, cause of heart failure, prior heart transplant, placement of a ventricular assist device, type of ventricular assist device, and panel-reactive antibody sensitization were analyzed to derive Kaplan-Meiersurvival probabilities and multivariable Cox regression models.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who received aventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant, survival was decreased at 1 year (P = .008) and 5 years (P = .019), but not at 10 years, posttransplant. Inpatients with coronary artery disease, the use of a ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant did not influence survival at 1, 5, and 10 tearsposttransplant.

Furthermore,prior studies with pulsatile LVADs have shown that transplantation, either early (<6 weeks) or late (>6 months) after LVAD implantation, adversely affectedpost-cardiac transplant survival. We sought to determine factors related toposttransplant survival in patients supported with continuous-flow LVADs.METHODS: The HeartMate II LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif) wasimplanted in 468 patients as a bridge to transplant at 36 centers in amulticenter trial. Patients who underwent transplantation after support werestratified by demographics: gender, age, etiology, body mass index, duration ofdevice support, and by adverse events during support. The median age was 54 years(range 18-73 years); 43\\\% had ischemic etiology, and 18\\\% were women. Survival was determined at the specific intervals of 30 days and 1 year after transplantation.RESULTS: Of 468 patients, 250 (53\\\%) underwent cardiac transplant after a medianduration of LVAD support of 151 days (longest: 3.2 years), 106 (23\\\%) died, 12(2.6\\\%) recovered ventricular function and the device was removed, and 100 (21\\\%)were still receiving LVAD support. The overall 30-day and 1-year posttransplantsurvivals were 97\\\% and 87\\\%. There were no significant differences in survivalbased on demographic factors or LVAD duration of less than 30 days, 30 to 90days, 90 to 180 days, and more than 180 days. Patients requiring more than 2units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support had astatistically significant decreased 1-year survival (82\\\% vs 94\\\%) when comparedwith patients who did not require more than 2 units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support (P = .03). There was a trend for slightly lowersurvival at 1 year in patients with percutaneous lead infections during LVADsupport versus no infection (75\\\% vs 89\\\%; P = .07).CONCLUSIONS: Post-cardiac transplant survival in patients supported withcontinuous-flow devices such as the HeartMate II LVAD is equivalent to that with conventional transplantation. Furthermore, posttransplant survival is notinfluenced by the duration of LVAD support. The improved durability and reducedshort- and long-term morbidity associated with the HeartMate II LVAD has reduced the need for urgent cardiac transplantation, which may have adversely influenced survival in the pulsatile LVAD era.

However, it remains to be seen whether newer continuous-flow leftventricular assist devices have a similar effect on pulmonary hypertension. Theobjective of this study was to determine whether the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp,Pleasanton, Calif), a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device, iseffective in improving pulmonary hemodynamics in the period after leftventricular assist device support and posttransplant.METHODS: Fifty patients with end-stage heart failure underwent HeartMate II left ventricular assist device placement as a bridge to transplant. We evaluated theirpulmonary hemodynamics with right-sided heart catheterization at baseline, after left ventricular assist device placement, and after heart transplant.RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 53.7 +/- 13.5 years. Ischemic etiology was present in 60\\\% of the patients. After left ventricular assist device placement(mean duration, 135 +/- 60 days), mean systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterypressures decreased significantly from a baseline of 55.2 +/- 13.4 mm Hg and 27.3+/- 6.8 mm Hg, respectively, to 35.9 +/- 10.8 mm Hg and 15.8 +/- 6.5 mm Hg,respectively (P < .001). Similarly, mean pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly from a baseline of 3.6 +/- 1.9 Woods units to 2.1 +/- 0.8 Woodsunits (P < .001). Posttransplant pulmonary hemodynamics also remained withinnormal limits, even in patients with previously severe pulmonary hypertension.CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices effectively improvepulmonary hemodynamics associated with end-stage heart failure. Moreover,pulmonary hemodynamics remain within normal limits in the posttransplant period, even in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

Although cardiac transplantation is anexcellent treatment option, it is a limited resource and most patients areineligible for cardiac transplantation using standard listing criteria.Increasingly, newer surgical options for these patients include the usage ofmarginal donor organs in an extended criteria-alternate list heart transplantprogram (EC-AL), or left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy(DT-LVAD). The purpose of this study was to compare baseline characteristics and outcomes after EC-AL versus DT-LVAD.METHODS: From March 2000 to August 2008, 153 consecutive patients who had beenturned down for standard heart transplantation underwent either EC-AL or DT-LVAD.The most common reasons for standard heart transplant ineligibility for bothgroups were advanced age, diabetes mellitus with end-organ dysfunction, andsignificant renal insufficiency. Patients in the alternate list program received a donor organ that had been turned down by all other centers for standard listrecipients. The most common reasons for donor heart refusal were decreased leftventricular function, left ventricle hypertrophy, or coronary artery disease.Outcomes for both groups were retrospectively reviewed after Institutional ReviewBoard permission was obtained. Comparisons were also made between patients thathad been matched by propensity score analysis.RESULTS: In all, 93 patients underwent EC-AL, and 60 underwent DT-LVAD. Baseline preoperative characteristics of both groups were similar except that 87\\\% ofDT-LVAD patients (52 of 60) required preoperative mechanical or inotropic supportwhereas only 51\\\% of EC-AL patients (47 of 93) required support (p<0.0001).Thirty-day operative mortality and 1-year survival were 2.5\\\% and 82.2\\\% for EC-AL and 6.7\\\% and 77.5\\\% DT-LVAD, respectively (p=0.2411 and p=0.5036). Overallsurvival at 3 years was better for EC-AL versus DT-LVAD. The DT-LVAD patients hadimproved survival compared with the Randomized Evaluation of MechanicalAssistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial DT-LVAD cohort, a historical control. These findings were corroborated in the analysis ofpropensity-matched patients.CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively, the DT-LVAD cohort was more unstable, with greaterneed for inotropes or mechanical support. Despite this, perioperative and 1-year mortality was similar for the two groups. Three-year survival was better forEC-AL.

Especially in patients with chronic heart failure, theethical and medico-legal issues associated with providing maximal possible careor withholding the same are coming to the forefront. Procedures, such as cardiac transplantation, have strict criteria for adequate candidacy. These criteria for subsequent listing are based on clinical outcome data but also reflect thereality of organ shortage.

': 14721801  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]1572. Ont Health Technol Assess Ser. 2004;4(3):1-69. Epub 2004 Mar 1.Left ventricular assist devices: an evidence-based analysis.Health Quality Ontario.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this health technology policy assessment was todetermine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using implantableventricular assist devices in the treatment of end-stage heart failure.HEART FAILURE: Heart failure is a complex syndrome that impairs the ability ofthe heart to maintain adequate blood circulation, resulting in multiorganabnormalities and, eventually, death. In the period of 1994 to 1997, 38,702individuals in Ontario had a first hospital admission for heart failure. Despite reported improvement in survival, the five-year mortality rate for heart failure is about 50\\\%. For patients with end-stage heart failure that does not respond to medical therapy, surgical treatment or traditional circulatory assist devices,heart transplantation (in appropriate patients) is the only treatment thatprovides significant patient benefit. HEART TRANSPLANT IN ONTARIO: With ashortage in the supply of donor hearts, patients are waiting longer for a hearttransplant and may die before a donor heart is available. From 1999 to 2003, 55to 74 people received a heart transplant in Ontario each year. Another 12 to 21people died while waiting for a suitable donor heart. Of these, 1 to 5 deathsoccurred in people under 18 years old. The rate-limiting factor in hearttransplant is the supply of donor hearts. Without an increase in available donor hearts, attempts at prolonging the life of some patients on the transplant waitlist could have a harmful effect on other patients that are being pushed down thewaiting list (knock on effect). LVAD TECHNOLOGY: Ventricular assist devices[VADs] have been developed to provide circulatory assistance to patients withend-stage heart failure. These are small pumps that usually assist the damagedleft ventricle [LVADs] and may be situated within the body (intracorporeal] oroutside the body [extracorporeal). Some of these devices were designed for use inthe right ventricle [RVAD] or both ventricles (bi-ventricular). LVADs have beenmainly used as a \\\"bridge-to-transplant\\\" for patients on a transplant waitinglist. As well, they have been used as a \\\"bridge-to-recovery\\\" in acute heartfailure, but this experience is limited. There has been an increasing interest inusing LVAD as a permanent (destination) therapy. REVIEW OF LVAD BY THE MEDICALADVISORY SECRETARIAT: The Medical Advisory Secretariat\\s review included adescriptive synthesis of findings from five systematic reviews and 60 reportspublished between January 2000 and December 2003. Additional information wasobtained through consultation and by searching the websites of Health Canada, theUnited Network of Organ Sharing, Organ Donation Ontario, and LVAD manufacturers.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS: Previous HTAs and current Level 3 evidence from prospective non-randomized controlled studies showed that whencompared to optimal medical therapy, LVAD support significantly improved thepre-transplant survival rates of heart transplant candidates waiting for asuitable donor heart (71\\\% for LVAD and 36\\\% for medical therapy). Pre-transplantsurvival rates reported ranged from 58\\\% to 90\\\% (median 74\\\%). Improved transplant rates were also reported for people who received pre-transplant LVAD support(e.g. 67\\\% for LVAD vs 33\\\% for medical therapy). Reported transplant rates forLVAD patients ranged from 39\\\% to 90\\\% (median 71\\\%). Patient\\s age greater than 60 years and pre-existing conditions of respiratory failure associated withsepticemia, ventilation, and right heart failure were independent risk factorsfor mortality after the LVAD implantation. LVAD support was shown to improve the New York Heart Association [NYHA)] functional classification and quality of life of patients waiting for heart transplant. LVAD also enabled approximately 41\\\% -49\\\% of patients to be discharged from hospitals and wait for a heart transplantat home. However, over 50\\\% of the discharged patients required re-hospitalizationdue to adverse events. Post-transplant survival rates for LVAD-bridged patientswere similar to or better than the survival rates of patients bridged by medical therapy. LVAD support has been associated with serious adverse events, including infection (median 53\\\%, range 6\\\%-72\\\%), bleeding (8.6\\\%-48\\\%, median 35\\\%),thromboembolism (5\\\%-37\\\%), neurologic disorders (7\\\%-28\\\%), right ventricularfailure (11\\\%-26\\\%), organ dysfunction (5\\\%-50\\\%) and hemolysis (6\\\%-20\\\%). Bleedingtends to occur in the first few post-implant days and is rare thereafter. It isfatal in 2\\\%-7\\\% of patients. Infection and thromboembolism occurred throughout theduration of the implant, though their frequency tended to diminish with time.Device malfunction has been identified as one of the major complications.Fatalities directly attributable to the devices were about 1\\\% in short-term LVAD use. However, mechanical failure was the second most frequent cause of death inpatients on prolonged LVAD support. Malfunctions were mainly associated with the external components, and often could be replaced by backed up components. LVADhas been used as a bridge-to-recovery in patients suffering from acutecardiogenic shock due to cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiotomy. The survival rates were reported to be lower than in bridge-to-transplant (median 26\\\%). Someof the bridge-to-recovery patients (14\\\%-75\\\%) required a heart transplant orremained on prolonged LVAD support. According to an expert in the field,experience with LVAD as a bridge-to-recovery technology has been more favourable in Germany than in North America, where it is not regarded as a major indication since evidence for its effectiveness in this setting is limited. LVAD has alsobeen explored as a destination therapy. A small, randomized, controlled trial(level 2 evidence) showed that LVAD significantly increased the 1-year survivalrate of patients with end-stage heart failure but were not eligible for a hearttransplant (51\\\% LVAD vs 25\\\% for medical therapy). However, improved survival was associated with adverse events 2.35 times higher than medically treated patients and a higher hospital re-admission rate. The 2-year survival rate on LVADdecreased to 23\\\%, although it was still significantly better compared to patientson medical therapy (8\\\%). The leading causes of deaths were sepsis (41\\\%) anddevice failure (17\\\%). The FDA has given conditional approval for the permanentuse of HeartMate SNAP VE LVAS in patients with end-stage heart failure who arenot eligible for heart transplantation, although the long-term effect of thisapplication is not known. In Canada, four LVAD systems have been licensed forbridge-to-transplant only. The use of LVAD support raises ethical issues because of the implications of potential explantation that could be perceived as awithdrawal of life support. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE TRANSPLANT WAITING LIST: Withthe shortage of donor hearts for adults, LVAD support probably would not increasethe number of patients who receive a heart transplant. If LVAD supportedcandidates are prioritized for urgent heart transplant, there will be a knock on effect as other transplant candidates without LVAD support would be pushed down, resulting in longer wait, deterioration in health status and die before asuitable donor heart becomes available. Under the current policy for allocatingdonor hearts in Ontario, patients on LVAD support would be downgraded to Status 3with a lower priority to receive a transplant. This would likely result in anexpansion of the transplant waiting list with an increasing number of patients onprolonged LVAD support, which is not consistent with the indication of LVAD useapproved by Health Canada. There is indication in the United Kingdom that LVADsupport in conjunction with an urgent transplant listing in the pediatricpopulation may decrease the number of deaths on the waiting list without aharmful knock-on effect on other transplant candidates.CONCLUSION: LVAD support as a bridge-to-transplant has been shown to improve the survival rate, functional status and quality of life of patients on the hearttransplant waiting list. However, due to the shortage of donor hearts and thecurrent heart transplant algorithm, LVAD support for transplant candidates of allage groups would likely result in an expansion of the waiting list and prolonged use of LVAD with significant budget implications but without increasing thenumber of heart transplants.

The introduction of LVAD in the pediatric population would be more cost-effective andmight not have a negative effect on the transplant waiting list.PMCID: PMC3387736: 14721801  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1572. ont health technol assess ser. 2004;4(3):1-69. epub 2004 mar 1.left ventricular assist devices: an evidence-based analysis.health quality ontario.objective: the objective of this health technology policy assessment was todetermine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using implantableventricular assist devices in the treatment of end-stage heart failure.heart failure: heart failure is a complex syndrome that impairs the ability ofthe heart to maintain adequate blood circulation, resulting in multiorganabnormalities and, eventually, death. in the period of 1994 to 1997, 38,702individuals in ontario had a first hospital admission for heart failure. despite reported improvement in survival, the five-year mortality rate for heart failure is about 50\\\%. for patients with end-stage heart failure that does not respond to medical therapy, surgical treatment or traditional circulatory assist devices,heart transplantation (in appropriate patients) is the only treatment thatprovides significant patient benefit. heart transplant in ontario: with ashortage in the supply of donor hearts, patients are waiting longer for a hearttransplant and may die before a donor heart is available. from 1999 to 2003, 55to 74 people received a heart transplant in ontario each year. another 12 to 21people died while waiting for a suitable donor heart. of these, 1 to 5 deathsoccurred in people under 18 years old. the rate-limiting factor in hearttransplant is the supply of donor hearts. without an increase in available donor hearts, attempts at prolonging the life of some patients on the transplant waitlist could have a harmful effect on other patients that are being pushed down thewaiting list (knock on effect). lvad technology: ventricular assist devices[vads] have been developed to provide circulatory assistance to patients withend-stage heart failure. these are small pumps that usually assist the damagedleft ventricle [lvads] and may be situated within the body (intracorporeal] oroutside the body [extracorporeal). some of these devices were designed for use inthe right ventricle [rvad] or both ventricles (bi-ventricular). lvads have beenmainly used as a \\\"bridge-to-transplant\\\" for patients on a transplant waitinglist. as well, they have been used as a \\\"bridge-to-recovery\\\" in acute heartfailure, but this experience is limited. there has been an increasing interest inusing lvad as a permanent (destination) therapy. review of lvad by the medicaladvisory secretariat: the medical advisory secretariat\\s review included adescriptive synthesis of findings from five systematic reviews and 60 reportspublished between january 2000 and december 2003. additional information wasobtained through consultation and by searching the websites of health canada, theunited network of organ sharing, organ donation ontario, and lvad manufacturers.summary of findings: safety and effectiveness: previous htas and current level 3 evidence from prospective non-randomized controlled studies showed that whencompared to optimal medical therapy, lvad support significantly improved thepre-transplant survival rates of heart transplant candidates waiting for asuitable donor heart (71\\\% for lvad and 36\\\% for medical therapy). pre-transplantsurvival rates reported ranged from 58\\\% to 90\\\% (median 74\\\%). improved transplant rates were also reported for people who received pre-transplant lvad support(e.g. 67\\\% for lvad vs 33\\\% for medical therapy). reported transplant rates forlvad patients ranged from 39\\\% to 90\\\% (median 71\\\%). patient\\s age greater than 60 years and pre-existing conditions of respiratory failure associated withsepticemia, ventilation, and right heart failure were independent risk factorsfor mortality after the lvad implantation. lvad support was shown to improve the new york heart association [nyha)] functional classification and quality of life of patients waiting for heart transplant. lvad also enabled approximately 41\\\% -49\\\% of patients to be discharged from hospitals and wait for a heart transplantat home. however, over 50\\\% of the discharged patients required re-hospitalizationdue to adverse events. post-transplant survival rates for lvad-bridged patientswere similar to or better than the survival rates of patients bridged by medical therapy. lvad support has been associated with serious adverse events, including infection (median 53\\\%, range 6\\\%-72\\\%), bleeding (8.6\\\%-48\\\%, median 35\\\%),thromboembolism (5\\\%-37\\\%), neurologic disorders (7\\\%-28\\\%), right ventricularfailure (11\\\%-26\\\%), organ dysfunction (5\\\%-50\\\%) and hemolysis (6\\\%-20\\\%). bleedingtends to occur in the first few post-implant days and is rare thereafter. it isfatal in 2\\\%-7\\\% of patients. infection and thromboembolism occurred throughout theduration of the implant, though their frequency tended to diminish with time.device malfunction has been identified as one of the major complications.fatalities directly attributable to the devices were about 1\\\% in short-term lvad use. however, mechanical failure was the second most frequent cause of death inpatients on prolonged lvad support. malfunctions were mainly associated with the external components, and often could be replaced by backed up components. lvadhas been used as a bridge-to-recovery in patients suffering from acutecardiogenic shock due to cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiotomy. the survival rates were reported to be lower than in bridge-to-transplant (median 26\\\%). someof the bridge-to-recovery patients (14\\\%-75\\\%) required a heart transplant orremained on prolonged lvad support. according to an expert in the field,experience with lvad as a bridge-to-recovery technology has been more favourable in germany than in north america, where it is not regarded as a major indication since evidence for its effectiveness in this setting is limited. lvad has alsobeen explored as a destination therapy. a small, randomized, controlled trial(level 2 evidence) showed that lvad significantly increased the 1-year survivalrate of patients with end-stage heart failure but were not eligible for a hearttransplant (51\\\% lvad vs 25\\\% for medical therapy). however, improved survival was associated with adverse events 2.35 times higher than medically treated patients and a higher hospital re-admission rate. the 2-year survival rate on lvaddecreased to 23\\\%, although it was still significantly better compared to patientson medical therapy (8\\\%). the leading causes of deaths were sepsis (41\\\%) anddevice failure (17\\\%). the fda has given conditional approval for the permanentuse of heartmate snap ve lvas in patients with end-stage heart failure who arenot eligible for heart transplantation, although the long-term effect of thisapplication is not known. in canada, four lvad systems have been licensed forbridge-to-transplant only. the use of lvad support raises ethical issues because of the implications of potential explantation that could be perceived as awithdrawal of life support. potential impact on the transplant waiting list: withthe shortage of donor hearts for adults, lvad support probably would not increasethe number of patients who receive a heart transplant. if lvad supportedcandidates are prioritized for urgent heart transplant, there will be a knock on effect as other transplant candidates without lvad support would be pushed down, resulting in longer wait, deterioration in health status and die before asuitable donor heart becomes available. under the current policy for allocatingdonor hearts in ontario, patients on lvad support would be downgraded to status 3with a lower priority to receive a transplant. this would likely result in anexpansion of the transplant waiting list with an increasing number of patients onprolonged lvad support, which is not consistent with the indication of lvad useapproved by health canada. there is indication in the united kingdom that lvadsupport in conjunction with an urgent transplant listing in the pediatricpopulation may decrease the number of deaths on the waiting list without aharmful knock-on effect on other transplant candidates.conclusion: lvad support as a bridge-to-transplant has been shown to improve the survival rate, functional status and quality of life of patients on the hearttransplant waiting list. however, due to the shortage of donor hearts and thecurrent heart transplant algorithm, lvad support for transplant candidates of allage groups would likely result in an expansion of the waiting list and prolonged use of lvad with significant budget implications but without increasing thenumber of heart transplants. limited level 4 evidence showed that lvad support inchildren yielded survival rates comparable to those in the adult population. the introduction of lvad in the pediatric population would be more cost-effective andmight not have a negative effect on the transplant waiting list.pmcid: pmc3387736',heartSurgery

De Gasperis, Niguarda Hospital, Milan,Italy. evitali@ospedaleniguarda.itBACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of death in Westerncountries. Heart transplantation currently is the only accepted therapy forpatients with end-stage heart failure, but the supply of donor hearts isinadequate, and different mechanical circulatory support systems have beeninvestigated as bridges to heart transplant.METHODS: Since April 1992, 53 patients (47 men, 6 women, aged 12 to 61 years)received left ventricle mechanical circulatory support as bridge to hearttransplant. The two principal devices used were: the Novacor LVAS in 31 patients and the DeBakey VAD in 11 patients.RESULTS: All patients survived the operation. Mean duration of LVAD support was2.8 +/- 5.6 months. Thirty-seven patients (71.1\\\%) underwent hearttransplantation. Twelve major bleeding episodes occurred in nine patients(16.9\\\%). Globally, major and minor neurologic events occurred in 13 patients(24.5\\\%). Ten patients (19.9\\\%) assisted with the Novacor Wearable LVAS device weredischarged at home while waiting for heart transplant (HTx). The mean follow-upof the 34 discharged transplanted patients was 45.3 +/- 37 months. Actuarialsurvival of transplanted patients while on LVAD was 91.0 +/- 4.9\\\% and 83.4 +/-8.5\\\% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. No differences in post-transplant long-term survival and rejection and allograft vasculopathy occurred between patientstransplanted with or without LVAD implanted.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD therapy proved to be effective in bridging patients withend-stage heart failure to HTx. While on LVAD support, patients assisted withimplantable wearable devices could be discharged at home, ameliorating theirquality of life.

Conventional implantable systems have inherentlimitations that increase morbidity during support. In contrast, small,efficient, axial-flow pumps, which have been under development for the pastdecade, have the potential to improve the length and quality of life in patients with severe heart failure. Methods and Results- To assess the safety and clinicalutility of the Jarvik 2000, we implanted this device in 10 transplant candidates (mean age 51.3 years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV. Implantationwas achieved through a left thoracotomy during partial cardiopulmonary bypass.The mean support period was 84 days. Within 48 hours postoperatively, the cardiacindex increased 43\\\%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased 52\\\%, systemicvascular resistance decreased significantly, and inotropic support becameunnecessary. Eight patients underwent physical rehabilitation and returned toNYHA class I. Their left ventricular dimensions, cardiothoracic ratios, andpressure-volume loop analyses showed good left ventricular unloading. Sevenpatients underwent transplantation and 3 died during support. No devicethrombosis was observed at explantation.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 functions as a true assist device by partiallyunloading the left ventricle, thereby optimizing the patient\\s hemodynamics.

Orsola-MalpighiHospital, Bologna University, Bologna, Italy.Two centrifugal pumps, the RotaFlow (Maquet, Jostra Medizintechnik AG,Hirrlingen, Germany) and Levitronix CentriMag (Levitronix LCC, Waltham, MA, USA),used in central or peripheral veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) support systems have been investigated, in terms of double-centerexperience, as treatment for patients with refractory cardiogenic shock (CS).Between January 2006 and December 2012, 228 consecutive adult patients weresupported on RotaFlow (n=213) or CentriMag (n=15) ECMO, at our institutions (155 men; age 58.3Â±10.5 years, range: 19-84 years). Indications for support were:failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy(n=118) and primary donor graft failure (n=37); postacute myocardial infarctionCS (n=27); acute myocarditis (n=6); and CS on chronic heart failure (n=40). Aperipheral ECMO setting was established in 126 (55.2\\\%) patients while it wasestablished centrally in 102 (44.7\\\%). Overall mean support time was 10.9Â±9.7 days(range: 1-43 days). Eighty-four (36.8\\\%) patients died on ECMO. Overall successrate, in terms of survival on ECMO (n=144), weaning from mechanical support(n=107; 46.9\\\%), bridge to mid-long-term ventricular assist device (n=6; 2.6\\\%),and bridge to heart transplantation (n=31; 13.5\\\%), was 63.1\\\%. One hundredtwenty-two (53.5\\\%) patients were successfully discharged. Stepwise logisticregression identified blood lactate level and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase(CK-MB) relative index at 72âh after ECMO initiation, and number of packed redblood cells (PRBCs) transfused on ECMO as significant predictors of mortality on ECMO (P=0.010, odds ratio [OR]=2.94; 95\\\% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-3.14;P=0.010, OR=2.82, 95\\\% CI=1.014-3.721; and P=0.011, OR=2.69; 95\\\% CI=1.06-4.16,respectively). Central ECMO population had significantly higher rate ofcontinuous veno-venous hemofiltration need and bleeding requiring surgery events compared with the peripheral ECMO setting population. No significant differences were seen by comparing the RotaFlow and CentriMag populations in terms of device performance. At follow-up, persistent heart failure with left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF)â¤40\\\% was a risk factor after hospital discharge.

Isolated observations suggest that chronic ventricular unloadingmay lead to normalization of pulmonary pressures and thus render a patient likelyto be a heart transplant candidate.METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of 9 heart failure patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (transpulmonary gradient [TPG] > 15 mm/Hg). Two were treated with a pulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 7 with anaxial-flow LVAD.RESULTS: After LVAD support, mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 39 +/-7 to 31 +/- 5 mm Hg, and the TPG decreased from 19 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg (p <0.01). The 1-year Kaplan-Meier survival curve for patients with pre-LVAD TPG > 15mm Hg vs those with TPG < 15 mm Hg showed no difference in survival (p = 0.6).This finding was supported by analysis of a large multi-institutional cohortobtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database, whereno differences in survival were found in the same groups.CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to congestive heartfailure, as defined by a TPG > 15 mm Hg can be reversed by the use of pulsatileand axial-flow LVADs; furthermore, post-transplant survival for patients withsecondary pulmonary hypertension treated with an LVAD was no different than forthose without pulmonary hypertension who received LVAD support.: 19783184  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1043. j heart lung transplant. 2010 feb;29(2):195-200. doi:10.1016/j.healun.2009.05.030. epub 2009 sep 26.reversal of secondary pulmonary hypertension by axial and pulsatile mechanicalcirculatory support.torre-amione g(1), southard re, loebe mm, youker ka, bruckner b, estep jd,tierney m, noon gp.author information: (1)the department of cardiology, the methodist debakey heart & vascular center,the methodist hospital, houston, texas, usa. gtorres@tmhs.org <gtorres@tmhs.org>background: pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic congestive heartfailure posses a significant risk of morbidity and death after hearttransplantation. isolated observations suggest that chronic ventricular unloadingmay lead to normalization of pulmonary pressures and thus render a patient likelyto be a heart transplant candidate.methods: this study is a retrospective analysis of 9 heart failure patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (transpulmonary gradient [tpg] > 15 mm/hg). two were treated with a pulsatile left ventricular assist device (lvad) and 7 with anaxial-flow lvad.results: after lvad support, mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 39 +/-7 to 31 +/- 5 mm hg, and the tpg decreased from 19 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 4 mm hg (p <0.01). the 1-year kaplan-meier survival curve for patients with pre-lvad tpg > 15mm hg vs those with tpg < 15 mm hg showed no difference in survival (p = 0.6).this finding was supported by analysis of a large multi-institutional cohortobtained from the organ procurement and transplantation network database, whereno differences in survival were found in the same groups.conclusions: pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to congestive heartfailure, as defined by a tpg > 15 mm hg can be reversed by the use of pulsatileand axial-flow lvads; furthermore, post-transplant survival for patients withsecondary pulmonary hypertension treated with an lvad was no different than forthose without pulmonary hypertension who received lvad support.',heartSurgery

However, with dramatic improvements in organ preservation, surgery andimmunosuppressive drug management, short term survival is no longer the pivotalissue for most heart transplant recipients (HTR). Rather, a return to functional lifestyle with good quality of life is now the desired procedural outcome. Toachieve this outcome, aggressive exercise rehabilitation is essential. HTRpresent unique exercise challenges. Preoperatively, most of these patients hadchronic debilitating cardiac illness. Many HTR have had prolongedpretransplantation hospitalisation for inotropic support or a ventricular assist device. Decrements in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and relatedcardiovascular parameters regress approximately 26\\\% within the first 1 to 3 weeksof sustained bed rest. Consequently, extremely poor aerobic capacity and cardiac cachexia are not unusual occurrences in HTR who have required mechanical support or been confined to bed rest. Moreover, HTR must also contend with de novoexercise challenges conferred by chronic cardiac denervation and the multiplesequelae resulting from immunosuppression therapy. There is ample evidence thatboth endurance and resistance training are well tolerated in HTR. Moreover, thereis growing clinical consensus that specific endurance and resistance trainingregimens in HTR can be efficacious adjunctive therapies in the prevention ofimmunosuppression-induced adverse effects and the reversal of pathophysiological consequences associated with cardiac denervation and antecedent heart failure.For example, some HTR who remain compliant during strenuous long term endurancetraining programmes achieve peak heart rate and VO2peak values late aftertransplantation that approach age-matched norms (up to approximately 95\\\% ofpredicted). These benefits are not seen in HTR who do not participate instructured endurance exercise training. Rather, peak heart rate and VO2peakvalues in untrained HTR remain approximately 60 to 70\\\% of predicted indefinitely.However, the mechanisms responsible for improved peak heart rate, VO2peak andtotal exercise time are not completely understood and require furtherinvestigation. Recent studies have also demonstrated that resistance exercisetraining may be an effective countermeasure for corticosteroid-inducedosteoporosis and skeletal muscle myopathy. HTR who participate in specificresistance training programmes successfully restore bone mineral density (BMD) inboth the axial and appendicular skeleton to pretransplantation levels, increaselean mass to levels greater than pretransplantation, and reduce body fat. Incontrast, HTR who do not participate in resistance training lose approximately15\\\% BMD from the lumbar spine early in the postoperative period and experiencefurther gradual reductions in BMD and muscle mass late after transplantation.: 11008069  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1796. sports med. 2000 sep;30(3):171-92.exercise following heart transplantation.braith rw(1), edwards dg.author information: (1)college of health and human performance, and college of medicine (division of cardiology), university of florida, gainesville 32611, usa. rbraith@hhp.ufl.eduduring the past 2 decades, heart transplantation has evolved from an experimentalprocedure to an accepted life-extending therapy for patients with endstage heart failure. however, with dramatic improvements in organ preservation, surgery andimmunosuppressive drug management, short term survival is no longer the pivotalissue for most heart transplant recipients (htr). rather, a return to functional lifestyle with good quality of life is now the desired procedural outcome. toachieve this outcome, aggressive exercise rehabilitation is essential. htrpresent unique exercise challenges. preoperatively, most of these patients hadchronic debilitating cardiac illness. many htr have had prolongedpretransplantation hospitalisation for inotropic support or a ventricular assist device. decrements in peak oxygen consumption (vo2peak) and relatedcardiovascular parameters regress approximately 26\\\% within the first 1 to 3 weeksof sustained bed rest. consequently, extremely poor aerobic capacity and cardiac cachexia are not unusual occurrences in htr who have required mechanical support or been confined to bed rest. moreover, htr must also contend with de novoexercise challenges conferred by chronic cardiac denervation and the multiplesequelae resulting from immunosuppression therapy. there is ample evidence thatboth endurance and resistance training are well tolerated in htr. moreover, thereis growing clinical consensus that specific endurance and resistance trainingregimens in htr can be efficacious adjunctive therapies in the prevention ofimmunosuppression-induced adverse effects and the reversal of pathophysiological consequences associated with cardiac denervation and antecedent heart failure.for example, some htr who remain compliant during strenuous long term endurancetraining programmes achieve peak heart rate and vo2peak values late aftertransplantation that approach age-matched norms (up to approximately 95\\\% ofpredicted). these benefits are not seen in htr who do not participate instructured endurance exercise training. rather, peak heart rate and vo2peakvalues in untrained htr remain approximately 60 to 70\\\% of predicted indefinitely.however, the mechanisms responsible for improved peak heart rate, vo2peak andtotal exercise time are not completely understood and require furtherinvestigation. recent studies have also demonstrated that resistance exercisetraining may be an effective countermeasure for corticosteroid-inducedosteoporosis and skeletal muscle myopathy. htr who participate in specificresistance training programmes successfully restore bone mineral density (bmd) inboth the axial and appendicular skeleton to pretransplantation levels, increaselean mass to levels greater than pretransplantation, and reduce body fat. incontrast, htr who do not participate in resistance training lose approximately15\\\% bmd from the lumbar spine early in the postoperative period and experiencefurther gradual reductions in bmd and muscle mass late after transplantation.',heartSurgery

All patients on the Eurotransplanthigh-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to berelisted every 8Â weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated withtachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospectiveanalysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated withintermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy.METHODS AND RESULTS: 117 consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at ourintensive care heart failure unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients(12Â \\\%) were stabilized and delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103patients (age 42Â Â±Â 15Â years), different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone,adrenaline, noradrenaline, levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\\sspecific characteristics. After initial recompensation, patients were weaned frominotropes as soon as possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4Â days)were given as a predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57Â \\\% of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropicsupport was necessary due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14Â \\\%) needed a left- or biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14Â \\\%) died whilewaiting and 87 (84Â \\\%) received heart transplants after 87Â Â±Â 91Â days.

Long-term implantable cardiac assist devices for smaller adolescentpatients are not yet available in the United States.METHODS: This study reviews the experience with patients less than 21 years oldthat received HeartMate LVADs (TCI) at our institution. Twelve patients wereimplanted with 13 LVADs. The patients ranged in age from 11 to 20 years (mean 16 years). Body surface area ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 m2 (mean 1.8 m2). Patients were selected for LVAD placement based on eligibility for heart transplant andevidence of end-organ dysfunction. Device placement in small patients wasfacilitated with prosthetic graft abdominal wall closure. No patient receivedsystemic anticoagulation.RESULTS: The duration of LVAD support ranged from 0 to 397 days (mean 123 days). Seven of the 8 patients eligible for discharge from the hospital with avented-electric LVAD were supported at home while awaiting transplantation.Outcomes of LVAD support were: LVAD explantation in 2 cases (15\\\%), expirationwith LVAD in place in 3 cases (23\\\%), and successful transplantation in 8 cases(62\\\%). Complications included 4 patients with systemic infection, 3 re-operationsfor hemorrhage, 1 embolic event, and 1 intraoperative air embolus that provedfatal. One explanted patient required a subsequent LVAD and the other expired 4months after explantation. Six of the 8 transplanted patients are alive and well with follow-up ranging from 8 to 43 months.CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent patients with heart failure can be successfully supportedon a long-term basis to heart transplantation with the HeartMate LVAD.

De Gasperis Center, NiguardaHospital, Milan, Italy.BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure refractory to optimal oral pharmacologic therapy have a dismal short term prognosis. Heart transplantation is the onlytherapy shown to improve survival in these patients. Unfortunately, due to thecritical shortage of donor organs, approximately 30\\\% of listed patients withend-stage heart failure die before a suitable donor heart becomes available. The principal aim of this study was to determine whether intravenous pharmacologiccirculatory support favorably influences the clinical course of heart transplant candidates or whether mechanical circulatory support should be instituted in thishigh risk patient population.METHODS: Data from 154 consecutive hospitalizations in 125 patients 49+/-12 yearswere retrospectively reviewed. The product limit method was used to estimatesurvival. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the clinicaland hemodynamic variables that independently predict outcome after each admissionin which heart transplantation did not occur.RESULTS: One year survival for the study population was 65\\\%. This survival issignificantly lower than the 91\\\% 1 year survival in similarly ill patientsundergoing heart transplantation. The Cox proportional hazard method identifiedserum bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum sodium levels and right atrial pressure as independent prognostic indices.

Initial experience with theimplantable LVAD used as a bridge to heart transplantation provides a clinicalopportunity to study the function of the device and adaptation by the patient.METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen heart transplant candidates (mean age, 50 years; 17males) underwent insertion of the HeartMate LVAD as a bridge to hearttransplantation from December 1991 to November 1993. All patients were incardiogenic shock on inotropes, and 16 (84\\\%) were on an intra-aortic balloonpump. Three patients died because of multiple organ failure; all had rightventricular (RV) dysfunction (2 required RV assist devices). Sixteen patients(84\\\%) improved markedly and were rehabilitated to New York Heart Associationfunctional class I-II. Three patients are still on support. Significantimprovements in hemodynamic function (based on analysis of the percent changefrom pre-LVAD condition to pretransplantation) were observed: cardiac index rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.9 L/min per m2 (P = .0002), left atrial pressurefell from 22.9 +/- 9.5 to 8.0 +/- 5.5 mm Hg (P = .003), RV ejection fractionincreased from 19.8 +/- 11.3\\\% to 40.8 +/- 8.9\\\% (P = .0004), pulmonary vascularresistance decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 Wood units (P = .004).Thirteen patients had successful transplants after a mean duration of 66 days on the LVAD (range, 22 to 101 days). There were no thromboembolic events while thepatients were on the LVAD. Only aspirin with dipyridamole was given foranticoagulation during a total of > 1100 patient days of support.CONCLUSIONS: Bridge to transplant implantable LVAD experience indicates thathemodynamic improvement should be significant after insertion of the devices and that the risk of thromboembolic events with the HeartMate LVAD should beextremely low.

However, due to the limitedavailability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patientswith refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with theHeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as abridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was aretrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVADimplantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-hearttransplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 yearsold (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heartdisease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], andchemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwentHMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery(21.7\\\%), mediastinal infection (21.7\\\%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinalcollection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1\\\%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0\\\%), and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3\\\%). All patients were dischargedfrom hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced drivelineinfections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to thefollowing conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0\\\%), gastrointestinalbleeding (13.0\\\%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0\\\%), transient ischemic attack(8.7\\\%), arrhythmia (8.7\\\%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aorticregurgitation (8.7\\\%), right ventricular failure (4.3\\\%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3\\\%),and hematuria (4.3\\\%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally NewYork Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient wassuccessfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were twomortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to beeffective in our Asian population.

Am J Transplant. 2014 Jan;14 Suppl 1:113-38. doi: 10.1111/ajt.12583.OPTN/SRTR 2012 Annual Data Report: heart.Colvin-Adams M(1), Smithy JM, Heubner BM, Skeans MA, Edwards LB, Waller C,Schnitzler MA, Snyder JJ, Israni AK, Kasiske BL.Author information: (1)Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Minneapolis Medical ResearchFoundation, Minneapolis, MN; Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology,University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.The number of heart transplants performed annually continues to increasegradually, and the number of adult candidates on the waiting list increased by25\\\% from 2004 to 2012. The heart transplant rate among active adult candidatespeaked at 149 per 100 wait-list years in 2007 and has been declining since; in2012, the rate was 93 heart transplants per 100 active wait-list years. Increasedwaiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase inwait-list mortality. Since 2007, the proportion of patients on life supportbefore transplant increased from 48.6\\\% to 62.7\\\% in 2012. Medical urgencycategories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgencycategories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list each year; the number of transplants performed each year increased from 274 in1998 to 372 in 2012. Graft survival in pediatric recipients continues to improve;5-year graft survival for transplants performed in 2007 was 78.5\\\%. Medicare paid for some or all of the care for nearly 40\\\% of heart transplant recipients in2010. Heart transplant appears to be more expensive than ventricular assistdevices for managing end-stage heart failure, but is more effective and likelymore cost-effective.Â© Copyright 2013 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Societyof Transplant Surgeons.: 24384782  [pubmed - indexed for medline]291. am j transplant. 2014 jan;14 suppl 1:113-38. doi: 10.1111/ajt.12583.optn/srtr 2012 annual data report: heart.colvin-adams m(1), smithy jm, heubner bm, skeans ma, edwards lb, waller c,schnitzler ma, snyder jj, israni ak, kasiske bl.author information: (1)scientific registry of transplant recipients, minneapolis medical researchfoundation, minneapolis, mn; department of medicine, division of cardiology,university of minnesota, minneapolis, mn.the number of heart transplants performed annually continues to increasegradually, and the number of adult candidates on the waiting list increased by25\\\% from 2004 to 2012. the heart transplant rate among active adult candidatespeaked at 149 per 100 wait-list years in 2007 and has been declining since; in2012, the rate was 93 heart transplants per 100 active wait-list years. increasedwaiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase inwait-list mortality. since 2007, the proportion of patients on life supportbefore transplant increased from 48.6\\\% to 62.7\\\% in 2012. medical urgencycategories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgencycategories. approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list each year; the number of transplants performed each year increased from 274 in1998 to 372 in 2012. graft survival in pediatric recipients continues to improve;5-year graft survival for transplants performed in 2007 was 78.5\\\%. medicare paid for some or all of the care for nearly 40\\\% of heart transplant recipients in2010. heart transplant appears to be more expensive than ventricular assistdevices for managing end-stage heart failure, but is more effective and likelymore cost-effective.â© copyright 2013 the american society of transplantation and the american societyof transplant surgeons.',heartSurgery
