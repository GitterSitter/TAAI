However, many of these patients can be titrated on beta-blockers, but there is      little evidence of successful clinical strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We      analysed the records of inotropy-dependent patients referred for assessment for      heart transplantation. Thirty-six patients (45%) could not be weaned (NW) and      underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation or transplantation,       or died. However, 44 (55%) were successfully weaned (SW). Neither the aetiology      (ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic) nor cardiac indexes were different in the SW as      compared with the NW group (2.27+/-0.5 vs. 2.15+/-0.6 L/min/m2). The NW patients       had lower LVEF (15+/-5% vs. 19+/-5%, P=0.001), higher right atrial pressure      (12+/-6 vs. 8+/-6 mmHg, P=0.02), and more severe mitral regurgitation (P<0.001)      than the SW patients. At discharge, 35 of 44 SW patients were receiving      beta-blockers. In 29 of them, a beta-blocker could only be initiated or continued      during concomitant support with i.v. enoximone for a duration of 14.1+/-7.2 days.      Patients discharged on a beta-blocker had an LVAD/transplantation-free cumulative      survival of 71% during a follow-up of 2074+/-201 days (confidence interval      1679-2470). CONCLUSION: It takes time to put severely ill HF patients on      beta-blockers and it may require bridging with inotropes which are independent of      beta-adrenergic receptors. Whether such a strategy may result in a better      clinical outcome warrants further research.CI  - (c) 2013 The Authors.
