Recommendations based on a systematic review.PG  - 1712-20LID - 10.1016/j.cjca.2013.05.014 [doi]LID - S0828-282X(13)00361-9 [pii]AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used in chronic end-stage heart      failure as "bridge to transplantation" (BTT) and, more recently, for      transplant-ineligible patients as "destination therapy" (DT). We reviewed the      evidence on clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of 2 types of continuous-flow      LVADs (HeartMate II [HM II] and HeartWare), for BTT and DT patients. We      systematically searched the scientific literature (January 2008-June 2012) and      identified 14 clinical studies (approximately 2900 HM II and approximately 200      HeartWare patients), and 3 economic evaluations (HM II) using simulation models.       Data were, however, limited to 2-3 studies per outcome. We made policy      recommendations on the basis of our systematic review. Although complications      after implantation are frequent, LVAD therapy is often highly effective across      transplantation eligibility status and device, with 1-year survival reaching 86%       for BTT and 78% for DT (compared with 25% for medical therapy). Neither BTT nor      DT currently meet traditional cost-effectiveness limits in models using      historical data, although BTT is standard practice for a limited number of      patients in many regions. We found that BTT and DT as implantation strategies      tend to be no longer mutually exclusive. We conclude that evidence is sufficient       to support LVAD use, regardless of transplantation eligibility status, as long as      patients are carefully selected and program infrastructure and budget are      adequate. However, evidence gaps, limitations in economic models, and the lack of      Canadian data point to the importance of mandatory, systematic monitoring of LVAD      use and outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
