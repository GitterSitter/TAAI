The impact of CHF medication optimization following CRT,      however, has never been comprehensively evaluated. In the current study, we      therefore investigated the effect of CHF medication dosage on morbidity and      mortality in CHF patients after CRT implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chronic      heart failure medication was assessed in 185 patients after CRT implantation.      During an overall mean follow-up of 44.6 months, 83 patients experienced a      primary endpoint (death, heart transplantation, assist device implantation, or      hospitalization for CHF). Treatment with higher dosages of angiotensin-converting      enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (P = 0.001) and       beta-blockers (P < 0.001) as well as with lower dosages of loop diuretics (P <      0.001) was associated with a reduced risk for the primary combined endpoint as      well as for all-cause mortality. Echocardiographic super-responders to CRT were      treated with higher average dosages of ACE-I/ARBs (68.1 vs. 52.4%, P < 0.01) and       beta-blockers (59 vs. 42.2%, P < 0.01). During follow-up, the average dosage of      loop diuretics was decreased by 20% in super-responders, but increased by 30% in       non-super-responders (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of higher dosages of      neurohormonal blockers and lower dosages of diuretics is associated with reduced       morbidity and mortality following CRT implantation. Our data imply a beneficial      effect of increasing neurohormonal blockade whenever possible following CRT      implantation.FAU - Schmidt, SusannAU  - Schmidt SAD  - Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Zurich, University Heart Center,      Ramistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.FAU - Hurlimann, DavidAU  - Hurlimann DFAU - Starck, Christoph TAU  - Starck CTFAU - Hindricks, GerhardAU  - Hindricks GFAU - Luscher, Thomas FAU  - Luscher TFFAU - Ruschitzka, FrankAU  - Ruschitzka FFAU - Steffel, JanAU  - Steffel JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20131225PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263RN  - 0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)RN  - 0 (Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists)RN  - 0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)RN  - 0 (Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors)SB  - IMMH  - Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/administration & dosageMH  - Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosageMH  - Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosageMH  - Cardiac Resynchronization TherapyMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/*administration & dosageMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Randomized Controlled Trials as TopicMH  - Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/administration & dosageMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cardiac resynchronization therapyOT  - Chronic heart failureOT  - Optimal medical therapyEDAT- 2013/12/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/28 06:00PHST- 2013/12/25 [aheadofprint]AID - eht514 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht514 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Heart J. 2014 Apr;35(16):1051-60. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/eht514.
