This       study investigated whether LVADs can be implanted in selected patients over the      age of 65 years with acceptable survival compared with published outcomes.      METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted in 64      consecutive patients >/=65 years of age implanted with a continuous-flow left      ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) as either bridge to transplantation or      destination therapy from August 2005 to January 2012. Baseline laboratory and      hemodynamic characteristics and follow-up data were obtained. Median survival was      1,090 days. Survival was 85%, 74%, 55%, and 45% at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3      years, respectively. Our cohort had a baseline mean Seattle Heart Failure Model      (SHFM) score of 2.6 +/- 0.9. Observed survival was significantly better than      SHFM-predicted medical survival. Stratification by age subsets, renal function,      SHFM, implantation intention, or etiology did not reveal significant differences       in survival. The most common cause of death was sepsis and nonlethalcomplication       was bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with patients over the age of 65      receiving CF-LVADs suggests that this group demonstrates excellent survival.      Further research is needed to discern the specific criteria for risk      stratification for LVAD support in the elderly.CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Rosenbaum, Andrew NAU  - Rosenbaum ANAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - John, RanjitAU  - John RAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of      Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Liao, Kenneth KAU  - Liao KKAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of      Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Adatya, SirtazAU  - Adatya SAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Colvin-Adams, Monica MAU  - Colvin-Adams MMAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Pritzker, MarcAU  - Pritzker MAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Eckman, Peter MAU  - Eckman PMAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.
