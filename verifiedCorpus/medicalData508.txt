It can be used for      long-term support of the left and/or right ventricule during end-stage heart      failure. The aim of this study was to share our clinical experience in 54      patients. METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, 54 patients with end-stage      heart failure underwent Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device      implantation, including 5 females and 9 children. Twenty-four patients (44%) were      in Intermacs level 1, 11 (21%) in level 2, and 19 (35%) in level 3. Biventricular      support was applied to 13 patients. Device implantation was performed with an "on      pump" beating heart technique while 6 other patients underwent intervention      operations while the aortic valve has under cross-clamp. Tricuspid annuloplasty      was performed in 6 patients. RESULTS: There was no peroperative death. Nine      patients (17%) underwent re-exploration because of hemorrhage in the early      postoperative period. Heart transplantation was performed in 32 patients (59%),      while 10 (19%) are still under pump support with a mean follow-up of 13 months.      Although 1 was successfully weaned from the system, 11 patients (20%) died during      the support. Pump-head exchange was required 19 times in 17 patients because of      visible thrombus or fibrin deposit in the pump head or due to membrane rupture.      DISCUSSION: The use of long-term paracorporeal assist devices has decreased in      recent years because of the increased popularity of implantable devices that      permit longer survival and a better quality of life. We believe that the Berlin      Heart EXCOR has a special role because it can be used in pediatric patients and      especially in critical conditions like Intermacs levels 1 and 2.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
