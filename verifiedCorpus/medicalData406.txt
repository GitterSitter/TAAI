CentriMag      (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) is an extracorporeal short-term circulatory      assist device Conformite Europeenne-marked in Europe for use up to 30 days.      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 41 patients with advanced heart failure who,      from 2003 to 2011, were supported with CentriMag for >30 days as a bridge to      recovery, long-term VAD or transplantation. RESULTS: Forty-one adult patients      were supported with 46 CentriMag devices for a total of 2695 days with a mean      support time of 59 (range: 31-167) days. Indications were post-cardiotomy      cardiogenic shock (PC = 4), primary graft failure (PGF = 7) and refractory heart       failure (RHF = 35). Six devices were used to support the left ventricle, 19 to      support the right ventricle and 21 to support both the ventricles (biventricular       support considered as single device unit). In the PC cohort, 3 (75%) patients      were weaned from support, while 4 (57%) were weaned from support in the PGF      cohort. In the RHF cohort, 8 patients were bridged to long-term VAD and 5 were      bridged to transplantation; heart function recovered and device explanted in 14,       while 8 patients died on support. There were no device failures. Overall, 34      (74%) patients were recovered or bridged, with a 1-year survival of 54%.      CONCLUSIONS: CentriMag proved to be a versatile, safe and effective short-term      circulatory support for patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge to      solution. Its use over 30 days is associated with acceptable survival and does      not increase device-related complications.FAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation & Mechanical Support, Royal Brompton      and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.FAU - Zych, BartlomiejAU  - Zych BFAU - Popov, Aron FAU  - Popov AFFAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AFAU - Saez, Diana GAU  - Saez DGFAU - Patil, Nikhil PAU  - Patil NPFAU - Amrani, MohamedAU  - Amrani MFAU - Bahrami, ToufanAU  - Bahrami TFAU - DeRobertis, FabioAU  - DeRobertis FFAU - Maunz, OlafAU  - Maunz OFAU - Marczin, NandorAU  - Marczin NFAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130829PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgery/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Postoperative Complications/etiologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesOTO - NOTNLMOT  - CentriMagOT  - End-stage heart failureOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/08/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/06 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/31 06:00PHST- 2013/08/29 [aheadofprint]AID - ezt415 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt415 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Nov;44(5):e310-5. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt415.
