In this study, we evaluated the impact of      etiology on outcomes. METHODS: Between January 2009 and March 2013, we implanted       a total of 249 patients with ECLS; we focused on 64 patients for whom peripheral       ECLS was the treatment for PCS. Of these, 37 cases (58%) were "acute" (mostly      acute myocardial infarction: 39%); 27 (42%) had an exacerbation of "chronic"      heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy: 30%; post-ischemic cardiomyopathy: 9%; and      congenital: 3%). RESULTS: In the group with chronic etiology, 23 patients were      bridged to a left ventricular assist device (52%) or heart transplantation (33%).      In the group with acute etiology, ECLS was used as a bridge-to-transplantation in      3 patients (8%), a bridge-to-bridge in 9 (24%), and a bridge-to-recovery in 18      (49%). One patient in each group was bridged to conventional surgery. Recovery of      cardiac function was achieved in only the group with acute primary cardiogenic      shock (18 vs 0 patients, P = .0001). A mean flow during support of </=60% of the       theoretic flow (body surface area x 2.4) was a predictor of successful weaning (P      = .02). Median duration of ECLS support was 7 days (range: 2-11.5 days). Nine      patients (14%) died during support; 30-day overall survival was 80% (51 of 64      patients); and 59% of patients were discharged, in whom survival at 48 months was      90%. Thirty-day survival was correlated with duration of ECLS support.      CONCLUSIONS: In "chronic" heart failure, ECLS represents a bridge to a      ventricular assist device or heart transplantation, whereas in "acute" settings,       it offers a considerable chance of recovery, and is often the only required      therapy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
