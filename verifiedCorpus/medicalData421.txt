Although temporary support could lead to successful RVAD      weaning in certain patients, the data remain scarce. METHODS: We retrospectively       reviewed 398 patients who underwent implantable LVAD insertion between January      2000 and December 2012. Of these patients, 44 (11%) required unplanned RVAD      support due to severe RV failure after LVAD insertion. For comparison, 37      patients who underwent planned biventricular assist device (BiVAD) insertion were      identified during the same study period. We analyzed the early and late outcomes       in these patients. RESULTS: The mean duration of RVAD support was 21 +/- 23 days.      Of the 44 patients, 21 (49%) were weaned from the RVAD (weaning group), whereas      23 (51%) required continued biventricular support (failure group). The failure      group had ongoing end-organ dysfunction after RVAD insertion. Hospital mortality       was significantly lower in the weaning group (24%) and in the planned BiVAD group      (30%) as compared to the failure group (74%, p = 0.0009). The 6-month actuarial      survival rate was 75% in the weaning group, 62% in the planned BiVAD group and      13% in the failure group (p < 0.0001). Successful bridge to transplant was      achieved in 14 patients (67%) in the weaning group as compared with 8 patients      (35%) in the failure group (p = 0.03). On multivariate logistic regression      analyses, pre-operative white blood cell (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence      interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.50, p = 0.016) and creatinine (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.079 to      0.88, p = 0.03) levels were significant predictors for RVAD removal. CONCLUSIONS:      Among patients who developed acute RV failure after LVAD insertion, only half      could be weaned from the temporary RVAD support. An alternative strategy is      necessary in patients who require continuous RVAD support.CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Takeda, KojiAU  - Takeda KAD  - Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Columbia University      Medical Center, New York, New York.FAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YAD  - Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Columbia University      Medical Center, New York, New York.FAU - Yang, Jonathan AAU  - Yang JAAD  - Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Columbia University      Medical Center, New York, New York.FAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, New York.FAU - Colombo, Paolo CAU  - Colombo PCAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, New York.FAU - Jorde, Ulrich PAU  - Jorde UPAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, New York.FAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HAD  - Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Columbia University      Medical Center, New York, New York.
