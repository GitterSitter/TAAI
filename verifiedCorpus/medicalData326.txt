We report on a 65-year-old male with end-stage      ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent implantation of Levitronix CentriMag      (Levitronix, Waltham, MA) for cardiac support and was listed for heart      transplantation. Acute pulmonary injury with profound hypoxaemia was noted 6 h      after the implantation. Despite optimal medical treatment and maximal ventilator       support, refractory hypoxaemia persisted, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation (oxygenator: Affinity-NT; centrifugal pump: BPX-80 Bio-Pump,      Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was applied for ventilation support. The patient      was weaned from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 4 days later and from the      ventilator on the next 2 days. He underwent a successful orthotopic heart      transplant after a total of 77 days on Levitronix left ventricular device cardiac      support.FAU - Chen, Jia-LinAU  - Chen JLAD  - Department of Anesthesia, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical       Center, Taipei, Taiwan.FAU - Sung, Shih-YingAU  - Sung SYFAU - Hsu, Po-ShunAU  - Hsu PSFAU - Tsai, Chien-SungAU  - Tsai CSFAU - Tsai, Yi-TingAU  - Tsai YTFAU - Lin, Chih-YuanAU  - Lin CYFAU - Ke, Hong-YanAU  - Ke HYFAU - Lin, Yi-ChangAU  - Lin YCLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140103PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Anoxia/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapyMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Lung Injury/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapyMH  - MaleEDAT- 2014/01/05 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/31 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/04 06:00PHST- 2013/08/22 [received]PHST- 2013/12/02 [accepted]PHST- 2014/01/03 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-013-0750-0 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2014 Jun;17(2):202-5. doi: 10.1007/s10047-013-0750-0.
