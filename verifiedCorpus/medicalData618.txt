Heart transplantation (HTx) can be postponed and for certain      patients even replaced by smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices      (LVAD). Mechanical support of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate      hemodynamic stabilisation and recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in       these severely ill patients. These new devices may be of great help to bridge      patients until a suitable cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed      as definitive treatment for patients who do not qualify for transplantation. Main      indications for LVAD implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to      transplantation or destination therapy. LVAD may be an important tool for      patients with an expected prolonged period on the waiting list, for instance      those with blood group 0 or B, with a body weight over 90 kg and those with      potentially reversible secondary organ failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.      However, LVAD implantation means an additional heart operation with inherent      peri-operative risks and complications during the waiting period. Finally,      cardiac transplantation in patients with prior implantation of a LVAD represents       a surgical challenge. This review summarises the current knowledge about LVAD and      continuous flow devices especially since the latter have been increasingly used      worldwide in the most recent years. The review is also based on the institutional      experience at Berne University Hospital between 2000 and 2012. Apart from      short-term devices (Impella, Cardiac Assist, Deltastream and ECMO) which were      used in approximately 150 cases, 85 pulsatile long-term LVAD, RVAD or bi-VAD and       44 non-pulsatile LVAD (mainly HeartMateII and HeartWare) were implanted. After an      initial learning curve, one-year mortality dropped to 10.4% in the last 58      patients.FAU - Carrel, ThierryAU  - Carrel TAD  - Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland.      thierry.carrel@insel.chFAU - Englberger, LarsAU  - Englberger LFAU - Martinelli, Michele VAU  - Martinelli MVFAU - Takala, JukkaAU  - Takala JFAU - Boesch, ClaudiaAU  - Boesch CFAU - Sigurdadottir, VilborgAU  - Sigurdadottir VFAU - Gygax, ErichAU  - Gygax EFAU - Kadner, AlexanderAU  - Kadner AFAU - Mohacsi, PaulAU  - Mohacsi PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121018PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Swiss Med WklyJT  - Swiss medical weeklyJID - 100970884SB  - IMMH  - ComorbidityMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/instrumentationMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Perioperative Care/methodsMH  - Waiting ListsEDAT- 2012/11/09 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/23 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/09 06:00AID - 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 [doi]AID - smw-13701 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Swiss Med Wkly. 2012 Oct 18;142:w13701. doi: 10.4414/smw.2012.13701.- 23135811own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20121108dcom- 20130522is  - 1424-3997 (electronic)is  - 0036-7672 (linking)vi  - 142dp  - 2012ti  - continuous flow left ventricular assist devices: a valid option for heart failure      patients.pg  - w13701lid - 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 [doi]lid - swiss med wkly. 2012;142:w13701 [pii]ab  - recent outstanding clinical advances with new mechanical circulatory systems      (mcs) have led to additional strategies in the treatment of end stage heart      failure (hf). heart transplantation (htx) can be postponed and for certain      patients even replaced by smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices      (lvad). mechanical support of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate      hemodynamic stabilisation and recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in       these severely ill patients. these new devices may be of great help to bridge      patients until a suitable cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed      as definitive treatment for patients who do not qualify for transplantation. main      indications for lvad implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to      transplantation or destination therapy. lvad may be an important tool for      patients with an expected prolonged period on the waiting list, for instance      those with blood group 0 or b, with a body weight over 90 kg and those with      potentially reversible secondary organ failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.      however, lvad implantation means an additional heart operation with inherent      peri-operative risks and complications during the waiting period. finally,      cardiac transplantation in patients with prior implantation of a lvad represents       a surgical challenge. this review summarises the current knowledge about lvad and      continuous flow devices especially since the latter have been increasingly used      worldwide in the most recent years. the review is also based on the institutional      experience at berne university hospital between 2000 and 2012. apart from      short-term devices (impella, cardiac assist, deltastream and ecmo) which were      used in approximately 150 cases, 85 pulsatile long-term lvad, rvad or bi-vad and       44 non-pulsatile lvad (mainly heartmateii and heartware) were implanted. after an      initial learning curve, one-year mortality dropped to 10.4% in the last 58      patients.fau - carrel, thierryau  - carrel tad  - clinic for cardiovascular surgery, inselspital, bern, switzerland.      thierry.carrel@insel.chfau - englberger, larsau  - englberger lfau - martinelli, michele vau  - martinelli mvfau - takala, jukkaau  - takala jfau - boesch, claudiaau  - boesch cfau - sigurdadottir, vilborgau  - sigurdadottir vfau - gygax, erichau  - gygax efau - kadner, alexanderau  - kadner afau - mohacsi, paulau  - mohacsi pla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewdep - 20121018pl  - switzerlandta  - swiss med wklyjt  - swiss medical weeklyjid - 100970884sb  - immh  - comorbiditymh  - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/instrumentationmh  - heart failure/*surgerymh  - heart transplantation/methodsmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - hemodynamicsmh  - humansmh  - perioperative care/methodsmh  - waiting listsedat- 2012/11/09 06:00mhda- 2013/05/23 06:00crdt- 2012/11/09 06:00aid - 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 [doi]aid - smw-13701 [pii]pst - epublishso  - swiss med wkly. 2012 oct 18;142:w13701. doi: 10.4414/smw.2012.13701.
