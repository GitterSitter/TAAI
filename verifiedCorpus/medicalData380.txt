The lack of alternative treatment options has prompted the development of      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, first as bridge to heart transplant      and subsequently as destination therapy as a valid alternative to transplant.      Last generation MCS devices are mechanically reliable and their management has      become increasingly less complex. Nowadays, medium-term survival does not      significantly differ between MCS and heart transplant recipients. MCS management       programs require a multidisciplinary team to optimize the pathway leading to      rehabilitation and improved quality of life and decrease the frequent occurrence       of complications. However, in the near future with the growing number of      implants, the chances for clinical cardiologists to come across a MCS recipient      will increase. The management of general or acute problems will no longer be      limited to tertiary implanting centers. A key issue to improve patient outcomes      is the provision of a smooth and careful transition from the hospital environment      to home care. The aim of this review is to start this process by providing basic       notions and general indications through several scenarios of MCS recipients      presenting to the emergency room for acute clinical problems.FAU -
