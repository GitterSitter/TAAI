However, many Japanese candidates have not received its benefits      due to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. The heart transplant waiting period       in Japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the Organ      Transplantation Law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900      days because of the increase in candidates. According to the Japanese Transplant       Registry, almost 90% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (BTT)      with a ventricular assist device (VAD), and the average duration of BTT is around      800 to 900 days. The excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in Japan even       with such a prolonged BTT duration with VADs is confirmation of the excellent      clinical results of VAD support. Until April 2011, only the paracorporeal Nipro      VAD for BTT was covered by Japanese national health insurance. Analysis of the      clinical outcome of 303 patients who received a Nipro VAD (for left ventricular      [LV] drainage) as BTT showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days      (average 427 days), 72 patients (24%) received a heart transplant, and 68      patients (22%) required ongoing VAD support. Thus the Nipro VAD is an excellent      paracorporeal device. The 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials       of four types of implantable rotary blood pump LVADs (Evaheart, DuraHeart, Jarvik      200, HeartMate II) was about 70%, which is an outstanding result of BTT using      implantable LVADs. Only 36 patients in seven Japanese heart centers have received      implantable LVADs, and this small number corresponds to the initial learning      curve. Therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use of      commercially available implantable LVADs becomes more widespread. The long      waiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellent      clinical outcomes of VAD therapy in Japan.FAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SAD  - Department of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, The University of Tokyo      Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.LA  - jpnPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - JapanTA  - Nihon Geka Gakkai ZasshiJT  - Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshiJID - 0405405SB  - IMMH  - EuropeMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*utilizationMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2012/06/20 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/22 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/20 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 2012 May;113(3):292-6.- 22708386own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120619dcom- 20120821is  - 0301-4894 (print)is  - 0301-4894 (linking)vi  - 113ip  - 3dp  - 2012 mayti  - [end-stage heart failure].pg  - 292-6ab  - the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure patients is cardiac      transplantation. however, many japanese candidates have not received its benefits      due to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. the heart transplant waiting period       in japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the organ      transplantation law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900      days because of the increase in candidates. according to the japanese transplant       registry, almost 90% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (btt)      with a ventricular assist device (vad), and the average duration of btt is around      800 to 900 days. the excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in japan even       with such a prolonged btt duration with vads is confirmation of the excellent      clinical results of vad support. until april 2011, only the paracorporeal nipro      vad for btt was covered by japanese national health insurance. analysis of the      clinical outcome of 303 patients who received a nipro vad (for left ventricular      [lv] drainage) as btt showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days      (average 427 days), 72 patients (24%) received a heart transplant, and 68      patients (22%) required ongoing vad support. thus the nipro vad is an excellent      paracorporeal device. the 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials       of four types of implantable rotary blood pump lvads (evaheart, duraheart, jarvik      200, heartmate ii) was about 70%, which is an outstanding result of btt using      implantable lvads. only 36 patients in seven japanese heart centers have received      implantable lvads, and this small number corresponds to the initial learning      curve. therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use of      commercially available implantable lvads becomes more widespread. the long      waiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellent      clinical outcomes of vad therapy in japan.fau - kyo, shuneiau  - kyo sad  - department of therapeutic strategy for heart failure, the university of tokyo      hospital, tokyo, japan.la  - jpnpt  - english abstractpt  - journal articlepl  - japanta  - nihon geka gakkai zasshijt  - nihon geka gakkai zasshijid - 0405405sb  - immh  - europemh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart-assist devices/*utilizationmh  - humansmh  - japanmh  - united statesedat- 2012/06/20 06:00mhda- 2012/08/22 06:00crdt- 2012/06/20 06:00pst - ppublishso  - nihon geka gakkai zasshi. 2012 may;113(3):292-6.
