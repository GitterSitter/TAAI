The change in the heart allocation system in 2006 has affected      our Center by both reducing the number of transplants we perform annually and      increasing the percentage of recipients on MCS at the time of transplant. Despite      the increased utilization of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge       to transplant, we continue to maintain excellent outcomes. The major clinical      advances in LVAD technology have allowed us to expand this therapy to ineligible       transplant patients, with outcomes that are continually improving. Nevertheless,       the field of MCS as permanent therapy is still in its infancy. The number of      patients who can benefit from this technology in the U.S. alone is in the      thousands, but refinements in patient selection and management are needed to      further advance this lifesaving therapy.FAU - Hoercher, Katherine JAU  - Hoercher KJAD  - The George M. and Linda H.
