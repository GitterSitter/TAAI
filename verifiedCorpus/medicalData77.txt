Nowadays, mechanical      circulatory support devices (MSCD) are an established therapeutic option for      terminal heart failure after exhaustion of medical and conventional surgical      treatment, and are becoming a realistic alternative to heart transplantation      (HTX). There are a number of different treatment options for these patients, such      as bridge to transplantation (BTT), bridge to candidacy (BTC), bridge to recovery      (BTR) and the destination therapy (DT) option. The latter option has become more       frequent throughout the last years, due to a donor organ shortage and an      increasing number of older patients with terminal heart failure who are not      eligible for HTX. These factors have led to a rapidly increasing number of LVAD      implantations as well as centers which perform these procedures. This has also      been due to improved LVAD survival rates and quality of life following the      introduction of smaller, intrapericardial and more durable continuous flow left      ventricular devices. The most common complications for these patients are      device-related problems, such as coagulation disorders, gastrointestinal      bleeding, device related infection, pump thrombosis or cerebrovascular accidents.      However, some questions still remain unanswered or under debate, such as the      exact time-point for LVAD implantation. In addition, aspects such as better      biocompatibility for LVADs remain a major challenge. This review will concentrate      on DT for terminal heart failure and provide an overview of the current evidence       for LVAD implantation in this patient group, with particular emphasis on      indication and time-point of implantation, choice of LVADs, and long term      outcomes and quality of life.FAU -
