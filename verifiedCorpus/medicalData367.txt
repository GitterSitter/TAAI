Therapies      include cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support, as well      inotropic agents for the short-term. Despite a growing armamentarium of      resources, the clinician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each      therapy to develop an optimal treatment strategy. While cardiac transplantation      remains the only true "cure" for end-stage disease, this resource is limited and       the demand continues to far outpace the supply. For patients who are      transplant-ineligible or likely to succumb to their illness prior to transplant,       ventricular assist device therapy has now become a viable option for improving      morbidity and mortality. Particularly for the non-operative patient, intravenous       inotropes can be utilized for symptom control. Regardless of the treatments      considered, care of the heart failure patient requires thoughtful dialogue,      multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized care. While survival is      important, most patients covet quality of life above all outcomes. An often      overlooked component is the patient's control over the dying process. It is vital      that clinicians make goals-of-care discussions a priority when seeing patients      with advanced heart failure. The use of palliative care consultation is      well-validated and facilitates these difficult conversations to ensure that all      patient needs are ultimately met.FAU - Katz, Jason NAU  - Katz JNFAU - Waters, Sarah BAU  - Waters SBFAU - Hollis, Ian BAU  - Hollis IBFAU - Chang, Patricia PAU  - Chang PPAD  - Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, 160 Dental Circle, CB#7075,      Burnett-Womack Building, 6th Floor, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7075, USA.      katzj@med.unc.edu.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United Arab EmiratesTA  - Curr Cardiol RevJT  - Current cardiology reviewsJID - 101261935SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Palliative CareMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Quality of LifePMC - PMC4347211OID - NLM: PMC4347211 [Available on 02/01/16]EDAT- 2013/11/21 06:00MHDA- 2015/05/12 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/21 06:00PMCR- 2016/02/01 00:00PHST- 2013/06/09 [received]PHST- 2013/06/09 [revised]PHST- 2013/09/27 [accepted]AID - CCR-EPUB-57443 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Cardiol Rev. 2015;11(1):63-72.- 24251460own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20141113dcom- 20150511lr  - 20150305is  - 1875-6557 (electronic)is  - 1573-403x (linking)vi  - 11ip  - 1dp  - 2015ti  - advanced therapies for end-stage heart failure.pg  - 63-72ab  - management of the advanced heart failure patient can be complex. therapies      include cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support, as well      inotropic agents for the short-term. despite a growing armamentarium of      resources, the clinician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each      therapy to develop an optimal treatment strategy. while cardiac transplantation      remains the only true "cure" for end-stage disease, this resource is limited and       the demand continues to far outpace the supply. for patients who are      transplant-ineligible or likely to succumb to their illness prior to transplant,       ventricular assist device therapy has now become a viable option for improving      morbidity and mortality. particularly for the non-operative patient, intravenous       inotropes can be utilized for symptom control. regardless of the treatments      considered, care of the heart failure patient requires thoughtful dialogue,      multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized care. while survival is      important, most patients covet quality of life above all outcomes. an often      overlooked component is the patient's control over the dying process. it is vital      that clinicians make goals-of-care discussions a priority when seeing patients      with advanced heart failure. the use of palliative care consultation is      well-validated and facilitates these difficult conversations to ensure that all      patient needs are ultimately met.fau - katz, jason nau  - katz jnfau - waters, sarah bau  - waters sbfau - hollis, ian bau  - hollis ibfau - chang, patricia pau  - chang ppad  - division of pulmonary & critical care medicine, 160 dental circle, cb#7075,      burnett-womack building, 6th floor, chapel hill, nc 27599-7075, usa.      katzj@med.unc.edu.la  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united arab emiratesta  - curr cardiol revjt  - current cardiology reviewsjid - 101261935sb  - immh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - palliative caremh  - patient selectionmh  - quality of lifepmc - pmc4347211oid - nlm: pmc4347211 [available on 02/01/16]edat- 2013/11/21 06:00mhda- 2015/05/12 06:00crdt- 2013/11/21 06:00pmcr- 2016/02/01 00:00phst- 2013/06/09 [received]phst- 2013/06/09 [revised]phst- 2013/09/27 [accepted]aid - ccr-epub-57443 [pii]pst - ppublishso  - curr cardiol rev. 2015;11(1):63-72.
