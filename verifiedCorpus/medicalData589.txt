Cardiac transplantation has been the gold standard      treatment with high post-transplant survival rates and relatively good quality of      life. However, there has been an extreme shortage of organ donations, limiting      transplants to only a very small portion of patients with the condition. This led      to a growing interest in alternative options for the increasing population of      patients who are waitlisted or ineligible for transplantation. In recent years,      ventricular assist device (VAD) technologies have advanced from pulsatile blood      pumps to continuous-flow pumps that have demonstrated unprecedented      post-implantation survival rates. The HeartMate II, the only commercially      available, continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in the United      States and Europe, has been implanted in over 10,000 patients worldwide, setting       a benchmark for biomedical modalities of advanced heart failure treatment. Thanks      to the successes of contemporary LVADs, patients are able to enjoy a better      lifestyle, with a significantly prolonged life span and the ability to regularly       partake in physical activities. In this new biomedical generation, the usage of      LVADs has begun to expand towards the treatment for a wider range of heart      conditions, including earlier stages of heart failure. In fact, LVAD      implantations have surpassed the number of transplants taken place annually. An      increasing number of patients are considering the permanent, circulatory support       with an LVAD, namely destination therapy, as a promising option for treating      heart failure.FAU - Yamakawa, MichaelAU  - Yamakawa MAD  - Department of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, University of Tokyo      Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.FAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SFAU - Yamakawa, SeanAU  - Yamakawa SFAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MFAU - Kinugawa, KoichiroAU  - Kinugawa KFAU - Nishimura, TakashiAU  - Nishimura TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121221PL  - JapanTA  - Gen Thorac Cardiovasc SurgJT  - General thoracic and cardiovascular surgeryJID - 101303952SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Survival RateEDAT- 2012/12/25 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/25 06:00PHST- 2012/08/10 [received]PHST- 2012/12/21 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s11748-012-0181-5 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2013 Mar;61(3):111-7. doi: 10.1007/s11748-012-0181-5.
