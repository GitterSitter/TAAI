However, there are      questions about posttransplantation effects of VADs. METHODS: Seventy-four      patients with end-stage heart failure who underwent HTx in our clinic between      February 2007 and July 2011 were divided into two groups; a bridge cohort (n =      28) and a nonbridge group comprising 46 who underwent HTx without mechanical      circulatory support. There mean ages were 39.89 +/- 15.66 and 38.33 +/- 16.23      years respectively. Significantly more patients in the bridge group, were man      displayed anemia, were treated with anticoagulation therapy, and underwent a      resternotomy. In the nonbridge group, more patients needed preoperative inotropic      support. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative      renal failure (P = .007, odds ratio [OR] 27) and inotropic support (P = .006, OR:      10,222) as well as longer cardiopulmonary bypasses (>/= 130 minutes, P = .001,      OR: 11,24) to be risk factors for in-hospital mortality, which was 15.2% in      nonbridge and 10.7% in bridge subjects, P = .733). Major adverse events, such as       renal failure, pulmonary failure, right ventricular failure, neurological event,       and reoperation due to bleeding, shown similar incidences between the groups. The      amount of blood transfusion was significantly higher in the bridge group (2.34 U       versus 3.56 U, P = .037). The preoperative incidence of human leukocyte antigen      sensitization (panel reactive antibody >/= 10%) and grade 2R were rejection      episodes in the early period were similar. CONCLUSION: Early posttransplant      results were not adversely or beneficially influenced by the use of VADs. Similar      to other types of cardiac surgery, a patients preoperative condition seemed to be      the major factor affecting mortality.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
