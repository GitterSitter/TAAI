The aim of this study is to report the outcomes in patients receiving      the HeartMate II LVAD at a single center and review the lessons learned from this      experience. METHODS: From June 2005 to June 2010, 130 consecutive patients      received the HeartMate II LVAD. Of these, 102 were bridge-to-transplant (BTT), 17      destination therapy, and 11 exchanges for failed HeartMate XVE. This study      focuses on the 102 BTT patients. The HeartMate II was approved by the US Food and      Drug Administration (FDA) as BTT in April 2008 and 64 patients received this      device as BTT since that date. We review our experience with the device as BTT      and report on patient survival and adverse events as well as the impact of FDA      approval on outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, mean age was 52.6 +/- 12.8 years; 26      (25.5%) were female. Disease etiology was ischemic in 58, nonischemic in 36, and       other in 8. Overall, 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year survival for the BTT patients      was 95.1%, 83.5%, and 78.8%, respectively. The 6-month survival in 38 patients in      the clinical trial (pre-FDA) was 88.8% and was not statistically significant      compared with the 76.2% 6-month survival in the 64 patients in the post-FDA      approval period (p value = 0.1). Major adverse events among the 102 BTT patients       included right ventricular failure in 5 (4.9%), LVAD driveline infections in 25      (24.5%), neurologic events in 10 (9.8%), and gastrointestinal bleeding in 18      (17.6%) patients. In addition, 1 patient (0.98%) had pump thrombus requiring      device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant morbidity, use of the      HeartMate II LVAD as BTT provides excellent hemodynamic support and is associated      with excellent survival and low mortality. In addition, there needs to be      improvement and focused strategies in the areas of gastrointestinal bleeding,      driveline infections, and adverse neurologic events for these devices to be able       to provide a real long-term alternative to heart transplantation.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
