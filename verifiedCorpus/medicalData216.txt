However, its effectiveness has not been evaluated      since approval. In this study we evaluated the EVAHEART device in a commercial      setting in Japan. METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients enrolled in the      Japanese Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (J-MACS), who      were listed for transplant or likely to be listed and who received an EVAHEART      device, were enrolled from 2011 to 2013 at 14 Japanese centers. Patients'      survival rates, adverse events and quality-of-life data were obtained from the      J-MACS Registry. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 43 years (85% male). The      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profiles      revealed 12 patients in Level 1, 45 in Level 2, 37 in Level 3 and 1 in Level 4.      The mean support duration was 384.7 days, with a cumulative duration of 101.2      years. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate during support was 93.4% at 6 months, 87.4%      at 1 year and 87.4% at 2 years. Seventy-seven patients (80.2%) currently remain      on support, 7 received a transplant and 10 died during support. Major adverse      events included drive-line infection (14.6%) and neurologic events such as      ischemic stroke (17.7%), hemorrhage (13.5%), transient ischemic attack (3.1%),      pump thrombosis (1%) and hemolysis (1%). There was no gastrointestinal (GI)      bleeding or right heart failure requiring right ventricular assist device (RVAD).      There was no pump exchange due to mechanical failure. CONCLUSIONS: The EVAHEART      device provides safe, reliable and long-term circulatory support with improved      survival in commercial settings of BTT in Japan, where the transplant waiting      period is much longer. Incidences of GI bleeding, hemolysis, right ventricular      failure, device thrombosis and mechanical failure were extremely rare in patients      on EVAHEART devices.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
