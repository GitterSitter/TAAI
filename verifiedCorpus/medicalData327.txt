The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates      peaked at 149 per 100 wait-list years in 2007 and has been declining since; in      2012, the rate was 93 heart transplants per 100 active wait-list years. Increased      waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase in      wait-list mortality. Since 2007, the proportion of patients on life support      before transplant increased from 48.6% to 62.7% in 2012. Medical urgency      categories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgency      categories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list       each year; the number of transplants performed each year increased from 274 in      1998 to 372 in 2012. Graft survival in pediatric recipients continues to improve;      5-year graft survival for transplants performed in 2007 was 78.5%. Medicare paid       for some or all of the care for nearly 40% of heart transplant recipients in      2010. Heart transplant appears to be more expensive than ventricular assist      devices for managing end-stage heart failure, but is more effective and likely      more cost-effective.CI  - (c) Copyright 2013 The American Society of Transplantation and the American      Society of Transplant Surgeons.FAU - Colvin-Adams, MAU  - Colvin-Adams MAD  - Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Minneapolis Medical Research      Foundation, Minneapolis, MN;
