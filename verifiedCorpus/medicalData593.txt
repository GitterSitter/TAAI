However, with improving mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) technology,       the treatment options for RCS patients are expanding. We report on a recent      5-year single-center experience with MCSD for treatment of RCS. METHODS: This      study was a retrospective review of adult patients who required an MCSD due to      RCS in the past 5 years. We excluded those patients with post-cardiotomy shock      and post-transplant cardiac graft dysfunction. In the setting of RCS, a      short-term ventricular assist device (VAD) was inserted as a bridge-to-decision      device. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) was chosen in      cases of unknown neurologic status, complete hemodynamic collapse or severe      coagulopathy. RESULTS: From January 2007 through January 2012, 90 patients      received an MCSD for RCS, 21 (23%) of whom had active cardiopulmonary      resuscitation (CPR). The etiology of RCS included acute myocardial infarction in       49% and acute decompensated heart failure in 27%. Mean age was 53+/-14 years, 71%      were male, and 60% had an intra-aortic balloon pump. The initial approach      utilized was short-term VAD in 49% and VA ECMO in 51%. Median length of support      was 8 days (IQR 4 to 18 days). Exchange to implantable VAD was performed in 26%      of patients. Other destinations included myocardial recovery in 18% and heart      transplantation in 11%. Survival to hospital discharge was 49%. Multivariate      analysis showed ongoing CPR to be an independent risk factor for mortality (OR =       5.79, 95% CI 1.285 to 26.08, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: In the current era, roughly      half of the patients who need an MCSD for RCS survive, and roughly half of these       survivors require an implantable VAD.
