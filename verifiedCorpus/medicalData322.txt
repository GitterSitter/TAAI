However, due to the limited      availability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)      have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patients      with refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with the      HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as a      bridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was a      retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVAD      implantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were       classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support       (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-heart      transplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 years      old (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart      disease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], and      chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12      patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwent      HMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative       days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery      (21.7%), mediastinal infection (21.7%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinal      collection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0%),       and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3%). All patients were discharged      from hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced driveline      infections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to the      following conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0%), gastrointestinal      bleeding (13.0%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0%), transient ischemic attack      (8.7%), arrhythmia (8.7%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aortic      regurgitation (8.7%), right ventricular failure (4.3%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3%),      and hematuria (4.3%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally New      York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three       patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient was      successfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were two      mortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was      522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to be      effective in our Asian population. Driveline infection rate remains low even in      the tropical hot, humid climate in Singapore. With more patients ending up on      extended periods of LVAD support, increased emphasis in the detection and      management of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will be      needed.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Lim, Choon PinAU  - Lim CPAD  - National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore.FAU - Sivathasan, CumaraswamyAU  - Sivathasan CFAU - Tan, Teing EeAU  - Tan TEFAU - Lim, Chong HeeAU  - Lim CHFAU - Kerk, Ka LeeAU  - Kerk KLFAU - Sim, David Kheng LengAU  - Sim DKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140107PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMCIN - Artif Organs. 2014 Jun;38(6):521-3. - 24392937own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140721dcom- 20150309is  - 1525-1594 (electronic)is  - 0160-564x (linking)vi  - 38ip  - 7dp  - 2014 julti  - use of left ventricular assist device (heartmate ii): a singapore experience.pg  - 543-8lid - 10.1111/aor.12247 [doi]ab  - recent advances in medical and device therapies in heart failure have improved      the survival of patients with heart failure. however, due to the limited      availability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (lvads)      have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patients      with refractory heart failure in singapore. we report our experience with the      heartmate ii (hmii) lvad (thoratec corporation, pleasanton, ca, usa) as a      bridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. this was a      retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent hmii lvad      implantation in our center between may 2009 and december 2012. all patients were       classified as interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support       (intermacs) levels 1 to 3 and underwent lvad implantation as a bridge-to-heart      transplant. there were 17 male and 6 female patients. the mean age was 43.6 years      old (range 14 to 64). the etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart      disease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], and      chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. nine patients were intermacs level 1, 12      patients level 2, and two patients level 3. all patients successfully underwent      hmii lvad implantation. there was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative       days. postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery      (21.7%), mediastinal infection (21.7%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinal      collection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0%),       and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3%). all patients were discharged      from hospital after lvad implantation. three patients experienced driveline      infections during outpatient follow-up. there were 19 readmissions due to the      following conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0%), gastrointestinal      bleeding (13.0%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0%), transient ischemic attack      (8.7%), arrhythmia (8.7%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aortic      regurgitation (8.7%), right ventricular failure (4.3%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3%),      and hematuria (4.3%). post-lvad implantation, 20 patients were functionally new      york heart association (nyha) class i, while 3 reported nyha iii symptoms. three       patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. one patient was      successfully explanted 11 months after lvad implantation. there were two      mortalities during the follow-up period. the average duration of lvad support was      522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). the heartmate ii lvad has proven to be      effective in our asian population. driveline infection rate remains low even in      the tropical hot, humid climate in singapore. with more patients ending up on      extended periods of lvad support, increased emphasis in the detection and      management of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will be      needed.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 international center for artificial organs and transplantation      and wiley periodicals, inc.fau - lim, choon pinau  - lim cpad  - national heart centre singapore, singapore.fau - sivathasan, cumaraswamyau  - sivathasan cfau - tan, teing eeau  - tan tefau - lim, chong heeau  - lim chfau - kerk, ka leeau  - kerk klfau - sim, david kheng lengau  - sim dkla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20140107pl  - united statesta  - artif organsjt  - artificial organsjid - 7802778sb  - imcin - artif organs. 2014 jun;38(6):521-3.
