The Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t)       (SynCardia Systems Inc., Tuscon, AZ) has been approved for compassionate use by      the Food and Drug Administration for patients with end-stage biventricular heart       failure as a bridge to heart transplantation since 1985 and has had FDA approval       since 2004. However, of the 1,061 patients placed on the TAH-t, only 21 (2%) were      under the age 18. SynCardia Systems, Inc. recommends a minimum patient body      surface area (BSA) of 1.7 m(2), thus, limiting pediatric application of this      device. This unique case report shares this pediatric institution's first      experience with the TAH-t. A 14-year-old male was admitted with dilated      cardiomyopathy and severe biventricular heart failure. The patient rapidly      decompensated, requiring extracorporeal life support. An echocardiogram revealed       severe biventricular dysfunction and diffuse clot formation in the left ventricle      and outflow tract. The decision was made to transition to biventricular assist      device. The biventricular failure and clot formation helped guide the team to the      TAH-t, in spite of a BSA (1.5 m(2)) below the recommendation of 1.7 m(2). A      computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, in conjunction with a novel      three-dimensional (3D) modeling system and team, assisted in determining      appropriate fit. Chest CT and 3D modeling following implantation were utilized to      determine all major vascular structures were unobstructed and the bronchi were      open. The virtual 3D model confirmed appropriate device fit with no evidence of      compression to the left pulmonary veins. The postoperative course was complicated      by a left lung opacification. The left lung anomalies proved to be atelectasis      and improved with aggressive recruitment maneuvers. The patient was supported for      11 days prior to transplantation. Chest CT and 3D modeling were crucial in      assessing whether the device would fit, as well as postoperative complications in      this smaller pediatric patient.FAU - Park, S SAU  - Park SSAD  - 1Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Division of Cardiology, Division of Critical      Care Medicine, Children's Heart Center, Division of Radiology, Phoenix Children's      Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA.FAU - Sanders, D BAU  - Sanders DBFAU - Smith, B PAU  - Smith BPFAU - Ryan, JAU  - Ryan JFAU - Plasencia, JAU  - Plasencia JFAU - Osborn, M BAU  - Osborn MBFAU - Wellnitz, C MAU  - Wellnitz CMFAU - Southard, R NAU  - Southard RNFAU - Pierce, C NAU  - Pierce CNFAU - Arabia, F AAU  - Arabia FAFAU - Lane, JAU  - Lane JFAU - Frakes, DAU  - Frakes DFAU - Velez, D AAU  - Velez DAFAU - Pophal, S GAU  - Pophal SGFAU - Nigro, J JAU  - Nigro JJLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130718PL  - EnglandTA  - PerfusionJT  - PerfusionJID - 8700166SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*surgery/therapyMH  - Heart Failure/*surgery/therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - *Heart, ArtificialMH  - HumansMH  - MaleOTO - NOTNLMOT  - 3D modelingOT  - ECLSOT  - ECMOOT  - Total Artificial HeartOT  - VADOT  - cardiac transplantationOT  - decompensated heart failureOT  - mechanical circulatory supportOT  - ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/07/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/04 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/23 06:00PHST- 2013/07/18 [aheadofprint]AID - 0267659113496580 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0267659113496580 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Perfusion. 2014 Jan;29(1):82-8. doi: 10.1177/0267659113496580.
