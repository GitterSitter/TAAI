From a surgical perspective, the treatment options for      effective long-term survival are usually limited to heart transplantation,      heart-lung transplantation or implantation of a destination mechanical      circulatory support device. Assuming an advanced heart-failure patient is indeed       deemed a candidate for transplantation, the patient is subject to shortages in      donor organ availability and thus possible further decompensation and potential      death while awaiting transplantation. Various extracorporeal and implantable      ventricular-assist devices (VADs) may be able to provide temporary or long-term      circulatory support for many end-stage heart-failure patients but mechanical      circulatory support options for patients requiring long-term biventricular      support remain limited. Implantation of a total artificial heart (TAH) currently       represents one, if not the best, long-term surgical treatment option for patients      requiring biventricular mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplant.      The clinical applicability of available versions of positive displacement pumps      is limited by their size and complications. Application of continuous-flow      technology can help in solving some of these issues and is currently being      applied in the research towards a new generation of smaller and more effective      TAHs. In this review, we discuss the history of the TAH, its development and      clinical application, implications for anaesthetic management, published outcomes      and the future outlook for TAHs.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
