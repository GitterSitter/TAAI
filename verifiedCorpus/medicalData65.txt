The latter has become      increasingly popular in recent years, in the face of a donor organ shortage and a      rise in elderly patients ineligible for heart transplants. For these patients in       particular, device durability is a key contributor to survival, morbidity, and      quality of life. This systematic review aimed to assess the long-term durability       of current continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched      from their dates of inception to August 2014 for original studies reporting on      patients receiving continuous-flow LVADs. LVAD failure was defined as device      malfunction necessitating exchange or explantation, or causing patient mortality.      Pooled averages were calculated for outcomes and rates of device failure were      reconstructed from digitized graph curves using the software, WebPlotDigitizer      v3.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective observational studies with a total of 5,471      patients were included for analysis. The mean duration of LVAD support was 504.7       (range, 303-568) days, and the overall weighted incidence of device failure was      3.9% (range, 1-11.3%). On average, pump thrombosis was the most common cause of      device failure (50.5%), followed by lead or cable damage (21.7%), mechanical pump      failure (11.6%), device-related infection (11.1%), and surgical complications      from implantation (2.5%). Long-term device failure rates at 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and       24-months post-implantation were 0.5%, 1.8%, 2.9%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively.      CONCLUSIONS: With the expected rise in LVAD usage for end-stage heart failure,      particularly as a DT, the steady minority of patients experiencing device failure      is likely to increase. Further investigation is required into the incidence and      mechanism of major causes of failure, as well as design improvements that may      address these complications. There is currently a lack of guidelines and large      randomized studies reporting on the etiology and outcomes of LVAD failure.FAU - Xie, AshleighAU  - Xie AAD  - 1 The Collaborative Research (CORE) Group, Macquarie University, Sydney,      Australia ;
