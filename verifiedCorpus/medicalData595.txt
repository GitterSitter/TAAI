Left ventricular assist device implantation offers an      alternative treatment approach. Left ventricular assist device practice has      changed dramatically since the 2008 Food and Drug Administration approval of the       HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif), but at what societal cost? The      present study examined the cost and efficacy of both treatments over time.      METHODS: All patients who underwent either orthotopic heart transplantation (n =       9369) or placement of an implantable left ventricular assist device (n = 6414)      from 2005 to 2009 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were selected. The trends in      treatment use, mortality, and cost were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of      orthotopic heart transplantation increased marginally within a 5-year period. In       contrast, the annual left ventricular assist device implantation rates nearly      tripled. In-hospital mortality from left ventricular assist device implantation      decreased precipitously, from 42% to 17%. In-hospital mortality for orthotopic      heart transplantation remained relatively stable (range, 3.8%-6.5%). The mean      cost per patient increased for both orthotopic heart transplantation and left      ventricular assist device placement (40% and 17%, respectively). With the      observed increase in both device usage and cost per patient, the cumulative Left       ventricular assist device cost increased 232% within 5 years (from $143 million      to $479 million). By 2009, Medicare and Medicaid were the primary payers for      nearly one half of all patients (orthotopic heart transplantation, 45%; left      ventricular assist device, 51%). CONCLUSIONS: Since Food and Drug Administration       approval of the HeartMate II, mortality after left ventricular assist device      implantation has decreased rapidly, yet has remained greater than that after      orthotopic heart transplantation. The left ventricular assist device costs have      continued to increase and have been significantly greater than those for      orthotopic heart transplantation. Because of the evolving healthcare economics      climate, with increasing emphasis on the costs and comparative effectiveness, a      concerted effort at LVAD cost containment and judicious usage is essential to      preserve the viability of this invaluable treatment.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
