In Japan, CFVAD is limited for BTT use. The      waiting period for heart transplantation (HT) is long owing to donor shortage. We      examined the results of CFVAD for BTT indication. METHODS: Eighty-nine VAD      treatments were performed among subjects whose preimplantation condition was      profile 1 (n = 49) or profile 2 or 3 (n = 40). The device was the paracorporeal      pulsatile Nipro VAD (n = 67) or CFVAD (n = 22). All CFVAD patients were profile 2      or 3. RESULTS: The median assist period was 529 days (Nipro VAD, 530; CFVAD,      528). Twenty-six patients were on the device for >2 years. Actuarial survival was      81.6%, 69.5%, and 61.1% at 1, 3, and 5 years. Survival in profile 1 was      significantly worse than in profile 2 or 3. Survival of CFVAD patients was      superior to that of paracorporeal VAD. Six-month mortality rate of 20% in cases      before 2009 (n = 60) was dramatically improved to 3% among those after 2010 (n =       29). All patients with CFVAD were alive and discharged home. 26 patients were      transplanted, 7 had been weaned from VAD and 27 were on a device. The rate of      events requiring hospital admission was 0.98 per patient-year in CFVAD patients.       CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary CFVADs have enabled advanced heart failure patients to       await HT safely with an improved quality of life. The advent of CFVAD has also      shifted their preimplantation condition to a less sick status. CFVADs were the      safest, most reliable circulatory support devices for long-term waiting periods      for the BTT indications.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
