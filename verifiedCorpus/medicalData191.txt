However, little is known about how exercise capacity changes after LVAD and how      changes compare with patients undergoing heart transplantation. METHODS AND      RESULTS: We compared changes in cardiopulmonary exercise testing performed pre-      and postoperatively in patients who underwent HeartMate II LVAD implantation (n =      25) and heart transplantation (n = 74) at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,      Minnesota, between 2007 and 2012. Preoperatively, patients undergoing LVAD and      transplant had markedly reduced exercise time (mean 5.1 minutes [45% predicted]      and 5.0 minutes [44% predicted], respectively), low peak oxygen consumption (VO2;      mean 11.5 mL . kg . min [43% predicted] and 11.9 mL . kg . min [38% predicted]),       and abnormal ventilatory gas exchange (ratio of minute ventilation to carbon      dioxide production [VE/VCO2] nadir 39.4 and 37.4). After LVAD and transplant,      there were similar improvements in exercise time (mean Delta +1.2 vs. 1.7      minutes, respectively, P = .27) and VE/VCO2 nadir (mean Delta -3.7 vs. -4.2, P =       .74). However, peak VO2 increased posttransplant but did not change post-LVAD      (mean Delta +5.4 vs. +0.9 mL . kg . min, respectively, P < .001). Most patients      (72%) had a peak VO2 < 14 mL . kg . min post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Although      improvements in exercise capacity and gas exchange are seen after LVAD and heart       transplant, peak VO2 doesn't improve post-LVAD and remains markedly abnormal in      most patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
