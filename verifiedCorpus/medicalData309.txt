Data regarding risk factors,      prevalence, and outcomes are limited. To better define the characteristics and      prognosis of hemolysis, we present a retrospective case-control study of LVAD      patients in our institution. METHODS: A detailed record review was conducted of      18 patients supported with the HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA)      who were diagnosed with hemolysis, and their data were compared with 82 patients       who received an LVAD implant during the same period who did not develop      hemolysis. Patients were excluded if they did not survive hospitalization at the       time of LVAD implantation. The primary end points of this analysis were time to      death and time to first hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 100 total patients, 18 HMII       patients (18%) were diagnosed with hemolysis. Those with hemolysis were younger,       had significantly higher lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels, lower      international normalized ratio, and no difference in cannula velocities by      transthoracic echocardiography. Patient survival in the hemolysis group was      markedly decreased at 1 year (38.9% vs 89.3%, p < 0.001), but no differences in      hospitalization (p = 0.57) were observed. Partial to complete thrombosis was      noted in all of the pumps at explant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate      that hemolysis is associated with high mortality, likely serving as a marker of      pump thrombosis. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels are      important indicators for hemolysis, and lower international normalized ratio may       pre-dispose for this worrisome condition. Diagnosis should prompt clinicians to      consider pump exchange or explant, listing for transplantation, or intensifying      anti-coagulation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
