New temporary ventricular assist devices (VADs)      that are rapidly applied to normalize cardiac output in patients with severe      heart failure are being used more frequently. Bridge to decision describes the      temporary use of a VAD to stabilize critically ill patients until complete      diagnostic tests are performed and decisions about more definitive therapy are      made. The CentriMag, TandemHeart, and Impella VADs offer versatility for use in      many patients and in multiple hospital settings. These VADs provide continuous      blood flow, altering the usual assessment of arterial blood pressure. Patients      are usually immobilized during support to prevent dislodgement of cannulas.      Anticoagulation therapy is commonly required, and bleeding is a frequent      complication. Infection prevention measures must be used to avoid septic      complications. In the past 10 years, clinical experience with these devices has      expanded, but they remain underused.FAU - Myers, Timothy JAU  - Myers TJAD  - Medical & Scientific Consulting Services, LLC, 4803 Valerie St., Bellaire, TX      77401, USA. tmyers@medscics.comLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - AACN Adv Crit CareJT  - AACN advanced critical careJID - 101269322SB  - NMH  - Cardiac OutputMH  - Cooperative BehaviorMH  - Critical IllnessMH  - Decision MakingMH  - Heart Failure/surgery/therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*instrumentation/methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - *Intensive Care UnitsMH  - Shock, CardiogenicMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2012/02/01 06:00MHDA- 2012/06/06 06:00CRDT- 2012/02/01 06:00AID - 10.1097/NCI.0b013e318240e369 [doi]AID - 01256961-201201000-00009 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - AACN Adv Crit Care. 2012 Jan-Mar;23(1):55-68. doi: 10.1097/NCI.0b013e318240e369.- 22290091own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120131dcom- 20120605is  - 1559-7776 (electronic)is  - 1559-7768 (linking)vi  - 23ip  - 1dp  - 2012 jan-marti  - temporary ventricular assist devices in the intensive care unit as a bridge to      decision.pg  - 55-68lid - 10.1097/nci.0b013e318240e369 [doi]ab  - morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock remain high despite      the recent advances in therapy. new temporary ventricular assist devices (vads)      that are rapidly applied to normalize cardiac output in patients with severe      heart failure are being used more frequently. bridge to decision describes the      temporary use of a vad to stabilize critically ill patients until complete      diagnostic tests are performed and decisions about more definitive therapy are      made. the centrimag, tandemheart, and impella vads offer versatility for use in      many patients and in multiple hospital settings. these vads provide continuous      blood flow, altering the usual assessment of arterial blood pressure. patients      are usually immobilized during support to prevent dislodgement of cannulas.      anticoagulation therapy is commonly required, and bleeding is a frequent      complication. infection prevention measures must be used to avoid septic      complications. in the past 10 years, clinical experience with these devices has      expanded, but they remain underused.fau - myers, timothy jau  - myers tjad  - medical & scientific consulting services, llc, 4803 valerie st., bellaire, tx      77401, usa. tmyers@medscics.comla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - aacn adv crit carejt  - aacn advanced critical carejid - 101269322sb  - nmh  - cardiac outputmh  - cooperative behaviormh  - critical illnessmh  - decision makingmh  - heart failure/surgery/therapymh  - heart transplantation/*instrumentation/methodsmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - hemodynamicsmh  - humansmh  - *intensive care unitsmh  - shock, cardiogenicmh  - time factorsedat- 2012/02/01 06:00mhda- 2012/06/06 06:00crdt- 2012/02/01 06:00aid - 10.1097/nci.0b013e318240e369 [doi]aid - 01256961-201201000-00009 [pii]pst - ppublishso  - aacn adv crit care. 2012 jan-mar;23(1):55-68. doi: 10.1097/nci.0b013e318240e369.
