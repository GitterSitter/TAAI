The aim of this study      was to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA)      and BSI after implantation of LVAD for advanced heart failure (HF). This was a      retrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage HF, who underwent       implantation of HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD over a 4 year period. Blood      stream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspected      neurological complications including CVAs were confirmed by neuroimaging.      Extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristics      were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The mean age of our study      population was 62.3 +/- 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males      (n = 75, 86.2%). The baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients      with and without CVAs. Patients with BSI had a much greater incidence of CVA      compared to patients without BSI (n = 13, 43.3% vs. n = 5, 10.0%; p < 0.0001).      There was an increased mortality in patients with BSI than those without (n = 57,      65.5% vs. n = 30, 34.5%; p = 0.003). The risk of all CVAs (hemorrhagic/ischemic)       was eightfold (odds ratio [OR] = 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4-25.5; p       = 0.001] in patients with BSI. Patients with BSI had a >20-fold risk of      hemorrhagic CVA (OR = 24; 95% CI = 2.8-201.1; p = 0.03). Advanced HF patients      with LVAD support who developed BSI need urgent evaluation and close monitoring      for suspected neurological complications, particularly hemorrhagic CVA.FAU - Aggarwal, AshimAU  - Aggarwal AAD  - Center for Heart Transplant and Assist Devices, Advocate Christ Medical Center,      Oak Lawn, Illinois 60453, USA.FAU - Gupta, AnkitAU  - Gupta AFAU - Kumar, ShivaniAU  - Kumar SFAU - Baumblatt, Jane AAU  - Baumblatt JAFAU - Pauwaa, SunilAU  - Pauwaa SFAU - Gallagher, ColleenAU  - Gallagher CFAU - Treitman, AdamAU  - Treitman AFAU - Pappas, PatAU  - Pappas PFAU - Tatooles, AntoneAU  - Tatooles AFAU - Bhat, GeethaAU  - Bhat GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - Bacteremia/*complications/etiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative Complications/etiologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Stroke/*etiologyEDAT- 2012/07/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/26 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/24 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318260c6a6 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2012 Sep-Oct;58(5):509-13. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318260c6a6.- 22820918own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120830dcom- 20130125is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 58ip  - 5dp  - 2012 sep-octti  - are blood stream infections associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic      stroke in patients with a left ventricular assist device?pg  - 509-13lid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e318260c6a6 [doi]ab  - blood stream infections (bsis) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality       in patients with left ventricular assist devices (lvads). the aim of this study      was to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (cva)      and bsi after implantation of lvad for advanced heart failure (hf). this was a      retrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage hf, who underwent       implantation of heartmate ii continuous-flow lvad over a 4 year period. blood      stream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspected      neurological complications including cvas were confirmed by neuroimaging.      extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristics      were analyzed using spss statistical software. the mean age of our study      population was 62.3 +/- 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males      (n = 75, 86.2%). the baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients      with and without cvas. patients with bsi had a much greater incidence of cva      compared to patients without bsi (n = 13, 43.3% vs. n = 5, 10.0%; p < 0.0001).      there was an increased mortality in patients with bsi than those without (n = 57,      65.5% vs. n = 30, 34.5%; p = 0.003). the risk of all cvas (hemorrhagic/ischemic)       was eightfold (odds ratio [or] = 7.9; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.4-25.5; p       = 0.001] in patients with bsi. patients with bsi had a >20-fold risk of      hemorrhagic cva (or = 24; 95% ci = 2.8-201.1; p = 0.03). advanced hf patients      with lvad support who developed bsi need urgent evaluation and close monitoring      for suspected neurological complications, particularly hemorrhagic cva.fau - aggarwal, ashimau  - aggarwal aad  - center for heart transplant and assist devices, advocate christ medical center,      oak lawn, illinois 60453, usa.fau - gupta, ankitau  - gupta afau - kumar, shivaniau  - kumar sfau - baumblatt, jane aau  - baumblatt jafau - pauwaa, sunilau  - pauwaa sfau - gallagher, colleenau  - gallagher cfau - treitman, adamau  - treitman afau - pappas, patau  - pappas pfau - tatooles, antoneau  - tatooles afau - bhat, geethaau  - bhat gla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109sb  - immh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - aged, 80 and overmh  - bacteremia/*complications/etiologymh  - femalemh  - heart failure/therapymh  - heart-assist devices/*adverse effectsmh  - humansmh  - kaplan-meier estimatemh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - postoperative complications/etiologymh  - retrospective studiesmh  - risk factorsmh  - stroke/*etiologyedat- 2012/07/24 06:00mhda- 2013/01/26 06:00crdt- 2012/07/24 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e318260c6a6 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2012 sep-oct;58(5):509-13. doi: 10.1097/mat.0b013e318260c6a6.
