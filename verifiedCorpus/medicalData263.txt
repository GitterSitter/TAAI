Although heart      transplantation is the only curative strategy for patients with end-stage heart      failure, the relative shortage of donors has led to a worldwide plateau of this      option over the past 20 years. The result is an unacceptably high mortality rate       among patients with advanced heart failure. Interest in developing alternative      curative strategies based on chronic circulatory support, with the aim of      prolonging and improving quality of life for these patients, has grown. Patients       supported with left ventricular assist devices require structured longitudinal      care from a team of providers. An integrated approach using basic      echocardiography is critical to patient selection, implantation, and continued      surveillance and success of patients with left ventricular assist devices.FAU - Todaro, Maria ChiaraAU  - Todaro MCAD  - Cardiology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of       Messina, Messina, Italy.FAU - Khandheria, Bijoy KAU  - Khandheria BKFAU - Paterick, Timothy EAU  - Paterick TEFAU - Umland, Matt MAU  - Umland MMFAU - Thohan, VinayAU  - Thohan VLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Cardiol RepJT  - Current cardiology reportsJID - 100888969SB  - IMMH  - *EchocardiographyMH  - Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension/ultrasonographyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgery/*ultrasonographyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Ventricles/physiopathology/*ultrasonographyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Perioperative Care/*methodsMH  - PrognosisMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/ultrasonographyEDAT- 2014/03/04 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/04 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11886-014-0468-5 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Cardiol Rep. 2014 Apr;16(4):468. doi: 10.1007/s11886-014-0468-5.- 24585110own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140303dcom- 20141201is  - 1534-3170 (electronic)is  - 1523-3782 (linking)vi  - 16ip  - 4dp  - 2014 aprti  - the practical role of echocardiography in selection, implantation, and management      of patients requiring lvad therapy.pg  - 468lid - 10.1007/s11886-014-0468-5 [doi]ab  - viable treatment options for advanced heart failure have not emerged as the      number of people afflicted with this condition has grown. although heart      transplantation is the only curative strategy for patients with end-stage heart      failure, the relative shortage of donors has led to a worldwide plateau of this      option over the past 20 years. the result is an unacceptably high mortality rate       among patients with advanced heart failure. interest in developing alternative      curative strategies based on chronic circulatory support, with the aim of      prolonging and improving quality of life for these patients, has grown. patients       supported with left ventricular assist devices require structured longitudinal      care from a team of providers. an integrated approach using basic      echocardiography is critical to patient selection, implantation, and continued      surveillance and success of patients with left ventricular assist devices.fau - todaro, maria chiaraau  - todaro mcad  - cardiology unit, department of clinical and experimental medicine, university of       messina, messina, italy.fau - khandheria, bijoy kau  - khandheria bkfau - paterick, timothy eau  - paterick tefau - umland, matt mau  - umland mmfau - thohan, vinayau  - thohan vla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - curr cardiol repjt  - current cardiology reportsjid - 100888969sb  - immh  - *echocardiographymh  - familial primary pulmonary hypertension/ultrasonographymh  - femalemh  - heart failure/physiopathology/surgery/*ultrasonographymh  - heart transplantationmh  - heart ventricles/physiopathology/*ultrasonographymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - hemodynamicsmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - patient selectionmh  - perioperative care/*methodsmh  - prognosismh  - quality of lifemh  - risk assessmentmh  - survival analysismh  - tricuspid valve insufficiency/ultrasonographyedat- 2014/03/04 06:00mhda- 2014/12/15 06:00crdt- 2014/03/04 06:00aid - 10.1007/s11886-014-0468-5 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - curr cardiol rep. 2014 apr;16(4):468. doi: 10.1007/s11886-014-0468-5.
