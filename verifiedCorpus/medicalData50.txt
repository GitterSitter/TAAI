Emergent use of MCS is often required before      establishing the likelihood of OHTx. This can require bridge-to-bridge strategies      to increase survival on the waiting list. We compared the outcome of children      with heart failure who underwent single MCS with those who required multiple MCS       as a bridge to OHTx. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients aged less than 16      years was conducted. From March 1998 to October 2005, we used either a      veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VA-ECMO), or the Medos(R)      para-corporeal ventricular assist device (VAD). From November 2005 onwards, the      Berlin Heart EXCOR(R) (BHE) device was implanted in the majority of cases.      Several combinations of bridge-to-bridge strategies have been used: VA-ECMO and      then conversion to BHE; BHE and then conversion to VA-ECMO; left VAD and then      upgraded to biventricular support (BIVAD); conversion from pulsatile to      continuous-flow pumps. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients received MCS with the      intent to bridge to OHTx, including 21 (23%) supported with more than one      modality. The mean age and weight at support was similar in both groups, but      multimodality MCS was used more often in infancy (P = 0.008) and in children less      than 10 kg in weight (P = 0.02). The mean duration of support was longer in the      multiple MCS group: 40 +/- 48 vs 84 +/- 43 days (P = 0.0003). Usage of      multimodality MCS in dilated cardiomyopathy (19%) and in other diagnoses (29%)      was comparable. Incidence of major morbidity (haematological sequelae,      cerebrovascular events and sepsis) was similar in both groups. Survival to      OHTx/explantation of the device (recovery) and survival to discharge did not      differ between single MCS and multiple MCS groups (78 vs 81% and 72 vs 76%,      respectively). CONCLUSION: Bridge to OHTx with multiple MCS does not seem to      influence the outcome in our population. Infancy and body weight less than 10 kg       do not tend to produce higher mortality in the multiple MCS group. However,      children receiving more than one modality are supported for longer durations.CI  - (c) The Author 2015.
