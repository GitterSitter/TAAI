The Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatrics is utilized at our center as a      bridge to transplantation or bridge to recovery. This retrospective study reviews      our results regarding the safety of long-term support and outcome. Methods.      Between January 2008 and December 2010, 12 patients (6 females and 6 males)      underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device. The median weight was 14.2      kg (range 4.2-51.6 kg) and the median age was 4.12 years (range 0.25-11.83      years). All patients were on inotropes, five patients required mechanical      ventilation and three patients experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation.      Results. Eight patients received a left ventricular assist device and four      patients received a biventricular assist device. Of the 12 patients, 8 were      bridge to heart transplantation, in 2 patients explantation was possible, and 1      patient died on support. The median support time for these 11 patients was 151      days (range 4-488 days), with 2124 days of cardiac support. One patient is on      support. Survival rate was 91.6%. Seven patients had a blood pump change once.      Four patients had local signs of infection. There was no mediastinitis and      thromboembolism. One patient had intracerebral hemorrhage. There was no death      after heart transplantation or after explantation of the device. Conclusions. The      Berlin Heart EXCOR is effective in bridging children of almost all ages and sizes      to cardiac transplantation or myocardial recovery. Our experience proved that      long-term support is possible with a low rate of adverse events.FAU - Sandica, EugenAU  - Sandica EAD  - Department of Surgery for Congenital Heart Defects, Center for Congenital Heart      Defects, Heart and Diabetes Centre North-Rhine Westfalia, Bad Oeynhausen,      Germany.FAU - Knyphausen, Edzard ZuAU  - Knyphausen EZFAU - Blanz, UteAU  - Blanz UFAU - Rofe, DanielaAU  - Rofe DFAU - Morshuis, MichielAU  - Morshuis MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart SurgJT  - World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgeryJID - 101518415OTO - NOTNLMOT  - BVADOT  - RVADOT  - TAH)OT  - cardiomyopathyOT  - circulatory assist devices (LVADOT  - heartOT  - heart failureOT  - transplantationEDAT- 2012/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2012/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/06/28 06:00AID - 3/1/72 [pii]AID - 10.1177/2150135111417459 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg. 2012 Jan 1;3(1):72-6. doi:      10.1177/2150135111417459.- 23804687own - nlmstat- pubmed-not-medlineda  - 20130627dcom- 20130628is  - 2150-136x (electronic)is  - 2150-1351 (linking)vi  - 3ip  - 1dp  - 2012 jan 1ti  - safety of long-term mechanical support with berlin heart excor in pediatric      patients.pg  - 72-6lid - 10.1177/2150135111417459 [doi]ab  - background. the berlin heart excor pediatrics is utilized at our center as a      bridge to transplantation or bridge to recovery. this retrospective study reviews      our results regarding the safety of long-term support and outcome. methods.      between january 2008 and december 2010, 12 patients (6 females and 6 males)      underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device. the median weight was 14.2      kg (range 4.2-51.6 kg) and the median age was 4.12 years (range 0.25-11.83      years). all patients were on inotropes, five patients required mechanical      ventilation and three patients experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation.      results. eight patients received a left ventricular assist device and four      patients received a biventricular assist device. of the 12 patients, 8 were      bridge to heart transplantation, in 2 patients explantation was possible, and 1      patient died on support. the median support time for these 11 patients was 151      days (range 4-488 days), with 2124 days of cardiac support. one patient is on      support. survival rate was 91.6%. seven patients had a blood pump change once.      four patients had local signs of infection. there was no mediastinitis and      thromboembolism. one patient had intracerebral hemorrhage. there was no death      after heart transplantation or after explantation of the device. conclusions. the      berlin heart excor is effective in bridging children of almost all ages and sizes      to cardiac transplantation or myocardial recovery. our experience proved that      long-term support is possible with a low rate of adverse events.fau - sandica, eugenau  - sandica ead  - department of surgery for congenital heart defects, center for congenital heart      defects, heart and diabetes centre north-rhine westfalia, bad oeynhausen,      germany.fau - knyphausen, edzard zuau  - knyphausen ezfau - blanz, uteau  - blanz ufau - rofe, danielaau  - rofe dfau - morshuis, michielau  - morshuis mla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - world j pediatr congenit heart surgjt  - world journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgeryjid - 101518415oto - notnlmot  - bvadot  - rvadot  - tah)ot  - cardiomyopathyot  - circulatory assist devices (lvadot  - heartot  - heart failureot  - transplantationedat- 2012/01/01 00:00mhda- 2012/01/01 00:01crdt- 2013/06/28 06:00aid - 3/1/72 [pii]aid - 10.1177/2150135111417459 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - world j pediatr congenit heart surg. 2012 jan 1;3(1):72-6. doi:      10.1177/2150135111417459.
