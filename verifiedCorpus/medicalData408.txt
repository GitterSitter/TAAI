Indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely with      the development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), and the      total artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with      end-stage heart failure awaiting for transplantation. However, the transplant      cannot be the only solution, due to an insufficient number of available donors,      but also because of the high number of patients who are not candidates for severe      comorbidities or advanced age. New perspectives are emerging in which the VAD is       no longer conceived only as a "Bridge to Transplant", but is now seen as a      destination therapy. In this review, the main VAD classification, current basic      indications, functioning modalities, main limitations of surgical VAD and the      total artificial heart development are described.FAU - La Franca, EluisaAU  - La Franca EAD  - Policlinico Universitario "Paolo Giaccone" Palermo. lajello@libero.it.FAU - Iacona, RosannaAU  - Iacona RFAU - Ajello, LauraAU  - Ajello LFAU - Sansone, AngelaAU  - Sansone AFAU - Caruso, MarcoAU  - Caruso MFAU - Assennato, PasqualeAU  - Assennato PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130514PL  - CanadaTA  - Glob J Health SciJT  - Global journal of health scienceJID - 101519495SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/methodsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/*classificationMH  - HumansMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2013/08/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/14 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/30 06:00PHST- 2013/04/07 [received]PHST- 2013/04/23 [accepted]PHST- 2013/05/06 [revised]AID - 10.5539/gjhs.v5n5p11 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Glob J Health Sci. 2013 May 14;5(5):11-9. doi: 10.5539/gjhs.v5n5p11.- 23985102own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130829dcom- 20131113is  - 1916-9736 (print)is  - 1916-9736 (linking)vi  - 5ip  - 5dp  - 2013 septi  - heart failure and mechanical circulatory assist devices.pg  - 11-9lid - 10.5539/gjhs.v5n5p11 [doi]ab  - during the last 20 years, the management of heart failure has significantly      improved by means of new pharmacotherapies, more timely invasive treatments and      device assisted therapies. indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely with      the development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (lvad), and the      total artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with      end-stage heart failure awaiting for transplantation. however, the transplant      cannot be the only solution, due to an insufficient number of available donors,      but also because of the high number of patients who are not candidates for severe      comorbidities or advanced age. new perspectives are emerging in which the vad is       no longer conceived only as a "bridge to transplant", but is now seen as a      destination therapy. in this review, the main vad classification, current basic      indications, functioning modalities, main limitations of surgical vad and the      total artificial heart development are described.fau - la franca, eluisaau  - la franca ead  - policlinico universitario "paolo giaccone" palermo. lajello@libero.it.fau - iacona, rosannaau  - iacona rfau - ajello, lauraau  - ajello lfau - sansone, angelaau  - sansone afau - caruso, marcoau  - caruso mfau - assennato, pasqualeau  - assennato pla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewdep - 20130514pl  - canadata  - glob j health scijt  - global journal of health sciencejid - 101519495sb  - immh  - equipment designmh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantation/methodsmh  - heart-assist devices/adverse effects/*classificationmh  - humansmh  - risk factorsmh  - time factorsedat- 2013/08/30 06:00mhda- 2013/11/14 06:00crdt- 2013/08/30 06:00phst- 2013/04/07 [received]phst- 2013/04/23 [accepted]phst- 2013/05/06 [revised]aid - 10.5539/gjhs.v5n5p11 [doi]pst - epublishso  - glob j health sci. 2013 may 14;5(5):11-9. doi: 10.5539/gjhs.v5n5p11.
