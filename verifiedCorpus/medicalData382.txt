Coexistent cardiac and renal       dysfunction (so-called cardiorenal syndrome) increases the risk of death, both      with advanced heart failure and after LVAD implantation. We analyzed patients      from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assist Circulatory Support to      better estimate postimplant mortality according to the severity of renal      dysfunction. METHODS: Patients with a continuous-flow LVAD were grouped according      to their pre-implant level of renal dysfunction: severe was defined as dialysis      and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min; moderate if eGFR       was 30 to 59 ml/min or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was > 60 mg/dl; and mild or no      renal dysfunction if eGFR was >/= 60 ml/min and BUN was < 60 mg/dl. RESULTS: Of      the 4,917 patients with a continuous-flow LVAD implanted between June 2006 and      March 2012, 3,160 (64%) were identified with mild or no renal dysfunction, 1,475       (30%) with moderate dysfunction, and 282 (6%) with severe dysfunction. Worsening       renal dysfunction correlated with decreased survival, with nearly a 20% reduction      in the 2-year survival going from low to severe dysfunction. The major negative      survival effect occurred during the first 3 months. Combination of severe renal      dysfunction and cardiogenic shock predicted the highest early mortality.      CONCLUSIONS: Pre-implant renal dysfunction predicts higher mortality after LVAD      implant. The progressive reduction in survival with higher grades of renal      dysfunction supports consideration of LVAD implant before cardiorenal syndrome is      advanced. For patients with severe renal dysfunction and other major      comorbidities, initial support with a temporary device while awaiting organ      recovery before implanting a durable pump could be considered.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Kirklin, James KAU  - Kirklin JKAD  - Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.
