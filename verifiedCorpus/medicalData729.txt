We investigated the trends and outcomes      for cardiac transplantation in recipients aged 70 years and older in the United      States. METHODS: De-identified data were provided by United Network of Organ      Sharing. Transplant recipients were grouped by age 60-69 years and 70 years and      older. Univariate comparisons were performed using Student's t-test or the      Pearson chi-square test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique       and compared with the log-rank test. Cox regression was used to determine      predictors of death after transplant. Statistical significance was assigned to p       < 0.05. RESULTS: Between January 1, 1998, and June 15, 2010, 5,807 sexagenarians       and 332 septuagenarians received allografts. The septuagenarian cohort had more      men, less diabetes, was less likely to have a ventricular assist device, and more      likely to be status II. Donors for septuagenarians were older and died more      frequently from intracranial hemorrhage. Median unadjusted survival was 9.8 years      for sexagenarians vs 8.5 years for septuagenarians (p = 0.003). There was no      difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular accident, length of stay, or      pacemaker need between groups. Septuagenarians were less likely to be treated for      rejection the first year (p = 0.001). Age was a multivariate predictor of death      (hazard ratio, 1.289; 95% confidence interval, 1.039-1.6; p = 0.021).      CONCLUSIONS: Selected septuagenarians with advanced heart failure can derive      great benefit from cardiac transplantation, although survival is inferior to that      of an immediately younger sexagenarian cohort. Most of the mortality risk is seen      in the first year after transplantation. A reduced incidence of rejection was      observed and warrants further study.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.
