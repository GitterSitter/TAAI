As more children are placed on       mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to transplant, the risk factors       for development of sensitization warrant further study. A single-center      retrospective review of 36 children who received MCS identified 22 patients      supported with either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (n = 15) or      ECMO-ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 7) with paired (pre-MCS/post-MCS) panel      reactive antibodies (PRA) or only negative post-MCS PRAs. Four patients (18%)      became sensitized post-MCS (one ECMO-only patient, three ECMO-VAD patients). No      difference was found between sensitized and nonsensitized patients in terms of      congenital heart disease versus primary cardiomyopathy (p = 0.096), duration of      MCS (38 days vs. 14 days, p = 0.233), or volume of blood product transfusions      (358.6 ml/kg vs. 612.7 ml/kg, p = not significant). By multivariable analysis,      the association of sensitization with older age at MCS (p = 0.076) and history of      homograft (p = 0.064) approached significance. Pediatric patients supported with       MCS are at low risk of developing HLA sensitization. Diagnosis, MCS duration, and      volume of transfused blood products do not appear to be associated with HLA      sensitization, but there is a suggestion of an association with older age at MCS       and history of a homograft.FAU - Hong, Borah JAU  - Hong BJAD  - From the *Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor      College of Medicine, Houston, Texas;
