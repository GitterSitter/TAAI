This may result in      aortic insufficiency (AI) leading to symptomatic heart failure. In patients with       AI at the time of LVAD implantation, repairing, or replacing the aortic valve is       advisable. We describe a patient who had a severe dilated cardiomyopathy and      moderate AI who underwent implantation of an LVAD and aortic valve replacement      with a bioprosthesis that subsequently developed commissural fusion which was      found at the time of heart transplantation. This case highlights the conundrum of      the management of AI in patients requiring LVAD support. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12541       (J Card Surg 2015;30:466-468).CI  - (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Doi, AtsuoAU  - Doi AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.FAU - Marasco, Silvana FAU  - Marasco SFFAU - McGiffin, David CAU  - McGiffin DCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20150326PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMEDAT- 2015/03/27 06:00MHDA- 2015/03/27 06:00CRDT- 2015/03/27 06:00PHST- 2015/03/26 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/jocs.12541 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2015 May;30(5):466-8. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12541.
