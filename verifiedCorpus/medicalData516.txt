This has to be      kept in mind when alternative therapies enter into our daily routine in treating       this patient population. However, the shortage of appropriate donor organs and      the expanding pool of patients waiting for heart transplantation have led to      growing interest in alternative strategies, particularly in left ventricular      assist device (LVAD) therapy. With growing clinical experience and continued      technical advances, continuous-flow pumps are evolving as a bridge to      transplantation or as a destination therapy for advanced heart failure.      Nevertheless, the importance of this new indication of chronic cardiac support      compared to heart transplantation is still completely open and the object of      controversial ongoing discussion. This review (1) describes the clinical use and       long-term outcome of a currently available miniaturized LVAD in the context to      the standard of care-heart transplantation, (2) provides an outlook of the      ongoing process of further optimization of LVADs, and (3) comments on the      challenges with assist devices as alternatives to transplantation with a 5-year      outlook.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Garbade, JensAU  - Garbade JAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Heart Center, University of Leipzig, Leipzig,      Germany. garbade@med.uni-leipzig.deFAU - Barten, Markus JAU  - Barten MJFAU - Bittner, Hartmuth BAU  - Bittner HBFAU - Mohr, Friedrich-WilhelmAU  - Mohr FWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130417PL  - United StatesTA  - Clin CardiolJT  - Clinical cardiologyJID - 7903272SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/surgery/*therapyMH  - *Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/mortalityMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Tissue Donors/supply & distributionMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Waiting ListsEDAT- 2013/04/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/13 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/19 06:00PHST- 2012/11/12 [received]PHST- 2013/03/03 [revised]PHST- 2013/04/17 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1002/clc.22124 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Cardiol. 2013 Jul;36(7):378-82. doi: 10.1002/clc.22124.
