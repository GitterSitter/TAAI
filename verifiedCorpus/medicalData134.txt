We aimed to assess the utility of the SHFM by validation      in patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for heart transplantation. METHODS: We      assessed the SHFM performance in 382 patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for      heart transplantation. Outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or      left ventricular assist device. Model discrimination and calibration were      assessed graphically and by formal tests. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 2.3      years, 195 events occurred. One-, 2-, and 3-year observed event-free survival was      77%, 62%, and 52%, and the observed to predicted event-free survival ratio was      0.89, 0.80, and 0.76. Calibration plots demonstrated results deviating from the      ideal calibration line at 1, 2, and 3 years. The SHFM score adequately assigned      patients in discrete risk strata, according to Kaplan-Meier estimated survival.      Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good      discrimination overall, which was slightly better for 1-year (area under the      curve [AUC] 0.774) compared with 2-year (AUC 0.742) and 3-year (AUC 0.728)      event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The SHFM has good discrimination but      underestimates risk of adverse outcomes in patients with CRT and/or ICD referred       for heart transplantation. The SHFM may be used to assess relative risk and      changes over time, but when assessing absolute percentage of event-free survival,      the overestimation of event-free survival should be accounted for.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Mosby, Inc.
