Renal       impairment can range from reversible ischemic damage to renal failure requiring      short- or long-term renal replacement therapy (2). Patients who require      mechanical circulatory support, such as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD),       as definitive treatment for congestive heart failure or as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation pose a unique challenge with respect to receiving dialysis,      because they experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality from infection in      the post-LVAD period (3-7). Acute dialysis access can pose an increased infection      risk. In this article, we present a patient who required renal replacement      therapy and a LVAD for management of acute-on-chronic cardiorenal syndrome while       awaiting heart transplantation. A literature review to determine whether      peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is superior for patients with profound      hemodynamic dysfunction and the need to minimize risk of infection did not offer       clear guidance about which modality is superior in patients with advanced      congestive heart failure. However, there is clear evidence of the superiority of       peritoneal dialysis in reducing the risk of systemic infection secondary to acute      dialysis access. Given the high risk of LVAD infection, we therefore conclude      that, to decrease mortality secondary to systemic infection, peritoneal dialysis       should strongly be considered in patients who require renal replacement therapy      before or after LVAD placement.FAU - Thomas, Bernadette AAU  - Thomas BAAD  - Nephrology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98125, USA.      bathomas@u.washington.eduFAU - Logar, Christine MAU  - Logar CMFAU - Anderson, Arthur EAU  - Anderson AELA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - Perit Dial IntJT  - Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for      Peritoneal DialysisJID - 8904033SB  - IMMH  - Cardio-Renal Syndrome/*therapyMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Peritoneal DialysisMH  - Renal DialysisMH  - Renal Insufficiency/*therapyMH  - Renal Replacement Therapy/methodsPMC - PMC3524848OID - NLM: PMC3524848EDAT- 2012/08/04 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/12 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/04 06:00AID - 32/4/386 [pii]AID - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Perit Dial Int. 2012 Jul-Aug;32(4):386-92. doi: 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076.- 22859837own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120803dcom- 20130611lr  - 20141105is  - 1718-4304 (electronic)is  - 0896-8608 (linking)vi  - 32ip  - 4dp  - 2012 jul-augti  - renal replacement therapy in congestive heart failure requiring left ventricular       assist device augmentation.pg  - 386-92lid - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076 [doi]ab  - "cardiorenal syndrome" is a term used to describe a dys-regulation of the heart      affecting the kidneys, or vice versa, in an acute or chronic manner (1,2). renal       impairment can range from reversible ischemic damage to renal failure requiring      short- or long-term renal replacement therapy (2). patients who require      mechanical circulatory support, such as a left ventricular assist device (lvad),       as definitive treatment for congestive heart failure or as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation pose a unique challenge with respect to receiving dialysis,      because they experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality from infection in      the post-lvad period (3-7). acute dialysis access can pose an increased infection      risk. in this article, we present a patient who required renal replacement      therapy and a lvad for management of acute-on-chronic cardiorenal syndrome while       awaiting heart transplantation. a literature review to determine whether      peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is superior for patients with profound      hemodynamic dysfunction and the need to minimize risk of infection did not offer       clear guidance about which modality is superior in patients with advanced      congestive heart failure. however, there is clear evidence of the superiority of       peritoneal dialysis in reducing the risk of systemic infection secondary to acute      dialysis access. given the high risk of lvad infection, we therefore conclude      that, to decrease mortality secondary to systemic infection, peritoneal dialysis       should strongly be considered in patients who require renal replacement therapy      before or after lvad placement.fau - thomas, bernadette aau  - thomas baad  - nephrology, university of washington, seattle, wa 98125, usa.      bathomas@u.washington.edufau - logar, christine mau  - logar cmfau - anderson, arthur eau  - anderson aela  - engpt  - case reportspt  - journal articlepl  - canadata  - perit dial intjt  - peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the international society for      peritoneal dialysisjid - 8904033sb  - immh  - cardio-renal syndrome/*therapymh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - *peritoneal dialysismh  - renal dialysismh  - renal insufficiency/*therapymh  - renal replacement therapy/methodspmc - pmc3524848oid - nlm: pmc3524848edat- 2012/08/04 06:00mhda- 2013/06/12 06:00crdt- 2012/08/04 06:00aid - 32/4/386 [pii]aid - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - perit dial int. 2012 jul-aug;32(4):386-92. doi: 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076.
