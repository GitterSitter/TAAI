Unloading of the heart with a left ventricular assist      device (LVAD) can lead to the reversal of many remodeling changes whose      underlying mechanisms are not yet completely known. Molecular analysis might play      a role in obtaining further insight into the regulatory mechanisms of this      process. A critical step in an RT-PCR study is the selection of reference genes      for data normalization. This study aimed to determine an optimal combination of      stably expressed reference genes in different regions of the human heart in order      to study the effects of LVAD implants on cardiac remodeling, and in particular to      check their reliability on the evaluation of pro-inflammatory cytokine      expression. DESIGN AND METHODS: We validated nine of the most commonly used      reference genes in human myocardium samples obtained at heart transplantation      from patients with LVAD implant (n=30 from a total of six patients) and from      heart transplant (HT from a total of seven patients) recipients as controls      (n=35). Samples from both left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles were analyzed. The       normalization strategy was tested by analyzing mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8 and       TNF-alpha, whose protein levels were measured by immunometric assay. RESULTS: The      most stable gene combinations changed according to the experimental groups (the      LVAD and HT groups and the different myocardial regions). Considering all the      cardiac samples as a whole, the three most stably expressed genes were PPIA,      RPL13A, and YWHAZ (M=0.70). Using the best normalization strategy, a significant       increase in IL-6, IL-8 mRNA expression was observed in LVAD samples compared to      HT (p<0.0001). Similar results were obtained by protein analysis. CONCLUSIONS:      Our results underline the importance of always selecting reference genes for the       specific system studied. The most appropriate normalization strategy is of      pivotal importance for understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with the      pathophysiology of HF, such as inflammation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
