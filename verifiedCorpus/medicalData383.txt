At the time of      LVAD implant, a large proportion of patients have pulmonary hypertension, right      ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). RV dysfunction      and TR can exacerbate renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy,      edema, and even prohibit isolated LVAD implant. Repairing TR mandates increased      cardiopulmonary bypass time and bicaval cannulation, which should be reserved for      the time of orthotopic heart transplantation. We hypothesized that CF LVAD      implant would improve pulmonary artery pressures, enhance RV function, and      minimize TR, obviating need for surgical tricuspid repair. METHODS: One hundred      fourteen continuous flow LVADs implanted from 2005 through 2011 at a single      center, with medical management of functional TR, were retrospectively analyzed.       Pulmonary artery pressures were measured immediately prior to and following LVAD       implant. RV function and TR were graded according to standard echocardiographic      criteria, prior to, immediately following, and long-term following LVAD. RESULTS:      There was a significant improvement in post-VAD mean pulmonary arterial pressures      (26.6 +/- 4.9 vs. 30.2 +/- 7.4 mmHg, p = 0.008) with equivalent loading pressures      (CVP = 12.0 +/- 4.0 vs. 12.1 +/- 5.1 p = NS). RV function significantly improved,      as noted by right ventricular stroke work index (7.04 +/- 2.60 vs. 6.05 +/- 2.54,      p = 0.02). There was an immediate improvement in TR grade and RV function      following LVAD implant, which was sustained long term. CONCLUSION: Continuous      flow LVAD implant improves pulmonary hypertension, RV function, and tricuspid      regurgitation. TR may be managed nonoperatively during CF LVAD implant.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Atluri, PavanAU  - Atluri PAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Perelman School of      Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.FAU - Fairman, Alexander SAU  - Fairman ASFAU - MacArthur, John WAU  - MacArthur JWFAU - Goldstone, Andrew BAU  - Goldstone ABFAU - Cohen, Jeffrey EAU  - Cohen JEFAU - Howard, Jessica LAU  - Howard JLFAU - Zalewski, Christyna MAU  - Zalewski CMFAU - Shudo, YasuhiroAU  - Shudo YFAU - Woo, Y JosephAU  - Woo YJLA  - engGR  - T32 HL007843/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130930PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Arterial PressureMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Ventricles/physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Hypertension, Pulmonary/*etiology/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - MaleMH  - Pulmonary Artery/physiopathologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/*etiology/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/*etiology/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Ventricular Function, RightPMC - PMC4111248MID - NIHMS575740OID - NLM: NIHMS575740OID - NLM: PMC4111248EDAT- 2013/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/19 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/15 06:00PHST- 2013/09/30 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/jocs.12214 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2013 Nov;28(6):770-5. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12214.
