METHODS: A cohort of 124 consecutive patients received ECMO for      refractory cardiogenic shock in our institution. Twenty-six of these were out of       hospital cardiac arrests and were excluded from this analysis. The median age was      43years, in the range of 11 to 73years. RESULTS: The median duration of ECMO      support was 4.5days. Mortality while supported by ECMO was 50% with a median      support time of 2days. Weaning from ECMO was achieved for 49 patients with the      following outcomes: cardiac recovery (60%), heart transplantation (26%), and VAD       implantation (14%). Median duration of support before weaning was 8days. Hospital      survival was 83%, 61.5% and 71% for cardiac recovery, heart transplantation and      VAD implantation, respectively. ECMO weaning was significantly improved in all      patients who had normalized their renal function, and when duration of      support>6days (HR: 4.255 [1.255-14.493], p=0.02 and HR: 2.164 [1.152-4.082],      p=0.02, respectively). A creatinine level>14mg/l the day of weaning was a      significant predictor of death (HR: 5.807 [1.089-30.953]; p=0.04). Median follow       up was 2.4years; one-year survival rate was 78%, 51% and 75% for cardiac      recovery, heart transplantation and VAD implantation, respectively. CONCLUSION:      With at least 6days of support, ECMO allowed a better patient selection for      myocardial recovery, VAD implantation or heart transplantation. Whether VAD      implantation or heart transplant in those patients is a better indication remains      to be evaluated.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
