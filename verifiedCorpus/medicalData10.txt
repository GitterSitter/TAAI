The scarcity of the gold      standard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.      For patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been of      great benefit on survival. To allow explantation of the assist device and obviate      heart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.      However, explant rates so far are low. Combining mechanical circulatory support      with regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might       give rise to improved long-term results. Although synergistic effects are      suggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in both      preclinical and clinical setting is lacking. This review focuses on advanced and       innovative strategies for the treatment of end-stage HF and furthermore appraises      clinical experience with combined strategies.FAU - Tseng, Cheyenne C SAU  - Tseng CCAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,      Utrecht , Netherlands ; Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands ,      Utrecht , Netherlands.FAU - Ramjankhan, Faiz ZAU  - Ramjankhan FZAD  - Department of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, Division Heart and Lungs, University      Medical Center , Utrecht , Netherlands.FAU - de Jonge, NicolaasAU  - de Jonge NAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,      Utrecht , Netherlands.FAU - Chamuleau, Steven A JAU  - Chamuleau SAAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,      Utrecht , Netherlands.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20150407PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Front SurgJT  - Frontiers in surgeryJID - 101645127PMC - PMC4387859OID - NLM: PMC4387859OTO - NOTNLMOT  - cardiac recoveryOT  - cell therapyOT  - heart failureOT  - mechanical circulatory supportOT  - regenerative therapiesOT  - ventricular-assist deviceEDAT- 2015/04/24 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/24 06:01CRDT- 2015/04/24 06:00PHST- 2015 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/11/02 [received]PHST- 2015/03/07 [accepted]PHST- 2015/04/07 [epublish]AID - 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Front Surg. 2015 Apr 7;2:10. doi: 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010. eCollection 2015.- 25905105own - nlmstat- pubmed-not-medlineda  - 20150423dcom- 20150423lr  - 20150427is  - 2296-875x (electronic)is  - 2296-875x (linking)vi  - 2dp  - 2015ti  - advanced strategies for end-stage heart failure: combining regenerative      approaches with lvad, a new horizon?pg  - 10lid - 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010 [doi]ab  - despite the improved treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the population with      end-stage heart failure (hf) is progressively growing. the scarcity of the gold      standard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.      for patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been of      great benefit on survival. to allow explantation of the assist device and obviate      heart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.      however, explant rates so far are low. combining mechanical circulatory support      with regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might       give rise to improved long-term results. although synergistic effects are      suggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in both      preclinical and clinical setting is lacking. this review focuses on advanced and       innovative strategies for the treatment of end-stage hf and furthermore appraises      clinical experience with combined strategies.fau - tseng, cheyenne c sau  - tseng ccad  - department of cardiology, division heart and lungs, university medical center ,      utrecht , netherlands ; interuniversity cardiology institute of the netherlands ,      utrecht , netherlands.fau - ramjankhan, faiz zau  - ramjankhan fzad  - department of cardio-thoracic surgery, division heart and lungs, university      medical center , utrecht , netherlands.fau - de jonge, nicolaasau  - de jonge nad  - department of cardiology, division heart and lungs, university medical center ,      utrecht , netherlands.fau - chamuleau, steven a jau  - chamuleau saad  - department of cardiology, division heart and lungs, university medical center ,      utrecht , netherlands.la  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewdep - 20150407pl  - switzerlandta  - front surgjt  - frontiers in surgeryjid - 101645127pmc - pmc4387859oid - nlm: pmc4387859oto - notnlmot  - cardiac recoveryot  - cell therapyot  - heart failureot  - mechanical circulatory supportot  - regenerative therapiesot  - ventricular-assist deviceedat- 2015/04/24 06:00mhda- 2015/04/24 06:01crdt- 2015/04/24 06:00phst- 2015 [ecollection]phst- 2014/11/02 [received]phst- 2015/03/07 [accepted]phst- 2015/04/07 [epublish]aid - 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010 [doi]pst - epublishso  - front surg. 2015 apr 7;2:10. doi: 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010. ecollection 2015.
