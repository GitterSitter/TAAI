METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a state-transition model to simulate 4      treatment options and associated morbidity and mortality. Transition      probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from published sources.      Calculated outcomes included survival, quality-adjusted life-years, and      incremental cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed on model      parameters to test robustness. Average life expectancy for OHT-eligible patients       is estimated at 1.1 years, with 39% surviving to 1 year. OHT with a median wait      time of 5.6 months is estimated to increase life expectancy to 8.5 years, and      costs <$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent      medical therapy. Bridge to transplant-LVAD followed by OHT further is estimated      to increase life expectancy to 12.3 years, for $226,000/quality-adjusted      life-year gained versus OHT. Among OHT-ineligible patients, mean life expectancy       with inotrope-dependent medical therapy is estimated at 9.4 months, with 26%      surviving to 1 year. Patients who instead received destination therapy-LVAD are      estimated to live 4.4 years on average from extrapolation of recent constant      hazard rates beyond the first year. This strategy costs $202,000/quality-adjusted      life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent medical therapy. Patient's age,       time on wait list, and costs associated with care influence outcomes.      CONCLUSIONS: Under most scenarios, OHT prolongs life and is cost effective in      eligible patients. Bridge to transplant-LVAD is estimated to offer >3.8      additional life-years for patients waiting >/=6 months, but does not meet      conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. Destination therapy-LVAD      significantly improves life expectancy in OHT-ineligible patients. However,      further reductions in adverse events or improved quality of life are needed for      destination therapy-LVAD to be cost effective.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Long, Elisa FAU  - Long EFAD  - From Decisions, Operations & Technology Management, UCLA Anderson School of      Management, Los Angeles, CA (E.F.L.); Department of Surgery, Icahn School of      Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (G.W.S.); and Section of Cardiac Surgery,      Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT (A.A.M.).FAU - Swain, Gary WAU  - Swain GWAD  - From Decisions, Operations & Technology Management, UCLA Anderson School of      Management, Los Angeles, CA (E.F.L.); Department of Surgery, Icahn School of      Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (G.W.S.); and Section of Cardiac Surgery,      Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT (A.A.M.).FAU - Mangi, Abeel AAU  - Mangi AAAD  - From Decisions, Operations & Technology Management, UCLA Anderson School of      Management, Los Angeles, CA (E.F.L.); Department of Surgery, Icahn School of      Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (G.W.S.); and Section of Cardiac Surgery,      Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT (A.A.M.).      abeel.mangi@yale.edu.LA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140221PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
