We report on our      two-center experience with MCS therapy. METHODS: Between January 2000 and      December 2012, 116 adult patients (mean age 56.8 +/- 9.9 years, range: 31 to 76      years) were primarily supported on temporary or long-term ventricular assist      devices (VADs) or total artificial hearts (TAHs) at our institutions. Temporary      extracorporeal radial VAD support was established in 50 patients (43.1%) (Group      A) whereas 66 (56.8%) patients received long-term paracorporeal and      intracorporeal VAD or TAH (Group B). LVAD support was established in 63 patients       (54.3%), with BVAD/TAH support in 29 (25%). A temporary CentriMag was the only      device adopted as an isolated RVAD support, being placed in 24 patients (20.6%).       RESULTS: In Group A, the overall mean support time was 10.2 +/- 6.6 days (range:       3 to 43 days) and the overall success rate was 55.1% (27 patients). The mean LVAD      support time was 357 +/- 352.3 days (range: 1 to 902 days) in Group B and 98 +/-       82.6 days (range: 8 to 832 days) in BVAD/TAH patients, with success rates of      72.5% (37 patients) and 46.6% (seven patients), respectively. The heart      transplantation (Htx) rate for both groups combined was 25.8% (n = 30). The      overall one- and five-year survival rates after Htx were 73.3% and 60%,      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When a decision to treat with VAD or TAH is made      early, either modality can be used as an alternative to Htx, affording comparable      early to mid-term outcomes.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Loforte, AntonioAU  - Loforte AAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation, S.
