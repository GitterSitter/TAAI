Advancements in the fields of immunosuppression, infection prophylaxis, and      surgical techniques have transformed heart transplantation from what was once      considered an experimental intervention into a routine treatment. The number of      heart transplants reported to the International Society of Heart and Lung      Transplantation registry worldwide has been 3,500-4,000 annually, but has not      been increased over the past 2 decades because of donor shortage despite the      growing number of patients with HF. This imbalance between the supply of donor      hearts and the demand of patients with endstage HF has led to increased use of      mechanical circulatory support as destination therapy, because the supply of      mechanical devices is virtually unlimited. Although mechanical circulatory      support technology is improving, heart transplantation remains the preferred      treatment for many patients because of major complications, such as stroke,      bleeding and infection, and because of limited quality of life related to the      driveline and the need for battery change. Therefore, significant efforts have      been made to maximize the number of heart transplants and to ensure good      outcomes.FAU - Toyoda, YoshiyaAU  - Toyoda YAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Temple University School of Medicine,      Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA. yoshiya.toyoda@tuhs.temple.eduFAU - Guy, T SloaneAU  - Guy TSFAU - Kashem, AbulAU  - Kashem ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130403PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683RN  - 0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)SB  - IMMH  - Bacterial Infections/prevention & controlMH  - Donor Selection/trendsMH  - ForecastingMH  - Graft Rejection/prevention & controlMH  - Graft SurvivalMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/standards/*trendsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/trendsMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic useMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Tissue Donors/supply & distributionMH  - Tissue and Organ Procurement/trendsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - United StatesMH  - Virus Diseases/prevention & controlEDAT- 2013/04/26 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/26 06:00PHST- 2013/04/03 [aheadofprint]AID - DN/JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-13-0296 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2013;77(5):1097-110.
