For      both transplant-eligible and noneligible patients, advances in mechanical      circulatory support have revolutionized the options for the management of      end-stage heart failure, and this technology continues to bring us closer to a      true alternative to heart transplantation. This review provides a perspective on       the past, present and future of mechanical circulatory support and addresses the       changes in technology, patient selection and management strategies needed to have      this therapy fully embraced by the heart failure community, and perhaps replace      heart transplantation either as the therapy of choice or as a strategy by which      to delay transplantation in younger patients.FAU - Moazami, NaderAU  - Moazami NAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Miller Family Heart and      Vascular Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. moazamn@ccf.orgFAU - Hoercher, Katherine JAU  - Hoercher KJFAU - Fukamachi, KiyotakaAU  - Fukamachi KFAU - Kobayashi, MarikoAU  - Kobayashi MFAU - Smedira, Nicholas GAU  - Smedira NGFAU - Massiello, AlexAU  - Massiello AFAU - Horvath, David JAU  - Horvath DJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Med DevicesJT  - Expert review of medical devicesJID - 101230445SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Equipment Failure AnalysisMH  - *ForecastingMH  - Heart Failure/*prevention & control/*rehabilitationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*trendsMH  - HumansMH  - Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*instrumentation/*trendsEDAT- 2013/01/03 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/03 06:00AID - 10.1586/erd.12.69 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2013 Jan;10(1):55-71. doi: 10.1586/erd.12.69.- 23278224own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130102dcom- 20130530is  - 1745-2422 (electronic)is  - 1743-4440 (linking)vi  - 10ip  - 1dp  - 2013 janti  - mechanical circulatory support for heart failure: past, present and a look at the      future.pg  - 55-71lid - 10.1586/erd.12.69 [doi]ab  - heart transplantation remains the gold standard for long-term cardiac      replacement, but a shortage of donor organs will always limit this option. for      both transplant-eligible and noneligible patients, advances in mechanical      circulatory support have revolutionized the options for the management of      end-stage heart failure, and this technology continues to bring us closer to a      true alternative to heart transplantation. this review provides a perspective on       the past, present and future of mechanical circulatory support and addresses the       changes in technology, patient selection and management strategies needed to have      this therapy fully embraced by the heart failure community, and perhaps replace      heart transplantation either as the therapy of choice or as a strategy by which      to delay transplantation in younger patients.fau - moazami, naderau  - moazami nad  - department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, miller family heart and      vascular institute, cleveland clinic, cleveland, oh 44195, usa. moazamn@ccf.orgfau - hoercher, katherine jau  - hoercher kjfau - fukamachi, kiyotakaau  - fukamachi kfau - kobayashi, marikoau  - kobayashi mfau - smedira, nicholas gau  - smedira ngfau - massiello, alexau  - massiello afau - horvath, david jau  - horvath djla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - englandta  - expert rev med devicesjt  - expert review of medical devicesjid - 101230445sb  - immh  - equipment designmh  - equipment failure analysismh  - *forecastingmh  - heart failure/*prevention & control/*rehabilitationmh  - heart-assist devices/*trendsmh  - humansmh  - therapy, computer-assisted/*instrumentation/*trendsedat- 2013/01/03 06:00mhda- 2013/06/01 06:00crdt- 2013/01/03 06:00aid - 10.1586/erd.12.69 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - expert rev med devices. 2013 jan;10(1):55-71. doi: 10.1586/erd.12.69.
