However, significant rates of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)       have been observed during CF-LVAD support. METHODS: From March 2006 through March      2011, 86 patients with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD       (HeartMate II; Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Records were reviewed to      determine the prevalence of post-implant GIB, location of the bleeding site and      associated morbidity and mortality. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted      to identify independent predictors of GIB. RESULTS: GIB occurred in 19 patients      (22.1%) with a duration of support that ranged from 5 to 456 days. Sources of GIB      included small bowel and rectum in 6 patients each, large bowel in 2 patients and      stomach in 1 patient. No definite source was identified in 4 patients. There were      no deaths referable to GIB. Recurrent GIB occurred in 4 patients. History of a      GIB prior to LVAD implant was the only variable significantly different between      patients with and without post-implant GIB (21.1% vs 10.4%, p = 0.016), and was      the only independent predictor of GIB (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 2.121 to 2.435, p =      0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent source of morbidity       for patients on HeartMate II LVAD support but does not significantly impact      survival. As implantation of CF-LVADs with non-pulsatile flow gains popularity      for both bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy, a better understanding of       the pathophysiology of GIB in these patients will be needed for minimizing this      complication.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
