We describe the use of this device to support       the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York Heart      Association class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustard      procedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. CASE REPORT: A      HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and      pulmonary edema. RESULTS: The patient's edema and acute kidney injury resolved      after device placement. She was discharged home and successfully underwent device      removal with heart transplant five months later. CONCLUSION: The HeartWare device      may be used for extended support as a systemic RV in a pediatric patient. It is      feasible to consider using the device in this patient population.CI  - (c) The Author(s) 2014.FAU - Kenleigh, DorianAU  - Kenleigh DAD  - University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA      dorian-kenleigh@uiowa.edu.FAU - Edens, R ErikAU  - Edens READ  - Stead Family Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa Children's Hospital,      Iowa City, IA, USA.FAU - Bates, Michael JAU  - Bates MJAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Ochsner Health System, New Orleans, LA,      USA.FAU - Turek, Joseph WAU  - Turek JWAD  - Division of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University of Iowa Children's Hospital,      Iowa City, IA, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart SurgJT  - World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgeryJID - 101518415SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - adult congenital heart diseaseOT  - arterial switch operationOT  - artificial organsOT  - circulatory assist devices (LVAD, RVAD, BVAD, TAH)OT  - circulatory hemodynamicsOT  - congenital heart diseaseOT  - congenital heart surgeryOT  - heartOT  - heart failureOT  - pediatricOT  - transplantationEDAT- 2015/04/15 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/15 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/15 06:00AID - 6/2/339 [pii]AID - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg. 2015 Apr;6(2):339-41. doi:      10.1177/2150135114563769.- 25870363own - nlmstat- in-data-reviewda  - 20150414is  - 2150-136x (electronic)is  - 2150-1351 (linking)vi  - 6ip  - 2dp  - 2015 aprti  - use of heartware ventricular assist system for systemic ventricular support of a       pediatric patient after mustard procedure.pg  - 339-41lid - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]ab  - background: the heartware ventricular assist system is indicated to provide      mechanical circulatory support of patients with intractable heart failure as a      bridge to cardiac transplantation. we describe the use of this device to support       the systemic right ventricle (rv) of a pediatric patient with new york heart      association class iiic congestive heart failure who had undergone mustard      procedure for d-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. case report: a      heartware ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and      pulmonary edema. results: the patient's edema and acute kidney injury resolved      after device placement. she was discharged home and successfully underwent device      removal with heart transplant five months later. conclusion: the heartware device      may be used for extended support as a systemic rv in a pediatric patient. it is      feasible to consider using the device in this patient population.ci  - (c) the author(s) 2014.fau - kenleigh, dorianau  - kenleigh dad  - university of iowa carver college of medicine, iowa city, ia, usa      dorian-kenleigh@uiowa.edu.fau - edens, r erikau  - edens read  - stead family department of pediatrics, university of iowa children's hospital,      iowa city, ia, usa.fau - bates, michael jau  - bates mjad  - department of cardiothoracic surgery, ochsner health system, new orleans, la,      usa.fau - turek, joseph wau  - turek jwad  - division of pediatric cardiac surgery, university of iowa children's hospital,      iowa city, ia, usa.la  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - world j pediatr congenit heart surgjt  - world journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgeryjid - 101518415sb  - imoto - notnlmot  - adult congenital heart diseaseot  - arterial switch operationot  - artificial organsot  - circulatory assist devices (lvad, rvad, bvad, tah)ot  - circulatory hemodynamicsot  - congenital heart diseaseot  - congenital heart surgeryot  - heartot  - heart failureot  - pediatricot  - transplantationedat- 2015/04/15 06:00mhda- 2015/04/15 06:00crdt- 2015/04/15 06:00aid - 6/2/339 [pii]aid - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - world j pediatr congenit heart surg. 2015 apr;6(2):339-41. doi:      10.1177/2150135114563769.
