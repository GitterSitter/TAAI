The CUPID 2 (Calcium Up-Regulation by Percutaneous      Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease Phase 2b) trial is designed to       evaluate whether increasing SERCA2a activity via gene therapy improves clinical      outcome in these patients. BACKGROUND: Intracoronary delivery of recombinant      adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1)/SERCA2a improves intracellular Ca(2+)      handling by increasing SERCA2a protein levels and, as a consequence, restores      systolic and diastolic function. In a previous phase 2a trial, this therapy      improved symptoms, functional status, biomarkers, and left ventricular function,       and reduced cardiovascular events in advanced heart failure patients. METHODS:      CUPID 2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational,      multicenter, randomized event-driven study in up to 250 patients with      moderate-to-severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New York      Heart Association functional class II to IV symptoms despite optimal therapy.      Enrolled patients will be at high risk for recurrent heart-failure      hospitalizations by virtue of having elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic      peptide/BNP (>1,200 pg/ml, or >1,600 pg/ml if atrial fibrillation is present)      and/or recent heart failure hospitalization. The primary endpoint of      time-to-recurrent event (heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence      of terminal events [all-cause death, heart transplant, left ventricular assist      device implantation or ambulatory worsening heart failure]) will be assessed      using the joint frailty model. This ongoing trial is expected to complete      recruitment in 2014, with the required number of 186 recurrent events estimated      to occur by mid 2015. RESULTS: Available data indicate that calcium up-regulation      by AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy is safe and of potential benefit in advanced heart      failure patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CUPID 2 trial is designed to study the effects      of this therapy on clinical outcome in these patients.
