We report our single-center experience with      mechanical circulatory support therapy. METHODS: From March 2002 to December      2012, 107 adult patients (mean age, 56.8 +/- 9.9 y; range, 31-76 y) were primarly      supported on temporary or long-term VAD or TAH support as treatment for      refractory heart failure at our institution. Temporary extracorporeal radial VAD       support (group A) was established in 49 patients (45.7%), and long-term      paracorporeal and intracorporeal VAD or TAH (group B) in 58 patients (54.2%).      Left ventricular (LVAD) support was established in 55 patients (51.4%; n = 33,      Heartmate II; n = 6, Heartmate I XVE; n = 4, Heartware HVAD; and n = 12,      Centrimag) and biventricular (BVAD/TAH) support (group B) in 28 patients (26.1%;       n = 10, Thoratec paracorporeal; n = 2, Heartware HVAD, n = 1, Thoratec      implantable; n = 1, Syncardia TAH; and n = 14, Centrimag). The temporary      Centrimag was the only device adopted as isolated right ventricular (RVAD)      support, and it was inserted in 24 patients (22.4%). RESULTS: In group A, overall      mean support time was 10.2 +/- 6.6 days (range, 3-43 d). In group B, LVAD mean      support time was 357 +/- 352.3 days (range, 1-902 d) and BVAD/TAH support time      was 98 +/- 82.6 days (range, 8-832 d). In group A, the overall success rate was      55.1% (27 patients). In group B, LVAD overall success rate was 74.4% (32      patients) and BVAD/TAH success rate was 50% (7 patients). Overall heart      transplantation rate for both groups was 27.1% (n = 2, group A; n = 27, group B).      Overall 1-year and 5-year survivals after heart transplantation were 72.4% (n =      21) and 58.6% (n = 17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical circulatory support      is an effective strategy even in cases of end-stage heart failure according to      our experience. Further improvement of VAD and TAH technologies may support their      adoption as an encouraging alternative to heart transplantation in the near      future.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
