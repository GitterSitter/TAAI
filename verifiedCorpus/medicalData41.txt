Because very few data exist examining the influence of significant      pre-operative MR on outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      implantation, we evaluate our experience. METHODS: Between October 1996 and      August 2013, 756 patients underwent primary LVAD implantation at our      institutions. Of these, 508 patients received a continuous-flow LVAD and      represent the contemporary cohort for this analysis. Devices implanted included      the HeartMate II in 410 patients (81%) and HeartWare HVAD in 98 patients (19%).      Based on availability of pre-operative echocardiography, 491 patients were      divided into 2 study groups according to degree of pre-operative MR; 189 patients      (39%) had moderate to severe or greater MR (MR group), and 302 (61%) had less      than moderate to severe MR (less MR group). Median age at operation (60 years in       MR group vs 58 years in less MR group, p = 0.19), male sex (78% in MR group vs      81% in less MR group, p = 0.42), and ischemic etiology (46% in MR group vs 51% in      less MR group, p = 0.35) were similar between groups. RESULTS: There were 40      early deaths (7.9%), and follow-up was available in all 468 early survivors for      641 patient-years of support. Patients in the MR group had higher late survival      (2 years, 75%; 4 years, 65%) compared with patients in the less MR group (2      years, 66%; 4 years, 48%; p < 0.04). Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the      independent interaction between MR and late survival (hazard ratio 0.62, p =      0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was improved survival in patients with severe      pre-operative MR after continuous-flow LVAD implantation in our cohort. These      findings may lend insight into the possible lack of value of addressing      significant MR at the time of LVAD implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
