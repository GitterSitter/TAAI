Despite a      thorough search in that study, no mitoses explaining a potential net increase of       cardiomyocytes has been observed. The heart harbors several stem cell      populations, including c-kit (CD117)(+) stem cells and side population cells      (SPC), which may proliferate after unloading and thus contribute to the      generation of diploid cardiomyocytes. In this study we sought to determine,      whether there is an increase of ABCG2(+) SPC and CD117(+) stem cells after      unloading. METHODS: In paired myocardial samples (prior to and after LVAD), the      number of cells with immunoexpression of ABCG2, c-kit/CD117 and MEF-2 was      assessed by immunohistochemistry. Their number was morphometrically determined      and these data were correlated with the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. RESULTS:       A significant increase of SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2      after unloading was observed from 0.00013% in CHF to 0.0011%, and 0.013% to      0.035%, respectively after unloading (p = 0.001). A significant positive      correlation between both SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2      expression was observed (p = 0.007 and 0.01). No correlation was found between      the number of SPC and the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. CONCLUSIONS: SPC are      increased significantly in the myocardium after ventricular unloading, suggesting      a role for stem cell proliferation during "reverse cardiac remodeling." These      cells might proliferate and commit to different cell lineages, such as      cardiomyocytes or endothelium, and thus ameliorate cardiac function.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
