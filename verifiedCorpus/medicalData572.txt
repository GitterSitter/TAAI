However, data on long-term post-transplant      survival for these patients are limited. We evaluated the effect of      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices on postcardiac transplant      survival in the current era. METHODS: All patients who received a continuous-flow      left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant at a single center from       June 2005 to September 2011 were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 167 patients who      received a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device as a bridge to      transplant, 77 (46%) underwent cardiac transplantation, 27 died before      transplantation (16%), and 63 (38%) remain listed for transplantation and      continued with left ventricular assist device support. The mean age of the      transplanted patients was 54.5 +/- 11.9 years, 57% had an ischemic etiology, and       20% were women. The overall mean duration of left ventricular assist device      support before transplantation was 310 +/- 227 days (range, 67-1230 days). The      mean duration of left ventricular assist device support did not change in      patients who had received a left ventricular assist device in the early period of      the study (2005-2008, n = 62) compared with those who had received a left      ventricular assist device later (2009-2011, n = 78, 373 vs 392 days, P = NS). In       addition, no difference was seen in survival between those patients supported      with a left ventricular assist device for fewer than 180 days or longer than 180       days before transplantation (P = NS). The actuarial survival after      transplantation at 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis was      98.7%, 93.0%, 91.1%, and 88.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The short- and      long-term post-transplant survival for patients bridged with a continuous-flow      left ventricular assist device in the current era has been excellent.      Furthermore, the duration of left ventricular assist device support did not      affect post-transplant survival. The hemodynamic benefits of ventricular      unloading with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices, in addition to      their durability and reduced patient morbidity, have contributed to improved      post-transplant survival.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013.
