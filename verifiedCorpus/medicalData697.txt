Parents may      feel overwhelmed with the VAD regimes responsibility and be affected from this      process beside children. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the depressive and      anxiety symptoms of mothers of the first eight children equipped with a VAD in      Turkey. The mothers of eight pediatric patients living with VADs were filled BDI       and STAI at first month of VAD implantation (E.I) and secondly six months after      their first evaluation (E.II). In E.I, the BDI mean score of mothers was 20.87,      in E.II 14.37. STAI-S mean score was 53.37 in E.I and 43.62 in E.II. The Wilcoxon      nonparametric-paired t-test revealed significant difference between baseline and       end-point STAI-S scores (Z: -2.035; p: 0.042), and for BDI scores (Z, -1.965; p,       0.049). Prolonged usage of VAD may increase distress in parents. Psychiatric      evaluation and support of the primary caregiver is important for the well-being      of the pediatric patients.CI  - (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Ozbaran, BurcuAU  - Ozbaran BAD  - Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department, Medical Faculty, Ege University,      Izmir, Turkey. burcu.ozbaran@ege.edu.trFAU - Kose, SezenAU  - Kose SFAU - Yagdi, TahirAU  - Yagdi TFAU - Engin, CagatayAU  - Engin CFAU - Erermis, SerpilAU  - Erermis SFAU - Yazici, Kemal UtkuAU  - Yazici KUFAU - Noyan, AysinAU  - Noyan AFAU - Ozbaran, MustafaAU  - Ozbaran MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120705PL  - DenmarkTA  - Pediatr TransplantJT  - Pediatric transplantationJID - 9802574SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anxiety/*diagnosisMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Depression/*diagnosisMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - Mothers/*psychologyMH  - Psychiatric Status Rating ScalesMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - TurkeyEDAT- 2012/07/07 06:00MHDA- 2013/02/21 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/07 06:00PHST- 2012/07/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2012.01755.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Transplant. 2012 Nov;16(7):766-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2012.01755.x.
