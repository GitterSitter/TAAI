We sought to evaluate the relationship between      serial measurements of functional MR and reverse remodeling and outcomes in      patients undergoing CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 266 consecutive patients      undergoing CRT with available baseline echocardiograms and subsequent clinical      and echocardiographic follow-up were included in the analysis. Long-term      follow-up included all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, and implantation      of a left ventricular (LV) assist device. Temporal changes in MR severity and LV       end-systolic volume index (LVESVi) were evaluated by linear mixed-model analysis.      CRT led to an immediate sustained decrease in MR (P<0.0001), with no significant       subsequent change. The amount of MR decrease correlated with a greater decrease      in LVESVi late (P</=0.0001), but not early (P=0.14), after CRT began. Patients      with severe MR before CRT experienced a larger LVESVi decrease (P=0.005).      Although baseline MR severity was not associated with adverse events (P=0.13), a       larger MR decrease (P=0.001) and a smaller residual MR after the initial 6 months      of CRT (P=0.03) were predictive of better outcome in a multivariable model.      CONCLUSIONS: Early reversal of functional MR was associated with reverse cardiac       remodeling and improved outcomes. Patients with moderately severe to severe MR      before CRT experienced relatively more reverse remodeling than patients with      lesser degrees of MR.FAU - Verhaert, DavidAU  - Verhaert DAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195,      USA.FAU - Popovic, Zoran BAU  - Popovic ZBFAU - De, SabeAU  - De SFAU - Puntawangkoon, ChirapaAU  - Puntawangkoon CFAU - Wolski, KathyAU  - Wolski KFAU - Wilkoff, Bruce LAU  - Wilkoff BLFAU - Starling, Randall CAU  - Starling RCFAU - Tang, W H WilsonAU  - Tang WHFAU - Thomas, James DAU  - Thomas JDFAU - Griffin, Brian PAU  - Griffin BPFAU - Grimm, Richard AAU  - Grimm RALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20111102PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Cardiovasc ImagingJT  - Circulation.
