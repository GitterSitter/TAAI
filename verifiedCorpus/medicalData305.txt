Survival      analysis of the United Network of Organ Sharing database.PG  - 1364-71; discussion 1371-2LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.10.077 [doi]LID - S0003-4975(13)02402-8 [pii]AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved outcomes as well as lack of donor hearts have increased the       use of ventricular assist devices (VADs), rather than inotropic support, for      bridging to transplantation. Recognizing that organ allocation in the highest      status patients remains controversial, we sought to compare outcomes of patients       with VADs and those receiving advanced medical therapy. METHODS: The United      Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to compare survival on the      waiting list and posttransplantation survival in status 1A heart transplantation       patients receiving VADs or high-dose/dual inotropic therapy or an intraaortic      balloon pump( IABP), or both. Adjusted survival was calculated using Cox's      proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Adjusted 1-year posttransplantation mortality      was higher among patients with VADs compared with patients receiving inotropic      agents alone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; p<0.05). Survival remained better for      patients receiving inotropic agents alone in the post-2008 era (HR, 1.36; p=0.03)      and among those with isolated left-sided support (HR, 1.33; p=0.008). When      patients who received IABPs were added and analyzed after 2008, the left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) group had similar survival (HR, 1.2; p=0.3).      Survival on the waiting list, however, was superior among patients with LVADs      (HR, 0.56; p<0.05). In a therapy transition analysis, failure of inotropic agents      and the need for LVAD support was a consistent marker for significantly worse      mortality (HR, 1.7; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although posttransplantation survival      is better for patients who are bridged to transplantation with inotropic      treatment only, the cost of failure of inotropic agents is significant, with a      nearly doubled mortality for those who later require VAD support. Survival on the      waiting list appears to be improved among patients receiving VAD support. Careful      selection of the appropriate bridging strategy continues to be a significant      clinical challenge.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
