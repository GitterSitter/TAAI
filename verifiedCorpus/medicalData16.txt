VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of       life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of our      pediatric patients while supported with a VAD. DESIGN: In this prospective study,      pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement, and their parents, were      administered a generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then      periodically until heart transplant or death. Their final scores while on support      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.      RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VAD      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was       10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.      Eleven (85%) patients survived to transplant with one (8%) patient remaining      alive on support. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was       1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total      and physical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups.      Self-reported psychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy      controls only. Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all      three comparison groups for all three categories (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A large       deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patients supported by a VAD compared      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant      patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group with more severe heart      failure. Improvements in QoL must be made, as time spent with a VAD will likely      continue to increase.CI  - (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Miller, Jacob RAU  - Miller JRAD  - Section of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of      Medicine, St. Louis, Mo, USA.FAU - Boston, Umar SAU  - Boston USFAU - Epstein, Deirdre JAU  - Epstein DJFAU - Henn, Matthew CAU  - Henn MCFAU - Lawrance, Christopher PAU  - Lawrance CPFAU - Kallenbach, JacobAU  - Kallenbach JFAU - Simpson, Kathleen EAU  - Simpson KEFAU - Canter, Charles EAU  - Canter CEFAU - Eghtesady, PiroozAU  - Eghtesady PLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150410TA  - Congenit Heart DisJT  - Congenital heart diseaseJID - 101256510OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart FailureOT  - PediatricOT  - Quality of LifeOT  - Ventricular Assist DeviceEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00PHST- 2015/03/16 [accepted]AID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Congenit Heart Dis. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.- 25864509own - nlmstat- publisherda  - 20150413lr  - 20150414is  - 1747-0803 (electronic)is  - 1747-079x (linking)dp  - 2015 apr 10ti  - pediatric quality of life while supported with a ventricular assist device.lid - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]ab  - objective: ventricular assist devices (vads) have emerged as an important      treatment option for bridging pediatric patients with heart failure to      transplant. vads have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of       life (qol) while on vad support is unknown. we aimed to evaluate the qol of our      pediatric patients while supported with a vad. design: in this prospective study,      pediatric patients who underwent vad placement, and their parents, were      administered a generic pediatric quality of life inventory (pedsql) 4.0 pre-vad      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then      periodically until heart transplant or death. their final scores while on support      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.      results: from january 2008 to july 2014, 13 pediatric patients required vad      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a pedsql. the mean age at implant was       10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.      eleven (85%) patients survived to transplant with one (8%) patient remaining      alive on support. the median duration of support prior to their final pedsql was       1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. patients self-reported significantly (p < .05) lower total      and physical qol scores when compared with all three comparison groups.      self-reported psychosocial qol scores were significantly lower than healthy      controls only. parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all      three comparison groups for all three categories (p < .05). conclusions: a large       deficit exists in the total qol of pediatric patients supported by a vad compared      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant      patients; however, vad patients do represent a group with more severe heart      failure. improvements in qol must be made, as time spent with a vad will likely      continue to increase.ci  - (c) 2015 wiley periodicals, inc.fau - miller, jacob rau  - miller jrad  - section of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery, washington university school of      medicine, st. louis, mo, usa.fau - boston, umar sau  - boston usfau - epstein, deirdre jau  - epstein djfau - henn, matthew cau  - henn mcfau - lawrance, christopher pau  - lawrance cpfau - kallenbach, jacobau  - kallenbach jfau - simpson, kathleen eau  - simpson kefau - canter, charles eau  - canter cefau - eghtesady, piroozau  - eghtesady pla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20150410ta  - congenit heart disjt  - congenital heart diseasejid - 101256510oto - notnlmot  - heart failureot  - pediatricot  - quality of lifeot  - ventricular assist deviceedat- 2015/04/14 06:00mhda- 2015/04/14 06:00crdt- 2015/04/14 06:00phst- 2015/03/16 [accepted]aid - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]pst - aheadofprintso  - congenit heart dis. 2015 apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.
