We report on our experience using a different technique of RVAD implantation that      does not necessitate resternotomy at the time of RVAD removal. METHODS: Patients       with perioperative RVF who underwent temporary RVAD implantation between January       2010 and February 2014 were reviewed. A dacron graft was attached to the      pulmonary artery and passed through a subxiphoid exit, where the RVAD outflow      cannula was inserted. The inflow cannula was percutaneously cannulated in the      femoral vein, and the sternum was primarily closed. On the day of RVAD      explantation, the outflow graft of the RVAD was pulled and ligated, and the      insertion site was secondarily closed. The RVAD inflow cannula was removed, and      direct pressure was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (age 58 +/- 14 years)      were supported. Seventeen patients (81%) had RVF after left ventricular assist      device implantation, and 4 patients developed postcardiotomy RVF. The median      duration of RVAD support was 9 days (range: 2-88 days). Eleven patients (52%)      were successfully weaned from the RVAD. Two patients were bridged to      transplantation. Eight patients died on left ventricular assist device and/or      RVAD support. The survival rates to discharge or heart transplantation, and to      1-year, were 62% and 52%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No technical issues were      encountered in this large series of RVAD implantations using the described      technique for various forms of postoperative RVF. Extended support duration and      reduction of resternotomy risks may be the main advantages of this technique      compared with conventional RVAD implantation methods.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
