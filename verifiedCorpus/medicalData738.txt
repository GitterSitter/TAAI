We used alternate approaches of       intra-aortic balloon pump insertion to provide temporary and minimally invasive      support for patients with decompensating, end-stage heart failure. The present      study describes the outcomes with closed-chest, transthoracic intra-aortic      balloon pumps by way of the subclavian artery. METHODS: During a 3-year period,      20 patients underwent subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump in the setting       of end-stage heart failure. The balloon was inserted through a      polytetrafluoroethylene graft sutured to the right subclavian artery in 19      patients (95%) and to the left subclavian artery in 1 patient (5%). The goal of      support was to bridge to transplantation in 17 patients (85%) and bridge to      recovery in 3 patients (15%). The primary outcome measure was death during      subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump support. The secondary outcomes      included survival to the intended endpoint of bridge to transplantation/bridge to      recovery, complications during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump      support (eg, stroke, limb ischemia, brachial plexus injury, dissection, bleeding       requiring reoperation, and device-related infection), emergent surgery for      worsening heart failure, and ambulation during intra-aortic balloon pump support.      RESULTS: The duration of balloon support ranged from 3 to 48 days (mean, 17.3 +/-      13.1 days). No patients died during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump      support. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) were successfully bridged to transplant or       left ventricular-assist device. Two patients (10%) required emergent left      ventricular-assist device for worsening heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: An      intra-aortic balloon pump inserted through the subclavian artery is a simple,      minimally invasive approach to mechanical support and is associated with limited       morbidity and facilitates ambulation in patients with end-stage heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
