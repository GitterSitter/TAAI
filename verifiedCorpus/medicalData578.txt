One of the most promising       new alternatives to heart transplantation is use of ventricular assist devices      (VADs). To date, there are no guidelines for appropriate selection for use of      these devices that are approved by national societies in the field. This review      addresses all of the general criteria for clinicians to keep in mind regarding      when to refer a patient for evaluation and the specific issues addressed in      patient selection. The field of mechanical circulatory support has advanced      significantly over the past 10 years, resulting in rapid expansion of patients      with advanced heart failure who can benefit from implantable devices. With      progress of technology, limitations associated with age, body size, and      comorbidities gradually become less prohibitive. The continuing simplification of      design along with continued reduction in size of the devices, plus eventual      elimination of the external drive line will make the use of VADs a superior      option to heart transplant and even to medical management in many patients. We      anticipate that the patient selection process outlined in the present review will      continue to shift toward less advanced cases of heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
