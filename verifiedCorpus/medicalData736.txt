Improvements in device design and availability have led to increased      short-, medium-, and long-term support options for pediatric patients with heart       failure. Most pediatric mechanical circulatory support is utilized as a bridge to      transplant and as a bridge to recovery in patients with temporary etiologies of      heart failure (i.e., myocarditis). Described herein is our recovery program, and       we report our experience as an independent pediatric ventricular assist device      program with an intracorporeal continuous-flow device employed as an      out-of-hospital bridge to recovery for a child with end-stage chronic heart      failure.CI  - (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Lowry, Adam WAU  - Lowry AWAD  - Department of Pediatrics, Lillie Frank Abercrombie Section of Pediatric      Cardiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX      77054, USA. lowry@bcm.eduFAU - Adachi, IkiAU  - Adachi IFAU - Gregoric, Igor DAU  - Gregoric IDFAU - Jeewa, AamirAU  - Jeewa AFAU - Morales, David L SAU  - Morales DLLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120427PL  - United StatesTA  - Congenit Heart DisJT  - Congenital heart diseaseJID - 101256510SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/physiopathology/surgery/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftEDAT- 2012/04/28 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/11 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/28 06:00PHST- 2012/04/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1747-0803.2012.00659.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Congenit Heart Dis. 2012 Nov-Dec;7(6):E91-6. doi:      10.1111/j.1747-0803.2012.00659.x.
