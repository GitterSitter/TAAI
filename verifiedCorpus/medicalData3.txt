Little is known      about the incidence and clinical significance of late RHF during LVAD support.      METHODS: Between May 2004 and December 2013, 336 patients underwent      continuous-flow LVAD implantation. Of these, 293 patients (87%) discharged with      isolated LVAD support were included in this study. Late RHF was defined as HF      requiring re-admission and medical or surgical intervention after initial      surgery. RESULTS: Late RHF occurred in 33 patients (11%) at a median of 99 days      after discharge (range 19 to 1,357 days). Freedom from late RHF rates were 87%,      84% and 79% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. RHF recurred in 15 patients. Three      patients required right ventricular assist device insertion. Univariable Cox      proportional hazards regression model showed diabetes mellitus (HR 2.05, 95% CI      1.03 to 4.06, p = 0.04), body mass index >29 (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.94, p =      0.01) and blood urea nitrogen level >41 mg/dl (HR 2.19; 95% CI 1.10 to 4.36; p =       0.025) as significant predictors for late RHF. Estimated on-device survival rates      at 2 years were 73% in the RHF group and 82% in the non-RHF group (p = 0.20).      However, overall survival at 2 years was significantly worse in patients who      developed late RHF (60% vs 85%, p = 0.016). This reduction was mostly attributed       to worse overall outcomes in the bridge-to-transplant (BTT) population.      CONCLUSIONS: Late RHF is common after continuous-flow LVAD implantation, but does      not affect survival during LVAD support. However, it is associated with worse      overall outcomes in the BTT population.CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Takeda, KojiAU  - Takeda KAD  - Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery Columbia University      Medical Center, New York, New York.
