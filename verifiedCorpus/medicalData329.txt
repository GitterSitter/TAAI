The question addressed was: Can the temporary use of right ventricular       assist devices (RVADs) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute right      ventricular failure after cardiac surgery? More than 183 papers were found using       the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer the      clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient      group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are      tabulated. Indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass       surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assist      device insertion. Significant reductions in central venous pressure (P = 0.005)      and mean pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.01) were reported during and after      RVAD support. Furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (P <      0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05), right ventricular stroke      work (P < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (P < 0.05) were also      seen. Assessment by one study showed that on Day 7 after RVAD removal, the right       ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40%. Dynamic      echocardiography studies performed before, during and after RVAD placement      demonstrated that after RVAD implantation, right ventricular end-diastolic      dimensions (P < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (P < 0.05) and right       ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) increased. Although several studies      successfully weaned patients from an RVAD, there were several complications,      including bleeding requiring surgical intervention. However, this may be reduced       by using percutaneous implantation (bleeding incidence: 4 of 9 patients) rather      than by a surgically implanted RVAD (bleeding incidence: 5 of 5 patients).      However, mortality is higher in percutaneous RVAD patients rather than in      surgical RVAD (80-44%) patients. Causes of death cited for patients on an RVAD      included multiorgan failure, sepsis, thromboembolic events, reoccurring right      heart failure and failure to wean due to persistent right ventricular failure. We      conclude that RVADs have been successfully used to bridge patients to recovery      after cardiac surgery; however, RVADs carry numerous risks and a high mortality      rate.FAU - Lang, Sommer AAU  - Lang SAAD  - School of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.FAU - O'Neill, BridieAU  - O'Neill BFAU - Waterworth, PaulAU  - Waterworth PFAU - Bilal, HarisAU  - Bilal HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20131225PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - BenchmarkingMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects/mortalityMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction,      Right/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Ventricular Function, RightPMC - PMC3957279OID - NLM: PMC3957279OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart assist devicesOT  - ReviewOT  - Ventricular dysfunction, rightEDAT- 2013/12/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/28 06:00PHST- 2013/12/25 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt472 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt472 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2014 Apr;18(4):499-510. doi:      10.1093/icvts/ivt472.
