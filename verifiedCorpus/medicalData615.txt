It is       unknown whether the use of short-term VAD support in patients with cardiogenic      shock affects HTx outcome. We sought to investigate long-term outcomes of HU      transplanted patients with VAD compared with HU transplanted patients without      device support. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all HTx patients      transplanted between 1999 and 2011 in our institution. Patients were categorized       by urgency: elective HTx, HU-HTx with VAD (status 0), and HU-HTx without VAD      (status 1). Actuarial survival rates were compared. RESULTS: Of 237 transplanted       patients, 55 (23%) were HU-HTx, including 16 on VAD support and 39 without VAD.      Mean time in the HU waiting list was 6.5 +/- 6 days and mean VAD support was 8.4       +/- 8 days (range, 1 to 31 days). Assist devices used were Levitronix Centrimag      (6), Abiomed (9), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (1). After a      mean follow-up of 4.6 +/- 4.1 years (range 0 to 13 years), 22 patients had died:       5 VAD and 17 non-VAD. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 73% and 61% for the      VAD and 74% and 62% for the non-VAD group, respectively (P = ns). Kaplan-Meier      and Cox regression analyses did not show survival differences, HR 1.11 (95% CI      0.41-3.02), P = 0.84. The presence of renal failure was associated with increased      mortality risk, HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2), P = 0.02. The presence of renal failure       was associated with increased mortality risk [HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2), P = .02.).      CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the long-term outcome of patients receiving      HU-HTx under short-term VAD support is comparable to that of patients undergoing       HU-HTx without VAD support. Patients with renal failure had an increased risk for      overall mortality in this set of patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
