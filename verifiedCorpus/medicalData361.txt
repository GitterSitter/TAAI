Survival at one year after placement of a left ventricular assist      device exceeds 80%. MCS and transplant have developed in counterpoint to each      other. Patients with HF now have a meaningful option for lifelong support even if      they are not candidates for heart transplant. As the profiles of MCS recipients      change and the next generation of devices emerges, new challenges and      opportunities await physicians caring for patients with cardiac failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
