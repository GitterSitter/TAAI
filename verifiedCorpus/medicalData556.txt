However, their ability to      unload the right ventricle (RV) and improve RV function has not been as clearly      defined. We evaluated the short- and mid-term effects of CF-LVADs on central      venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), pulmonary capillary      wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac index (CI), RV ejection fraction (RVEF), RV      end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD), RV stroke work index (RVSWI), tricuspid annular       plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR).      METHODS: From March 2006 through June 2012, 130 patients with chronic heart      failure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD (122 HeartMate II and 8 HeartWare      devices) as a bridge to transplant (n = 76) or as destination therapy (n = 54).      Patients with pre-operative long-term LVADs (n = 4) and patients who underwent      concomitant tricuspid valve repairs during their LVAD implant (n = 21) were      excluded from the analysis. Echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations of      the remaining 105 patients were reviewed pre-operatively and at 1 and 6 months      post-LVAD implantation. RESULTS: At 1 month post-LVAD implantation, CVP decreased      from 12.4 +/- 5.9 mm Hg to 8.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001), systolic PAP decreased       from 52.3 +/- 14.1 mm Hg to 36.8 +/- 11.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001), PCWP decreased from       23.0 +/- 9.4 mm Hg to 12.9 +/- 8.0 mm Hg (p < 0.001), CI index increased from 1.8      +/- 0.5 liters/min m2 to 2.4 +/- 0.5 liters/min m2 (p < 0.001), RVEF increased      from 33.1 +/- 4.9% to 40.4 +/- 6.2% (p < 0.001), RVEDD decreased from 36 mm to 31      mm (p = 0.020), RVSWI improved from 408.6 +/- 144.6 mm Hg ml m2 to 614.4 +/-      196.2 mm Hg ml m2 (p < 0.001), and mean TAPSE increased from 1.1 +/- 0.4 cm to      1.9 +/- 0.4 cm (p = 0.004). Similarly, qualitative RV function on      echocardiography improved from 57.1% moderately or severely reduced      pre-operatively to 38.1% at 1 month (p = 0.008). Severity of TR decreased from      11.4% moderate or severe pre-operatively to 4.8% at 1 month (p < 0.001). These      improvements were maintained at 6 months post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support       significantly decreased CVP and RVEDD, with concomitant improvement in RV      function, as measured by increases in RVEF, RVSWI and TAPSE, as well as      improvements in the qualitative echocardiographic appearance of RV contractility       and a reduction in TR.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
