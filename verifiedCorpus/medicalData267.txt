Due to shortage of      donor organs in paediatric group, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is now      routinely applied as bridging strategy to increase survival on the waiting list      for OTHx. We sought to assess the impact of MCS as intention to bridge to OHTx in      patients with CHD less than 16 years of age. METHODS: From 1998 to 2013, 106      patients received 113 episodes of MCS with paracorporeal devices as intention to       bridge to OHTx. Twenty-nine had CHD, 15 (52%) with two-ventricle (Group A) and 14      (48%) with single-ventricle physiology (Group B). In Group A, 5 children had      venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), 6 left ventricular      assist device (LVAD), 2 biventricular assist device (BIVAD), 1 VA ECMO followed      by BIVAD and 1 BIVAD followed by VA ECMO. In Group B, VA ECMO was used in 7      children, univentricular assist device (UVAD) changed to VA ECMO in 4, UVAD in 2       and surgical conversion to two-ventricles physiology with BIVAD support changed      to VA ECMO in 1. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 29 (72%) children survived to      recovery/OHTx. Seven of 29 (59%) survived to discharge. In Group A, 11/15 (73%)      survived to recovery/OHTx and 9/15 (60%) survived to discharge. Four of 15 (27%)       died awaiting OHTx. One child had graft failure requiring VA ECMO and was bridged      successfully to retransplantation. One child dying after OHTx had acute      rejection, was supported with VA ECMO and then BIVAD but did not recover. One      patient had an unsuccessful second run on BIVAD 1 year after recovery from VA      ECMO. In Group B, 10/14 (71%) survived to recovery/OHTx and 8/14 (57%) survived      to discharge. Four of 14 (29%) died awaiting OHTx. Of deaths after OHTx, 1      occurred intraoperatively and 1 was consequent to graft failure and had an      unsuccessful second run with VA ECMO. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CHD can be      successfully bridged with MCS to heart transplantation. Single-ventricle      circulation compared with biventricular physiology does not increase the risk of       death before transplant or before hospital discharge.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
