Therefore, we analyzed the predictive value of plasma Gal-3      in the context of other potential clinical risk factors for death on device (DOD)      in a cohort of 175 VAD patients. METHODS: We analyzed numerous clinical factors      and plasma Gal-3 levels of 175 VAD patients before device implantation. Eighty      VAD patients were successfully bridged to HTx (BTT, 45.7%), 80 (45.7%) died on      VAD, 2 recovered on device (BTR, 1.1%) and 13 (7.4%) were still on device. Uni-      and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the importance of Gal-3 with      respect to other clinical factors. Myocardial gene expression of Gal-3 was      investigated in apex samples by RT-PCR (n = 30) and Western blotting (n = 45).      RESULTS: Plasma Gal-3 levels were higher in VAD patients than in controls (16.6      +/- 9.3 vs 9.5 +/- 3.9 ng/ml, p < 0.0001). Cox regression showed several clinical      factors and type of VAD as independent outcome predictors, but Gal-3 was not      among them. Using the regression equation we grouped patients according to their       factor constellation for prediction of survival on VAD. We propose a calculation       method for VAD survival prediction. Gal-3 mRNA and protein were detectable in      failing myocardium, but did not correlate with its plasma concentration.      CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 levels are associated with severe heart failure but do      not provide sufficient discrimination for prediction of outcomes after VAD      implantation. Importantly, we were unable to confirm myocardial tissue as a      primary source for the observed plasma elevations of Gal-3.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
