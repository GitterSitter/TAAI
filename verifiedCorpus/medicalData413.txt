However, the biologic      effects of continuous flow are not completely known. Therefore, we examined      aortic wall morphology in patients with heart failure before and after prolonged       circulatory support with a continuous-flow LVAD. METHODS: After applying a      partial aortic occlusion vascular clamp in the lower half of the ascending aorta,      we removed samples of aortic wall tissue and then attached the outflow graft of      the pump. Samples were obtained from 11 patients (9 men and 2 women, mean age 65       +/- 7 years) with severe heart failure at the time of LVAD implantation. We      obtained matched specimens at explantation after heart transplantation (n = 5) or      autopsy (n = 6). These specimens were removed from the distal ascending aorta,      remote from the aortic anastomotic site. Tissue sections were stained with      hematoxylin and eosin, Movat's pentachrome and Masson's trichrome. Smooth muscle       actin immunohistochemistry was performed on all sections. To evaluate the      morphology of the aortic wall media, we quantitatively graded tissue sections for      medial thickness, medial degenerative changes, smooth muscle cell (SMC)      disorientation and depletion, elastic fiber fragmentation and depletion, medial      fibrosis and atherosclerotic changes. RESULTS: The mean duration of support was      140 +/- 136 days (range 87 to 580 days). The histologic evaluation and comparison      of specimens obtained before and after LVAD support showed significantly      increased foci of medial degeneration, SMC depletion, elastic fiber      fragmentation, medial fibrosis and atherosclerotic changes after LVAD support.      Mean medial thickness was not significantly different after LVAD support. We      observed similar changes between samples obtained at transplantation and those      obtained at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: After continuous-flow LVAD support, the      morphology of the aortic wall media was altered in all of our patients. The      clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
