We examined the      efficacy of the PACT to assess psychosocial outcomes in LVAD patients. METHODS:      We reviewed patients who received LVAD implants between June 2006 and April 2011       and retrospectively applied the PACT. We determined the accuracy of identifying      social success with the PACT and revised domains to reflect criteria influencing       social success for LVAD patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (72% men, 44%      non-white, 50.4 years old) were divided into high-scoring and low-scoring groups.      Nine patients with low PACT scores were falsely categorized as high-risk, whereas      4 with high scores had poor social outcomes. The score had a high      positive-predictive value (0.86) but low negative-predictive value (0.31). The      PACT was revised (modified [m]PACT) to measure indicators, such as social support      and understanding of care requirements, identified to more closely affect LVAD      outcome. The mPACT exhibited improved accuracy. A reclassification table was      developed, and the net reclassification index was 0.32. The percentage of      patients incorrectly classified for social risk decreased from 27% with the PACT       to 8% with the mPACT. Patients with higher mPACT scores had decreased 30-day      readmission rates (26% vs 67%, p = 0.045) after device implantation. CONCLUSIONS:      By emphasizing social support, psychologic health, lifestyle factors, and device       understanding, the mPACT showed improved performance in risk-stratifying      candidates for LVAD therapy.
