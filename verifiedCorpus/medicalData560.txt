Patients listed for HTx have a prolonged waiting time (that is about 2.3 years in      the 2006-2010 time period in Italy) that is superior compared with patients who      receive HTx (median time around 6 months), to underline the presence of an      allocation system that prioritizes candidates in critical conditions. Patients      listed for HTx have a poor quality of life and their annual mortality is around      8-10%. Another 10-15% of HTx candidates are removed from the waiting list each      year because they are no longer suitable for transplantation. On the other hand,       continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been demonstrated to      improve survival and quality of life of patients with advanced/refractory HF.      LVAD therapy can represent a valid alternative to HTx, and it is recommended for       patients with advanced HF in the recent edition of the European Society of      Cardiology guidelines on HF management. In the United States, a larger number of       centers compared with European ones started to apply a strategy of LVAD implant      for many patients who meet clinical criteria for listing for HTx. Data from our      center concerning the last 6 years of LVAD implant (51 implants since 2006)      reported a 75.5% survival rate at 1 year. In Italian series, as in our center,      current HTx survival is only slightly superior (83% survival rate at 1 year),      based on data from the Italian National Transplant Center. We report a proposal      for updated listing criteria for HTx and indications for LVAD implant in patients      with advanced acute and chronic HF. Criteria for identifying suitable patients      for HTx and/or LVAD considering the shortage of donors are discussed.FAU - Ammirati, EnricoAU  - Ammirati EAD  - Dipartimento Cardiotoracovascolare, A.O Ospedale Niguarda Ca'Granda, Milano.FAU - Oliva, FabrizioAU  - Oliva FFAU - Colombo, TizianoAU  - Colombo TFAU - Botta, LucaAU  - Botta LFAU - Cipriani, ManlioAU  - Cipriani MFAU - Cannata, AldoAU  - Cannata AFAU - Verde, AlessandroAU  - Verde AFAU - Turazza, Fabio MAU  - Turazza FMFAU - Russo, Claudio FAU  - Russo CFFAU - Paino, RobertoAU  - Paino RFAU - Martinelli, LuigiAU  - Martinelli LFAU - Frigerio, MariaAU  - Frigerio MLA  - itaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewTT  - Evoluzione delle indicazioni al trapianto cardiaco e all'impianto di dispositivi       di assistenza ventricolare sinistra.PL  - ItalyTA  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome)JT  - Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)JID - 101263411SB  - IMMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - Decision TreesMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart VentriclesMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *Waiting ListsEDAT- 2013/02/08 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/21 06:00CRDT- 2013/02/08 06:00AID - 10.1714/1218.13523 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome). 2013 Feb;14(2):110-9. doi: 10.1714/1218.13523.- 23389313own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130207dcom- 20130620is  - 1827-6806 (print)is  - 1827-6806 (linking)vi  - 14ip  - 2dp  - 2013 febti  - [proposal for updated listing criteria for heart transplantation and indications       to implant of left ventricular assist devices].pg  - 110-9lid - 10.1714/1218.13523 [doi]ab  - heart transplantation (htx) is considered to be the gold standard treatment for      advanced heart failure (hf) but it is available only for a minority of patients,       due to paucity of donor hearts (278 htx were performed in 2011 in italy).      patients listed for htx have a prolonged waiting time (that is about 2.3 years in      the 2006-2010 time period in italy) that is superior compared with patients who      receive htx (median time around 6 months), to underline the presence of an      allocation system that prioritizes candidates in critical conditions. patients      listed for htx have a poor quality of life and their annual mortality is around      8-10%. another 10-15% of htx candidates are removed from the waiting list each      year because they are no longer suitable for transplantation. on the other hand,       continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (lvads) have been demonstrated to      improve survival and quality of life of patients with advanced/refractory hf.      lvad therapy can represent a valid alternative to htx, and it is recommended for       patients with advanced hf in the recent edition of the european society of      cardiology guidelines on hf management. in the united states, a larger number of       centers compared with european ones started to apply a strategy of lvad implant      for many patients who meet clinical criteria for listing for htx. data from our      center concerning the last 6 years of lvad implant (51 implants since 2006)      reported a 75.5% survival rate at 1 year. in italian series, as in our center,      current htx survival is only slightly superior (83% survival rate at 1 year),      based on data from the italian national transplant center. we report a proposal      for updated listing criteria for htx and indications for lvad implant in patients      with advanced acute and chronic hf. criteria for identifying suitable patients      for htx and/or lvad considering the shortage of donors are discussed.fau - ammirati, enricoau  - ammirati ead  - dipartimento cardiotoracovascolare, a.o ospedale niguarda ca'granda, milano.fau - oliva, fabrizioau  - oliva ffau - colombo, tizianoau  - colombo tfau - botta, lucaau  - botta lfau - cipriani, manlioau  - cipriani mfau - cannata, aldoau  - cannata afau - verde, alessandroau  - verde afau - turazza, fabio mau  - turazza fmfau - russo, claudio fau  - russo cffau - paino, robertoau  - paino rfau - martinelli, luigiau  - martinelli lfau - frigerio, mariaau  - frigerio mla  - itapt  - english abstractpt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov'tpt  - reviewtt  - evoluzione delle indicazioni al trapianto cardiaco e all'impianto di dispositivi       di assistenza ventricolare sinistra.pl  - italyta  - g ital cardiol (rome)jt  - giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)jid - 101263411sb  - immh  - chronic diseasemh  - decision treesmh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - *heart transplantationmh  - heart ventriclesmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - *waiting listsedat- 2013/02/08 06:00mhda- 2013/06/21 06:00crdt- 2013/02/08 06:00aid - 10.1714/1218.13523 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - g ital cardiol (rome). 2013 feb;14(2):110-9. doi: 10.1714/1218.13523.
