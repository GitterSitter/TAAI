We reviewed      our experience with the management of patients on continuous flow (CF) LVAD      support undergoing NCS. METHODS: From March 2006 through March 2011, 86 patients       with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of a HeartMate II (Thoratec      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD. Clinical records of these patients were reviewed to      identify patients who underwent NCS while on LVAD support, with a focus on      peri-operative death, bleeding, thrombosis, and device malfunction, as well as      management of pre-operative anti-coagulation. RESULTS: While on CF-LVAD support,       20 patients underwent 25 NCSs, comprising 13 major and 12 minor procedures.      Operations were performed electively in 22 and as emergencies in 3. No      peri-operative deaths, thromboembolic complications, or device malfunctions      occurred. The incidence of bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood      cells was 36.0%, including 25% of patients undergoing minor NCSs and 46.2%      undergoing major NCSs (p = 0.004). All bleeding complications occurred in      patients on both warfarin and aspirin pre-operatively. The only significant      differences between patients who did and did not require transfusion were      pre-operative warfarin use and significantly higher pre-operative international      normalized ratio in the transfused group (1.9 +/- 0.4 vs 1.4 +/- 0.3; p = 0.008).      CONCLUSIONS: Non-cardiac operations can be performed safely in patients with      CF-LVADs. It may possible to reduce peri-operative bleeding by lowering      pre-operative anti-coagulation goals, especially before major surgery. However,      additional analysis is required to determine if this can be performed safely.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
