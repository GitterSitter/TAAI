HYPOTHESIS: There are      different implications of persistent versus transient improvement in LVEF among      DCM patients receiving contemporary therapy. METHODS: We studied 188 patients      with nonischemic DCM. Persistent improvement in LVEF (PIEF) was defined as LVEF      increase by at least 10% compared to baseline, and found in 2 separate      echo-Doppler exams performed at least 12 months apart. Increased LVEF in echo 2,       which was not sustained in echo 3, was defined as transient improvement in LVEF      (TIEF). RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 6.8 years, PIEF occurred in 61      (33%) patients, predicting a better long-term outcome (P < 0.001) in a combined      end-point comprising death, heart transplantation, or the need for a ventricular       assist device. The TIEF group had an intermediate course and were closer to      nonimprovers (P = 0.003 vs PIEF). Multivariate logistic regression identified the      following independent predictors of PIEF: shorter disease duration,      pregnancy-associated disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baseline LVEF </=      25%. A score to predict PIEF assigned 1 point to each of the following: disease      duration < 3 years and no familial cardiomyopathy; pregnancy-associated      presentation; basal LVEF </= 25%; and left ventricular wall thickness >/= 12. A      score of >/= 3 was present in 44% of the patients, reliably predicting PIEF in      91% (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent improvement in LVEF is associated with      improved long-term prognosis. Baseline clinical parameters can be used to      identify patients likely to demonstrate PIEF, thereby allowing tailored      management in this population.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Blechman, IdoAU  - Blechman IAD  - Heart Failure Institute and Leviev Heart Center, Sheba Medical Center and Sackler      School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.FAU - Arad, MichaelAU  - Arad MFAU - Nussbaum, TamarAU  - Nussbaum TFAU - Goldenberg, IlanAU  - Goldenberg IFAU - Freimark, DovAU  - Freimark DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140918PL  - United StatesTA  - Clin CardiolJT  - Clinical cardiologyJID - 7903272SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/09/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/23 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/20 06:00PHST- 2014/02/26 [received]PHST- 2014/05/28 [revised]PHST- 2014/08/04 [accepted]PHST- 2014/09/18 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1002/clc.22331 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Cardiol. 2014 Nov;37(11):687-92. doi: 10.1002/clc.22331.
