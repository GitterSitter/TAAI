The purpose of this study was to      evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD in      end-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in the      Netherlands. METHODS: A third-generation LVAD was implanted in 16 heart failure      patients (age 61 +/- 8; 81 % male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20 +/- 6 %)      as destination therapy. All patients were ineligible for heart transplant. At      baseline, 3 and 6 months, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class,      quality-of-life and exercise capacity were assessed. Clinical adverse events were      registered. RESULTS: Survival at 30 days and 6 months was 88 and 75 %,      respectively. In the postoperative phase, 6 (38 %) patients required continuous      veno-venous haemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13 %) patients required      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure.       During follow-up, NYHA functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7 +/-      0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 57 +/- 5 to 23 +/- 3 at 6 months (P < 0.001),      respectively. The 6 min walking distance improved from 168 +/- 42 m to 291 +/- 29      m at 6 months (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD therapy is a      promising treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for      heart transplant.FAU - Haeck, M L AAU  - Haeck MLAD  - Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Albinusdreef 2, 2333       ZA, Leiden, the Netherlands.FAU - Beeres, S L M AAU  - Beeres SLFAU - Hoke, UAU  - Hoke UFAU - Palmen, MAU  - Palmen MFAU - Couperus, L EAU  - Couperus LEFAU - Delgado, VAU  - Delgado VFAU - Logeman, E AAU  - Logeman EAFAU - Maas, J JAU  - Maas JJFAU - Klautz, R J MAU  - Klautz RJFAU - Schalij, M JAU  - Schalij MJFAU - Verwey, H FAU  - Verwey HFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NetherlandsTA  - Neth Heart JJT  - Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of      Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart FoundationJID - 101095458PMC - PMC4315784OID - NLM: PMC4315784EDAT- 2014/10/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/03 06:01CRDT- 2014/10/03 06:00AID - 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Neth Heart J. 2015 Feb;23(2):102-8. doi: 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4.- 25273921own - nlmstat- pubmed-not-medlineda  - 20150204dcom- 20150204lr  - 20150206is  - 1568-5888 (print)is  - 1568-5888 (linking)vi  - 23ip  - 2dp  - 2015 febti  - left ventricular assist device for end-stage heart failure: results of the first       lvad destination program in the netherlands.pg  - 102-8lid - 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4 [doi]ab  - purpose: mechanical circulatory support with a continuous-flow left ventricular      assist device (lvad) may be a valuable treatment in end-stage heart failure      patients for an extended period of time. the purpose of this study was to      evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow lvad in      end-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in the      netherlands. methods: a third-generation lvad was implanted in 16 heart failure      patients (age 61 +/- 8; 81 % male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20 +/- 6 %)      as destination therapy. all patients were ineligible for heart transplant. at      baseline, 3 and 6 months, new york heart association (nyha) functional class,      quality-of-life and exercise capacity were assessed. clinical adverse events were      registered. results: survival at 30 days and 6 months was 88 and 75 %,      respectively. in the postoperative phase, 6 (38 %) patients required continuous      veno-venous haemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13 %) patients required      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure.       during follow-up, nyha functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7 +/-      0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 57 +/- 5 to 23 +/- 3 at 6 months (p < 0.001),      respectively. the 6 min walking distance improved from 168 +/- 42 m to 291 +/- 29      m at 6 months (p = 0.001). conclusion: continuous-flow lvad therapy is a      promising treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for      heart transplant.fau - haeck, m l aau  - haeck mlad  - department of cardiology, leiden university medical center, albinusdreef 2, 2333       za, leiden, the netherlands.fau - beeres, s l m aau  - beeres slfau - hoke, uau  - hoke ufau - palmen, mau  - palmen mfau - couperus, l eau  - couperus lefau - delgado, vau  - delgado vfau - logeman, e aau  - logeman eafau - maas, j jau  - maas jjfau - klautz, r j mau  - klautz rjfau - schalij, m jau  - schalij mjfau - verwey, h fau  - verwey hfla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - netherlandsta  - neth heart jjt  - netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the netherlands society of      cardiology and the netherlands heart foundationjid - 101095458pmc - pmc4315784oid - nlm: pmc4315784edat- 2014/10/03 06:00mhda- 2014/10/03 06:01crdt- 2014/10/03 06:00aid - 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - neth heart j. 2015 feb;23(2):102-8. doi: 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4.
