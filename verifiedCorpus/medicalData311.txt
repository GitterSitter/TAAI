An infrequent but serious      adverse event of LVAD support is thrombus ingestion or formation in the pump. In       this study, we analyze the incidence of pump thrombus, evaluate the comparative      effectiveness of various treatment strategies, and examine factors pre-disposing       to the development of pump thrombus. METHODS: The analysis included 382 patients       who underwent implantation of the HVAD as part of the HeartWare Bridge to      Transplant (BTT) and subsequent Continued Access Protocol (CAP) trial.      Descriptive statistics and group comparisons were generated to analyze baseline      characteristics, incidence of pump thrombus, and treatment outcomes. A      multivariate analysis was performed to assess significant risk factors for      developing pump thrombus. RESULTS: There were 34 pump thrombus events observed in      31 patients (8.1% of the cohort) for a rate of 0.08 events per patient-year. The       incidence of pump thrombus did not differ between BTT and CAP. Medical management      of pump thrombus was attempted in 30 cases, and was successful in 15 (50%). A      total of 16 patients underwent pump exchange, and 2 underwent urgent      transplantation. Five patients with a pump thrombus died after medical therapy      failed, 4 of whom also underwent a pump exchange. Survival at 1 year in patients       with and without a pump thrombus was 69.4% and 85.5%, respectively (p = 0.21). A       multivariable analysis revealed that significant risk factors for pump thrombus      included a mean arterial pressure > 90 mm Hg, aspirin dose </= 81 mg,      international normalized ratio </= 2, and Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile level of >/= 3 at implant.      CONCLUSIONS: Pump thrombus is a clinically important adverse event in patients      receiving an HVAD, occurring at a rate of 0.08 events per patient-year.      Significant risk factors for pump thrombosis include elevated blood pressure and       sub-optimal anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapies. This suggests that pump      thrombus event rates could be reduced through careful adherence to patient      management guidelines.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Najjar, Samer SAU  - Najjar SSAD  - Departments of Internal Medicine and Cardiac Surgery, MedStar Heart Institute,      Washington, DC.
