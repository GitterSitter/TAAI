Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,      some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We       sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II      (HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure       and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD. METHODS:      This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patients transplanted during       2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were divided into two groups      according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) or required      additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were compared for      early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major early      post-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival. RESULTS: Early graft      loss was 10.7% in isolated HMII and 25% in HMII + RVAD patients (P = 0.26). There      were no observed differences in the rates of primary graft dysfunction (7.3 vs      0%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25%, P =      0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary artery resistance (odds ratio: 3.286,      95% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant      predictor for adverse outcome of mechanically-bridged heart transplant      recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 +/- 5% in isolated HMII and 75       +/- 15% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate      that heart transplant recipients who required unplanned RV mechanical support      after LVAD implantation achieved comparable rates of early graft loss,      post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged      with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-year graft survival was      equivalent between those two groups. Given the small sample size, further studies      involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
