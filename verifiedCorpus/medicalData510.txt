In this report, we have presented our institution's clinical      experience in the anesthetic management of ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation. METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, VAD implantation was      performed in 84 adult patients with end-stage heart failure. The group included      75 male and 9 female patients of overall mean age, 47.6 +/- 13.4 years. Our      retrospective review analyzed elements of perioperative anesthetic care,      including preoperative characteristics, general anesthetic care, and blood      product usage. RESULTS: The indications for VAD implantation were dilated (n =      59; 70%) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 25; 30%). An intra-aortic balloon pump      had been placed in 16 patients. We monitored invasive arterial and central venous      pressures as well as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Etomidate      was used as the induction agent in 79 of 84 patients (average dose, 18.75 +/-      1.40 mg). Intraoperative fentanyl dose was 939.69 +/- 212.44 mug. Anesthesia was       maintained with sevoflurane (n = 55) or desflurane (n = 29). Dopamine,      dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and levosimendan were used in 74, 79,      60, 14, and 32 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered to      38 subjects (45%). The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh frozen plasma, and      thrombocyte suspension transfusions were 3.96 +/- 2.78, 1.91 +/- 1.21, 1.80 +/-      2.48 u, respectively. On average, patients were extubated 13 hours after arrival       in the intensive care unit and discharged therefrom on day 8. Thirty-one patients      were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. While 27 patients (32%) died       during the follow-up period, 26 are still living on VAD support. CONCLUSION:      Among patients undergoing VAD implantation, the anesthesiologist should become      familiar with the device and consider the severity of cardiac and other end-organ      dysfunction.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
