This study evaluates the safety and      efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a means to transplant      candidacy in such patients. METHODS: Morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart      failure, who were ineligible for cardiac transplantation and underwent LSG      between 2008 and 2013, were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic      characteristics, perioperative details, percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL),       and status of transplant candidacy were analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients (3 men)      with end-stage heart failure and morbid obesity underwent LSG. Three patients      (50%) had a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in place at the time of      surgery. Median age was 34 (31-66) years and mean preoperative body mass index      (BMI) was 47.6+/-3.0 kg/m2. Median operative time was 90 (66-141) minutes, with a      median length of stay of 7 (4-16) days. There were no perioperative deaths. One      patient suffered a spontaneous flank hematoma. The same patient also had      thrombosis of the LVAD pump at 3 weeks postoperatively, requiring an uneventful      device exchange. At median follow-up of 22 (12-70) months, the mean %EWL was      51.4+/-10.3% with a decrease in BMI to 34.3+/-2.4 kg/m2 (P<.05). All patients had      lost sufficient weight to become transplant eligible within 12 months of surgery.      Two patients had undergone successful transplantation and another 2 were on the      transplant list. CONCLUSION: LSG appears to be a safe, technically feasible, and       effective method for obtaining adequate weight loss in morbidly obese patients      with end-stage heart failure and mechanical circulatory support, subsequently      improving their access to cardiac transplantation. This is the largest case      series to date of this high-risk group of patients undergoing LSG.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015.
