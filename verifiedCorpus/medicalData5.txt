Survival rates and functional status following heart      transplantation are excellent, particularly if compared to medical therapy. The      process of acute and chronic transplant rejection, however, and the sequelae of      immunosuppression, such as infection, malignancy and renal insufficiency,      prevents even better results. Therapy with current mechanical circulatory support      devices is associated with improving outcome and may become competitive to heart       transplantation, at least in selected patients. But long-term results are not yet      available.FAU - Wilhelm, Markus JAU  - Wilhelm MJAD  - Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich,      Switzerland.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ChinaTA  - J Thorac DisJT  - Journal of thoracic diseaseJID - 101533916PMC - PMC4387387OID - NLM: PMC4387387OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart transplantationOT  - immunosuppressionOT  - transplant rejectionOT  - ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2015/04/30 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/30 06:01CRDT- 2015/04/30 06:00PHST- 2014/11/01 [received]PHST- 2014/12/23 [accepted]AID - 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.01.46 [doi]AID - jtd-07-03-549 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Thorac Dis. 2015 Mar;7(3):549-51. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.01.46.- 25922738own - nlmstat- pubmed-not-medlineda  - 20150429dcom- 20150429lr  - 20150501is  - 2072-1439 (print)is  - 2072-1439 (linking)vi  - 7ip  - 3dp  - 2015 marti  - long-term outcome following heart transplantation: current perspective.pg  - 549-51lid - 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.01.46 [doi]ab  - heart transplantation keeps its leading position in the treatment of end-stage      heart failure (hf). survival rates and functional status following heart      transplantation are excellent, particularly if compared to medical therapy. the      process of acute and chronic transplant rejection, however, and the sequelae of      immunosuppression, such as infection, malignancy and renal insufficiency,      prevents even better results. therapy with current mechanical circulatory support      devices is associated with improving outcome and may become competitive to heart       transplantation, at least in selected patients. but long-term results are not yet      available.fau - wilhelm, markus jau  - wilhelm mjad  - clinic for cardiovascular surgery, university hospital zurich, zurich,      switzerland.la  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - chinata  - j thorac disjt  - journal of thoracic diseasejid - 101533916pmc - pmc4387387oid - nlm: pmc4387387oto - notnlmot  - heart transplantationot  - immunosuppressionot  - transplant rejectionot  - ventricular assist deviceedat- 2015/04/30 06:00mhda- 2015/04/30 06:01crdt- 2015/04/30 06:00phst- 2014/11/01 [received]phst- 2014/12/23 [accepted]aid - 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.01.46 [doi]aid - jtd-07-03-549 [pii]pst - ppublishso  - j thorac dis. 2015 mar;7(3):549-51. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.01.46.
