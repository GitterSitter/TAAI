METHODS: The aim of the study is to investigate the      significance of pre-existing RV dysfunction, tricuspid valve (TV) insufficiency,       and the severity of septal deviation following LVAD implantation on RV      dysfunction, as well as the outcome and short-term complications in 51 patients      from June 2006 to August 2010. Student t test was used to compare the data and      estimate the p value. RESULTS: Mean age was 55.1 +/- 13, with a male to female      ratio of 3.25. The 30-day mortality was 13.7% (7/51 patients), and the overall      mortality was 23.5% (12/51 patients). Meanwhile, 21 patients (21/51; 41.2%) have       undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. The mean time of support was      314.5+/-235 days with a median of 240 days at the time of closing this study.      Echocardiographic evaluation of RV function pre- and post-implantation of an LVAD      demonstrated septal deviation towards the left ventricle in immediate      postoperative phase, which correlated with acute RV dysfunction (p = 0.002).      Preoperative RV dysfunction was a significant predictor of postoperative right      heart dysfunction following implantation of an LVAD (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION:      Preoperative RV dysfunction is a predictor of RV failure in LVAD patients. The      adjustment of septal deviation through gradual increase of the LVAD flow can      prevent the acute RV dysfunction following LVAD placement.FAU - Neragi-Miandoab, SiyamekAU  - Neragi-Miandoab SAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New      York, NY 10467, USA. sneragi@yahoo.comFAU - Goldstein, DanielAU  - Goldstein DFAU - Bello, RicardoAU  - Bello RFAU - Michler, RobertAU  - Michler RFAU - D'Alessandro, DavidAU  - D'Alessandro DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120627PL  - EnglandTA  - J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Journal of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101265113SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*instrumentation/methodsMH  - Cardiomyopathies/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart Septum/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/physiopathology/*surgeryPMC - PMC3403957OID - NLM: PMC3403957EDAT- 2012/06/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/31 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/29 06:00PHST- 2011/11/19 [received]PHST- 2012/06/27 [accepted]PHST- 2012/06/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 1749-8090-7-60 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jun 27;7:60. doi: 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60.- 22738144own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120725dcom- 20130130lr  - 20141016is  - 1749-8090 (electronic)is  - 1749-8090 (linking)vi  - 7dp  - 2012ti  - right ventricular dysfunction following continuous flow left ventricular assist      device placement in 51 patients: predicators and outcomes.pg  - 60lid - 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60 [doi]ab  - background: right ventricular (rv) dysfunction following implantation of a left      ventricular assist device (lvad) is a serious condition and is associated with      increased mortality. methods: the aim of the study is to investigate the      significance of pre-existing rv dysfunction, tricuspid valve (tv) insufficiency,       and the severity of septal deviation following lvad implantation on rv      dysfunction, as well as the outcome and short-term complications in 51 patients      from june 2006 to august 2010. student t test was used to compare the data and      estimate the p value. results: mean age was 55.1 +/- 13, with a male to female      ratio of 3.25. the 30-day mortality was 13.7% (7/51 patients), and the overall      mortality was 23.5% (12/51 patients). meanwhile, 21 patients (21/51; 41.2%) have       undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. the mean time of support was      314.5+/-235 days with a median of 240 days at the time of closing this study.      echocardiographic evaluation of rv function pre- and post-implantation of an lvad      demonstrated septal deviation towards the left ventricle in immediate      postoperative phase, which correlated with acute rv dysfunction (p = 0.002).      preoperative rv dysfunction was a significant predictor of postoperative right      heart dysfunction following implantation of an lvad (p = 0.001). conclusion:      preoperative rv dysfunction is a predictor of rv failure in lvad patients. the      adjustment of septal deviation through gradual increase of the lvad flow can      prevent the acute rv dysfunction following lvad placement.fau - neragi-miandoab, siyamekau  - neragi-miandoab sad  - department of cardiothoracic surgery, albert einstein college of medicine, new      york, ny 10467, usa. sneragi@yahoo.comfau - goldstein, danielau  - goldstein dfau - bello, ricardoau  - bello rfau - michler, robertau  - michler rfau - d'alessandro, davidau  - d'alessandro dla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20120627pl  - englandta  - j cardiothorac surgjt  - journal of cardiothoracic surgeryjid - 101265113sb  - immh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - cardiac surgical procedures/*instrumentation/methodsmh  - cardiomyopathies/physiopathology/surgerymh  - femalemh  - heart failure/physiopathology/surgerymh  - heart septum/physiopathology/surgerymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - retrospective studiesmh  - treatment outcomemh  - tricuspid valve insufficiency/physiopathology/surgerymh  - ventricular dysfunction, right/physiopathology/*surgerypmc - pmc3403957oid - nlm: pmc3403957edat- 2012/06/29 06:00mhda- 2013/01/31 06:00crdt- 2012/06/29 06:00phst- 2011/11/19 [received]phst- 2012/06/27 [accepted]phst- 2012/06/27 [aheadofprint]aid - 1749-8090-7-60 [pii]aid - 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60 [doi]pst - epublishso  - j cardiothorac surg. 2012 jun 27;7:60. doi: 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60.
