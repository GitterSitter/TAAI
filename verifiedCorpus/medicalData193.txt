In addition, inotropes are considered to be harmful in nonischemic HF.      METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the association of in-hospital inotrope use with      (1) major events (death, ventricular assist device, or heart transplant) and (2)       study days alive and out of hospital during the first 6 months in the Evaluation       Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization      Effectiveness, which excluded patients with immediate need for inotropic therapy.      Predefined subgroups of interest were baseline SBP <100 versus >/= 100 mm Hg,      cardiac index <1.8 vs >/= 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2), and ischemic versus nonischemic HF      etiology. Inotropes were frequently used in both the <100 mm Hg (88/165 [53.3%])       and the >/= 100 mm Hg (106/262 [40.5%]) SBP subgroups and were associated with      higher risk for major events in both subgroups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.85,       95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-5.12 [P < .001]; and HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.02-3.37       [P = .042]; respectively). Risk with inotropes was more pronounced among those      with cardiac index >/= 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 114; HR 4.65, 95% CI 1.98-10.9; P      < .001) vs <1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 82; HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.61-3.58; P = .39).      Event rates were higher with inotropes in both ischemic (n = 215; HR 2.64, 95% CI      1.49-4.68; P = .001) and nonischemic (n = 216; HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.18-4.07; P =      .012) patients. Across all subgroups, patients who received inotropes spent fewer      study days alive and out of hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of cardiogenic       shock or end-organ hypoperfusion, inotrope use during hospitalization for HF was       associated with unfavorable 6-month outcomes, regardless of admission SBP,      cardiac index, or HF etiology.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
