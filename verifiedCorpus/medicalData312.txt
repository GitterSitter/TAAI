A      perceived increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis in the HeartMate II (HMII)      LVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) by clinicians prompted this analysis of the      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)      database. METHODS: Between 2006 and June 2013, 8,988 United States patients aged       older than 18 years received a durable LVAD. Of these, 6,910 adult patients from       132 institutions who received a HMII LVAD were entered in the INTERMACS database       and constitute the study group for this analysis. RESULTS: Overall survival (with      censoring at transplant or explant for recovery) with the HMII LVAD was 80% at 1       year and 69% at 2 years and was not significantly different when stratified by      era of implant. Freedom from device exchange or death due to thrombosis decreased      from 99% at 6 months in 2009 to 94% in 2012 (p < 0.0001). Multivariable hazard      function analysis showed risk factors for pump thrombosis included later implant       year (p < 0.0001), younger age (p < 0.0001), higher creatinine (p = 0.002),      larger body mass index (p = 0.004), white race (p = 0.0004), left ventricular      ejection fraction above 20% (p = 0.02), and higher lactate dehydrogenase level at      1 month (p < 0.0001). Survival (p < 0.0001) and freedom from infection (p =      0.008) and cerebrovascular accident (p < 0.0001) were lower after pump exchange      than after primary implant. CONCLUSIONS: Pump exchange or death due to pump      thrombosis increased during 2011 and 2012, but the magnitude of the increase      remained relatively small. Survival remains high (80% at 1 year) with the HMII      LVAD. Risk factor analysis suggests that a number of patient-related factors      contribute to the risk of thrombosis. Markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase in       the first month is a predictor of pump thrombosis. This analysis could not      examine the potential role of technical factors during implant, such as      sub-optimal pump or graft positioning, changes in patient management paradigms      with pump speed settings, improved recognition and change in the threshold for      pump exchange, or design or production changes with the pump, as contributors to       the risk of pump thrombosis.CI  - (c) 2013 Published by International Society for the Heart and Lung      Transplantation on behalf of International Society for Heart and Lung      Transplantation.FAU - Kirklin, James KAU  - Kirklin JKAD  - University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.
