However, the prognosis of patients      with advanced heart failure and peak VO(2) of 10 to 14 mL/min per kg in the era      of modern medical therapy for heart failure is not fully elucidated. B-type      natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a useful prognostic marker in patients with heart      failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 424 patients undergoing HTx evaluation      were classified according to peak VO(2) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing      (>14, 10-14, and <10 mL/min per kg). Survival after cardiopulmonary exercise      testing without HTx or ventricular assist device (VAD) support was compared with       survival of 743 de novo HTx recipients. Multivariable analysis revealed that high      BNP and low peak VO(2) were independently associated with death, HTx, or VAD      requirements (hazard ratio, 3.5 and 0.6; 95% CI, 1.24-9.23 and 0.03-0.71; P=0.02       and <0.0001, respectively). VAD-free or HTx-free survival of patients with peak      VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg was identical to post-HTx survival. When patients      with peak VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg were dichotomized by a cutoff value of BNP      of 506 pg/mL, those with BNP<506 pg/mL was equivalent to post-HTx survival (1      year: 90.8% versus 87.2%; P=0.61), whereas those with BNP>/=506 showed worse      VAD-free or HTx-free survival (1 year: 79.7%; P<0.001 versus post-HTx). Patients       with peak VO(2) <10 mL/min per kg showed worse survival compared with post-HTx      survival, and there was a survival difference between those with BNP>/=506 and      <506 pg/mL (1 year: 77.2% versus 56.1%; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with peak       VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg and low BNP levels have a VAD-free or HTx-free      survival similar to post-HTx survival in heart recipients, whereas high BNP      levels indicate worse outcome in this group of patients.FAU - Kato, Tomoko SAU  - Kato TSAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.FAU - Collado, EliasAU  - Collado EFAU - Khawaja, TubaAU  - Khawaja TFAU - Kawano, YumekoAU  - Kawano YFAU - Kim, MargaretAU  - Kim MFAU - Farr, MaryjaneAU  - Farr MFAU - Mancini, Donna MAU  - Mancini DMFAU - Schulze, P ChristianAU  - Schulze PCLA  - engGR  - HL073029/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL095742-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - P30 HL101272-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1 RR024156/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20121130PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
