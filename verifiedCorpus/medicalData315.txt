The short- and long-term survival in      patients with cardiogenic shock or end-stage heart failure has improved      considerably by recent technological advances in short and long-term mechanical      circulatory support devices. For short-term mechanical support, veno-arterial      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has been increasingly used as      bridge-to-decision and bridge-to-recovery in cardiogenic shock patients.      Long-term mechanical circulatory support devices such as left ventricular assist       devices (LVADs) are widely available and play a central role in      bridge-to-transplantation in those eligible for heart transplantation (HTX) and      as destination therapy (DT) in those not eligible for heart transplantation.      Nevertheless, patients with critical cardiogenic shock show a deleterious outcome      after LVAD-implantation or HTX with higher mortality, more complications and      higher burden on financial resources. These considerations underscore the      importance of optimal timing and appropriate patient selection for eventual LVAD       therapy. The current report will focus on the immediate management of patients      with cardiogenic shock with inotropes, discuss the use of IABP and focus mainly      on pivotal choices to be made in the period spanned by short term mechanical      circulatory support in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock.FAU - Brugts, Jasper JAU  - Brugts JJAD  - Department of Cardiology, Erasmus MC Thoraxcenter, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.FAU - Caliskan, KadirAU  - Caliskan KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140113PL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Cardiovasc TherJT  - Expert review of cardiovascular therapyJID - 101182328RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)SB  - IMMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/therapeutic useMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*methodsMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - SurvivalMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2014/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/30 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/15 06:00PHST- 2014/01/13 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1586/14779072.2014.880051 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther. 2014 Feb;12(2):145-53. doi:      10.1586/14779072.2014.880051.
