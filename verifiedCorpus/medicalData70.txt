The natural long-term trajectory of survival      free of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant in patients      with ambulatory class IV symptoms who underwent CRT has not been established. We       extracted clinical data on 723 consecutive patients with NYHA class III or      ambulatory class IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction </=35%, and      a QRS duration >/=120 ms who underwent CRT from September 30, 2003, to August 6,       2007. Chart notes immediately before CRT were reviewed to confirm NYHA class      status before CRT. Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox proportional      hazards model were constructed to determine long-term survival free of heart      transplant and LVAD based on NYHA class status. Of the 723 patients, 52 had      ambulatory class IV symptoms. Over a mean follow-up of 5.0 +/- 2.5 years      controlling for many possible confounders, ambulatory NYHA class IV status was      independently associated with poor long-term outcomes. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and      5-year survival free of LVAD or heart transplant for class III versus ambulatory       class IV patients was 92.0%, 84.0%, 75.0%, 68.1%, and 63.2% versus 75.0%, 61.5%,       52.0%, 45%, and 40.4%, respectively. Although patients with ambulatory class IV      heart failure receiving CRT have inferior long-term outcomes compared with those       with class III symptoms, survival in class IV patients continues to parallel      class III patients over an extended follow-up. At 5 years, survival free of LVAD       or heart transplant in ambulatory class IV patients receiving CRT is 40%.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
