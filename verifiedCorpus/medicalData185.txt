Forty patients (LVAD, n = 14; HT, n = 12; and      heart failure [HF], n = 14) and 14 matched healthy subjects were assessed for      physical activity, energy expenditure, and QoL. The LVAD and HT groups were      assessed postoperatively at 4 to 6 weeks (baseline) and 3, 6, and 12 months. At      baseline, LVAD, HT, and HF patients demonstrated low physical activity, reaching       only 15%, 28%, and 51% of that of healthy subjects (1,603 +/- 302 vs 3,036 +/-      439 vs 5,490 +/- 1,058 vs 10,756 +/- 568 steps/day, respectively, p <0.01). This       was associated with reduced energy expenditure and increased sedentary time (p      <0.01). Baseline QoL was not different among LVAD, HT, and HF groups (p = 0.44).       LVAD implantation and HT significantly increased daily physical activity by 60%      and 52%, respectively, from baseline to 3 months (p <0.05), but the level of      activity remained unchanged at 3, 6, and 12 months. The QoL improved from      baseline to 3 months in LVAD implantation and HT groups (p <0.01) but remained      unchanged afterward. At any time point, HT demonstrated higher activity level      than LVAD implantation (p <0.05), and this was associated with better QoL. In      contrast, physical activity and QoL decreased at 12 months in patients with HF (p      <0.05). In conclusion, patients in LVAD and HT patients demonstrate improved      physical activity and QoL within the first 3 months after surgery, but physical      activity and QoL remain unchanged afterward and well below that of healthy      subjects. Strategies targeting low levels of physical activity should now be      explored to improve recovery of these patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
