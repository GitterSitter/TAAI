METHODS: Children bridged to transplantation from 2004 to 2011 were      included. RVD was defined as the use of a left VAD (LVAD) with an elevated      central venous pressure of >16 mm Hg with inotropic therapy and/or inhaled nitric      oxide for >96 hours or biventricular assist (BiVAD). RESULTS: A total of 57      children (median age, 2.97 years; range 35 days to 15.8 years) were supported. Of      the 57, 43 (75%) had an LVAD, and of those, 10 developed RVD. The remaining 14      (25%) required BiVAD. Thus, RVD occurred in 24 of 57 patients (42%). Preoperative      variables such as younger age (P = .01), use of extracorporeal mechanical support      (P = .006), and elevated urea (P = .03), creatinine (P = .02), and bilirubin (P =      .001) were associated with RVD. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated      that elevated urea and extracorporeal mechanical support (odds ratio, 26.4; 95%      confidence interval, 2.3-307.3; and odds ratio, 27.8; 95% confidence interval,      2.5-312.3, respectively) were risk factors for BiVAD. The patients who developed       RVD on LVAD had a complicated postoperative course but excellent survival (100%),      comparable to those with preserved right ventricular function (91%). The survival      for those requiring BiVAD was reduced (71%). CONCLUSIONS: RVD occurred in      approximately 40% of pediatric VAD recipients and affects their peri-implantation      morbidity and bridging outcomes. Preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation      and elevated urea were risk factors for BiVAD. Additional studies of the      management of RVD in children after VAD implantation are warranted.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published by      Mosby, Inc.
