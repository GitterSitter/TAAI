METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed PICC      adverse events (AEs) and associated cost in 129 status 1B patients from 2005 to      2012. End points were HT, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and death.      Regression analysis was used to identify AE risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty-three      PICC AEs occurred in 35 patients (27%), consisting of 48 infections, 4      thromboses, and 1 bleeding event. Median duration of PICC support was 63      (interquartile range [IQR] 34-131) days, and median time to first PICC infection       was 44 (IQR 14-76) days. Among PICC infections, 9% required defibrillator removal      and 30% were inactivated on the HT list for a mean of 23 +/- 17 days. Rate of HT,      LVAD, or death was similar between groups (P > .05). Regression analysis found      that a double lumen PICC was associated with a shorter time to first PICC      infection (hazard ratio 7.59, 95% CI 1.97-29.23; P = .003). Median cost per PICC       infection was $10,704 (IQR $7,401-$26,083). CONCLUSIONS: PICC infections were the      most frequent AEs. PICCs with >1 lumen were associated with increased risk of      infection. PICC AEs accounted for increased intensive care unit admissions, HT      list inactivations, and overall cost.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
