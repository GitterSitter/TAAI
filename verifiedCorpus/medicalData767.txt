Outcomes of patients who underwent short-term ventricular assist device (STVAD)      implantation in a community hospital (CH) as a bridge to a long-term VAD (LTVAD)       were compared with those who received both implants at the same tertiary hospital      (TH). METHODS: Data were retrospectively reviewed for patients with a STVAD who      were bridged to a LTVAD in a TH from 1997 to 2010. We studied outcomes and      survival censored for cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients      (73% male) were identified. Mean age was 52 +/- 16 years, 30% were diabetic, and       65% had intra-aortic balloon pump support. Reasons for STVAD implantation were an      acute myocardial infarction, 38%; post-cardiotomy, 38%, decompensated chronic      heart failure, 19%; and others, 5%. A STVAD was implanted in a CH in 20 patients       (54%), and they had fewer cardiovascular risk factors than those whose STVAD was       implanted at the TH. All patients at the CH were at Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 1 compared with 71% at the TH (p =      0.014). Patients from the CH tended to die sooner after LTVAD implant, although      long-term survival was similar. At the 1-year follow-up, 65% from the CH were      alive or had received a transplant vs 60% from the TH. CONCLUSION: Patients with       cardiogenic shock in whom a STVAD was implanted in a CH and then were bridged to       a LTVAD in a TH had similar long-term survival as those bridged to LTVAD at the      TH.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
