These numbers continue to rise due to advancing technology and successes in      treating cardiac conditions and potentially fatal events such as myocardial      infarctions. According to Carrier (2005), individuals with damaged hearts are      living longer, and lives are being successfully saved with the surge of      cardiovascular assist devices developed in recent years, which are increasingly      used as a bridge to transplant. Despite the lifesaving capabilities of      ventricular-assist devices, these innovations pose risks and complications that      can be debilitating for patients and their families (Carrier, 2005). As this      complex trajectory is navigated, nurses provide care and support to the patient      and family while playing a unique role in the assessment and monitoring of these       devices. A family-centred nursing model provides a framework for practice when      nursing patients and families are in crisis. The foundations of the McGill Model       of Nursing are focused on a strengths-based approach, revolving around      collaboration between patients, family resources, and tailored interventions      (Gottlieb & Feeley, 2005). As students placed in a critical care setting, we      began to realize the complexity of care required to nurse these patients and      their families. In this paper, a case study is used to describe and share our      learning experiences of caring for a patient with a biventricular assist device,       as well as the principles that guided our interventions.FAU - Doucette, ElaineAU  - Doucette EAD  - School of Nursing, McGill University, Montreal, QC. elaine.doucette@mcgill.caFAU - Cyr, JessicaAU  - Cyr JFAU - Graham, RobynAU  - Graham RFAU - Killackey, TieghanAU  - Killackey TFAU - Leblanc, LauraAU  - Leblanc LFAU - Martinson, KylaAU  - Martinson KFAU - Verleun, JeannetteAU  - Verleun JLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - DynamicsJT  - Dynamics (Pembroke, Ont.)JID - 100955578SB  - NMH  - CanadaMH  - Cerebral Infarction/*etiologyMH  - Education, NursingMH  - Heart Failure/*nursing/surgery/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Intensive Care UnitsMH  - *Nurse-Patient RelationsMH  - *Palliative CareEDAT- 2012/10/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/11/03 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/06 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Dynamics. 2012 Fall;23(3):20-3.- 23035376own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20121005dcom- 20121102is  - 1497-3715 (print)is  - 1497-3715 (linking)vi  - 23ip  - 3dp  - 2012 fallti  - bivads: a bridge to the future for patients and their families: the art and      science of nursing combined in the face of technology.pg  - 20-3ab  - approximately 500,000 canadians live with heart failure (ross et al., 2006).      these numbers continue to rise due to advancing technology and successes in      treating cardiac conditions and potentially fatal events such as myocardial      infarctions. according to carrier (2005), individuals with damaged hearts are      living longer, and lives are being successfully saved with the surge of      cardiovascular assist devices developed in recent years, which are increasingly      used as a bridge to transplant. despite the lifesaving capabilities of      ventricular-assist devices, these innovations pose risks and complications that      can be debilitating for patients and their families (carrier, 2005). as this      complex trajectory is navigated, nurses provide care and support to the patient      and family while playing a unique role in the assessment and monitoring of these       devices. a family-centred nursing model provides a framework for practice when      nursing patients and families are in crisis. the foundations of the mcgill model       of nursing are focused on a strengths-based approach, revolving around      collaboration between patients, family resources, and tailored interventions      (gottlieb & feeley, 2005). as students placed in a critical care setting, we      began to realize the complexity of care required to nurse these patients and      their families. in this paper, a case study is used to describe and share our      learning experiences of caring for a patient with a biventricular assist device,       as well as the principles that guided our interventions.fau - doucette, elaineau  - doucette ead  - school of nursing, mcgill university, montreal, qc. elaine.doucette@mcgill.cafau - cyr, jessicaau  - cyr jfau - graham, robynau  - graham rfau - killackey, tieghanau  - killackey tfau - leblanc, lauraau  - leblanc lfau - martinson, kylaau  - martinson kfau - verleun, jeannetteau  - verleun jla  - engpt  - case reportspt  - journal articlepl  - canadata  - dynamicsjt  - dynamics (pembroke, ont.)jid - 100955578sb  - nmh  - canadamh  - cerebral infarction/*etiologymh  - education, nursingmh  - heart failure/*nursing/surgery/therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - heart-assist devices/*adverse effectsmh  - humansmh  - intensive care unitsmh  - *nurse-patient relationsmh  - *palliative careedat- 2012/10/06 06:00mhda- 2012/11/03 06:00crdt- 2012/10/06 06:00pst - ppublishso  - dynamics. 2012 fall;23(3):20-3.
