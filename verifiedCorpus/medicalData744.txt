The transverse (t)-tubule system guarantees the proximity of the       triggers for Ca(2+) release [L-type Ca(2+) channel, dihydropyridine receptors      (DHPRs)] and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channels [ryanodine      receptors (RyRs)]. Transverse tubule disruption occurs early in heart failure      (HF). Clinical studies of left ventricular assist devices in HF indicate that      mechanical unloading induces reverse remodelling. We hypothesize that unloading      of failing hearts normalizes t-tubule structure and improves CICR. METHODS AND      RESULTS: Heart failure was induced in Lewis rats by left coronary artery ligation      for 12 weeks; sham-operated animals were used as controls. Failing hearts were      mechanically unloaded for 4 weeks by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation       (HF-UN). HF reduced the t-tubule density measured by di-8-ANEPPS staining in      isolated left ventricular myocytes, and this was reversed by unloading. The      deterioration in the regularity of the t-tubule system in HF was also reversed in      HF-UN. Scanning ion conductance microscopy showed the reappearance of normal      surface striations in HF-UN. Electron microscopy revealed recovery of normal      t-tubule microarchitecture in HF-UN. L-type Ca(2+) current density, measured      using whole-cell patch clamping, was reduced in HF but unaffected by unloading.      The variance of the time-to-peak of the Ca(2+) transient, an index of CICR      dyssynchrony, was increased in HF and normalized by unloading. The increased      Ca(2+) spark frequency observed in HF was reduced in HF-UN. These results could      be explained by the recoupling of orphaned RyRs in HF, as indicated by      immunofluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that mechanical unloading of the      failing heart reverses the pathological remodelling of the t-tubule system and      improves CICR.FAU - Ibrahim, MichaelAU  - Ibrahim MAD  - Laboratory of Cell Electrophysiology, Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial      College London, London, UK.FAU - Navaratnarajah, ManorajAU  - Navaratnarajah MFAU - Siedlecka, UrszulaAU  - Siedlecka UFAU - Rao, ChristopherAU  - Rao CFAU - Dias, PriyanthiAU  - Dias PFAU - Moshkov, Alexey VAU  - Moshkov AVFAU - Gorelik, JuliaAU  - Gorelik JFAU - Yacoub, Magdi HAU  - Yacoub MHFAU - Terracciano, Cesare MAU  - Terracciano CMLA  - engGR  - FS/09/025/27468/British Heart Foundation/United KingdomPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120401PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595RN  - 0 (Calcium Channels, T-Type)SB  - IMMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - AnimalsMH  - *Calcium Channels, T-TypeMH  - Disease Models, AnimalMH  - Disease ProgressionMH  - Heart Failure/*pathologyMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - MaleMH  - Myocardial Contraction/*physiologyMH  - Myocytes, Cardiac/*pathologyMH  - RatsMH  - Rats, Inbred LewMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Ventricular RemodelingPMC - PMC3359860OID - NLM: PMC3359860EDAT- 2012/04/03 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/06 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/03 06:00PHST- 2012/04/01 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2012/04/18 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2012/04/18 [aheadofprint]AID - hfs038 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs038 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2012 Jun;14(6):571-80. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs038.
