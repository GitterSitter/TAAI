The goal of this study was to measure the impact of this      allosensitization on outcomes. METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed      in BTT patients, with sensitization defined as peak PRAs >/= 10%. Baseline      characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using      descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. RESULTS:      Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21      non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47% vs. 10%, p =       0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular      rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).      Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection      (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier      log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of       infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION:      Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. This mortality      appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the      development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.CI  - (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
