Mechanical      circulatory support using VADs has been an essential therapeutic tool for      patients with severe heart failure waiting for a heart transplant in clinical      site. Adaptive control of VADs that automatically adjust the pump output with      changes in a patient state is one of the important approaches for enhanced      therapeutic efficacy, prevention of complications and quality of life      improvement. However adaptively controlling a VAD in the realistic situation      would be difficult because it is necessary to model the whole including the VAD      and the cardiovascular dynamics. To solve this problem, we propose an application      of attractor selection algorithm using stochastic behavior to a VAD control      system. In this study, we sought to investigate whether this proposed method can       be used to adaptively control of a VAD in the simple case of a continuous flow      VAD. The flow rate control algorithm was constructed on the basis of a      stochastically searching algorithm as one example of application. The validity of      the constructed control algorithm was examined in a mock circuit. As a result, in      response to a low-flow state with the different causes, the flow rate of the pump      reached a target value with self adaptive behavior without designing the detailed      control rule based on the experience or the model of the control target.FAU - Ohnuma, KentaroAU  - Ohnuma KFAU - Sumikura, HirohitoAU  - Sumikura HFAU - Homma, AkihikoAU  - Homma AFAU - Tsukiya, TomonoriAU  - Tsukiya TFAU - Mizuno, ToshihideAU  - Mizuno TFAU - Takewa, YoshiakiAU  - Takewa YFAU - Tatsumi, EisukeAU  - Tatsumi ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol SocJT  - Conference proceedings : ...
