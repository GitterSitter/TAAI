We      describe our experience with the conversion of an extracorporeal ventricular      assist system (VAS), the NIPRO VAS, to an implantable LVAS, the EVAHEART LVAS. A       32-year-old man underwent a NIPRO VAS implantation as a bridge to decision for a       condition consistent with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support profile 1. He was later diagnosed with secondary      cardiomyopathy due to cardiac sarcoidosis. During the period in which he had      NIPRO VAS support, no significant bacterial cultures were obtained from the      cannula-piercing site, and no systemic infection occurred. Approximately 5 months      after the NIPRO VAS implantation, he underwent an EVAHEART LVAS implantation as a      BTB. The procedure required technical modifications, including the anastomosis of      outflow grafts, trimming of the apical cuff, and creation of a pump pocket. The      operation was completed uneventfully. The patient completed the discharge program      for awaiting heart transplantation at home. Approximately 6 months after the      EVAHEART LVAS implantation, he continues to do well without any complications,      including infection, and visits our hospital as an outpatient. Conversion to an      implantable LVAS can be beneficial in carefully selected patients after      ascertaining the operative indications and operation timing.FAU - Ushijima, TomokiAU  - Ushijima TAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.FAU - Tanoue, YoshihisaAU  - Tanoue YFAU - Hirayama, KazutoAU  - Hirayama KFAU - Nakashima, AtsuhiroAU  - Nakashima AFAU - Tominaga, RyujiAU  - Tominaga RLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121208PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiomyopathies/*diagnosis/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleEDAT- 2012/12/12 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/11 06:00PHST- 2012/06/04 [received]PHST- 2012/11/14 [accepted]PHST- 2012/12/08 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-012-0678-9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2013 Jun;16(2):248-52. doi: 10.1007/s10047-012-0678-9.
