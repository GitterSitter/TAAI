We sought to characterize neurological events in children supported      with the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device. METHODS AND RESULTS: The multicenter      prospective cohort consisted of all 204 children implanted with the Berlin Heart       EXCOR((R)) device at 47 centers in North America between May 2007 and December      2010. There were 73 neurological events in 59 patients, with 29% of the cohort      experiencing >/=1 neurological event. Events included 52 strokes in 43 patients      (21% of the cohort). The neurological event rate was 0.51 events per 100      patient-days. Many of the neurological events occurred early in the course of      support, with 30 events recorded during the first 14 days of support. The      mortality rate in participants with at least 1 neurological event was 42% (25 of       59), significantly higher than the 18% mortality rate (26 of 145) for those who      did not have a neurological event (P=0.0006). Risk-factor analysis did not      identify significant preimplantation predictors of neurological injury.      CONCLUSIONS: Of children treated with the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device as a      bridge to transplant, 29% experienced at least 1 neurological event. The majority      of neurological events were ischemic strokes, and many of those occurred early in      the course of support. Neurological injury was the leading cause of death after      implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device. Risk stratification for      stroke or neurological injury is not possible based on baseline preimplantation      characteristics. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.
