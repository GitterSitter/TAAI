METHODS: We implemented a       clinical protocol to achieve maximal neurohormonal blockade after placement of a       CF-LVAD and assessed its utility in an LVAD weaning (6,200 rpm) study.      Thirty-four subjects were enrolled after CF-LVAD and were managed with      aggressive, bi-weekly up-titration of HFMED. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (8 with      coronary artery disease, 13 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) were included      in this LVAD weaning investigation. Overall, combined CF-LVAD and HFMED resulted       in significant reverse remodeling with a decrease in left atrial volume index      (44.7+/-16.0 to 31.6+/-12.1 ml/m(2), p < 0.001) and LV internal diastolic      diameter (6.7+/-1.5 to 6.0+/-1.6 cm, p = 0.003) and an increase in LV ejection      fraction (17.4+/-6.5 to 33.1+/-16.2%, p < 0.001) during LVAD weaning (6,200 rpm).      Five of 21 (24%) subjects demonstrated recovery of biventricular function.      Exploratory analysis showed that recovered subjects had shorter duration HF, less      myocardial fibrosis and less myocyte hypertrophy, and were supported at higher      LVAD speeds. CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support in combination with HFMED leads to      significant reverse remodeling in patients with advanced HF. Using this approach,      one quarter of patients demonstrated complete recovery of cardiac function. Our      results suggest that bridge to recovery in the current device era is a clinically      meaningful phenomenon and merits further investigation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
