Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) modulates ECM production during      inflammatory tissue injury, but available data on CTGF gene expression in failing      human heart and its response to mechanical unloading are limited. METHODS AND      RESULTS: Left ventricle (LV) tissue from patients undergoing cardiac      transplantation for ischemic (ICM; n = 20) and dilated (DCM; n = 20)      cardiomyopathies and from nonfailing (NF; n = 20) donor hearts were examined.      Paired samples (n = 15) from patients undergoing LV assist device (LVAD)      implantation as "bridge to transplant" (34-1,145 days) also were analyzed. There       was more interstitial fibrosis in both ICM and DCM compared with NF hearts.      Hydroxyproline concentration was also significantly increased in DCM compared      with NF samples. The expression of CTGF, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1,       collagen (COL) 1-alpha1, COL3-alpha1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, and MMP9       mRNA in ICM and DCM were also significantly elevated compared with NF samples.      Although TGF-beta1, CTGF, COL1-alpha1, and COL3-alpha1 mRNA levels were reduced      by unloading, there was only a modest reduction in tissue fibrosis and no      difference in protein-bound hydroxyproline concentration between pre- and      post-LVAD tissue samples. The persistent fibrosis may be related to a concomitant      reduction in MMP9 mRNA and protein levels following unloading. CONCLUSIONS: CTGF       may be a key regulator of fibrosis during maladaptive remodeling and progression       to HF. Although mechanical unloading normalizes most genotypic and functional      abnormalities, its effect on ECM remodeling during HF is incomplete.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
