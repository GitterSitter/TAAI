The purpose of this review is to discuss four      sub-classifications of cardiogenic shock patients (acute myocardial infarction,      acute decompensated heart failure, biventricular failure, and myocarditis), and      explore management considerations for these groups, with particular emphasis on      strategies for device placement. RECENT FINDINGS: In single-center studies, the      use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, percutaneous ventricular assist      devices, and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has allowed      approximately half of cardiogenic shock patients to receive an implantable left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant, or experience myocardial      recovery. Primary implantation of a durable LVAD in well-selected myocardial      infarction shock patients was associated with a 1-year survival of 86% in one      small case series. Analysis of a multi-institutional database suggests patients      older than 65 years have a lower post-implantation survival compared with younger      recipients. SUMMARY: Device selection strategies for INTERMACS I patients are      predicated on a patient's prognosis, hemodynamic stability, end organ, and      neurologic status. Percutaneous assist devices may be preferred for patients with      favorable prognoses, ECMO for patients with hemodynamic compromise, and durable      mechanical support for patients failing to recover sustainable myocardial      function after short-term device use.FAU - Dutt, Debleena PainAU  - Dutt DPAD  - Zena and Michael A.
