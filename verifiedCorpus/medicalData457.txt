This may be of therapeutic relevance in identifying novel      pharmacological targets for therapies that could facilitate recovery after VAD      implantation. METHODS: Twenty-two patients bridged to heart transplantation (HTx)      with VAD were included in the study. A group of patients underwent moderate      intensity aerobic exercise (GT), while another group of patients did not receive       exercise training (CG). Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1) protein and      total (t) and phosphorylated (p) protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal      kinase (JNK) kinase signalling were measured in myocardial tissue by western      blotting at pre-VAD and pre-HTx period. In addition, Thyroid hormone (TH) levels       were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Peak oxygen consumption (VO2) at pre-HTx period      was higher in patients subjected to training protocol [18.0 (0.8) for GT when      compared with 13.7 (0.7) for CG group, P = 0.002]. N-terminal-prohormone of brain      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were 1068 (148) for CG vs 626 (115) for GT      group, P = 0.035. A switch towards up-regulation of physiological growth      signalling was observed: the ratio of p-Akt/t-Akt was 2-fold higher in GT vs CG,       P < 0.05 while p-JNK/t-JNK was 2.5-fold lower (P < 0.05) in GT vs CG, in pre-HTx       samples. This response was accompanied by a 2.0-fold increase in TRalpha1      expression in pre-HTx samples with concomitant increase in circulating T3 in GT      vs CG, P < 0.05. No differences in peak VO2, NT-proBNP, T3, TRalpha1, p/t-AKT and      p/t-JNK were found between groups in the pre-VAD period. CONCLUSIONS: The      unloaded failing myocardium responded to physical training by enhancing thyroid      hormone signalling. This response was associated with an up-regulation of Akt and      suppression of JNK activation.FAU - Adamopoulos, StamatiosAU  - Adamopoulos SAD  - Department of Cardiology, Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Athens, Greece.FAU - Gouziouta, AggelikiAU  - Gouziouta AFAU - Mantzouratou, PolixeniAU  - Mantzouratou PFAU - Laoutaris, Ioannis DAU  - Laoutaris IDFAU - Dritsas, AthanasiosAU  - Dritsas AFAU - Cokkinos, Dennis VAU  - Cokkinos DVFAU - Mourouzis, IordanisAU  - Mourouzis IFAU - Sfyrakis, PetrosAU  - Sfyrakis PFAU - Iervasi, GiorgioAU  - Iervasi GFAU - Pantos, ConstantinosAU  - Pantos CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130702PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 0 (Peptide Fragments)RN  - 0 (Thyroid Hormone Receptors alpha)RN  - 0 (Thyroid Hormones)RN  - 0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))RN  - 114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)RN  - EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)RN  - EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - *Exercise TherapyMH  - FemaleMH  - GreeceMH  - Heart Failure/blood/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolismMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardium/*metabolismMH  - Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/bloodMH  - Oxygen ConsumptionMH  - Peptide Fragments/bloodMH  - PhosphorylationMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktMH  - *Signal TransductionMH  - Thyroid Hormone Receptors alpha/metabolismMH  - Thyroid Hormones/*bloodMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular FunctionPMC - PMC3781806OID - NLM: PMC3781806OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Exercise trainingOT  - Heart failureOT  - Kinase signallingOT  - Thyroid hormoneOT  - Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1EDAT- 2013/07/04 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/04 06:00PHST- 2013/07/02 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt294 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt294 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2013 Oct;17(4):664-8. doi: 10.1093/icvts/ivt294.
