The difficulties in procuring fresh      left ventricular (LV) myocardium from humans for assessment of mitochondrial      function have resulted in the reliance on surrogate markers of mitochondrial      function and limited our understanding of cardiac energetics. We isolated      mitochondria from fresh LV wall tissue of patients with heart failure and reduced      systolic function undergoing heart transplant or left ventricular assist device      placement, and compared their function to mitochondria isolated from the      non-failing LV (NFLV) wall tissue with normal systolic function from patients      with pulmonary hypertension undergoing heart-lung transplant. We performed      detailed mitochondrial functional analyses using 4 substrates: glutamate-malate      (GM), pyruvate-malate (PM) palmitoyl carnitine-malate (PC) and succinate. NFLV      mitochondria showed preserved respiratory control ratios and electron chain      integrity with only few differences for the 4 substrates. In contrast, HF      mitochondria had greater respiration with GM, PM and PC substrates and higher      electron chain capacity for PM than for PC. Surprisingly, HF mitochondria had      greater respiratory control ratios and lower ADP-independent state 4 rates than      NFLV mitochondria for GM, PM and PC substrates demonstrating that HF mitochondria      are capable of coupled respiration ex vivo. Gene expression studies revealed      decreased expression of key genes in pathways for oxidation of both fatty acids      and glucose. Our results suggest that mitochondria from the failing LV myocardium      are capable of tightly coupled respiration when isolated and supplied with ample       substrates. Thus energy starvation in the failing heart may be the result of      dysregulation of metabolic pathways, impaired substrate supply or reduced      mitochondrial number but not the result of reduced mitochondrial electron      transport capacity.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
