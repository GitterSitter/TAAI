The function of VADs differs from that of artificial cardiac pacemakers. Some VADs are intended for short term use, typically for patients recovering from heart attacks or heart surgery, while others are intended for long-term use (months to years and in some cases for life), typically for patients suffering from advanced congestive heart failure.\r\n\r\nVADs are distinct from artificial hearts, which are designed to completely take over cardiac function and generally require the removal of the patient\'s heart. VADs are designed to assist either the right (RVAD) or left (LVAD) ventricle, or both at once (BiVAD). The type that is used depends primarily on the underlying heart disease and the pulmonary arterial resistance that determines the load on the right ventricle.\r\n\r\nLVADs are most commonly used, but when pulmonary arterial resistance is high, right ventricular assistance may become necessary. Long term VADs are normally used to keep patients alive with a good quality of life while they wait for a heart transplantation (known as a \"bridge to transplantation\"). However, LVADs are sometimes used as destination therapy, meaning they will never undergo heart transplant, and sometimes as a bridge to recovery.[1][2]\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, VADs have improved significantly in terms of providing survival and quality of life among recipients.[3]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Design\r\n1.1 Pumps\r\n2 History\r\n3 Studies and outcomes\r\n3.1 Recent developments\r\n3.2 HeartMate II LVAD pivotal study\r\n3.3 HARPS\r\n3.4 REMATCH\r\n4 Complications and side effects\r\n5 List of implantable VAD devices\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nDesign[edit]\r\n\r\nClose-up illustration of typical left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nPumps[edit]\r\nThe pumps used in VADs can be divided into two main categories â€“ pulsatile pumps, that mimic the natural pulsing action of the heart, and continuous flow pumps.[4] Pulsatile VADs use positive displacement pumps. In some of these pumps, the volume occupied by blood varies during the pumping cycle, and if the pump is contained inside the body then a vent tube to the outside air is required.\r\n\r\nContinuous flow VADs are smaller and have proven to be more durable than pulsatile VADs.[5] They normally use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of the rotor\'s axis.[6]\r\n\r\nAn important issue with continuous flow pumps is the method used to suspend the rotor. Early versions used solid bearings; however, newer pumps, some of which are approved for use in the EU, use either electromagnetic suspension (\"maglev\")[7][8][9][10] or hydrodynamic suspension. These pumps contain only one moving part.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\n\r\n1966 DeBakey ventricular assist device.[11]\r\nThe first successful implantation of a left ventricular assist device was completed in 1966 by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey to a 37-year old woman. A paracorporeal (external) circuit was able to provide mechanical support for 10 days after the surgery.[12] The first successful long-term implantation of an artificial LVAD was conducted in 1988 by Dr. William F. Bernhard of Boston Children\'s Hospital Medical Center and Thermedics, Inc of Woburn, MA under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research contract which developed Heart-mate, an electronically controlled assist device. This was funded by a three year $6.2 million contract to Thermedics and Children\'s Hospital, Boston MA from the National Heart and Lung and Blood Institute, a program of NIH.[13] The early VADs emulated the heart by using a \"pulsatile\" action where blood is alternately sucked into the pump from the left ventricle then forced out into the aorta. Devices of this kind include the HeartMate IP LVAS, which was approved for use in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 1994. These devices are commonly referred to as first generation VADs.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nMore recent work has concentrated on continuous flow pumps, which can be roughly categorized as either centrifugal pumps or axial flow impeller driven pumps. These pumps have the advantage of greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability. These devices are referred to as second generation VADs. A side effect is that the user will not have a pulse, or that the pulse intensity will be seriously reduced[citation needed].\r\n\r\nThird generation VADs suspend the impeller in the pump using either hydrodynamic or electromagnetic suspension, thus removing the need for bearings and reducing the number of moving parts to one.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nAnother technology undergoing clinical trials is the use of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using percutaneous cables. Apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action. A pulsatile pump using this technology has CE Mark approval and is in clinical trials for US FDA approval.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nA very different approach in the early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta. Inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand â€“ in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle. A proposed refinement is to use the patient\'s skeletal muscle, driven by a pacemaker, to power this device which would make it truly self-contained. However a similar operation (cardiomyoplasty) was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results. In any case, it has substantial potential advantages in avoiding the need to operate on the heart itself and in avoiding any contact between blood and the device. This approach involves a return to a pulsatile flow.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPeter Houghton was the longest surviving recipient of a VAD for permanent use. He received an experimental Jarvik 2000 LVAD in June 2000. Since then, he completed a 91-mile charity walk, published two books, lectured widely, hiked in the Swiss Alps and the American West, flew in an ultra-light aircraft, and traveled extensively around the world. He died of acute renal failure in 2007 at the age of 69.[14][15]\r\n\r\nStudies and outcomes[edit]\r\nRecent developments[edit]\r\nIn July 2009 in England, surgeons removed a donor heart that had been implanted in a toddler next to her native heart, after her native heart had recovered. This technique suggests mechanical assist device, such as an LVAD, can take some or all the work away from the native heart and allow it time to heal.[16]\r\nIn July 2009, 18-month follow-up results from the HeartMate II Clinical Trial concluded that continuous-flow LVAD provides effective hemodynamic support for at least 18 months in patients awaiting transplantation, with improved functional status and quality of life. (see below).[17]\r\nHeidelberg University Hospital reported in July 2009 that the first HeartAssist5, known as the modern version of the DeBakey VAD, was implanted there. The HeartAssist5 weighs 92 grams, is made of titanium and plastic, and serves to pump blood from the left ventricle into the aorta.[18]\r\nA phase 1 clinical trial is underway (as of August 2009), consisting of patients with coronary artery bypass grafting and patients in end-stage heart failure who have a left ventricular assist device. The trial involves testing a patch, called Anginera(TM) that contains cells that secrete hormone-like growth factors that stimulate other cells to grow. The patches are seeded with heart muscle cells and then implanted onto the heart with the goal of getting the muscle cells to start communicating with native tissues in a way that allows for regular contractions.[19][20]\r\nIn September 2009, a New Zealand news outlet, Stuff, reported that in another 18 months to two years, a new wireless device will be ready for clinical trial that will power VADs without direct contact. If successful, this may reduce the chance of infection as a result of the power cable through the skin.[21]\r\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a $2.8 million grant to develop a \"pulse-less\" total artificial heart using two VADS by Micromed, initially created by Michael DeBakey and George Noon. The grant was renewed for a second year of research in August 2009. The Total Artificial Heart was created using two HeartAssist5 VADs, whereby one VAD pumps blood throughout the body and the other circulates blood to and from the lungs.[22]\r\nHeartWare International announced in August 2009 that it had surpassed 50 implants of their HeartWare Ventricular Assist System in their ADVANCE Clinical Trial, an FDA-approved IDE study. The study is to assess the system as bridge-to-transplantation system for patients with end-stage heart failure. The study, Evaluation of the HeartWare LVAD System for the Treatment of Advance Heart Failure, is a multi-center study that started in May 2009.[23][24]\r\nOn June 27, 2014 Hannover Medical School in Hannover, Germany performed the first human implant of HeartMate III under the direction of Professor Axel Haverich M.D., chief of the Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery Department and surgeon Jan Schmitto, M.D., Ph.D.[25]\r\nOn January 21, 2015 a study was published in Journal of American College of Cardiology suggesting that long-term use of LVAD may induce heart regeneration.[26] This may explain the bridge to recovery phenomenon first described by the Yacoub group in NEJM in 2009 (above).\r\nThe majority of VADs on the market today are somewhat bulky. The smallest device approved by the FDA, the HeartMate II, weighs about 1 pound (0.45 kg) and measures 3 inches (7.6 cm). This has proven particularly important for women and children, for whom alternatives would have been too large.[27]\r\n\r\nOne device gained CE Mark approval for use in the EU and began clinical trials in the US (VentrAssist). As of June 2007 these pumps had been implanted in over 100 patients. In 2009, Ventracor was placed into the hands of Administrators due to financial problems and was later that year liquidated. No other companies purchased the technology, so as a result the VentrAssist device was essentially defunct. Around 30â€“50 patients worldwide remain supported on VentrAssist devices as of January 2010.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe Heartware HVAD works similarly to the VentrAssist â€“ albeit much smaller and not requiring an abdominal pocket to be implanted into. The device has obtained CE Mark in Europe, and FDA approval in the U.S. Recently, it was shown that the Heartware HVAD can be implanted through limited access without sternotomy.[28]\r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases left ventricular assist devices, combined with drug therapy, have enabled the heart to recover sufficiently for the device to be able to be removed (explanted).[1][2]\r\n\r\nHeartMate II LVAD pivotal study[edit]\r\nA series of studies involving the use of the of HeartMate II LVAD have proven useful in establishing the viability and risks of using LVADs for bridge-to-transplantation and destination therapy.\r\n\r\nThe pilot trial for the HeartMate II LVAS began in November 2003 and consisted of 46 study patients at 15 centers. Results included 11 patients supported for more than one year and three patients supported for more than two years.\r\nThe HeartMate II pivotal trial began in 2005 and included the evaluation of HeartMate II for two indications: Bridge to transplantation (BTT) and destination therapy (DT), or long-term, permanent support. Thoratec Corp. announced that this was the first time the FDA had approved a clinical trial to include both indications in one protocol.[29][30][31]\r\nA multicenter study in the United States from 2005 to 2007 with 113 patients (of which 100 reported principal outcomes) showed that significant improvements in function were prevalent after three months, and a survival rate of 68\% after twelve months.[32]\r\nBased on one-year follow up data from the first 194 patients enrolled in the trial, the FDA approved HeartMate II for bridge-to-transplantation. The trial provided clinical evidence of improved survival rates and quality of life for a broad range of patients.[33][34]\r\nEighteen-month follow up data on 281 patients who had either reached the study end-point or completed 18 months of post-operative follow-up showed improved survival, less frequent adverse events and greater reliability with continuous flow LVADS compared to pulsatile flow devices. Of the 281 patients, 157 patients had undergone transplant, 58 patients were continuing with LVADs in their body and seven patients had the LVAD removed because their heart recovered; the remaining 56 had died. The results showed that the NYHA Class of heart failure the patients had been designated had significantly improved after six months of LVAD support compared to the pre-LVAD baseline. Although this trial involved bridge-to-transplant indication, the results provide early evidence that continuous flow LVADs have advantages in terms of durability and reliability for patients receiving mechanical support for destination therapy.[35]\r\nFollowing the FDA approval of HeartMate II LVAD for bridge-to-transplantation purposes, a post-approval (\"registry\") study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of the device in a commercial setting. The study found that the device improved outcomes, both compared to other LVAD treatments and baseline patients. Specifically, HeartMate II patients showed lower creatinine levels, 30-day survival rates were considerably higher at 96\%, and 93\% reached successful outcomes (transplant, cardiac recovery, or long-term LVAD).[36]\r\nHARPS[edit]\r\nThe Harefield Recovery Protocol Study (HARPS) is a clinical trial to evaluate whether advanced heart failure patients requiring VAD support can recover sufficient myocardial function to allow device removal (known as explantation). HARPS combines an LVAD (the HeartMate XVE) with conventional oral heart failure medications, followed by the novel Î²2 agonist clenbuterol. This opens the possibility that some advanced heart failure patients may forgo heart transplantation.[37]\r\n\r\nTo date, 73\% (11 of 15) of patients who underwent the combination therapy regimen demonstrated sufficient recovery to allow explantation and avoid heart transplantation; freedom from recurrent heart failure in surviving patients was 100\% and 89\% at one and four years after explantation, respectively; average ejection fraction was 64\% at 59 months after explantation â€“ all patients were NYHA Class I; and no significant adverse effects were reported with clenbuterol therapy.\r\n\r\nREMATCH[edit]\r\nThe REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure) clinical trial began in May 1998 and ran through July 2001 in 20 cardiac transplant centers around the USA. The trial was designed to compare long-term implantation of left ventricular assist devices with optimal medical management for patients with end-stage heart failure who require, but do not qualify to receive cardiac transplantation. As a result of the clinical outcomes, the device received FDA approval for both indications, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.[38]\r\n\r\nThe trial demonstrated an 81\% improvement in two-year survival among patients receiving HeartMate XVE compared to optimal medical management. In addition, a destination therapy study following the REMATCH trial demonstrated an additional 17\% improvement (61\% vs. 52\%) in one-year survival of patients that were implanted with a VAD (HeartMate XVE), with an implication for the appropriate selection of candidates and timing of VAD implantation.\r\n\r\nA test carried out in 2001 by Dr. Eric A. Rose and REMATCH study group with patients with congestive heart failure that were ineligible for a transplant showed a survival at two years of 23\% for those implanted with an LVAD compared with 8\% for those who were treated with drugs. The two major complications of VAD implantation were infection and mechanical failure (see below).\r\n\r\nAccording to a retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated with a left ventricular assist device versus inotrope therapy while awaiting heart transplantation, the group treated with LVAD had improved clinical and metabolic function at the time of transplant with better blood pressure, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. After transplant, 57.7\% of the inotrope group had renal failure versus 16.6\% in the LVAD group; 31.6\% of the inotrope group had right heart failure versus 5.6\% in the LVAD group; and event-free survival was 15.8\% in the inotrope group versus 55.6\% in the LVAD group.[39]\r\n\r\nComplications and side effects[edit]\r\nEarly postoperative bleeding complications are a major cause of morbidity and reoperation in LVAD patients.[40] Bleeding is the most common postoperative early complication after implantation or explantation of LVADs, necessitating reoperation in up to 60\% of recipients.[41] The implications of massive blood transfusions are great and include infection, pulmonary insufficiency, increased costs, right heart failure, allosensitization, and viral transmission, some of which can prove fatal or preclude transplantation.[41] When bleeding occurs, it impacts the one year Kaplan-Meier mortality.[40] In addition to complexity of the patient population and the complexity of these procedures contributing to bleeding, the devices themselves may contribute to the severe coagulopathy that can ensue when these devices are implanted.[42] Critical in the management of bleeding in the early hours after implantation or explantation is to adequately evacuate the post-surgical blood from around the heart and lungs to prevent retained blood from contributing to the need for reoperation to wash out clot that can compress the device features and contribute to post operative shock. Preventing chest tube clogging during this period is critical to recovery.[41]\r\n\r\nBecause the devices generally result in blood flowing over a non-biologic surface, predisposing the blood to clotting, there is need for anticoagulation measures. One device, the HeartMate XVE, is designed with a biologic surface derived from fibrin and does not require long term anticoagulation (except aspirin); unfortunately, this biologic surface may also predispose the patient to infection through selective reduction of certain types of leukocytes.[43]\r\n\r\nNew VAD designs which are now approved for use in the European Community and are undergoing trials for FDA approval have all but eliminated mechanical failure.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nVAD-related infection can be caused by a large number of different organisms:[44]\r\n\r\nGram positive bacteria (Staphylococci, especially Staph. aureus, Enterococci)\r\nGram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, Klebsiella species)\r\nFungi. especially Candida species\r\nTreatment of VAD-related infection is exceedingly difficult and many patients die of infection despite optimal treatment. Initial treatment should be with broad spectrum antibiotics, but every effort must be made to obtain appropriate samples for culture. A final decision regarding antibiotic therapy must be based on the results of microbiogical cultures.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nOther problems include immunosuppression, clotting with resultant stroke, and bleeding secondary to anticoagulation. Some of the polyurethane components used in the devices cause the deletion of a subset of immune cells when blood comes in contact with them. This predisposes the patient to fungal and some viral infections necessitating appropriate prophylactic therapy.[45]\r\n\r\nConsidering the multitude of risks and lifestyle modifications associated with ventricular assist device implant,[46] it is important for prospective patients to be informed prior to decision making.[47] In addition to physician consult, various Internet-based patient directed resources are available to assist in patient education.[48][49]\r\n\r\nList of implantable VAD devices[edit]\r\nAmbox current red.svg\r\nThis section is outdated.

assistSupportDevices3.txt,'1\r\nIndications for Ventricle Assist Devices\r\nGuillermo Reyes and Sara Badia\r\nHospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid\r\nSpain\r\n1. Introduction\r\nDespite widespread use of evidence-based therapies the morbidity and mortality of heart\r\nfailure has not changed, and it remains the most common hospital discharge diagnosis for\r\npatients older than 65 years old of age. Approximately 5 million patients in the United States\r\nof America have cardiac failure, and over 550,000 patients are diagnosed with heart failure\r\nfor the first time each year (Levy et al, 2002; Hunt et al, 2005). The European Society of\r\nCardiology represents countries with a population of more than 900 million, and in their last\r\nguidelines they reported that there are at least 15 million patients suffering this disease in\r\nthose 51 countries (Dickstein et al, 2008). Heart failure is primarily a condition of the elderly\r\n(Kannel & Belanger, 1991), and thus the widely recognized â€œaging of the populationâ€? also\r\ncontributes to the increasing incidence of heart disease. The incidence of cardiac failure\r\napproaches 10 per 1,000 population after age 65 years, and approximately about 80\% of\r\npatients hospitalized with heart failure are older than 65 years old (Masoudi & Havranek,\r\n2002).\r\nThere are several reasons that may explain why the prevalence of heart failure is increasing:\r\nageing of the population, the success in prolonging survival in coronary patients, and the\r\nsuccess in postponing coronary events by effective prevention in those patients at high risk\r\nor those patients who have already survived a first event (secondary prevention) (Senni et\r\nal, 1999). Advances in medical therapy have resulted in improved survival in patients with\r\nmoderate and severe heart failure, but the prognosis for end-stage heart failure patients still\r\nremains poor. The conclusion of all these aspects is that there is a change in the\r\ndemographics of heart failure patients in recent years, and an increased survival of older\r\npatients with heart disease.\r\nAt present time, cardiac transplantation remains the gold standard of cardiac replacement\r\ntherapy. However, the supply of donor hearts is limited and therefore is not an option for\r\nmany patients because of age and other comorbid conditions. Alternative forms of\r\ncardiac replacement therapy are being investigating. This includes cell therapy,\r\nxenotransplantation, ventricle assist devices implantation and total artificial heart.\r\nAlthough initially the indications for heart mechanical assistance are similar to those\r\ndeveloped in the1960s for the use of intra-aortic balloon pumps the indications have\r\ndeveloped into more complex cases which must be considered. Ventricle assist devices are\r\nmore and more reliable and its size is becoming smaller with the passing of time, improving\r\npatientâ€™s outcomes.\r\nwww.intechopen.com4 Ventricular Assist Devices\r\n2. Cardiac transplantation: where we are and what can we expect\r\nThe first human cardiac transplant was performed by Dr. Barnard in Cape Town in South\r\nAfrica in 1967. With the development of immunosuppression, orthotopic cardiac\r\ntransplantation, what exists today, is a highly successful procedure for the treatment of endstage\r\nheart disease. Over time, survival of patients undergoing orthotopic heart\r\ntransplantation has improved significantly, mainly due to a reduction in rejection rates,\r\nbetter prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and defined management\r\nprotocols (Taylor D et al, 2008).\r\nIndications for cardiac transplantation at the present time include patients with severe heart\r\nfailure symptoms, a poor prognosis, and with no alternative form of treatment (class of\r\nrecommendation I, level of evidence C). Contraindications to heart transplantation are:\r\ncurrent alcohol and/or drug abuse, lack of proper cooperation, serious mental disease not\r\nproperly controlled, treated cancer with remission and, 5 years follow-up, systemic disease\r\nwith multiorgan involvement, active infection, significant renal failure (creatinine clearance\r\n<50 mL/min), irreversible high pulmonary vascular resistance (6â€“8 Wood units and mean\r\ntranspulmonary gradient >15 mmHg), recent thromboembolic complications, unhealed\r\npeptic ulcer, evidence of significant liver impairment, or other serious co-morbidities with a\r\npoor prognosis. Patients must be well informed, motivated, emotionally stable, and capable\r\nof complying with intensive medical treatment.\r\nAccording to the registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation\r\nreported in 2008 (Taylor D et al, 2008) the one-year survival after primary orthotopic cardiac\r\ntransplantations has increased from 79\% between 1982 and 1991, to 82\% between 1992 and\r\n2001, and to 86\% between 2002 and 2005 (p<0.0001). However, long-term mortality has not\r\nchanged and in fact the overall survival patterns remain largely unchanged with a steep fall\r\nin survival up to 6 months and linear decrement in survival thereafter, at approximately\r\n3.5\% per year (figure 1)\r\nSome factors need to be in consideration, as they are changing the demographics of heart\r\ntransplantation. The primary cardiac transplantation has shifted in the last years towards a\r\nFig. 1. Kaplan-Meier survival for all cardiac transplants (1/1982-6/2006) (Taylor D et al,\r\n2008)\r\nwww.intechopen.comIndications for Ventricle Assist Devices 5\r\nslight predominance of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (50\%) vs. ischemic\r\n(34\%). It is a fact that the relative contribution of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy has\r\ndeclined over the last decade. Also the age of donors and recipients has increased in the past\r\n20 years. Almost 25\% of cardiac transplant patient recipients in the last years were over the\r\nage of 60 years, with a relative fall in the number of recipients aged 40-49 years. Also at the\r\npresent time the number of transplants being performed worldwide is far outnumbered by\r\nthe number of potential candidates, as donor hearts are a very limited resource. These\r\naspects are essential in the understanding of patient outcomes and they explain why other\r\nalternatives to heart transplantation should be investigated in an effort to offer alternative\r\ntherapies to those patients suffering severe heart failure.\r\nThe need for those alternative therapies include the lack of cardiac donors, long cardiac\r\ntransplantation waiting list, patients with any contraindication to cardiac transplantation\r\n(definitive or temporal) and patients requiring more time for the heart to recover.\r\nThe use of ventricle assist devices has acquired an important role in the management of endstage\r\nheart failure and it is very likely that its importance will increase with time.\r\nHistorically, the development of cardiopulmonary bypass technology in the fifties was the\r\nachievement that really started the development of more permanent means of mechanical\r\ncardiac support. Technological progress has allowed the design and production of smaller\r\ndevices that have bridged patients towards recovery and transplantation.\r\nIn this chapter we will review the indications of ventricle assist devices implantation. We\r\nwill star giving some general indications that every patient should follow from a theoretical\r\npoint of view. Then we will divide the indications in three different groups: 1) bridge to\r\ntransplantation, 2) bridge to recovery and 3) destination therapy.\r\nWe will also discuss when it is required to use a short term ventricle assist device, a long\r\nventricle assist devices and the total artificial heart. Finally we will review in the literature\r\nwhen it is necessary to have a right ventricle assist device especially when a left ventricle\r\nassist device is already implanted.\r\nThe authors would like to remark that this chapter is a compilation of the literature\r\nregarding ventricle assist device therapy. Therefore each patient must be considered as a\r\nparticular case and there are no strict rules or guidelines to be followed.\r\n3. General indications for ventricle assist device implantation\r\nThe general rule is simple: ventricle assist devices are used when the heart is incapable of\r\nmaintaining its function. Therefore, the organism is in danger or is going to be in danger\r\nbecause cardiac output is not enough to maintain vital organ flow. Cardiac dysfunction may\r\nbe caused in an acute fashion, like in a cardiogenic shock caused by an extensive myocardiac\r\ninfarction or after a major cardiac surgery when a patient is not able to weaned from the\r\nheart-lung machine. Also, cardiac failure may be a consequence of a chronic condition like\r\nin the ischemic chronic heart disease or in patients with dilatated myocardiopathy.\r\nThere are some registries that compile from different centers the indications for a ventricle\r\nassist devices implantation. These registries are a good resource of information about what\r\nthe indications of ventricle assist device are. One of the databases is the Interagency Registry\r\nfor Mechanical Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS), which is an audited registry\r\nfor patients who receive a mechanical circulatory support device to treat advanced\r\nmedically refractory heart failure. From June 2006 to December 2007, a total of 75\r\ninstitutions in the United States of America prospectively entered 420 patients. Most of the\r\nwww.intechopen.com6 Ventricular Assist Devices\r\npatients (n=336) had a mechanical circulatory support device implanted for the indication of\r\nbridge to transplantation. The indication of destination therapy was applied in 63 patients\r\nwhereas the rest of patients received a ventricle assist device as a bridge to recovery\r\n(Holman et al, 2009). This perfectly describes what the indications in the clinical practice are\r\nat the present time. Several aspects must be considered for indicating a ventricle assist\r\ndevice:\r\n3.1 Clinical status\r\nPatients requiring a ventricle assist device suffer severe heart failure acutely or chronically.\r\nWhen cardiac failure has been caused acutely, the patient is in cardiogenic shock. This may\r\nbe from different causes: extensive acute myocardial infarction (Killip IV), mechanical\r\ncomplications after an infarction (papillary muscle rupture, interventricular septal rupture),\r\npatients that cannot be weaned from the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, acute\r\nmyocarditis and others. It should be noticed that the use of ventricle assist device in the\r\nsetting of cardiogenic shock must be contemplated when the use of inotropes and intraaortic\r\nballon pump is not enough to maintain an adequate cardiac output and there is a risk\r\nof death or other organ failure. Also, there should be no other options such as major cardiac\r\nsurgery or other surgical options that may reverse the status of the patient.\r\nHowever, although ventricle assist devices are not the first treatment option in this type of\r\nsituation, their implantation should not be delayed. Most cardiologist and cardiac surgeons\r\nagree to implant a ventricle assist device in patients with severe heart failure, despite intraaortic\r\nballoon pump or inotropic support with unstable hemodynamics, and with early\r\nsigns of end-organ dysfunction (Osaki et al, 2009). In the last years, there has been an\r\nattempt to prevent deterioration of the ventricle assist device candidateâ€™s condition.\r\nActually, whenever possible some co-morbid conditions should be nullified by a period of\r\ntherapy prior to implant. Some examples are renal dysfunction, localized infection or severe\r\npulmonary edema, which can be reversed with medical therapy prior to a mechanical\r\ndevice implantation. Every patient should be in the best clinical position, considering that\r\nthese patients are in a really bad clinical status, avoiding the implantation in pre-mortem\r\nconditions. This rule should also be applied in those patients with end-stage chronic cardiac\r\ndysfunction. Mechanical device implantation should be kept in mind before other organs\r\ndeteriorate. This will definitely improve clinical outcomes. Other clinical conditions that\r\nmay indicate the use of some mechanical support are intractable arrhythmias and intractable\r\nangina not responsive to medical therapy or revascularization procedures in patients with\r\npoor left ventricle function.\r\n3.2 Hemodynamic parameters\r\nA hemodynamic study may be required in some situations to assure that cardiac function is\r\nseverely deteriorated. Table 1 summarizes hemodynamic data that represent severe left and\r\nright ventricle dysfunction.\r\n4. Ventricle assist device as bridge to transplantation\r\nAs we have previously descibed in the introduction section, orthotopic cardiac transplantation\r\nis the gold standard for treating end-stage heart failure. The International Society for Heart\r\nand Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has reported outcome data on transplant recipients for\r\nmore than 25 years with data that includes more than 74,000 patients (Taylor et al, 2008).\r\nwww.intechopen.comIndications for Ventricle Assist Devices 7\r\nLeft ventricle assist device Right ventricle assist device Biventricular ventricle\r\nassist device\r\nSystolic blood pressure\r\n<90mmHg\r\nRight atria pressure >\r\n20mmHg\r\nRight atria pressure >\r\n20mmHg\r\nLeft atria pressure >\r\n20mmHg\r\nLeft atria pressure <\r\n15mmHg\r\nLeft atria pressure >\r\n20mmHg\r\nSystemic vascular\r\nresistance >2,100 dynessec/cm\r\n\r\nNo tricuspid regurgitation No tricuspid regurgitation\r\nUrine output <20mL/h Inability to maintain left\r\nventricle assist device flow\r\n>2.0L/min/m2 with right\r\natrial pressure >20mmHg\r\nTable 1. Haemodynamic indications for circulatory assist device\r\nThis registry includes data mainly from USA and European countries. We see from those\r\nreports that primary indications for cardiac transplantation has changed with an increase of\r\npatients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and less ischemic patients. In addition, the age\r\nof donors and recipients has been increasing in the last 20 years, especially in Europe. It is\r\nclear that heart donors are a limited resource and some patients die while awaiting cardiac\r\ntransplantation due to that lack of donors. Actually, in the last two decades, decreasing\r\nnumbers of organ donors have led to longer waiting times for cardiac transplantation and\r\nsubsequently increasing mortality. Other patientsÂ´ statuses may worsen while waiting and\r\nthey may need some kind of cardiac circulatory support in order to maintain vital blood\r\nflow and preserve organ systems like kidney, hepatic, or brain function.\r\nTherefore, we can summarize that ventricle assist device as a bridge to transplantation is\r\nindicated in those patients that are candidates for cardiac transplantation and need some\r\ncardiac support while they are waiting for the heart. This indication includes a wide\r\nspectrum of patients. On one side, we may have patients that suffer an acute event\r\n(postinfarction cardiogenic shock, postcardiotomy) which leads them into an irreversible\r\nsevere heart failure that requires urgent cardiac transplantation. Until a donor is found,\r\ncardiac mechanical support is necessary to save patients life and to preserve their vital\r\norgans. As we will see later, organ failure is associated with a worse prognosis after heart\r\ntransplantation. On the other side, there are patients that are awaiting cardiac\r\ntransplantation and whose conditions become refractory to medical therapy.\r\nAt present time, ventricle assist devices are an important tool in the management of this\r\nkind of patient (Frazier at al, 2001; Miller et al, 2007; Russo et al, 2009). Also, in the last\r\ndecade, the number of heart transplant recipients supported by ventricle assist devices at the\r\ntime of transplantation has more than doubled to over 400 per year in the USA (Taylor DO\r\net al, 2008) as well as in European countries. This clearly reflects the need of mechanical\r\ncirculatory support in patients awaiting transplantation. Also as previously described, if we\r\nconsider some registries as the INTERMACS, bridge to transplantation is by far, the most\r\nfrequent indication for a ventricle assist device implantation (Holman et al, 2009).\r\nThere are some questions that should be answered regarding mechanical circulatory\r\nsupport as a bridge to transplantation.\r\nwww.intechopen.com8 Ventricular Assist Devices\r\n1. Does the use of a ventricle assist device as a bridge to transplantation affect the outcome\r\nof patients when compared to those patients who receive transplants without the need\r\nof mechanical assistance?\r\n2. When should one implant a mechanical device in a patient awaiting cardiac\r\ntransplantation?\r\n3. What kind of device should be implanted?\r\nAlthough several studies have demonstrated the benefits of ventricle assist devices in the\r\npretransplant period, findings from studies analyzed the impact of mechanical circulatory\r\nsupport on posttransplant outcomes have conflicted. The majority of studies have concluded\r\nthat short term, but not long term, survival is diminished in recipients bridge with a\r\nmechanical device (Taylor DO et al, 2008; Cleveland JC et al, 2008). However, there are some\r\nreports that do not confirm these findings. In a recently published study (Osaki et al, 2009)\r\nOsaki et al compared patientsÂ´ outcomes undergoing cardiac transplantation with and\r\nwithout the use of a ventricle assist device. They also divided patients in two different time\r\ngroups as an attempt to analyze both, the experience of the group and the improvement of\r\ndevices technology. A total of 531 consecutive heart transplant recipients in a 17 years\r\nperiod were included. They concluded that post-transplant survival has improved in the last\r\nyears. Actually in their study, outcomes for orthotopic heart transplantation after bridge to\r\ntransplantation have become equivalent to that of orthotopic heart transplantation without\r\nventricle assist device. The data suggest that advances in device technology and\r\nmultidisciplinary programs, have improved survival and allowed bridges to transplantation\r\ncandidates to have an outcome equivalent to that of non-ventricle assist device in recent\r\ntimes (Figure 2).\r\nFig. 2. Post-transplant survival by Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis. oOHT, old orthotopic heart\r\ntransplant (January 1990 to July 2003); nOHT, new orthotopic heart transplant (August 2003\r\nto August 2007); oBTT, old bridge to transplant (January 1990 to July 2003); nBTT, new\r\nbridge to transplant (August 2003 to August 2007).\r\nwww.intechopen.comIndications for Ventricle Assist Devices 9\r\nIn that study, multivariate analysis revealed that diabetes and biventricular (but no\r\nuniventricular) support were the only independent predictors of post-transplant mortality.\r\nThese findings have been confirmed by other groups (Russo et al, 2009). In the study\r\npublished by Russo et al, they included more than 10,000 heart transplantation recipients\r\nfrom the United Network for Organ Sharing in a seven-year period. They concluded that the\r\nuse of implantable left ventricle assist devices (both intracorporeal and extracorporeal\r\ndevices) as bridges to transplantation are not associated with diminished posttransplant\r\nsurvival. However, an increase in 90-day mortality was seen in patients bridged with\r\nextracorporeal devices.\r\nThese findings suggest that more than 80\% of well-selected patients implanted with\r\nintracorporeal devices as a bridge to transplantation are successfully transplanted,\r\nproviding additional evidence that a more aggressive use of implantable devices may\r\nbenefit candidates whose condition is refractory to medical management. Outcomes seem to\r\nbe better when implantable device support is implemented before patients clinical status\r\ndeteriorates badly. The findings further suggest that a more aggressive use of implantable\r\nsupport may benefit candidates who are likely to face long waiting times as candidates with\r\nhigher body mass index or blood type O. The fact that patient survival is diminished in\r\npatients with extracorporeal devices may suggests that in some cases, candidates supported\r\nby an extracorporeal device may benefit from further optimization before transplantation,\r\nand that this type of devices may be best used as a bridge to an implantable device\r\nespecially in those patients that may have long waiting times.\r\nAs it has been suggested in other studies (Cleveland et al, 2008), the general perception\r\namong most cardiac transplantation centres is that explantation of a ventricle assist device\r\nconfers a more technically challenging operation and therefore, might adversely affect\r\nsurvival not in medium term but in a short term. In the Cleveland group experience, one\r\nyear survival was similar in those recipients receiving a heart transplantation with or\r\nwithout a mechanical circulatory support. However, when they analyzed patients who died\r\nafter transplantation, most of the ventricle assist device group died within 30 days of\r\ntransplant. In contrast, only a minority of patients without a mechanical assist device died\r\nwithin those thirty days.\r\nThis may reflect an inherent complexity and higher risk operation that occurs in the\r\nexplantation of a ventricle device.\r\nIt is essential to have a good knowledge of the heart transplantation situation in every\r\ncountry. There are some countries such as Spain, where there is a high prevalence of donors\r\nand where the waiting times are not to long. Short term extracorporeal devices may be used\r\nas they are less expensive and very simple to use. Good results can be achieved this way\r\n(Reyes et al, 2007). In other countries like Germany or the USA where the waiting times are\r\nmuch longer, long term assistance may be a better option (Korfer et al, 1999).\r\n5. Ventricle assist device as bridge to recovery\r\nVentricle assist devices have been successfully implanted in patients who are expected to\r\nrecover sufficient myocardial function and it is not expected that they will need a cardiac\r\ntransplantation. In this type of patient a short-term bridge to recovery device may be a good\r\noption as these devices are less expensive and very easy to use (Samuels et al, 2005; Nicolini\r\n& Gherti, 2009). The most frequent clinical settings in which a mechanical circulatory\r\nsupport may be needed are described below:\r\nwww.intechopen.com10 Ventricular Assist Devices\r\n5.1 Post-cardiotomy\r\nPatients with compromised left ventricle function who have undergone long operations may\r\nneed a ventricle assist device because the severity of the postoperative circulatory shock. It\r\nis estimated that about 5\% of patients undergoing coronary or valve cardiac procedures will\r\nhave some degree of postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (Pae et al, 1992). Short term\r\nmechanical support as bridge to recovery has been successfully used in patients who are\r\nexpected to recover sufficient myocardial function. Since the ABIOMED system was\r\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1992, it has become the second most\r\ncommonly used mechanical support device for patients with post-cardiotomy ventricular\r\ndysfunction after the intra-aortic balloon pump with excellent rates of myocardial recovery\r\nand device removal after short-term support (Morgan et al, 2004). We highly recommend\r\nthe early implantation of mechanical circulatory assistance in this clinical setting to provide\r\nmechanical unloading of the ventricle and rapid restoration of normal end-organ perfusion\r\nin order to improve survival rates.\r\nIn those patients in whom a high risk of cardiac failure is anticipated (severely impaired\r\nventricular function undergoing high risk cardiac procedures) transplant evaluation should\r\nbe initiated preoperatively and the procedure performed with a ventricle assist device back\r\nup. If needed it, mechanical support may be used as bridge to recovery or bridge to\r\ntransplantation.\r\n5.2 Post acute myocardial infarction shock\r\nDespite the advances in the management of cardiogenic shock secondary to acute\r\nmyocardial infarction, the prognosis is still poor with mortality rates as high as 70\%\r\n(Goldberg RJ et al, 1999). There are some aspects that must be considered in this clinical\r\nsetting. One of the surgical dilemmas, when implanting an LVAD into a patient with an\r\nacute anterior wall myocardial infarction, is the safety of apical cannulation in the presence\r\nof acutely infarcted apical myocardium, which is typically necrotic and friable. Ventricular\r\ndisruption and bleeding from the cannulation site are major concerns with lethal\r\nconsequences. Although left atrial cannulation is an option, it is suboptimal as it affords\r\ninadequate left ventricular decompression and limits LVAD inflow. Furthermore, left atrial\r\ncannulation has been shown to have independent risk factors for the development of left\r\nventricular thrombus and stroke. There are some surgical techniques that should be\r\nconsidered. Some authors have maintained that left ventricle devices can be safely\r\nimplanted into acutely infarcted, friable myocardium by modifying their surgical technique.\r\nThis involves placing cannulation sutures through the full thickness of the infarcted\r\nventricular myocardium and reinforcing their suture line with pericardium or Teflon felt\r\n(Park SJ et al, 2000; Chen et al, 1999). Other technique used in patients with cardiogenic\r\nshock and with extensive anterior wall infarcts, consists of securing the cannula with\r\ninterrupted, pledgeted, horizontal mattress sutures through the full-thickness of the\r\ninfarcted myocardium. If significant bleeding is observed, additional sutures and/or\r\nhaemostatic products can be applied to the cannulation site (Leshnower et al, 2005).\r\nIt is important to highlight that patients with ventricle assist devices due to cardiogenic\r\nshock after an acute myocardial infarction may follow different outcomes. In this situation\r\nthere should be flexibility to the treatment algorithm that these patients may follow.\r\nMechanical circulatory system may be used as a bridge to recovery, a bridge to bridge (to\r\nother long term assist device system) or as a bridge to transplant. Also, some authors\r\nconsider that the use of a biventricular assist device is important in these patients\r\nwww.intechopen.comIndications for Ventricle Assist Devices 11\r\n(Leshnower et al, 2005). This must be taken in consideration in right ventricular heart\r\nfailure, intractable arrhytmias and in the presence of shock with multisystem organ failure.\r\nRecently, some authors consider that less invasive percutaneous ventricular assist devices\r\nmay be helpful in the decision making of the treatment as they are less expensive and\r\nsternotomy is not required, which may helps subsequent transplantation or surgically\r\nventricle assist device insertion (Brinkman et al, 2010).\r\n5.3 Myocarditis\r\nMyocarditis may cause severe cardiac failure, sometimes very acutely. It is believed that\r\nalmost every infectious agent can cause myocarditis (bacterias, virus, spiroquetas, mycotic\r\ninfections, parasital agents, ricketsias). Also there may be immunologic causes as the so call\r\ngiant cells myocarditis in which, apart from inmunosupresor therapy, ventricle assist device\r\nmay be needed. These patients trend to be younger (many of them children) and it is\r\ncharacterized by an unpredictable clinical course. Actually it remains a real challenge to\r\ndetermine which group of patients will recover and which will require mechanical support\r\nor heart transplantation (Houel R et al, 1999). As myocarditis is an inflammatory process\r\nthat affects the whole myocardium (both the right and left ventricle) it is frequent that\r\nbiventricular support is required (Grinda JM et al, 2004). As we have previously said it is\r\nimportant anticipate the prognosis of the patient in order to convert a short-term assist\r\ndevice into a long term assist device or cardiac transplantation in those patients in which an\r\noptimal recovery is not expected.\r\n6. Destination therapy\r\nVentricle assist device as a destination therapy has some aspects that may concern\r\ncardiologists and cardiac surgeons. It is necessary to know how the mechanical devices may\r\naffect survival rates compared with alternative treatment strategies, the durability of the\r\ndevices, and its safety profile. Also we must take into account the quality of life of these\r\npatients and if the up-front costs of implantation may be offset by the long-term benefits of\r\nthe patients.\r\nThe Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive\r\nHeart Failure (REMATCH) trial is a multicentered study supported by the National Heart,\r\nLung, and Blood Institute. It compares long-term implantation of left ventricular assist\r\ndevices with optimal medical management for patients with end-stage heart failure who\r\nrequire, but do not qualify to receive cardiac transplantation. This trial demonstrated that\r\nthe implantation of left-ventricular assist devices decreased the 1-year mortality by a third\r\n(from 75\% down to 51\%) and the two year survival rate was 29\% for left ventricle assist\r\ndevice patients versus 13\% for medical patients (95\% CL; 5\%-22\%), representing a 48 percent\r\nreduction in the risk of death from any cause, compared with the optimal medical therapy.\r\nThe survival advantage was associated with a considerable improvement in the quality of\r\nlife and functional status of these patients, as compared with their medical counterparts\r\n(Rose et al., 1999). The MLHF scores, (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire)\r\nfor left ventricle assist device patients were 75.1 (0 being the best â€“ 105 the worst). The\r\nREMATCH trial demonstrated that is superior to any available medical therapy in patients\r\nwith end-stage heart failure who are not eligible for transplantation (Lietz & Miller, 2005).\r\nThe Thoratec HeartMate was subsequently approved in 2003, by the Food and Drug\r\nAdministration (FDA), for long-term support of this kind of patient.\r\nwww.intechopen.com12 Ventricular Assist Devices\r\nThe next logical step for expanding the indications for mechanical circulatory assistance\r\nwould be to use the left ventricle assist device as an alternative to cardiac transplantation.\r\nHowever, heart transplantation cannot serve the estimated 30,000â€“60,000 people who die of\r\nheart failure in the US each year and could be candidates for heart transplantation or some\r\nform of mechanical circulatory support. More than 40\% of the patients waited more than 1\r\nyear for a cardiac transplantation, and the waiting time is increasing every year. In 1995, the\r\naverage waiting time for cardiac transplantation was over 200 days (Penningtonet al., 1999),\r\nbut the average national waiting time in 2003 for a heart was 230 days (UNOS/OPTN\r\nAnnual Report 2003). Each year, approximately 4000 new patients are added to the waiting\r\nlist for cardiac transplant, and about 28,000â€“30,000 are apparently not considered viable\r\ncandidates to be placed on the list. About 50\%of the patients not included in the waiting list\r\n(13,000) would be candidates for a permanent ventricular assist device. An important\r\ndeterrent to being listed may be advanced age.\r\nThe most obvious advantage of these mechanical device systems over transplantation would\r\nbe their immediate availability. They could be placed in UNOS status II rather than UNOS\r\nstatus I hospital-bound patients. Table 2 shows the indications and characteristics of the\r\ntotal artificial heart.\r\nTotal artificial\r\nheart Characteristics Use Cost\r\nAbiomed Total\r\nArtificial Heart\r\nTAH is currently\r\nundergoing clinical\r\ntrials\r\nCardioWest\r\ndevice\r\nIs inserted\r\northotopically; this\r\nprocedure is\r\naccompanied by\r\nremoval of the\r\npatient\'s own\r\nventricles\r\nPneumatic TAH that\r\nhas been used\r\ninvestigationally as a\r\nbridge to\r\ntransplantation\r\nThe cost of these\r\ndevices is likely to be\r\nquite high, but may\r\nnot be very different\r\nfrom the cost of heart\r\ntransplantation,\r\ntherapy and\r\nimmunosuppression.\r\nTable 2. Indications and characteristics of the total artificial heart. TAH: Total artificial heart.\r\n6.1 Exercise capacity\r\nAn important determinant of quality of life in cardiac transplant recipients and left ventricle\r\nassist device recipients is exercise capacity.\r\nStudies in cardiac transplant recipients demonstrate that, at rest, they have an increased\r\nheart rate, increased blood pressure, and low normal cardiac output. During exercise, peak\r\nheart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, peak power output, pulse pressure, heart rate\r\nreserve, total VO2, and absolute VO2 at ventilatory threshold are all less than normal. Their\r\nexercise capacity may increase with time up to 5 years and may improve with an increase in\r\nmuscle mass and lean body weight. Autonomic reenervation may actually increase the peak\r\nheart rate during exercise, although this is quite controversial. Recent studies suggest that\r\ncavo-caval anastomosis may increase atrial emptying, resulting in better functional capacity.\r\nWhile some individual patients with cardiac transplantation function well, most patients\r\nhave important physiological limitations.\r\nThe exercise capacity of patients with implantable mechanical cardiac devices is based on\r\nthe results obtained during the use like bridge to transplant, it is apparent that improvement\r\nwww.intechopen.comIndications for Ventricle Assist Devices 13\r\nin exercise tolerance occurs. Maximum VO2 is a well-characterized indicator of functional\r\nstatus and prognosis in patients with advanced heart failure.\r\nPeak oxygen consumption with upright treadmill exercise increased from 10 to 14 mL\r\nO2/kg/min in a group of patients supported for a mean of 50 days after left ventricle assist\r\ndevice implantation. Pennington et al remarked that many postoperative studies suggest\r\nthat the native left ventricle may contribute to this function during exercise by actively\r\nfilling the left ventricle assist device, which reduces filling time and overcomes inflowing\r\ncannula impedance. It may also augment total cardiac output with parallel ejection out of\r\nthe native aortic valve and reduce ventricular interaction-related changes in functional right\r\nventricular diastolic compliance.\r\nIt is clear that exercise capacity increases during the first several months after ventricle assist\r\ndevice insertion because patients have improved organ function, reducing pulmonary\r\nedema and pulmonary artery resistance. These changes significantly augment right\r\nventricular function, which also usually improves with time.\r\nIt is anticipated that patients with long-term left ventricle assist devices will achieve\r\nreasonably high levels of exercise capacity and they will not be limited by activities of daily\r\nliving. Whether they will be able to participate in athletic events and vigorous work is not\r\nentirely clear, but seems feasible (Pennington et al., 1999).\r\n6.2 Psychological factors\r\nA common sensation between the patients with left ventricle assist devices is that of being\r\nmachine-dependent. It is important to indicate a definitive cardiac assist device in very\r\nstrongly motivated patients which may need to be prepared from a psychological point of\r\nview. A positive psychological feature is the fact that left ventricle assist device insertion\r\ndoes not require removal of the natural heart, which might be able to temporarily support\r\nthe circulation, or recover sufficiently to allow for device removal.\r\nQuality of life may be reasonably satisfactory. Despite externalized battery sources, these\r\npatients are capable of recovering their daily activities, even returning to work. Although\r\npatients are capable of concealing external batteries so that it is not so obvious that they are\r\nsupported mechanically, they cannot forget that they are dependent on the device. This\r\nfactor may be resolved with new more modern devices that can be completely implanted\r\ninside the pericardium or the peritoneum. Presuming the availability of a safe and effective,\r\ntotally implantable, electrically driven, left ventricle assist devices prompts a comparison\r\nwith the current strategy of cardiac transplantation as a universal therapy for patients with\r\nsevere heart failure.\r\n6.3 Economical factors\r\nIt is very important to be aware of the cost of the implantation of definitive mechanical\r\ndevices. Since there are limited resources availables, it is necessary to demonstrate that they\r\nare economically feasible. The average total cost to insert a left ventricle assist device in the\r\nREMATCH patient population was $210,187 which includes a $60,000 charge for the device.\r\nWhen implantation hospitalization costs are compared between hospital survivors and\r\nnonsurvivors, the mean costs increase from $159,271 Â± 106,423 to $315,015 Â± 278,713.\r\nSepsis, pump housing infection, and perioperative bleeding are the major drivers of\r\nimplantation cost, established by regression modeling. In the patients who survived the\r\nprocedure, bypass time, perioperative bleeding, and late bleeding were the drivers of cost.\r\nwww.intechopen.com14 Ventricular Assist Devices\r\nThe average annual readmission cost per patient for the overall cohort was $105,326, the cost\r\nof which was considerably influenced by device reliability (Oz et al, 2003).\r\nIn a recent study published by the Institute of Medicine, cost effectiveness was measured by\r\nthe relationship of costs to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). It was estimated that the cost\r\nper quality-adjusted life years in dollars for hemodialysis was $50,000, for two-vessel\r\ncoronary artery bypass grafting, $34,000, and for a total artificial heart for 2 years,\r\napproximately $105,000.\r\nThe cost calculation of quality-adjusted life years for left ventricle assist devices was not\r\ncalculated, but it was estimated that it would be significantly less than that for a total\r\nartificial heart.\r\nIf the devices can be relatively problem free and not require multiple readmissions for\r\nreplacement of parts or devices, employers may be receptive to these patients returning to\r\nwork. It is not known whether the relatively low reemployment percentage for cardiac\r\ntransplant patients is related to their need to continue to take expensive medications or\r\nother medical problems.\r\nIt is possible that within four years, one could return to society with an income greater in\r\nvalue than the investment if the individual earns an annual salary of $40,000 per year.\r\nHowever, by Poirierâ€™s estimation, circulatory support systems represented a potential to\r\nincrease our gross national product, leading to a higher standard of living.\r\nThe current generation of pumps continue to undergo incremental improvement. These\r\ndevices exhibit smaller and more flexible drivelines or use a totally implantable design that\r\neliminates a major gateway for infection. They are being introduced in clinical trials that may\r\nmore fundamentally address the deviceÂ´s shortcomings observed in the REMATCH study.\r\n7. Short, long and intermediate ventricle assists devices\r\nWe can divide the ventricle assist devices according to its capacity to be used as support\r\nduring a short, long, or intermediate time, depending on the requirements of patients. The\r\nfollowing tables describe the indications and the more notable characteristics of the different\r\nkinds of ventricular assist devices.\r\n7.1 Intermediate ventricle assist devices\r\nFig. 3.

Long ventricle assist devices: Indications and characteristics.\r\nwww.intechopen.comIndications for Ventricle Assist Devices 17\r\n8. Biventricular assist device: why and when should it be implanted?\r\nIt is well described in the literature that between 15-25\% of patients with a left ventricle\r\nassist device will develop a right heart failure, even in those patients with a good\r\npreoperative right cardiac function. Severe right ventricle failure, requiring insertion of a\r\nright ventricles assist device, has been proved to negatively affect a successful bridge to\r\ntransplant, increase device-related morbidity, prolong hospital length of stay, and increase\r\ntotal hospital cost (Slater JP et al, 1996; Karavan et al, 2002). This can be explained with the\r\nfollowing:\r\n1. Pre-existing right ventricle dysfunction. This dysfunction may be latent secondary to\r\nthe augmented preload presented to the right side following left mechanical device\r\nimplantation.\r\n2. Interventricular septal shifting movement. The mechanical unloading of the left\r\nventricle may displace the interventricular septum which may contribute to impaired\r\nright-sided function.\r\n3. Other perioperative conditions as ischemia, myocardial stunning, embolism or\r\narrythmias.\r\nIt is essential to anticipate which patients will develop right side heart failure, however,\r\nthis may be a difficult task. Several papers have reported preoperative risk factors for\r\ndevelopment of right ventricle failure in patients with implantable left ventricle assist\r\ndevices. A study from Ochiai and colleagues (Ochiai et al, 2002) reported in a large\r\nnumber of patients that preoperative circulatory support, female gender, and nonischemic\r\netiology of heart failure were significant predictors of right ventricle failure.\r\nOther risk factors that have been related with the need of right circulatory support are low\r\npulmonary artery pressure, low right ventricle stroke work index, preoperative\r\nventilation and higher left ventricle assist device scores (Fukamachi et al, 1999, Morgan et\r\nal, 2004).\r\nApart from the difficult task of anticipating which patient will require a right ventricle assist\r\ndevice, another important problem is the difficulty associated with anticipating when it is\r\nthe right moment to implant a right ventricle device. It is important to note that while\r\noptimal timing of right ventricle assist device insertion for severe right ventricle failure after\r\nleft ventricle assist device implantation has yet to be clearly defined, a low threshold for\r\nearly right ventricle assist device insertion may be preferable to subsequent development of\r\nmultisystem organ failure that could potentially develop with a more conservative\r\napproach.\r\nSome studies describe that patients with an implantable left ventricle assist device and with\r\na prompt right ventricle assist device insertion (within 24 hours) have a better outcome than\r\npatients in which the right mechanical device was inserted after the first 24 hours (Morgan\r\net al, 2004). In general, it is believed that right ventricle assist device insertion should be\r\nperformed early after the development of severe right ventricle failure after left ventricle\r\nassist device implantation, and that right ventricle assist device support should be\r\ncontinued for an adequate duration to allow for right ventricle recovery or until\r\ntransplantation. It is essential that while on RVAD support, opportunities to maximally\r\nimprove the patientâ€™s hemodynamic status and fluid balance, such as the use of continuous\r\nveno-venous hemofiltration and dialysis, should be pursued.\r\nwww.intechopen.com18 Ventricular Assist Devices\r\nFig. 4. Biventricular assist device. Cannula implantation.\r\n9. Conclusions\r\nHeart transplantation is the gold standard therapy for end stage heart failure disease.\r\nHowever, there is a lack of donors and some patients have some kind of contraindications.\r\nVentricle assist devices can be used in different clinical situations. The most common\r\nindication nowadays is bridge to transplantation. As more experience and more modern\r\ndevices are available, better the outcomes. Patients being transplanted with a mechanical\r\ndevice can have as good results as patients without a ventricle device.\r\nIn some cases an external cardiac support is required while the heart recovers from an acute\r\nevent. Ventricle assist devices can also be used as a bridge to recovery with excellent results\r\nusing a short term ventricle device. In patients awaiting a transplantation or with a\r\ncontraindication for transplantation a long term cardiac device or the total artificial heart are\r\nvery good options in which a high quality of life can be expected.\r\nIt is important not to delay ventricle device implantation till there is a severe multi-organ\r\ndysfunction. Patients need to be in the best clinical status when receiving a mechanical\r\ncardiac support. Biventricular assist devices should be kept in mind as right ventricle failure\r\ncan happen after a left ventricle device implantation.\r\n10.

As of 2008 the most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor (cadaveric allograft) and implant it into the patient. The patient\'s own heart is either removed (orthotopic procedure) or, less commonly, left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic procedure). Post-operation survival periods average 15 years.[1] Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease, but a life-saving treatment intended to improve the quality of life for recipients.[2]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n2 Contraindications\r\n3 Procedures\r\n3.1 Pre-operative\r\n3.2 Operative\r\n3.2.1 Orthotopic procedure\r\n3.2.2 Heterotopic procedure\r\n3.2.3 \'Living organ\' transplant\r\n3.2.4 Non-beating heart transplant\r\n3.3 Post-operative\r\n4 Complications\r\n5 Prognosis\r\n5.1 Notable recipients\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nNorman Shumway is widely regarded as the father of heart transplantation although the world\'s first adult human heart transplant was performed by a South African cardiac surgeon, Christiaan Barnard, utilizing the techniques developed and perfected by Shumway and Richard Lower.[3] Barnard performed the first transplant on Louis Washkansky on December 3, 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.[3][4] Adrian Kantrowitz performed the world\'s first pediatric heart transplant on December 6, 1967, at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, barely three days after Christiaan Barnard\'s pioneering procedure.[3] Norman Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on January 6, 1968, at the Stanford University Hospital.[3]\r\n\r\nWorldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are performed annually. The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000-2,300 annually). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 119 adult transplants in 2013 alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure.[5] The great disparity between the number of patients needing transplants and the number of procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non-human hearts into humans after 1993. Xenografts from other species and man-made artificial hearts are two less successful alternatives to allografts.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthotopic heart transplant. Recipient P-waves (arrows).\r\nContraindications[edit]\r\nSome patients are less suitable for a heart transplant, especially if they suffer from other circulatory conditions related to the heart. The following conditions in a patient increase the chances of complications:\r\n\r\nKidney, lung, or liver disease\r\nInsulin-dependent diabetes with other organ dysfunction\r\nLife-threatening diseases unrelated to heart failure\r\nVascular disease of the neck and leg arteries.\r\nHigh pulmonary vascular resistance\r\nRecent thromboembolism\r\nAge over 60 years (some variation between centers)\r\nSubstance abuse, notably tobacco smoking (which increases the chance of lung disease)\r\nProcedures[edit]\r\nPre-operative[edit]\r\nA typical heart transplantation begins when a suitable donor heart is identified. The heart comes from a recently deceased or brain dead donor, also called a beating heart cadaver. The patient is contacted by a nurse coordinator and instructed to come to the hospital for evaluation and pre-surgical medication. At the same time, the heart is removed from the donor and inspected by a team of surgeons to see if it is in suitable condition. Learning that a potential organ is unsuitable can induce distress in an already fragile patient, who usually requires emotional support before returning home.\r\n\r\nThe patient must also undergo emotional, psychological, and physical tests to verify mental health and ability to make good use of a new heart. The patient is also given immunosuppressant medication so that the patient\'s immune system does not reject the new heart.\r\n\r\nOperative[edit]\r\n\r\nSchematic of a transplanted heart with native lungs and the great vessels.\r\nOnce the donor heart passes inspection, the patient is taken into the operating room and given a general anaesthetic. Either an orthotopic or a heterotopic procedure follows, depending on the conditions of the patient and the donor heart.\r\n\r\nOrthotopic procedure[edit]\r\nThe orthotopic procedure begins with a median sternotomy, opening the chest and exposing the mediastinum. The pericardium is opened, the great vessels are dissected and the patient is attached to cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor\'s heart is injected with potassium chloride (KCl). Potassium chloride stops the heart beating before the heart is removed from the donor\'s body and packed in ice. Ice can usually keep the heart usable for four[6] to six hours depending on preservation and starting condition. The failing heart is removed by transecting the great vessels and a portion of the left atrium. The patient\'s pulmonary veins are not transected; rather a circular portion of the left atrium containing the pulmonary veins is left in place. The donor heart is trimmed to fit onto the patient\'s remaining left atrium and the great vessels are sutured in place. The new heart is restarted, the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and the chest cavity is closed.\r\n\r\nThe orthotopic procedure was developed by Shumway and Lower at Stanford-Lane Hospital in San Francisco in 1958.[3]\r\n\r\nHeterotopic procedure[edit]\r\nIn the heterotopic procedure, the patient\'s own heart is not removed. The new heart is positioned so that the chambers and blood vessels of both hearts can be connected to form what is effectively a \'double heart\'. The procedure can give the patient\'s original heart a chance to recover, and if the donor\'s heart fails (e.g., through rejection), it can later be removed, leaving the patient\'s original heart. Heterotopic procedures are used only in cases where the donor heart is not strong enough to function by itself (because either the patient\'s body is considerably larger than the donor\'s, the donor\'s heart is itself weak, or the patient suffers from pulmonary hypertension).\r\n\r\n\'Living organ\' transplant[edit]\r\nIn February 2006, at the Bad Oeynhausen Clinic for Thorax and Cardiovascular Surgery, Germany, surgeons successfully transplanted a \'beating heart\' into a patient.[7] Rather than cooling the heart, the living organ procedure keeps it at body temperature and connects it to a special machine called an Organ Care System that allows it to continue pumping warm, oxygenated blood. This technique can maintain the heart in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method.\r\n\r\nNon-beating heart transplant[edit]\r\nThe first successful non-beating heart transplant was achieved in Australia in 2014, performed by cardiothoracic surgeon Kumud Dhital. The transplant was made possible by the development of preservation technology able to preserve a heart, resuscitate it and to assess the function of the heart. The first patient to have this surgery was 57-year-old Michelle Gribilas.[8] Papworth Hospital in England (where the first non-beating heart transplant in Europe was carried out) stated that the technique could increase the number of hearts available for transplant by at least 25\%. [9]\r\n\r\nPost-operative[edit]\r\n\r\nTransplanted heart in the thorax of recipient\r\nThe patient is taken to the ICU to recover. When they wake up, they move to a special recovery unit for rehabilitation. The duration of in-hospital, post-transplant care depends on the patient\'s general health, how well the heart is working, and the patient\'s ability to look after the new heart. Doctors typically prefer that patients leave the hospital 1â€“2 weeks after surgery, because of the risk of infection and presuming no complications. After release, the patient returns for regular check-ups and rehabilitation. They may also require emotional support. The frequency of hospital visits decreases as the patient adjusts to the transplant. The patient remains on immunosuppressant medication to avoid the possibility of rejection. Since the vagus nerve is severed during the operation, the new heart beats at around 100 beats per minute unless nerve regrowth occurs.\r\n\r\nImmunosuppressive agents are continued in the intensive care unit.\r\n\r\nThe patient is regularly monitored to detect rejection. This surveillance can be performed via frequent biopsy or a gene expression blood test known as AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing. Typically, biopsy is performed immediately post-transplant and then AlloMap replaces it once the patient is stable. The transition from biopsy to AlloMap can occur as soon as 55 days after the transplant.\r\n\r\nComplications[edit]\r\nPost-operative complications include infection, sepsis, organ rejection, as well as the side-effects of the immunosuppressive medication. Since the transplanted heart originates from another organism, the recipient\'s immune system typically attempts to reject it. The risk of rejection never fully goes away, and the patient will be on immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of his or her life, but these may cause unwanted side effects, such as increased likelihood of infections, like fevers, unusual pains, or any new feelings. Recipients can get kidney disease from a heart transplant. Many recent advances in reducing complications due to tissue rejection stem from mouse heart transplant procedures.[10] Surgery death rate is 5-10\% in 2011.[11] Hong Kong death rate is 5\% for 16 patients from beginning to 2014.[12]\r\n\r\nPrognosis[edit]\r\nThe prognosis for heart transplant patients following the orthotopic procedure has increased over the past 20 years, and as of June 5, 2009, the survival rates were:[13]\r\n\r\n1 year: 88.0\% (males), 86.2\% (females)\r\n3 years: 79.3\% (males), 77.2\% (females)\r\n5 years: 73.2\% (males), 69.0\% (females)\r\nIn a study spanning 1999 to 2007, conducted on behalf of the U.S. federal government by Dr. Eric Weiss of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, it was discovered that, compared to men receiving male hearts, \"men receiving female hearts had a 15\% increase in the risk of adjusted cumulative mortality\" over five years. No significant differences were noted with females receiving hearts from male or female donors.[14]\r\n\r\nNotable recipients[edit]\r\nAt the time of his death on August 10, 2009, Tony Huesman was the world\'s longest living heart transplant recipient, having survived for 30 years, 11 months and 10 days, before dying of cancer.[15] Huesman received a heart in 1978 at the age of 20 after viral pneumonia severely weakened his heart.[16] The operation was performed at Stanford University under heart transplant pioneer Dr. Norman Shumway.[17]\r\n\r\nAs of December 2013, the record holder for longest living heart recipient is Englishman John McCafferty, 71. He received his heart on 20 October 1982.[15]\r\n\r\nKelly Perkins climbs mountains around the world to promote positive awareness of organ donation. Perkins was the first recipient to climb the peaks of Mt. Fuji, Mt. Kilimanjaro, the Matterhorn, Mt. Whitney, and Cajon de Arenales in Argentina in 2007, 12 years after her surgery.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nTwenty-two years after Dwight Kroening\'s heart transplant, he was the first recipient to finish an Ironman competition.[18]\r\n\r\nFiona Coote was the fourth Australian to receive a heart transplant in 1984 (at age 14) and the youngest Australian. In the 24 years after her transplant she became involved in publicity and charity work for the Red Cross, and promoted organ donation in Australia.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nRace car driver and manufacturer Carroll Shelby received a heart transplant in 1990.[19]\r\n\r\nGolfer Erik Compton qualified for the PGA Tour at age 32, after his second heart transplant.[20]\r\n\r\nFormer Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney received a heart transplant on March 24, 2012.[21]\r\n\r\nFormer chairman and founder of MCI Communications William G. McGowan received a heart transplant on April 25, 1987.[22] After a six-month recovery, McGowan returned to his duties as MCI chairman where he remained until his death on June 8, 1992 from another heart attack.[23]'
heartFail.txt,'The term \"heart failure\" makes it sound like the heart is no longer working at all and there\'s nothing that can be done. Actually, heart failure means that the heart isn\'t pumping as well as it should be.\r\n\r\nYour body depends on the heart\'s pumping action to deliver oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the body\'s cells. When the cells are nourished properly, the body can function normally.\r\n\r\nWith heart failure, the weakened heart can\'t supply the cells with enough blood. This results in fatigue and shortness of breath and some people have coughing. Everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs or carrying groceries can become very difficult.\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a serious condition, and usually there\'s no cure. But many people with heart failure lead a full, enjoyable life when the condition is managed with heart failure medications and healthy lifestyle changes. It\'s also helpful to have the support of family and friends who understand your condition.\r\n\r\nHow the normal heart works\r\n\r\nThe normal healthy heart is a strong, muscular pump a little larger than a fist. It pumps blood continuously through the circulatory system. Watch an animation of blood flow through the heart.\r\n\r\nThe heart has four chambers, two on the right and two on the left:\r\n\r\nTwo upper chambers called atria (one is an atrium)\r\nTwo lower chambers called ventricles\r\nThe right atria takes in oxygen-depleted blood from the rest of the body and sends it back out to the lungs through the right ventricle where the blood becomes oxygenated.\r\n\r\nOxygen-rich blood travels from the lungs to the left atrium, then on to the left ventricle, which pumps it to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nThe heart pumps blood to the lungs and to all the body\'s tissues by a sequence of highly organized contractions of the four chambers. For the heart to function properly, the four chambers must beat in an organized way.\r\n\r\nWhat is heart failure?\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood through to meet the body\'s needs for blood and oxygen. Basically, the heart can\'t keep up with its workload. \r\nWatch an animation of heart failure\r\n\r\nAt first the heart tries to make up for this by:\r\nEnlarging. When your heart chamber enlarges, it stretches more and can contract more strongly, so it pumps more blood. With an enlarged heart, your body starts to retain fluid, your lungs get congested with fluid and your heart begins to beat irregularly.\r\nDeveloping more muscle mass. The increase in muscle mass occurs because the contracting cells of the heart get bigger. This lets the heart pump more strongly, at least initially.\r\nPumping faster. This helps to increase the heart\'s output.\r\nThe body also tries to compensate in other ways:\r\n\r\nThe blood vessels narrow to keep blood pressure up, trying to make up for the heart\'s loss of power.\r\nThe body diverts blood away from less important tissues and organs (like the kidneys), the heart and brain.\r\nThese temporary measures mask the problem of heart failure, but they don\'t solve it. Heart failure continues and worsens until these substitute processes no longer work.\r\n\r\nEventually the heart and body just can\'t keep up, and the person experiences the fatigue, breathing problems or other symptoms that usually prompt a trip to the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe body\'s compensation mechanisms help explain why some people may not become aware of their condition until years after their heart begins its decline. (It\'s also a good reason to have a regular checkup with your doctor.)\r\n\r\nHeart failure can involve the heart\'s left side, right side or both sides. Ho'
heartTest.txt,'Essential update: FDA approves I(f) \"funny\" current inhibitor for patients with worsening heart failure\r\nIn April 2015, the FDA approved ivabradine (Corlanor) to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35\% or lower, who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 70 bpm or higher, and who are either on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use.[1, 2] This drug blocks the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel responsible for the cardiac pacemaker I(f) \"funny\" current, which regulates heart rate without any effect on ventricular repolarization or myocardial contractility.\r\n\r\nApproval for ivabradine was based on the international, placebo-controlled SHIFT trial published in 2010, which randomized more than 6500 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV heart failure and an LVEF of 35\% or lower.[1, 2] The trial saw a highly significant 18\% drop in risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure over an average of 23 months in patients treated with ivabradine.\r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms\r\nSigns and symptoms of heart failure include the following:\r\n\r\nExertional dyspnea and/or dyspnea at rest\r\nOrthopnea\r\nAcute pulmonary edema\r\nChest pain/pressure and palpitations\r\nTachycardia\r\nFatigue and weakness\r\nNocturia and oliguria\r\nAnorexia, weight loss, nausea\r\nExophthalmos and/or visible pulsation of eyes\r\nDistention of neck veins\r\nWeak, rapid, and thready pulse\r\nRales, wheezing\r\nS 3 gallop and/or pulsus alternans\r\nIncreased intensity of P 2 heart sound\r\nHepatojugular reflux\r\nAscites, hepatomegaly, and/or anasarca\r\nCentral or peripheral cyanosis, pallor\r\nSee Clinical Presentation for more detail.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\nHeart failure criteria, classification, and staging\r\n\r\nThe Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure consists of the concurrent presence of either 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria.[3]\r\n\r\nMajor criteria include the following:\r\n\r\nParoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea\r\nWeight loss of 4.5 kg in 5 days in response to treatment\r\nNeck vein distention\r\nRales\r\nAcute pulmonary edema\r\nHepatojugular reflux\r\nS 3 gallop\r\nCentral venous pressure greater than 16 cm water\r\nCirculation time of 25 seconds\r\nRadiographic cardiomegaly\r\nPulmonary edema, visceral congestion, or cardiomegaly at autopsy\r\nMinor criteria are as follows:\r\n\r\nNocturnal cough\r\nDyspnea on ordinary exertion\r\nA decrease in vital capacity by one third the maximal value recorded\r\nPleural effusion\r\nTachycardia (rate of 120 bpm)\r\nBilateral ankle edema\r\nThe New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system categorizes heart failure on a scale of I to IV,[4] as follows:\r\n\r\nClass I: No limitation of physical activity\r\nClass II: Slight limitation of physical activity\r\nClass III: Marked limitation of physical activity\r\nClass IV: Symptoms occur even at rest; discomfort with any physical activity\r\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) staging system is defined by the following 4 stages[5, 6] :\r\n\r\nStage A: High risk of heart failure but no structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage B: Structural heart disease but no symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage C: Structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage D: Refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nThe following tests may be useful in the initial evaluation for suspected heart failure[5, 7, 8] :\r\n\r\nComplete blood count (CBC)\r\nUrinalysis\r\nElectrolyte levels\r\nRenal and liver function studies\r\nFasting blood glucose levels\r\nLipid profile\r\nThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels\r\nB-type natriuretic peptide levels\r\nN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide\r\nElectrocardiography\r\nChest radiography\r\n2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography\r\nNuclear imaging [9]\r\nMaximal exercise testing\r\nPulse oximetry or arterial blood gas\r\nSee Workup for more detail.\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nTreatment includes the following:\r\n\r\nNonpharmacologic therapy: Oxygen and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, dietary sodium and fluid restriction, physical activity as appropriate, and attention to weight gain\r\nPharmacotherapy: Diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic agents, anticoagulants, beta blockers, and digoxin\r\nSurgical options\r\n\r\nSurgical treatment options include the following:\r\n\r\nElectrophysiologic intervention\r\nRevascularization procedures\r\nValve replacement/repair\r\nVentricular restoration\r\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation\r\nVentricular assist devices\r\nHeart transplantation\r\nTotal artificial heart\r\nSee Treatment and Medication for more detail.'
heart_failure_8.txt,'ï»¿Valvular heart disease is any disease process involving one or more of the four valves of the heart (the aortic and mitral valves on the left and the pulmonary and tricuspid valves on the right). These conditions occur largely as a result of aging. Most people are in their late 50s when diagnosed, and more than one in ten people over 75 have it.\r\n\r\nEarly detection may improve outcomes from surgery.\r\n\r\nCollectively and anatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue makeup of the heart known as the cardiac skeleton. Valve problems may be congenital (inborn) or acquired (due to another cause later in life). Treatment may be with medication but often (depending on the severity) involves valve repair or replacement (insertion of an artificial heart valve). Specific situations include those where additional demands are made on the circulation, such as in pregnancy.[1]\r\n\r\nPhonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png\r\nValve involved\tStenotic disease\tInsufficiency/regurgitation disease\r\nAortic valve\tAortic valve stenosis\tAortic insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nMitral valve\tMitral valve stenosis\tMitral insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nTricuspid valve\tTricuspid valve stenosis\tTricuspid insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nPulmonary valve\tPulmonary valve stenosis\tPulmonary insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nAortic and mitral valve disorders[edit]\r\nThese are termed left heart diseases.\r\n\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders[edit]\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve diseases are right heart diseases.

Ebstein\'s anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve.[1]\r\n\r\nRheumatic disorders[edit]\r\nValvular heart disease resulting from rheumatic fever is referred to as \"rheumatic heart disease\". While developed countries once had a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, medical advances and improved social conditions have dramatically reduced their incidence. Many developing countries, as well as indigenous populations within developed countries, still carry a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and there has been a resurgence in efforts to eradicate the diseases in these populations. Inflammation of the heart valves due to any cause is called endocarditis; this is usually due to bacterial infection but may also be due to cancer (marantic endocarditis), certain autoimmune conditions (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (Loeffler endocarditis). Certain medications have been associated with valvular heart disease, most prominently ergotamine derivatives pergolide and cabergoline.[3]\r\n\r\nIn pregnancy[edit]\r\nThe evaluation of individuals with valvular heart disease who are or wish to become pregnant is a difficult issue. Issues that have to be addressed include the risks during pregnancy to the mother and the developing fetus by the presence of maternal valvular heart disease as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy. Normal physiological changes during pregnancy require, on average, a 50\% increase in circulating blood volume that is accompanied by an increase in cardiac output that usually peaks between the midportion of the second and third trimesters.[4] The increased cardiac output is due to an increase in the stroke volume, and a small increase in heart rate, averaging 10 to 20 beats per minute.[4] Additionally uterine circulation and endogenous hormones cause systemic vascular resistance to decrease and a disproportionately lowering of diastolic blood pressure causes a wide pulse pressure.[4] Inferior vena caval obstruction from a gravid uterus in the supine position can result in an abrupt decrease in cardiac preload, which leads to hypotension with weakness and lightheadedness.[4] During labor and delivery cardiac output increases more in part due to the associated anxiety and pain, as well as due to uterine contractions which will cause an increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[4]\r\n\r\nValvular heart lesions associated with high maternal and fetal risk during pregnancy include:[4]\r\n\r\nSevere aortic stenosis with or without symptoms\r\nAortic regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nMitral stenosis with NYHA functional class II-IV symptoms\r\nMitral regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease resulting in severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary pressure greater than 75\% of systemic pressures)\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease with severe LV dysfunction (EF less than 0.40)\r\nMechanical prosthetic valve requiring anticoagulation\r\nMarfan syndrome with or without aortic regurgitation\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nIn individuals who require an artificial heart valve, consideration must be made for deterioration of the valve over time (for bioprosthetic valves) versus the risks of blood clotting in pregnancy with mechanical valves with the resultant need of drugs in pregnancy in the form of anticoagulation.\r\n\r\nComparison[edit]\r\nThe following table includes the main types of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Major types of valvular heart disease not included in the table include mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis.\r\n\r\nValvular disease\tMitral stenosis\tAortic stenosis\tAortic regurgitation\tMitral regurgitation\tTricuspid regurgitation\r\nPrevalence\tMost common valvular heart disease in pregnancy[5]\tApproximately 2\% of people over the age of 65, 3\% of people over age 75, and 4\% percent of people over age 85[6]\t\t2\% of the population, equally in males and females.[7]\t\r\nMain causes and risk factors\tAlmost always caused by rheumatic heart disease[8]\t\r\nCalcification of tricuspid aortic valve with age[8]\r\n(>50\%[9])\r\nCalcification of bicuspid aortic valve[8]\r\n(30-40\%[9])\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\n(<10\%[9])\r\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia and uremia may speed up the process.[9]\r\n\r\nAcute\r\nInfective endocarditis[8][9]\r\nTrauma[8]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nPrimary valvular: rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan\'s syndrome, Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus[8]\r\nDisease of the aortic root: syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, BehÃ§et\'s disease, reactive arthritis, systemic hypertension[8]\r\nAcute\r\nEndocarditis, mainly S. aureus[8]\r\nPapillary muscle rupture or dysfunction,[8] including mitral valve prolapse[9]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\nMarfan\'s syndrome[8]\r\nCardiomyopathy[8]\r\nUsually secondary to right ventricular dilation[8]\r\nleft ventricular failure is, in turn, the most common cause[8]\r\nRight ventricular infarction[8]\r\nInferior myocardial infarction[8]\r\nCor pulmonale[8]\r\nOther causes: Tricuspid endocarditis, rheumatic fever, Ebstein\'s anomaly, carcinoid syndrome and myxomatous degeneration[8]\r\nHemo\r\ndynamics\r\n/\r\nPatho-\r\nphysiology\tProgressive obstruction of the mitral ostium causes increased pressure in the left atrium and the pulmonary circulation.[9] Congestion may cause thromboembolism, and atrial hypertension may cause atrial fibrillation.[9]\tObstruction through the aortic ostium causes increased pressure in the left ventricle and impaired flow through the aorta\tInsufficiency of the aortic valve causes backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole.\tInsufficiency of the mitral valve causes backflow of blood into the left atrium during systole.\tInsufficiency of the tricuspid valve causes backflow of blood into the right atrium during systole.\r\nSymptoms\t\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nChest pain[8]\r\nHemoptysis[8]\r\nThromboembolism[8]\r\nAscites and edema (if right-sided heart failure develops)[8]\r\nSymptoms increase with exercise and pregnancy[8]\r\n\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion (most frequent symptom[9]), orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nSyncope, usually exertional[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nIn acute cases: cyanosis and circulatory shock[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nPulmonary edema[8]\r\nSymptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as ascites, hepatomegaly, edema and jugular venous distension[8]\r\nMedical signs\t\r\nOpening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic rumble with presystolic accentuation.[8][9]\r\nThe opening snap follows closer to the S2 heart tone with worsening stenosis.[8]\r\nThe murmur is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope[8] lying on the left side[9] and its duration increases with worsening disease.[8]\r\nLoud S1 -

It means your heart needs some support to do its job, usually in the form of medicines.\r\nBreathlessness, feeling very tired and ankle swelling are the main symptoms of heart failure. But all of these symptoms can have other causes, only some of which are serious.\r\nThe symptoms of heart failure can develop quickly (acute heart failure). If this happens, you will need to be treated in hospital. But they can also develop gradually (chronic heart failure).\r\nRead more about the symptoms of heart failure.\r\nTypes of heart failure\r\nThere are three main types of heart failure. They are:\r\nheart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) â€“ this is because the part of the heart that pumps blood around your body (the left ventricle) becomes weak \r\nheart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) â€“ usually a result of the left ventricle become stiff, causing difficulty filling with blood\r\nheart failure caused by diseased or damaged heart valves\r\nIt is important the type of heart failure you have is identified as it will affect the type of treatment you will be offered. A number of tests can be used to help diagnose heart failure.\r\nYou should also have blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. These are used to investigate your heart and check how well it is functioning. If you have not had these tests, you should ask your doctor for an explanation.\r\nRead more about how heart failure is diagnosed.\r\nWhat causes heart failure?\r\nHeart failure does not often have a single cause. A number of problems usually \"gang up\" on the heart, causing it to fail.\r\nThere are a number of health conditions that increase your chances of developing heart failure, including:\r\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension) â€“ this can put extra strain on the heart, which over time can lead to heart failure\r\ncoronary heart disease (CHD) â€“ where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged up by fatty substances (atherosclerosis), and may cause angina or a heart attack\r\nheart muscle weakness (cardiomyopathy) â€“ this can cause heart failure; the reasons for this are often unclear, but it may be genetic in origin, or caused by an infection (usually viral), alcohol misuse, or medication used to treat cancer\r\nheart rhythm disturbance (atrial fibrillation)\r\nheart valve disease, damage or problems with the heart\'s valves\r\nSometimes anaemia, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also lead to heart failure.\r\nRead more about the causes of heart failure.\r\nTreating heart failure\r\nIn most cases, heart failure is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured. Treatment therefore aims to find a combination of measures, including lifestyle changes, medicines, devices or surgery that will improve heart function or help the body get rid of excess water.\r\nA cure may be possible in cases where heart failure has a specific cause. For example, if your heart valves are damaged, it may be possible to replace them, which can cure the condition.\r\nAs treatment will usually be lifelong, you and your doctor will need to find a balance of effective treatments that you can manage in the long term so you have the best symptom control and quality of life possible.\r\nEffective treatment for heart failure can have the following benefits:\r\nit helps make the heart stronger\r\nit improves your symptoms\r\nit reduces the risk of a flare-up\r\nit allows people with the condition to live longer and fuller lives\r\nRead more about how heart failure is treated.\r\nPreventing heart failure\r\nMany of the factors that increase your risk of developing heart failure can be managed either by making lifestyle changes or by taking medicines.\r\nFor example, in terms of lifestyle factors, you should:\r\nstop smoking (if you smoke)\r\nkeep your blood pressure at a healthy level\r\nkeep your cholesterol level under control\r\nmaintain a healthy weight (neither too fat nor too thin)\r\neat healthily, including avoiding excess salt in your diet (but severe salt restriction is rarely necessary and is not good for most people); most people should also ensure they have enough iron in their diet (eating red meat or iron supplements can help this)\r\nexercise regularly\r\nlimit your alcohol consumption\r\nRead more about preventing heart failure.\r\nLiving with heart failure\r\nBeing diagnosed with heart failure may come as a shock. While the outlook is related to age, the severity of the heart condition, and any other health problems that may exist, such as lung or kidney disease, anaemia and diabetes, it also depends on what you do to reduce your risk.\r\nSelf care means taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing, with support from the people who are involved in your care.\r\nIt is very important that you take any prescribed medication, even after you feel better. Some medicines are designed to protect or heal your heart.\r\nIf you do not take them, they cannot help and the underlying problem will get worse. The medicines can prevent or delay your heart problem and stop symptoms getting worse.\r\nSpeak to your healthcare team if you have any questions or concerns about the medication you are taking or any potential side effects.\r\nAs heart failure is a long-term condition, you will have regular contact with your healthcare team. Developing a good relationship with the members of your team will enable you to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you have. The more the team knows about you, the more they can help you.\r\nRead more about living with heart failure.\r\n\r\nAn echocardiogram is one of the main methods used to diagnose heart failure \r\nHow common is heart failure?\r\nHeart failure affects about 900,000 people in the UK.\r\nThe condition can affect people of all ages, but it is more common in older people â€“ more than half of all people with heart failure are over the age of 75.\r\nHeart failure is associated with a number of other serious health conditions, including coronary heart disease, heart attack and high blood pressure (hypertension).\r\n\r\nFlu and the flu vaccine\r\nYour guide to flu symptoms and the flu vaccine, including who should be vaccinated this winter\r\n\r\nLife with heart disease\r\nTips on living with a long-term condition, including healthcare, medicines and support\r\nPage last reviewed: 02/09/2014\r\nNext review due: 02/09/2016\r\nShare:Email shareTwitter shareFacebook shareSave:Google BookmarksNHS Choices Saved PagesPrint:\r\nRatings\r\nHow helpful is this page?\r\nAverage rating\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\nBased on 337 ratings View all ratings\r\nAdd your rating\r\n\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\nPlease leave your rating\r\nLeave your comment Log in or Register\r\nShare your views and experiences with others.\r\nIf you want a response from an NHS professional or the website team, please contact us.\r\nComments (2) â–º\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful links\r\n\r\nNHS Choices links\r\n\r\nAtherosclerosis\r\nAtrial fibrillation\r\nAngina\r\nCoronary heart disease\r\nHeart attack\r\nHigh blood pressure\r\nStroke\r\nExternal links\r\n\r\nBritish Heart Foundation: heart health\r\nhealthtalk.org: heart failure\r\nHEART UK\r\nheartfailurematters.org\r\nThe Somerville Foundation\r\n\r\nHeart rhythm problems\r\nAn arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat that can seriously affect quality of life and even cause death.

hTest.txt,'There are lots of reasons why you might be diagnosed with heart failure. It can be sudden or it can happen slowly over months or even years.\r\n\r\nThe most common causes are:\r\n\r\nheart attack\r\nhigh blood pressure\r\ncardiomyopathy (diseases of the heart muscle. Sometimes these are inherited from your family and sometimes they are caused by other things, such as viral infections).\r\nHeart failure can also be caused by:\r\n\r\nheart valve problems\r\nalcohol or recreational drugs\r\nan uncontrolled irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\r\ncongenital heart conditions (ones you’re born with)\r\na viral infection affecting the heart muscle\r\nsome cancer treatments.\r\nHeart health and cancer treatment cover imageIf you are having treatment for cancer and have a heart condition, or have been told that your treatment may affect your heart, you might find Heart health and cancer treatment helpful. It\'s a new booklet jointly produced by Macmillan Cancer Support and the British Heart Foundation and you can order free copies online from Macmillan Cancer Support.\r\n\r\nPulmonary hypertension\r\nHeart failure can also be caused by pulmonary hypertension (raised blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply your lungs). This condition can damage the right side of your heart, leading to heart failure. In some cases the pulmonary hypertension itself is caused by an existing heart condition.\r\n\r\nFind out more about pulmonary hypertension on NHS Choices.\r\n\r\nWhat are the symptoms of heart failure?\r\nThe main symptoms are:\r\n\r\nshortness of breath - when you are being active or at rest\r\nswelling - of your feet, ankles, stomach and lower back areas\r\nfatigue - feeling unusually tired or weak\r\nSymptoms occur because the heart does not have enough strength to pump blood all the way round the body efficiently. This can cause fluid to pool in the feet and legs.  If this fluid is left unmanaged, it can build and spread to your stomach area and sit beneath your lungs. This reduces their ability to expand and makes you short of breath.\r\n\r\nMedication and making changes to the way you live can make a real difference to these symptoms. People with heart failure experience different symptoms and everyone copes in different ways, so speak to your GP and your heart failure nurse about what is best for you.\r\n\r\nFor more information about understanding and managing the symptoms of heart failure, take a look at our advice and information on living with heart failure.\r\n\r\nHow is heart failure diagnosed?\r\nTo diagnose heart failure, your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history, talk about your symptom and do a physical examination. In most cases you will also have further tests to confirm the diagnosis and guide how your symptoms are controlled. These include blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a chest x-ray, an echocardiogram and a coronary angiogram.\r\n\r\nYou may hear your doctor talk about the ‘ejection fraction’ of your heart. This refers to the amount of blood that is pushed out of your left ventricle every time your heart beats. It’s usually expressed as a percentage. A normal ejection fraction is around 50-65 per cent, as there is always some blood left in the heart after each heartbeat. Some people with heart failure have a normal ejection fraction, so ejection fraction is used alongside other tests to help diagnose heart failure.\r\n\r\nAfter a diagnosis, your doctor may discuss your \'stage\' or \'class\' of heart failure. There are four classes, which are based on your symptoms and how they affect you. The higher the number of the class you are in, the more serious your heart failure has become.  It is also possible to move between stages as you may have episodes where your heart failure is worse because of other events, such as a further heart attack.\r\n\r\nWhat treatments are available for heart failure?\r\nWhile there isn\'t a cure for heart failure at the moment, the treatments available to control symptoms are helping many people live full and active lives.\r\n\r\nYour doctor is likely to prescribe drugs that will help control your blood pressure and help the pumping action of your heart.\r\n\r\nThey will also give you advice about making changes to your lifestyle such as cutting down on salt, which will help control your blood pressure, and stopping smoking.\r\n\r\nA combination of medication and lifestyle changes will hopefully help you continue to do the things you enjoy, by helping you manage your symptoms and keeping your condition as stable as possible.\r\n\r\nSome people with heart failure will benefit from a pacemaker or ICD. Your doctor will talk to you about these treatments if they are right for you.\r\n\r\nFind out more\r\nFind out more about living with heart failure\r\nOrder or download, \'An everyday guide to living with heart failure\'\r\nOrder our DVD, \'One step at a time: Living with heart failure\'\r\nOrder or download our booklet, \'Living with heart failure\'\r\nVisit the Heart Failure Matters website.\r\nFighting for a cure\r\nAt the moment, if you have a heart attack your heart muscle suffers damage that can never be repaired. But with recent advances in regenerative medicine, repairing a damaged heart is a realistic goal.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve launched our most ambitious research programme yet to progress the UK\'s fight against heart failure – our Mending Broken Hearts appeal.'
htTest.txt,'A heart transplant is surgery to remove a damaged or diseased heart and replace it with a healthy donor heart.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nFinding a donor heart can be difficult. The heart must be donated by someone who is brain-dead but is still on life support. The donor heart must be matched as closely as possible to your tissue type to reduce the chance that your body will reject it.\r\n\r\nYou are put into a deep sleep with general anesthesia, and a cut is made through the breastbone.\r\n\r\nYour blood flows through a heart-lung bypass machine while the surgeon works on your heart. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped, and supplies your body with blood and oxygen.\r\nYour diseased heart is removed and the donor heart is stitched in place. The heart-lung machine is then disconnected. Blood flows through the transplanted heart.\r\nTubes are inserted to drain air, fluid, and blood out of the chest for several days, and to allow the lungs to fully re-expand.\r\nIn some cases, the surgeon will not remove the old heart, but will put the new heart on top of it (heterotopic transplant).\r\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\r\nA heart transplant may be done to treat:\r\n\r\nSevere angina that can no longer be treated with medications or other surgeries\r\nSevere heart failure, when medicines, other treatments, and surgery no longer help\r\nSevere heart defects that were present at birth and cannot be fixed with surgery\r\nLife-threatening abnormal heartbeats or rhythms that do not respond to other treatments\r\nHeart transplant surgery may not be used in patients who:\r\n\r\nAre malnourished\r\nAre older than age 55 to 60\r\nHave had a severe stroke or dementia\r\nHave had cancer\r\nHave HIV infection\r\nHave infections, such as hepatitis, that are active\r\nHave insulin-dependent diabetes and other organs that aren\'t working correctly\r\nHave kidney, lung, nerve, or liver disease\r\nHave no family support and do not follow their treatment\r\nHave other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the neck and leg\r\nHave pulmonary hypertension (thickening of blood vessels in the lung)\r\nSmoke or abuse alcohol or drugs, or have other lifestyle habits that may damage the new heart\r\nThe doctor may not recommend a heart transplant if the patient may not be able to keep up with the many hospital and doctor\'s office visits, tests, and medications needed to keep the new heart healthy.\r\n\r\nRisks\r\nRisks from any anesthesia are:\r\n\r\nReactions to medications\r\nProblems breathing\r\nRisks from any surgery are:\r\n\r\nBleeding\r\nInfection\r\nRisks of transplant include:\r\n\r\nBlood clots (deep venous thrombosis)\r\nDamage to the kidneys, liver, or other organs from anti-rejection medications\r\nDevelopment of cancer from the drugs used to prevent rejection\r\nHeart attack or stroke\r\nHeart rhythm problems\r\nHigh cholesterol levels, diabetes, and bone thinning from the use of rejection medications\r\nIncreased risk for infections due to anti-rejection medications\r\nRejection of the heart\r\nSevere coronary artery disease\r\nWound infections\r\nBefore the Procedure\r\nOnce the doctor refers you to a transplant center, you will be evaluated by the transplant team. They will want to make sure that you are a good candidate for a transplant. You will visit many times over several weeks or even months. You will need to have blood drawn and x-rays taken. The following may also be done:\r\n\r\nBlood or skin tests to check for infections\r\nTests of your kidney and liver\r\nTests to evaluate your heart, such as EKG, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization\r\nTests to look for cancer\r\nTissue and blood typing, to help make sure your body will not reject the donated heart\r\nYou will want to look at one or more transplant centers to see which would be best for you:\r\n\r\nAsk them how many transplants they perform every year and what their survival rates are. Compare these numbers with the numbers from other centers.\r\nAsk what support groups they have available and how much help they offer with travel and housing.\r\nAsk about the costs of medications you will need to take afterwards.\r\nIf the transplant team believes you are a good candidate, you will be put on a national waiting list for a heart:\r\n\r\nYour place on the list is based on several factors. Key factors include the type and severity of your heart disease, and the likelihood that a transplant will be successful.\r\nThe amount of time you spend on a waiting list is usually NOT a factor for how soon you get a heart, except in the case of children.\r\nMost, but not all, patients who are waiting for heart transplants are very ill and need to be in the hospital. Many will need some sort of device to help their heart pump enough blood to the body. Most often this is a ventricular assist device (artificial heart-like device).\r\n\r\nAfter the Procedure\r\nYou should expect to stay in the hospital for 7 to 21 days after a heart transplant. The first 24 to 48 hours will likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). During the first few days after a transplant, you will need close follow-up to make sure that you do not get an infection and your heart is working well.\r\n\r\nThe recovery period is about 6 months. Often, your transplant team will ask you to stay fairly close to the hospital for the first 3 months. You will need to have regular check-ups with blood tests, x-rays, and echocardiograms for many years.\r\n\r\nFighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body\'s immune system considers the transplanted organ an infection and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take drugs that suppress the body\'s immune response. Taking medicines and following your doctor\'s instructions carefully is very important to preventing rejection.\r\n\r\nBiopsies of the heart muscle are often done every month during the first 6 to 12 months after transplant, and then less often after that. This helps the doctor determine if your body is rejecting the new heart, even before you have symptoms.\r\n\r\nYou must take drugs that prevent transplant rejection for the rest of your life. You will need to understand how to take these medications, and know their side effects.\r\n\r\nYou can go back to your normal activities as soon as you feel well enough, and after talking with your doctor. However, avoid vigorous physical activity.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that you do not develop coronary disease after a transplant, you may have cardiac catheterization every year.\r\n\r\nOutlook (Prognosis)\r\nHeart transplant prolongs the life of patients who would otherwise die. About 80\% of heart transplant patients are alive 2 years after the operation. At 5 years, 70\% of people will still be alive after a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nThe main problem, as with other transplants, is rejection. If rejection can be controlled, survival increases to over 10 years.\r\n\r\nAlternative Names\r\nCardiac transplant; Transplant - heart; Transplantation - heart\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nBernstein D.
