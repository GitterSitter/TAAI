As of 2008 the most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor (cadaveric allograft) and implant it into the patient. The patient\'s own heart is either removed (orthotopic procedure) or, less commonly, left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic procedure). Post-operation survival periods average 15 years.[1] Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease, but a life-saving treatment intended to improve the quality of life for recipients.[2]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n2 Contraindications\r\n3 Procedures\r\n3.1 Pre-operative\r\n3.2 Operative\r\n3.2.1 Orthotopic procedure\r\n3.2.2 Heterotopic procedure\r\n3.2.3 \'Living organ\' transplant\r\n3.2.4 Non-beating heart transplant\r\n3.3 Post-operative\r\n4 Complications\r\n5 Prognosis\r\n5.1 Notable recipients\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nNorman Shumway is widely regarded as the father of heart transplantation although the world\'s first adult human heart transplant was performed by a South African cardiac surgeon, Christiaan Barnard, utilizing the techniques developed and perfected by Shumway and Richard Lower.[3] Barnard performed the first transplant on Louis Washkansky on December 3, 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.[3][4] Adrian Kantrowitz performed the world\'s first pediatric heart transplant on December 6, 1967, at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, barely three days after Christiaan Barnard\'s pioneering procedure.[3] Norman Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on January 6, 1968, at the Stanford University Hospital.[3]\r\n\r\nWorldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are performed annually. The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000-2,300 annually). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 119 adult transplants in 2013 alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure.[5] The great disparity between the number of patients needing transplants and the number of procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non-human hearts into humans after 1993. Xenografts from other species and man-made artificial hearts are two less successful alternatives to allografts.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthotopic heart transplant. Recipient P-waves (arrows).\r\nContraindications[edit]\r\nSome patients are less suitable for a heart transplant, especially if they suffer from other circulatory conditions related to the heart. The following conditions in a patient increase the chances of complications:\r\n\r\nKidney, lung, or liver disease\r\nInsulin-dependent diabetes with other organ dysfunction\r\nLife-threatening diseases unrelated to heart failure\r\nVascular disease of the neck and leg arteries.\r\nHigh pulmonary vascular resistance\r\nRecent thromboembolism\r\nAge over 60 years (some variation between centers)\r\nSubstance abuse, notably tobacco smoking (which increases the chance of lung disease)\r\nProcedures[edit]\r\nPre-operative[edit]\r\nA typical heart transplantation begins when a suitable donor heart is identified. The heart comes from a recently deceased or brain dead donor, also called a beating heart cadaver. The patient is contacted by a nurse coordinator and instructed to come to the hospital for evaluation and pre-surgical medication. At the same time, the heart is removed from the donor and inspected by a team of surgeons to see if it is in suitable condition. Learning that a potential organ is unsuitable can induce distress in an already fragile patient, who usually requires emotional support before returning home.\r\n\r\nThe patient must also undergo emotional, psychological, and physical tests to verify mental health and ability to make good use of a new heart. The patient is also given immunosuppressant medication so that the patient\'s immune system does not reject the new heart.\r\n\r\nOperative[edit]\r\n\r\nSchematic of a transplanted heart with native lungs and the great vessels.\r\nOnce the donor heart passes inspection, the patient is taken into the operating room and given a general anaesthetic. Either an orthotopic or a heterotopic procedure follows, depending on the conditions of the patient and the donor heart.\r\n\r\nOrthotopic procedure[edit]\r\nThe orthotopic procedure begins with a median sternotomy, opening the chest and exposing the mediastinum. The pericardium is opened, the great vessels are dissected and the patient is attached to cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor\'s heart is injected with potassium chloride (KCl). Potassium chloride stops the heart beating before the heart is removed from the donor\'s body and packed in ice. Ice can usually keep the heart usable for four[6] to six hours depending on preservation and starting condition. The failing heart is removed by transecting the great vessels and a portion of the left atrium. The patient\'s pulmonary veins are not transected; rather a circular portion of the left atrium containing the pulmonary veins is left in place. The donor heart is trimmed to fit onto the patient\'s remaining left atrium and the great vessels are sutured in place. The new heart is restarted, the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and the chest cavity is closed.\r\n\r\nThe orthotopic procedure was developed by Shumway and Lower at Stanford-Lane Hospital in San Francisco in 1958.[3]\r\n\r\nHeterotopic procedure[edit]\r\nIn the heterotopic procedure, the patient\'s own heart is not removed. The new heart is positioned so that the chambers and blood vessels of both hearts can be connected to form what is effectively a \'double heart\'. The procedure can give the patient\'s original heart a chance to recover, and if the donor\'s heart fails (e.g., through rejection), it can later be removed, leaving the patient\'s original heart. Heterotopic procedures are used only in cases where the donor heart is not strong enough to function by itself (because either the patient\'s body is considerably larger than the donor\'s, the donor\'s heart is itself weak, or the patient suffers from pulmonary hypertension).\r\n\r\n\'Living organ\' transplant[edit]\r\nIn February 2006, at the Bad Oeynhausen Clinic for Thorax and Cardiovascular Surgery, Germany, surgeons successfully transplanted a \'beating heart\' into a patient.[7] Rather than cooling the heart, the living organ procedure keeps it at body temperature and connects it to a special machine called an Organ Care System that allows it to continue pumping warm, oxygenated blood. This technique can maintain the heart in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method.\r\n\r\nNon-beating heart transplant[edit]\r\nThe first successful non-beating heart transplant was achieved in Australia in 2014, performed by cardiothoracic surgeon Kumud Dhital. The transplant was made possible by the development of preservation technology able to preserve a heart, resuscitate it and to assess the function of the heart. The first patient to have this surgery was 57-year-old Michelle Gribilas.[8] Papworth Hospital in England (where the first non-beating heart transplant in Europe was carried out) stated that the technique could increase the number of hearts available for transplant by at least 25\%. [9]\r\n\r\nPost-operative[edit]\r\n\r\nTransplanted heart in the thorax of recipient\r\nThe patient is taken to the ICU to recover. When they wake up, they move to a special recovery unit for rehabilitation. The duration of in-hospital, post-transplant care depends on the patient\'s general health, how well the heart is working, and the patient\'s ability to look after the new heart. Doctors typically prefer that patients leave the hospital 1–2 weeks after surgery, because of the risk of infection and presuming no complications. After release, the patient returns for regular check-ups and rehabilitation. They may also require emotional support. The frequency of hospital visits decreases as the patient adjusts to the transplant. The patient remains on immunosuppressant medication to avoid the possibility of rejection. Since the vagus nerve is severed during the operation, the new heart beats at around 100 beats per minute unless nerve regrowth occurs.\r\n\r\nImmunosuppressive agents are continued in the intensive care unit.\r\n\r\nThe patient is regularly monitored to detect rejection. This surveillance can be performed via frequent biopsy or a gene expression blood test known as AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing. Typically, biopsy is performed immediately post-transplant and then AlloMap replaces it once the patient is stable. The transition from biopsy to AlloMap can occur as soon as 55 days after the transplant.\r\n\r\nComplications[edit]\r\nPost-operative complications include infection, sepsis, organ rejection, as well as the side-effects of the immunosuppressive medication. Since the transplanted heart originates from another organism, the recipient\'s immune system typically attempts to reject it. The risk of rejection never fully goes away, and the patient will be on immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of his or her life, but these may cause unwanted side effects, such as increased likelihood of infections, like fevers, unusual pains, or any new feelings. Recipients can get kidney disease from a heart transplant. Many recent advances in reducing complications due to tissue rejection stem from mouse heart transplant procedures.[10] Surgery death rate is 5-10\% in 2011.[11] Hong Kong death rate is 5\% for 16 patients from beginning to 2014.[12]\r\n\r\nPrognosis[edit]\r\nThe prognosis for heart transplant patients following the orthotopic procedure has increased over the past 20 years, and as of June 5, 2009, the survival rates were:[13]\r\n\r\n1 year: 88.0\% (males), 86.2\% (females)\r\n3 years: 79.3\% (males), 77.2\% (females)\r\n5 years: 73.2\% (males), 69.0\% (females)\r\nIn a study spanning 1999 to 2007, conducted on behalf of the U.S. federal government by Dr. Eric Weiss of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, it was discovered that, compared to men receiving male hearts, \"men receiving female hearts had a 15\% increase in the risk of adjusted cumulative mortality\" over five years. No significant differences were noted with females receiving hearts from male or female donors.[14]\r\n\r\nNotable recipients[edit]\r\nAt the time of his death on August 10, 2009, Tony Huesman was the world\'s longest living heart transplant recipient, having survived for 30 years, 11 months and 10 days, before dying of cancer.[15] Huesman received a heart in 1978 at the age of 20 after viral pneumonia severely weakened his heart.[16] The operation was performed at Stanford University under heart transplant pioneer Dr. Norman Shumway.[17]\r\n\r\nAs of December 2013, the record holder for longest living heart recipient is Englishman John McCafferty, 71. He received his heart on 20 October 1982.[15]\r\n\r\nKelly Perkins climbs mountains around the world to promote positive awareness of organ donation. Perkins was the first recipient to climb the peaks of Mt. Fuji, Mt. Kilimanjaro, the Matterhorn, Mt. Whitney, and Cajon de Arenales in Argentina in 2007, 12 years after her surgery.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nTwenty-two years after Dwight Kroening\'s heart transplant, he was the first recipient to finish an Ironman competition.[18]\r\n\r\nFiona Coote was the fourth Australian to receive a heart transplant in 1984 (at age 14) and the youngest Australian. In the 24 years after her transplant she became involved in publicity and charity work for the Red Cross, and promoted organ donation in Australia.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nRace car driver and manufacturer Carroll Shelby received a heart transplant in 1990.[19]\r\n\r\nGolfer Erik Compton qualified for the PGA Tour at age 32, after his second heart transplant.[20]\r\n\r\nFormer Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney received a heart transplant on March 24, 2012.[21]\r\n\r\nFormer chairman and founder of MCI Communications William G. McGowan received a heart transplant on April 25, 1987.[22] After a six-month recovery, McGowan returned to his duties as MCI chairman where he remained until his death on June 8, 1992 from another heart attack.[23]',2
'﻿Valvular heart disease is any disease process involving one or more of the four valves of the heart (the aortic and mitral valves on the left and the pulmonary and tricuspid valves on the right). These conditions occur largely as a result of aging. Most people are in their late 50s when diagnosed, and more than one in ten people over 75 have it.\r\n\r\nEarly detection may improve outcomes from surgery.\r\n\r\nCollectively and anatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue makeup of the heart known as the cardiac skeleton. Valve problems may be congenital (inborn) or acquired (due to another cause later in life). Treatment may be with medication but often (depending on the severity) involves valve repair or replacement (insertion of an artificial heart valve). Specific situations include those where additional demands are made on the circulation, such as in pregnancy.[1]\r\n\r\nPhonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png\r\nValve involved\tStenotic disease\tInsufficiency/regurgitation disease\r\nAortic valve\tAortic valve stenosis\tAortic insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nMitral valve\tMitral valve stenosis\tMitral insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nTricuspid valve\tTricuspid valve stenosis\tTricuspid insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nPulmonary valve\tPulmonary valve stenosis\tPulmonary insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nAortic and mitral valve disorders[edit]\r\nThese are termed left heart diseases.\r\n\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders[edit]\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve diseases are right heart diseases. Pulmonary valve diseases are the least common heart valve disease in adults.[2]\r\n\r\nThe most common types of pulmonary valve diseases are:\r\n\r\npulmonary valve stenosis\r\npulmonary valve insufficiency\r\npulmonary valve incompetence\r\npulmonary valve regurgitation\r\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases classifies non rheumatic pulmonary valve diseases as I37.\r\n\r\nBoth tricuspid and pulmonary valve diseases are less common than aortic or mitral valve diseases due to the lower pressure those valves experience.[2]\r\n\r\nDysplasia[edit]\r\nHeart valve dysplasia is an error in the development of any of the heart valves, and a common cause of congenital heart defects in humans as well as animals; tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect with four abnormalities, one of which is stenosis of the pulmonary valve. Ebstein\'s anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve.[1]\r\n\r\nRheumatic disorders[edit]\r\nValvular heart disease resulting from rheumatic fever is referred to as \"rheumatic heart disease\". While developed countries once had a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, medical advances and improved social conditions have dramatically reduced their incidence. Many developing countries, as well as indigenous populations within developed countries, still carry a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and there has been a resurgence in efforts to eradicate the diseases in these populations. Inflammation of the heart valves due to any cause is called endocarditis; this is usually due to bacterial infection but may also be due to cancer (marantic endocarditis), certain autoimmune conditions (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (Loeffler endocarditis). Certain medications have been associated with valvular heart disease, most prominently ergotamine derivatives pergolide and cabergoline.[3]\r\n\r\nIn pregnancy[edit]\r\nThe evaluation of individuals with valvular heart disease who are or wish to become pregnant is a difficult issue. Issues that have to be addressed include the risks during pregnancy to the mother and the developing fetus by the presence of maternal valvular heart disease as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy. Normal physiological changes during pregnancy require, on average, a 50\% increase in circulating blood volume that is accompanied by an increase in cardiac output that usually peaks between the midportion of the second and third trimesters.[4] The increased cardiac output is due to an increase in the stroke volume, and a small increase in heart rate, averaging 10 to 20 beats per minute.[4] Additionally uterine circulation and endogenous hormones cause systemic vascular resistance to decrease and a disproportionately lowering of diastolic blood pressure causes a wide pulse pressure.[4] Inferior vena caval obstruction from a gravid uterus in the supine position can result in an abrupt decrease in cardiac preload, which leads to hypotension with weakness and lightheadedness.[4] During labor and delivery cardiac output increases more in part due to the associated anxiety and pain, as well as due to uterine contractions which will cause an increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[4]\r\n\r\nValvular heart lesions associated with high maternal and fetal risk during pregnancy include:[4]\r\n\r\nSevere aortic stenosis with or without symptoms\r\nAortic regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nMitral stenosis with NYHA functional class II-IV symptoms\r\nMitral regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease resulting in severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary pressure greater than 75\% of systemic pressures)\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease with severe LV dysfunction (EF less than 0.40)\r\nMechanical prosthetic valve requiring anticoagulation\r\nMarfan syndrome with or without aortic regurgitation\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nIn individuals who require an artificial heart valve, consideration must be made for deterioration of the valve over time (for bioprosthetic valves) versus the risks of blood clotting in pregnancy with mechanical valves with the resultant need of drugs in pregnancy in the form of anticoagulation.\r\n\r\nComparison[edit]\r\nThe following table includes the main types of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Major types of valvular heart disease not included in the table include mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis.\r\n\r\nValvular disease\tMitral stenosis\tAortic stenosis\tAortic regurgitation\tMitral regurgitation\tTricuspid regurgitation\r\nPrevalence\tMost common valvular heart disease in pregnancy[5]\tApproximately 2\% of people over the age of 65, 3\% of people over age 75, and 4\% percent of people over age 85[6]\t\t2\% of the population, equally in males and females.[7]\t\r\nMain causes and risk factors\tAlmost always caused by rheumatic heart disease[8]\t\r\nCalcification of tricuspid aortic valve with age[8]\r\n(>50\%[9])\r\nCalcification of bicuspid aortic valve[8]\r\n(30-40\%[9])\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\n(<10\%[9])\r\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia and uremia may speed up the process.[9]\r\n\r\nAcute\r\nInfective endocarditis[8][9]\r\nTrauma[8]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nPrimary valvular: rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan\'s syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus[8]\r\nDisease of the aortic root: syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behçet\'s disease, reactive arthritis, systemic hypertension[8]\r\nAcute\r\nEndocarditis, mainly S. aureus[8]\r\nPapillary muscle rupture or dysfunction,[8] including mitral valve prolapse[9]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\nMarfan\'s syndrome[8]\r\nCardiomyopathy[8]\r\nUsually secondary to right ventricular dilation[8]\r\nleft ventricular failure is, in turn, the most common cause[8]\r\nRight ventricular infarction[8]\r\nInferior myocardial infarction[8]\r\nCor pulmonale[8]\r\nOther causes: Tricuspid endocarditis, rheumatic fever, Ebstein\'s anomaly, carcinoid syndrome and myxomatous degeneration[8]\r\nHemo\r\ndynamics\r\n/\r\nPatho-\r\nphysiology\tProgressive obstruction of the mitral ostium causes increased pressure in the left atrium and the pulmonary circulation.[9] Congestion may cause thromboembolism, and atrial hypertension may cause atrial fibrillation.[9]\tObstruction through the aortic ostium causes increased pressure in the left ventricle and impaired flow through the aorta\tInsufficiency of the aortic valve causes backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole.\tInsufficiency of the mitral valve causes backflow of blood into the left atrium during systole.\tInsufficiency of the tricuspid valve causes backflow of blood into the right atrium during systole.\r\nSymptoms\t\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nChest pain[8]\r\nHemoptysis[8]\r\nThromboembolism[8]\r\nAscites and edema (if right-sided heart failure develops)[8]\r\nSymptoms increase with exercise and pregnancy[8]\r\n\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion (most frequent symptom[9]), orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nSyncope, usually exertional[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nIn acute cases: cyanosis and circulatory shock[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nPulmonary edema[8]\r\nSymptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as ascites, hepatomegaly, edema and jugular venous distension[8]\r\nMedical signs\t\r\nOpening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic rumble with presystolic accentuation.[8][9]\r\nThe opening snap follows closer to the S2 heart tone with worsening stenosis.[8]\r\nThe murmur is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope[8] lying on the left side[9] and its duration increases with worsening disease.[8]\r\nLoud S1 -
