Notice how the back of the patient\'s left atrium and great vessels are left in place.\r\nICD-9-CM\t37.51\r\nMeSH\tD016027\r\nMedlinePlus\t003003\r\nA heart transplant, or a cardiac transplant, is a surgical transplant procedure performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease. As of 2008 the most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor (cadaveric allograft) and implant it into the patient. The patient\'s own heart is either removed (orthotopic procedure) or, less commonly, left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic procedure). Post-operation survival periods average 15 years.[1] Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease, but a life-saving treatment intended to improve the quality of life for recipients.[2]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n2 Contraindications\r\n3 Procedures\r\n3.1 Pre-operative\r\n3.2 Operative\r\n3.2.1 Orthotopic procedure\r\n3.2.2 Heterotopic procedure\r\n3.2.3 \'Living organ\' transplant\r\n3.2.4 Non-beating heart transplant\r\n3.3 Post-operative\r\n4 Complications\r\n5 Prognosis\r\n5.1 Notable recipients\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nNorman Shumway is widely regarded as the father of heart transplantation although the world\'s first adult human heart transplant was performed by a South African cardiac surgeon, Christiaan Barnard, utilizing the techniques developed and perfected by Shumway and Richard Lower.[3] Barnard performed the first transplant on Louis Washkansky on December 3, 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.[3][4] Adrian Kantrowitz performed the world\'s first pediatric heart transplant on December 6, 1967, at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, barely three days after Christiaan Barnard\'s pioneering procedure.[3] Norman Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on January 6, 1968, at the Stanford University Hospital.[3]\r\n\r\nWorldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are performed annually. The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000-2,300 annually). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 119 adult transplants in 2013 alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure.[5] The great disparity between the number of patients needing transplants and the number of procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non-human hearts into humans after 1993. Xenografts from other species and man-made artificial hearts are two less successful alternatives to allografts.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthotopic heart transplant. Recipient P-waves (arrows).\r\nContraindications[edit]\r\nSome patients are less suitable for a heart transplant, especially if they suffer from other circulatory conditions related to the heart. The following conditions in a patient increase the chances of complications:\r\n\r\nKidney, lung, or liver disease\r\nInsulin-dependent diabetes with other organ dysfunction\r\nLife-threatening diseases unrelated to heart failure\r\nVascular disease of the neck and leg arteries.\r\nHigh pulmonary vascular resistance\r\nRecent thromboembolism\r\nAge over 60 years (some variation between centers)\r\nSubstance abuse, notably tobacco smoking (which increases the chance of lung disease)\r\nProcedures[edit]\r\nPre-operative[edit]\r\nA typical heart transplantation begins when a suitable donor heart is identified. The heart comes from a recently deceased or brain dead donor, also called a beating heart cadaver. The patient is contacted by a nurse coordinator and instructed to come to the hospital for evaluation and pre-surgical medication. At the same time, the heart is removed from the donor and inspected by a team of surgeons to see if it is in suitable condition. Learning that a potential organ is unsuitable can induce distress in an already fragile patient, who usually requires emotional support before returning home.\r\n\r\nThe patient must also undergo emotional, psychological, and physical tests to verify mental health and ability to make good use of a new heart. The patient is also given immunosuppressant medication so that the patient\'s immune system does not reject the new heart.\r\n\r\nOperative[edit]\r\n\r\nSchematic of a transplanted heart with native lungs and the great vessels.\r\nOnce the donor heart passes inspection, the patient is taken into the operating room and given a general anaesthetic. Either an orthotopic or a heterotopic procedure follows, depending on the conditions of the patient and the donor heart.\r\n\r\nOrthotopic procedure[edit]\r\nThe orthotopic procedure begins with a median sternotomy, opening the chest and exposing the mediastinum. The pericardium is opened, the great vessels are dissected and the patient is attached to cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor\'s heart is injected with potassium chloride (KCl). Potassium chloride stops the heart beating before the heart is removed from the donor\'s body and packed in ice. Ice can usually keep the heart usable for four[6] to six hours depending on preservation and starting condition. The failing heart is removed by transecting the great vessels and a portion of the left atrium. The patient\'s pulmonary veins are not transected; rather a circular portion of the left atrium containing the pulmonary veins is left in place. The donor heart is trimmed to fit onto the patient\'s remaining left atrium and the great vessels are sutured in place. The new heart is restarted, the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and the chest cavity is closed.\r\n\r\nThe orthotopic procedure was developed by Shumway and Lower at Stanford-Lane Hospital in San Francisco in 1958.[3]\r\n\r\nHeterotopic procedure[edit]\r\nIn the heterotopic procedure, the patient\'s own heart is not removed. The new heart is positioned so that the chambers and blood vessels of both hearts can be connected to form what is effectively a \'double heart\'. The procedure can give the patient\'s original heart a chance to recover, and if the donor\'s heart fails (e.g., through rejection), it can later be removed, leaving the patient\'s original heart. Heterotopic procedures are used only in cases where the donor heart is not strong enough to function by itself (because either the patient\'s body is considerably larger than the donor\'s, the donor\'s heart is itself weak, or the patient suffers from pulmonary hypertension).\r\n\r\n\'Living organ\' transplant[edit]\r\nIn February 2006, at the Bad Oeynhausen Clinic for Thorax and Cardiovascular Surgery, Germany, surgeons successfully transplanted a \'beating heart\' into a patient.[7] Rather than cooling the heart, the living organ procedure keeps it at body temperature and connects it to a special machine called an Organ Care System that allows it to continue pumping warm, oxygenated blood. This technique can maintain the heart in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method.\r\n\r\nNon-beating heart transplant[edit]\r\nThe first successful non-beating heart transplant was achieved in Australia in 2014, performed by cardiothoracic surgeon Kumud Dhital. The transplant was made possible by the development of preservation technology able to preserve a heart, resuscitate it and to assess the function of the heart. The first patient to have this surgery was 57-year-old Michelle Gribilas.[8] Papworth Hospital in England (where the first non-beating heart transplant in Europe was carried out) stated that the technique could increase the number of hearts available for transplant by at least 25\%. [9]\r\n\r\nPost-operative[edit]\r\n\r\nTransplanted heart in the thorax of recipient\r\nThe patient is taken to the ICU to recover. When they wake up, they move to a special recovery unit for rehabilitation. The duration of in-hospital, post-transplant care depends on the patient\'s general health, how well the heart is working, and the patient\'s ability to look after the new heart. Doctors typically prefer that patients leave the hospital 1â€“2 weeks after surgery, because of the risk of infection and presuming no complications. After release, the patient returns for regular check-ups and rehabilitation. They may also require emotional support. The frequency of hospital visits decreases as the patient adjusts to the transplant. The patient remains on immunosuppressant medication to avoid the possibility of rejection. Since the vagus nerve is severed during the operation, the new heart beats at around 100 beats per minute unless nerve regrowth occurs.\r\n\r\nImmunosuppressive agents are continued in the intensive care unit.\r\n\r\nThe patient is regularly monitored to detect rejection. This surveillance can be performed via frequent biopsy or a gene expression blood test known as AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing. Typically, biopsy is performed immediately post-transplant and then AlloMap replaces it once the patient is stable. The transition from biopsy to AlloMap can occur as soon as 55 days after the transplant.\r\n\r\nComplications[edit]\r\nPost-operative complications include infection, sepsis, organ rejection, as well as the side-effects of the immunosuppressive medication. Since the transplanted heart originates from another organism, the recipient\'s immune system typically attempts to reject it. The risk of rejection never fully goes away, and the patient will be on immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of his or her life, but these may cause unwanted side effects, such as increased likelihood of infections, like fevers, unusual pains, or any new feelings. Recipients can get kidney disease from a heart transplant. Many recent advances in reducing complications due to tissue rejection stem from mouse heart transplant procedures.[10] Surgery death rate is 5-10\% in 2011.[11] Hong Kong death rate is 5\% for 16 patients from beginning to 2014.[12]\r\n\r\nPrognosis[edit]\r\nThe prognosis for heart transplant patients following the orthotopic procedure has increased over the past 20 years, and as of June 5, 2009, the survival rates were:[13]\r\n\r\n1 year: 88.0\% (males), 86.2\% (females)\r\n3 years: 79.3\% (males), 77.2\% (females)\r\n5 years: 73.2\% (males), 69.0\% (females)\r\nIn a study spanning 1999 to 2007, conducted on behalf of the U.S. federal government by Dr. Eric Weiss of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, it was discovered that, compared to men receiving male hearts, \"men receiving female hearts had a 15\% increase in the risk of adjusted cumulative mortality\" over five years. No significant differences were noted with females receiving hearts from male or female donors.[14]\r\n\r\nNotable recipients[edit]\r\nAt the time of his death on August 10, 2009, Tony Huesman was the world\'s longest living heart transplant recipient, having survived for 30 years, 11 months and 10 days, before dying of cancer.[15] Huesman received a heart in 1978 at the age of 20 after viral pneumonia severely weakened his heart.[16] The operation was performed at Stanford University under heart transplant pioneer Dr. Norman Shumway.[17]\r\n\r\nAs of December 2013, the record holder for longest living heart recipient is Englishman John McCafferty, 71. He received his heart on 20 October 1982.[15]\r\n\r\nKelly Perkins climbs mountains around the world to promote positive awareness of organ donation. Perkins was the first recipient to climb the peaks of Mt. Fuji, Mt. Kilimanjaro, the Matterhorn, Mt. Whitney, and Cajon de Arenales in Argentina in 2007, 12 years after her surgery.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nTwenty-two years after Dwight Kroening\'s heart transplant, he was the first recipient to finish an Ironman competition.[18]\r\n\r\nFiona Coote was the fourth Australian to receive a heart transplant in 1984 (at age 14) and the youngest Australian. In the 24 years after her transplant she became involved in publicity and charity work for the Red Cross, and promoted organ donation in Australia.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nRace car driver and manufacturer Carroll Shelby received a heart transplant in 1990.[19]\r\n\r\nGolfer Erik Compton qualified for the PGA Tour at age 32, after his second heart transplant.[20]\r\n\r\nFormer Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney received a heart transplant on March 24, 2012.[21]\r\n\r\nFormer chairman and founder of MCI Communications William G. McGowan received a heart transplant on April 25, 1987.[22] After a six-month recovery, McGowan returned to his duties as MCI chairman where he remained until his death on June 8, 1992 from another heart attack.[23]'
heartFail.txt,'The term \"heart failure\" makes it sound like the heart is no longer working at all and there\'s nothing that can be done. Actually, heart failure means that the heart isn\'t pumping as well as it should be.\r\n\r\nYour body depends on the heart\'s pumping action to deliver oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the body\'s cells. When the cells are nourished properly, the body can function normally.\r\n\r\nWith heart failure, the weakened heart can\'t supply the cells with enough blood. This results in fatigue and shortness of breath and some people have coughing. Everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs or carrying groceries can become very difficult.\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a serious condition, and usually there\'s no cure. But many people with heart failure lead a full, enjoyable life when the condition is managed with heart failure medications and healthy lifestyle changes. It\'s also helpful to have the support of family and friends who understand your condition.\r\n\r\nHow the normal heart works\r\n\r\nThe normal healthy heart is a strong, muscular pump a little larger than a fist. It pumps blood continuously through the circulatory system. Watch an animation of blood flow through the heart.\r\n\r\nThe heart has four chambers, two on the right and two on the left:\r\n\r\nTwo upper chambers called atria (one is an atrium)\r\nTwo lower chambers called ventricles\r\nThe right atria takes in oxygen-depleted blood from the rest of the body and sends it back out to the lungs through the right ventricle where the blood becomes oxygenated.\r\n\r\nOxygen-rich blood travels from the lungs to the left atrium, then on to the left ventricle, which pumps it to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nThe heart pumps blood to the lungs and to all the body\'s tissues by a sequence of highly organized contractions of the four chambers. For the heart to function properly, the four chambers must beat in an organized way.\r\n\r\nWhat is heart failure?\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood through to meet the body\'s needs for blood and oxygen. Basically, the heart can\'t keep up with its workload. \r\nWatch an animation of heart failure\r\n\r\nAt first the heart tries to make up for this by:\r\nEnlarging. When your heart chamber enlarges, it stretches more and can contract more strongly, so it pumps more blood. With an enlarged heart, your body starts to retain fluid, your lungs get congested with fluid and your heart begins to beat irregularly.\r\nDeveloping more muscle mass. The increase in muscle mass occurs because the contracting cells of the heart get bigger. This lets the heart pump more strongly, at least initially.\r\nPumping faster. This helps to increase the heart\'s output.\r\nThe body also tries to compensate in other ways:\r\n\r\nThe blood vessels narrow to keep blood pressure up, trying to make up for the heart\'s loss of power.\r\nThe body diverts blood away from less important tissues and organs (like the kidneys), the heart and brain.\r\nThese temporary measures mask the problem of heart failure, but they don\'t solve it. Heart failure continues and worsens until these substitute processes no longer work.\r\n\r\nEventually the heart and body just can\'t keep up, and the person experiences the fatigue, breathing problems or other symptoms that usually prompt a trip to the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe body\'s compensation mechanisms help explain why some people may not become aware of their condition until years after their heart begins its decline. (It\'s also a good reason to have a regular checkup with your doctor.)\r\n\r\nHeart failure can involve the heart\'s left side, right side or both sides. Ho'
heartFail1.txt,'Essential update: FDA approves I(f) \"funny\" current inhibitor for patients with worsening heart failure\r\nIn April 2015, the FDA approved ivabradine (Corlanor) to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35\% or lower, who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 70 bpm or higher, and who are either on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use.[1, 2] This drug blocks the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel responsible for the cardiac pacemaker I(f) \"funny\" current, which regulates heart rate without any effect on ventricular repolarization or myocardial contractility.\r\n\r\nApproval for ivabradine was based on the international, placebo-controlled SHIFT trial published in 2010, which randomized more than 6500 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV heart failure and an LVEF of 35\% or lower.[1, 2] The trial saw a highly significant 18\% drop in risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure over an average of 23 months in patients treated with ivabradine.\r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms\r\nSigns and symptoms of heart failure include the following:\r\n\r\nExertional dyspnea and/or dyspnea at rest\r\nOrthopnea\r\nAcute pulmonary edema\r\nChest pain/pressure and palpitations\r\nTachycardia\r\nFatigue and weakness\r\nNocturia and oliguria\r\nAnorexia, weight loss, nausea\r\nExophthalmos and/or visible pulsation of eyes\r\nDistention of neck veins\r\nWeak, rapid, and thready pulse\r\nRales, wheezing\r\nS 3 gallop and/or pulsus alternans\r\nIncreased intensity of P 2 heart sound\r\nHepatojugular reflux\r\nAscites, hepatomegaly, and/or anasarca\r\nCentral or peripheral cyanosis, pallor\r\nSee Clinical Presentation for more detail.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\nHeart failure criteria, classification, and staging\r\n\r\nThe Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure consists of the concurrent presence of either 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria.[3]\r\n\r\nMajor criteria include the following:\r\n\r\nParoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea\r\nWeight loss of 4.5 kg in 5 days in response to treatment\r\nNeck vein distention\r\nRales\r\nAcute pulmonary edema\r\nHepatojugular reflux\r\nS 3 gallop\r\nCentral venous pressure greater than 16 cm water\r\nCirculation time of 25 seconds\r\nRadiographic cardiomegaly\r\nPulmonary edema, visceral congestion, or cardiomegaly at autopsy\r\nMinor criteria are as follows:\r\n\r\nNocturnal cough\r\nDyspnea on ordinary exertion\r\nA decrease in vital capacity by one third the maximal value recorded\r\nPleural effusion\r\nTachycardia (rate of 120 bpm)\r\nBilateral ankle edema\r\nThe New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system categorizes heart failure on a scale of I to IV,[4] as follows:\r\n\r\nClass I: No limitation of physical activity\r\nClass II: Slight limitation of physical activity\r\nClass III: Marked limitation of physical activity\r\nClass IV: Symptoms occur even at rest; discomfort with any physical activity\r\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) staging system is defined by the following 4 stages[5, 6] :\r\n\r\nStage A: High risk of heart failure but no structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage B: Structural heart disease but no symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage C: Structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage D: Refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nThe following tests may be useful in the initial evaluation for suspected heart failure[5, 7, 8] :\r\n\r\nComplete blood count (CBC)\r\nUrinalysis\r\nElectrolyte levels\r\nRenal and liver function studies\r\nFasting blood glucose levels\r\nLipid profile\r\nThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels\r\nB-type natriuretic peptide levels\r\nN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide\r\nElectrocardiography\r\nChest radiography\r\n2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography\r\nNuclear imaging [9]\r\nMaximal exercise testing\r\nPulse oximetry or arterial blood gas\r\nSee Workup for more detail.\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nTreatment includes the following:\r\n\r\nNonpharmacologic therapy: Oxygen and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, dietary sodium and fluid restriction, physical activity as appropriate, and attention to weight gain\r\nPharmacotherapy: Diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic agents, anticoagulants, beta blockers, and digoxin\r\nSurgical options\r\n\r\nSurgical treatment options include the following:\r\n\r\nElectrophysiologic intervention\r\nRevascularization procedures\r\nValve replacement/repair\r\nVentricular restoration\r\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation\r\nVentricular assist devices\r\nHeart transplantation\r\nTotal artificial heart\r\nSee Treatment and Medication for more detail.'
heartFail2.txt,'There are lots of reasons why you might be diagnosed with heart failure. It can be sudden or it can happen slowly over months or even years.\r\n\r\nThe most common causes are:\r\n\r\nheart attack\r\nhigh blood pressure\r\ncardiomyopathy (diseases of the heart muscle. Sometimes these are inherited from your family and sometimes they are caused by other things, such as viral infections).\r\nHeart failure can also be caused by:\r\n\r\nheart valve problems\r\nalcohol or recreational drugs\r\nan uncontrolled irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\r\ncongenital heart conditions (ones you’re born with)\r\na viral infection affecting the heart muscle\r\nsome cancer treatments.\r\nHeart health and cancer treatment cover imageIf you are having treatment for cancer and have a heart condition, or have been told that your treatment may affect your heart, you might find Heart health and cancer treatment helpful. It\'s a new booklet jointly produced by Macmillan Cancer Support and the British Heart Foundation and you can order free copies online from Macmillan Cancer Support.\r\n\r\nPulmonary hypertension\r\nHeart failure can also be caused by pulmonary hypertension (raised blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply your lungs). This condition can damage the right side of your heart, leading to heart failure. In some cases the pulmonary hypertension itself is caused by an existing heart condition.\r\n\r\nFind out more about pulmonary hypertension on NHS Choices.\r\n\r\nWhat are the symptoms of heart failure?\r\nThe main symptoms are:\r\n\r\nshortness of breath - when you are being active or at rest\r\nswelling - of your feet, ankles, stomach and lower back areas\r\nfatigue - feeling unusually tired or weak\r\nSymptoms occur because the heart does not have enough strength to pump blood all the way round the body efficiently. This can cause fluid to pool in the feet and legs.  If this fluid is left unmanaged, it can build and spread to your stomach area and sit beneath your lungs. This reduces their ability to expand and makes you short of breath.\r\n\r\nMedication and making changes to the way you live can make a real difference to these symptoms. People with heart failure experience different symptoms and everyone copes in different ways, so speak to your GP and your heart failure nurse about what is best for you.\r\n\r\nFor more information about understanding and managing the symptoms of heart failure, take a look at our advice and information on living with heart failure.\r\n\r\nHow is heart failure diagnosed?\r\nTo diagnose heart failure, your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history, talk about your symptom and do a physical examination. In most cases you will also have further tests to confirm the diagnosis and guide how your symptoms are controlled. These include blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a chest x-ray, an echocardiogram and a coronary angiogram.\r\n\r\nYou may hear your doctor talk about the ‘ejection fraction’ of your heart. This refers to the amount of blood that is pushed out of your left ventricle every time your heart beats. It’s usually expressed as a percentage. A normal ejection fraction is around 50-65 per cent, as there is always some blood left in the heart after each heartbeat. Some people with heart failure have a normal ejection fraction, so ejection fraction is used alongside other tests to help diagnose heart failure.\r\n\r\nAfter a diagnosis, your doctor may discuss your \'stage\' or \'class\' of heart failure. There are four classes, which are based on your symptoms and how they affect you. The higher the number of the class you are in, the more serious your heart failure has become.  It is also possible to move between stages as you may have episodes where your heart failure is worse because of other events, such as a further heart attack.\r\n\r\nWhat treatments are available for heart failure?\r\nWhile there isn\'t a cure for heart failure at the moment, the treatments available to control symptoms are helping many people live full and active lives.\r\n\r\nYour doctor is likely to prescribe drugs that will help control your blood pressure and help the pumping action of your heart.\r\n\r\nThey will also give you advice about making changes to your lifestyle such as cutting down on salt, which will help control your blood pressure, and stopping smoking.\r\n\r\nA combination of medication and lifestyle changes will hopefully help you continue to do the things you enjoy, by helping you manage your symptoms and keeping your condition as stable as possible.\r\n\r\nSome people with heart failure will benefit from a pacemaker or ICD.

heartTrans1.txt,'A heart transplant is surgery to remove a damaged or diseased heart and replace it with a healthy donor heart.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nFinding a donor heart can be difficult. The heart must be donated by someone who is brain-dead but is still on life support. The donor heart must be matched as closely as possible to your tissue type to reduce the chance that your body will reject it.\r\n\r\nYou are put into a deep sleep with general anesthesia, and a cut is made through the breastbone.\r\n\r\nYour blood flows through a heart-lung bypass machine while the surgeon works on your heart. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped, and supplies your body with blood and oxygen.\r\nYour diseased heart is removed and the donor heart is stitched in place. The heart-lung machine is then disconnected. Blood flows through the transplanted heart.\r\nTubes are inserted to drain air, fluid, and blood out of the chest for several days, and to allow the lungs to fully re-expand.\r\nIn some cases, the surgeon will not remove the old heart, but will put the new heart on top of it (heterotopic transplant).\r\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\r\nA heart transplant may be done to treat:\r\n\r\nSevere angina that can no longer be treated with medications or other surgeries\r\nSevere heart failure, when medicines, other treatments, and surgery no longer help\r\nSevere heart defects that were present at birth and cannot be fixed with surgery\r\nLife-threatening abnormal heartbeats or rhythms that do not respond to other treatments\r\nHeart transplant surgery may not be used in patients who:\r\n\r\nAre malnourished\r\nAre older than age 55 to 60\r\nHave had a severe stroke or dementia\r\nHave had cancer\r\nHave HIV infection\r\nHave infections, such as hepatitis, that are active\r\nHave insulin-dependent diabetes and other organs that aren\'t working correctly\r\nHave kidney, lung, nerve, or liver disease\r\nHave no family support and do not follow their treatment\r\nHave other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the neck and leg\r\nHave pulmonary hypertension (thickening of blood vessels in the lung)\r\nSmoke or abuse alcohol or drugs, or have other lifestyle habits that may damage the new heart\r\nThe doctor may not recommend a heart transplant if the patient may not be able to keep up with the many hospital and doctor\'s office visits, tests, and medications needed to keep the new heart healthy.\r\n\r\nRisks\r\nRisks from any anesthesia are:\r\n\r\nReactions to medications\r\nProblems breathing\r\nRisks from any surgery are:\r\n\r\nBleeding\r\nInfection\r\nRisks of transplant include:\r\n\r\nBlood clots (deep venous thrombosis)\r\nDamage to the kidneys, liver, or other organs from anti-rejection medications\r\nDevelopment of cancer from the drugs used to prevent rejection\r\nHeart attack or stroke\r\nHeart rhythm problems\r\nHigh cholesterol levels, diabetes, and bone thinning from the use of rejection medications\r\nIncreased risk for infections due to anti-rejection medications\r\nRejection of the heart\r\nSevere coronary artery disease\r\nWound infections\r\nBefore the Procedure\r\nOnce the doctor refers you to a transplant center, you will be evaluated by the transplant team. They will want to make sure that you are a good candidate for a transplant. You will visit many times over several weeks or even months. You will need to have blood drawn and x-rays taken. The following may also be done:\r\n\r\nBlood or skin tests to check for infections\r\nTests of your kidney and liver\r\nTests to evaluate your heart, such as EKG, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization\r\nTests to look for cancer\r\nTissue and blood typing, to help make sure your body will not reject the donated heart\r\nYou will want to look at one or more transplant centers to see which would be best for you:\r\n\r\nAsk them how many transplants they perform every year and what their survival rates are. Compare these numbers with the numbers from other centers.\r\nAsk what support groups they have available and how much help they offer with travel and housing.\r\nAsk about the costs of medications you will need to take afterwards.\r\nIf the transplant team believes you are a good candidate, you will be put on a national waiting list for a heart:\r\n\r\nYour place on the list is based on several factors. Key factors include the type and severity of your heart disease, and the likelihood that a transplant will be successful.\r\nThe amount of time you spend on a waiting list is usually NOT a factor for how soon you get a heart, except in the case of children.\r\nMost, but not all, patients who are waiting for heart transplants are very ill and need to be in the hospital. Many will need some sort of device to help their heart pump enough blood to the body. Most often this is a ventricular assist device (artificial heart-like device).\r\n\r\nAfter the Procedure\r\nYou should expect to stay in the hospital for 7 to 21 days after a heart transplant. The first 24 to 48 hours will likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). During the first few days after a transplant, you will need close follow-up to make sure that you do not get an infection and your heart is working well.\r\n\r\nThe recovery period is about 6 months. Often, your transplant team will ask you to stay fairly close to the hospital for the first 3 months. You will need to have regular check-ups with blood tests, x-rays, and echocardiograms for many years.\r\n\r\nFighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body\'s immune system considers the transplanted organ an infection and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take drugs that suppress the body\'s immune response. Taking medicines and following your doctor\'s instructions carefully is very important to preventing rejection.\r\n\r\nBiopsies of the heart muscle are often done every month during the first 6 to 12 months after transplant, and then less often after that. This helps the doctor determine if your body is rejecting the new heart, even before you have symptoms.\r\n\r\nYou must take drugs that prevent transplant rejection for the rest of your life. You will need to understand how to take these medications, and know their side effects.\r\n\r\nYou can go back to your normal activities as soon as you feel well enough, and after talking with your doctor. However, avoid vigorous physical activity.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that you do not develop coronary disease after a transplant, you may have cardiac catheterization every year.\r\n\r\nOutlook (Prognosis)\r\nHeart transplant prolongs the life of patients who would otherwise die. About 80\% of heart transplant patients are alive 2 years after the operation. At 5 years, 70\% of people will still be alive after a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nThe main problem, as with other transplants, is rejection. If rejection can be controlled, survival increases to over 10 years.\r\n\r\nAlternative Names\r\nCardiac transplant; Transplant - heart; Transplantation - heart\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nBernstein D.

It means your heart needs some support to do its job, usually in the form of medicines.\r\nBreathlessness, feeling very tired and ankle swelling are the main symptoms of heart failure. But all of these symptoms can have other causes, only some of which are serious.\r\nThe symptoms of heart failure can develop quickly (acute heart failure). If this happens, you will need to be treated in hospital. But they can also develop gradually (chronic heart failure).\r\nRead more about the symptoms of heart failure.\r\nTypes of heart failure\r\nThere are three main types of heart failure. They are:\r\nheart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) â€“ this is because the part of the heart that pumps blood around your body (the left ventricle) becomes weak \r\nheart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) â€“ usually a result of the left ventricle become stiff, causing difficulty filling with blood\r\nheart failure caused by diseased or damaged heart valves\r\nIt is important the type of heart failure you have is identified as it will affect the type of treatment you will be offered. A number of tests can be used to help diagnose heart failure.\r\nYou should also have blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. These are used to investigate your heart and check how well it is functioning. If you have not had these tests, you should ask your doctor for an explanation.\r\nRead more about how heart failure is diagnosed.\r\nWhat causes heart failure?\r\nHeart failure does not often have a single cause. A number of problems usually \"gang up\" on the heart, causing it to fail.\r\nThere are a number of health conditions that increase your chances of developing heart failure, including:\r\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension) â€“ this can put extra strain on the heart, which over time can lead to heart failure\r\ncoronary heart disease (CHD) â€“ where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged up by fatty substances (atherosclerosis), and may cause angina or a heart attack\r\nheart muscle weakness (cardiomyopathy) â€“ this can cause heart failure; the reasons for this are often unclear, but it may be genetic in origin, or caused by an infection (usually viral), alcohol misuse, or medication used to treat cancer\r\nheart rhythm disturbance (atrial fibrillation)\r\nheart valve disease, damage or problems with the heart\'s valves\r\nSometimes anaemia, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also lead to heart failure.\r\nRead more about the causes of heart failure.\r\nTreating heart failure\r\nIn most cases, heart failure is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured. Treatment therefore aims to find a combination of measures, including lifestyle changes, medicines, devices or surgery that will improve heart function or help the body get rid of excess water.\r\nA cure may be possible in cases where heart failure has a specific cause. For example, if your heart valves are damaged, it may be possible to replace them, which can cure the condition.\r\nAs treatment will usually be lifelong, you and your doctor will need to find a balance of effective treatments that you can manage in the long term so you have the best symptom control and quality of life possible.\r\nEffective treatment for heart failure can have the following benefits:\r\nit helps make the heart stronger\r\nit improves your symptoms\r\nit reduces the risk of a flare-up\r\nit allows people with the condition to live longer and fuller lives\r\nRead more about how heart failure is treated.\r\nPreventing heart failure\r\nMany of the factors that increase your risk of developing heart failure can be managed either by making lifestyle changes or by taking medicines.\r\nFor example, in terms of lifestyle factors, you should:\r\nstop smoking (if you smoke)\r\nkeep your blood pressure at a healthy level\r\nkeep your cholesterol level under control\r\nmaintain a healthy weight (neither too fat nor too thin)\r\neat healthily, including avoiding excess salt in your diet (but severe salt restriction is rarely necessary and is not good for most people); most people should also ensure they have enough iron in their diet (eating red meat or iron supplements can help this)\r\nexercise regularly\r\nlimit your alcohol consumption\r\nRead more about preventing heart failure.\r\nLiving with heart failure\r\nBeing diagnosed with heart failure may come as a shock. While the outlook is related to age, the severity of the heart condition, and any other health problems that may exist, such as lung or kidney disease, anaemia and diabetes, it also depends on what you do to reduce your risk.\r\nSelf care means taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing, with support from the people who are involved in your care.\r\nIt is very important that you take any prescribed medication, even after you feel better. Some medicines are designed to protect or heal your heart.\r\nIf you do not take them, they cannot help and the underlying problem will get worse. The medicines can prevent or delay your heart problem and stop symptoms getting worse.\r\nSpeak to your healthcare team if you have any questions or concerns about the medication you are taking or any potential side effects.\r\nAs heart failure is a long-term condition, you will have regular contact with your healthcare team. Developing a good relationship with the members of your team will enable you to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you have. The more the team knows about you, the more they can help you.\r\nRead more about living with heart failure.\r\n\r\nAn echocardiogram is one of the main methods used to diagnose heart failure \r\nHow common is heart failure?\r\nHeart failure affects about 900,000 people in the UK.\r\nThe condition can affect people of all ages, but it is more common in older people â€“ more than half of all people with heart failure are over the age of 75.\r\nHeart failure is associated with a number of other serious health conditions, including coronary heart disease, heart attack and high blood pressure (hypertension).\r\n\r\nFlu and the flu vaccine\r\nYour guide to flu symptoms and the flu vaccine, including who should be vaccinated this winter\r\n\r\nLife with heart disease\r\nTips on living with a long-term condition, including healthcare, medicines and support\r\nPage last reviewed: 02/09/2014\r\nNext review due: 02/09/2016\r\nShare:Email shareTwitter shareFacebook shareSave:Google BookmarksNHS Choices Saved PagesPrint:\r\nRatings\r\nHow helpful is this page?\r\nAverage rating\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\nBased on 337 ratings View all ratings\r\nAdd your rating\r\n\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\nPlease leave your rating\r\nLeave your comment Log in or Register\r\nShare your views and experiences with others.\r\nIf you want a response from an NHS professional or the website team, please contact us.\r\nComments (2) â–º\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful links\r\n\r\nNHS Choices links\r\n\r\nAtherosclerosis\r\nAtrial fibrillation\r\nAngina\r\nCoronary heart disease\r\nHeart attack\r\nHigh blood pressure\r\nStroke\r\nExternal links\r\n\r\nBritish Heart Foundation: heart health\r\nhealthtalk.org: heart failure\r\nHEART UK\r\nheartfailurematters.org\r\nThe Somerville Foundation\r\n\r\nHeart rhythm problems\r\nAn arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat that can seriously affect quality of life and even cause death.

heart_failure_8.txt,'ï»¿Valvular heart disease is any disease process involving one or more of the four valves of the heart (the aortic and mitral valves on the left and the pulmonary and tricuspid valves on the right). These conditions occur largely as a result of aging. Most people are in their late 50s when diagnosed, and more than one in ten people over 75 have it.\r\n\r\nEarly detection may improve outcomes from surgery.\r\n\r\nCollectively and anatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue makeup of the heart known as the cardiac skeleton. Valve problems may be congenital (inborn) or acquired (due to another cause later in life). Treatment may be with medication but often (depending on the severity) involves valve repair or replacement (insertion of an artificial heart valve). Specific situations include those where additional demands are made on the circulation, such as in pregnancy.[1]\r\n\r\nPhonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png\r\nValve involved\tStenotic disease\tInsufficiency/regurgitation disease\r\nAortic valve\tAortic valve stenosis\tAortic insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nMitral valve\tMitral valve stenosis\tMitral insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nTricuspid valve\tTricuspid valve stenosis\tTricuspid insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nPulmonary valve\tPulmonary valve stenosis\tPulmonary insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nAortic and mitral valve disorders[edit]\r\nThese are termed left heart diseases.\r\n\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders[edit]\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve diseases are right heart diseases. Pulmonary valve diseases are the least common heart valve disease in adults.[2]\r\n\r\nThe most common types of pulmonary valve diseases are:\r\n\r\npulmonary valve stenosis\r\npulmonary valve insufficiency\r\npulmonary valve incompetence\r\npulmonary valve regurgitation\r\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases classifies non rheumatic pulmonary valve diseases as I37.\r\n\r\nBoth tricuspid and pulmonary valve diseases are less common than aortic or mitral valve diseases due to the lower pressure those valves experience.[2]\r\n\r\nDysplasia[edit]\r\nHeart valve dysplasia is an error in the development of any of the heart valves, and a common cause of congenital heart defects in humans as well as animals; tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect with four abnormalities, one of which is stenosis of the pulmonary valve. Ebstein\'s anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve.[1]\r\n\r\nRheumatic disorders[edit]\r\nValvular heart disease resulting from rheumatic fever is referred to as \"rheumatic heart disease\". While developed countries once had a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, medical advances and improved social conditions have dramatically reduced their incidence. Many developing countries, as well as indigenous populations within developed countries, still carry a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and there has been a resurgence in efforts to eradicate the diseases in these populations. Inflammation of the heart valves due to any cause is called endocarditis; this is usually due to bacterial infection but may also be due to cancer (marantic endocarditis), certain autoimmune conditions (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (Loeffler endocarditis). Certain medications have been associated with valvular heart disease, most prominently ergotamine derivatives pergolide and cabergoline.[3]\r\n\r\nIn pregnancy[edit]\r\nThe evaluation of individuals with valvular heart disease who are or wish to become pregnant is a difficult issue. Issues that have to be addressed include the risks during pregnancy to the mother and the developing fetus by the presence of maternal valvular heart disease as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy. Normal physiological changes during pregnancy require, on average, a 50\% increase in circulating blood volume that is accompanied by an increase in cardiac output that usually peaks between the midportion of the second and third trimesters.[4] The increased cardiac output is due to an increase in the stroke volume, and a small increase in heart rate, averaging 10 to 20 beats per minute.[4] Additionally uterine circulation and endogenous hormones cause systemic vascular resistance to decrease and a disproportionately lowering of diastolic blood pressure causes a wide pulse pressure.[4] Inferior vena caval obstruction from a gravid uterus in the supine position can result in an abrupt decrease in cardiac preload, which leads to hypotension with weakness and lightheadedness.[4] During labor and delivery cardiac output increases more in part due to the associated anxiety and pain, as well as due to uterine contractions which will cause an increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[4]\r\n\r\nValvular heart lesions associated with high maternal and fetal risk during pregnancy include:[4]\r\n\r\nSevere aortic stenosis with or without symptoms\r\nAortic regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nMitral stenosis with NYHA functional class II-IV symptoms\r\nMitral regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease resulting in severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary pressure greater than 75\% of systemic pressures)\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease with severe LV dysfunction (EF less than 0.40)\r\nMechanical prosthetic valve requiring anticoagulation\r\nMarfan syndrome with or without aortic regurgitation\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nIn individuals who require an artificial heart valve, consideration must be made for deterioration of the valve over time (for bioprosthetic valves) versus the risks of blood clotting in pregnancy with mechanical valves with the resultant need of drugs in pregnancy in the form of anticoagulation.\r\n\r\nComparison[edit]\r\nThe following table includes the main types of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Major types of valvular heart disease not included in the table include mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis.\r\n\r\nValvular disease\tMitral stenosis\tAortic stenosis\tAortic regurgitation\tMitral regurgitation\tTricuspid regurgitation\r\nPrevalence\tMost common valvular heart disease in pregnancy[5]\tApproximately 2\% of people over the age of 65, 3\% of people over age 75, and 4\% percent of people over age 85[6]\t\t2\% of the population, equally in males and females.[7]\t\r\nMain causes and risk factors\tAlmost always caused by rheumatic heart disease[8]\t\r\nCalcification of tricuspid aortic valve with age[8]\r\n(>50\%[9])\r\nCalcification of bicuspid aortic valve[8]\r\n(30-40\%[9])\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\n(<10\%[9])\r\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia and uremia may speed up the process.[9]\r\n\r\nAcute\r\nInfective endocarditis[8][9]\r\nTrauma[8]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nPrimary valvular: rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan\'s syndrome, Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus[8]\r\nDisease of the aortic root: syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, BehÃ§et\'s disease, reactive arthritis, systemic hypertension[8]\r\nAcute\r\nEndocarditis, mainly S. aureus[8]\r\nPapillary muscle rupture or dysfunction,[8] including mitral valve prolapse[9]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\nMarfan\'s syndrome[8]\r\nCardiomyopathy[8]\r\nUsually secondary to right ventricular dilation[8]\r\nleft ventricular failure is, in turn, the most common cause[8]\r\nRight ventricular infarction[8]\r\nInferior myocardial infarction[8]\r\nCor pulmonale[8]\r\nOther causes: Tricuspid endocarditis, rheumatic fever, Ebstein\'s anomaly, carcinoid syndrome and myxomatous degeneration[8]\r\nHemo\r\ndynamics\r\n/\r\nPatho-\r\nphysiology\tProgressive obstruction of the mitral ostium causes increased pressure in the left atrium and the pulmonary circulation.[9] Congestion may cause thromboembolism, and atrial hypertension may cause atrial fibrillation.[9]\tObstruction through the aortic ostium causes increased pressure in the left ventricle and impaired flow through the aorta\tInsufficiency of the aortic valve causes backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole.\tInsufficiency of the mitral valve causes backflow of blood into the left atrium during systole.\tInsufficiency of the tricuspid valve causes backflow of blood into the right atrium during systole.\r\nSymptoms\t\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nChest pain[8]\r\nHemoptysis[8]\r\nThromboembolism[8]\r\nAscites and edema (if right-sided heart failure develops)[8]\r\nSymptoms increase with exercise and pregnancy[8]\r\n\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion (most frequent symptom[9]), orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nSyncope, usually exertional[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nIn acute cases: cyanosis and circulatory shock[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nPulmonary edema[8]\r\nSymptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as ascites, hepatomegaly, edema and jugular venous distension[8]\r\nMedical signs\t\r\nOpening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic rumble with presystolic accentuation.[8][9]\r\nThe opening snap follows closer to the S2 heart tone with worsening stenosis.[8]\r\nThe murmur is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope[8] lying on the left side[9] and its duration increases with worsening disease.[8]\r\nLoud S1 -
