Beer on the Rails: The Simple Pleasure of Train Travel What's Brewing
BEER ON THE RAILS: THE SIMPLE PLEASURE OF TRAIN TRAVEL
May 4, 2015 - Heather Vandenengel
Beer is going places. Literally—you can now find respectable selections of beer on airplanes, ferry boats and cruise lines. Delta now offers seven new lagers and ales on board its domestic flights, cruise ships are serving custom beers, and the Denver International Airport hosted a pop-up airport beer garden last year, complete with beer flights....

 48 Hours in Duluth: A Superior Outpost in Minnesota Beer Weekend
48 HOURS IN DULUTH: A SUPERIOR OUTPOST IN MINNESOTA
April 29, 2015 - Melissa Maki
To the uninitiated, Duluth, MN, may seem like an unlikely beer destination. Mayor Don Ness boldly snagged the title “Craft Beer Capital of Minnesota”  for Duluth in 2013. Many would argue that a bigger city with more breweries, like Minneapolis, should get the honor. But Duluth has some brilliant brewers, a burgeoning beer scene and...

A Global Look at Leading and Emerging Brewing Countries
April 16, 2015 - Stephen Beaumont & Tim Webb
The beer being sampled would by almost any definition be deemed unusual. That it was brewed from a mix of grains that included four different types of wheat—malted, unmalted, flaked and smoked—comprising over half the grain bill, and boasted an impressive 12% alcohol by volume, was alone an element of distinction. That its ingredients also...

THE BEST IN BEER EXPERIENCES
April 8, 2015 - Chris Rice
More than 43,000 new and re-released beers were produced and imported professionally last year in the United States. OK, I made that up, but think it’s within range of the actual number. With more than 3,200 breweries operating across the country and more than double that number interested in exporting here (and with each releasing...

April 8, 2015 - Chris Rice
Twenty-two years ago, I tasted the Karl Strauss amber lager for the first time while sitting at the brewery. It was the first American example of the great German style I had ever tried, and it was where a good friend and I wondered: Can we do this in North Carolina? We launched Carolina Brewery...

 Honest Pricing Behind the Bar
HONEST PRICING
April 2, 2015 - John Holl
Last month, I took my first trip to Nebraska and visited breweries and bars, and met with local folks who are intensely proud of their heritage and the future of their beer culture. I spent a few days and nights at the Nebraska Brewing Co., where founders Kim and Paul Kavulak proudly showed off their...

DRINKING AT THE CROSSROADS OF AMERICA
48 Hours in Indianapolis
April 2, 2015 - Karen Asp
Forget pork tenderloins, the Indy 500, Bobby Knight and everything else Indiana is known for. The Hoosier State is staking a new claim as a beer powerhouse, and nowhere is that more apparent than in Indianapolis. Although the state boasts almost 90 breweries, roughly 25 of them reside either downtown or on the outskirts of...

 Searching for the Perfect Pint in Dublin and Belfast  Beer Travelers
SEARCHING FOR THE PERFECT PINT IN DUBLIN AND BELFAST 
March 17, 2015 - Brian Yaeger
The Irish not only gave us dry stout porter, they also gave us classic drinking songs to sing whilst hoisting proper imperial pints (buy the MP3 of the Clancy Brothers’ “Beer, Beer, Beer”) and the full Irish breakfast (with “black pudding,” aka blood sausage, among the four breakfast meats on the plate) to sop up all...
