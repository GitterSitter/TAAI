Epub 2008 Sep23.Experience of appendicular thermal therapy applied to a patient with a leftventricular assist device awaiting heart transplantation.Higashi H(1), Komamura K, Oda N, Kato TS, Yanase M, Mano A, Hashimoto S, Wada K, Shishido T, Hashimura K, Kitakaze M, Kitamura S, Nakatani T.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, National Cardiovascular Center, 5-7-1 Fujishirodai,Suita-shi, Osaka 565-8565, Japan.Thermal therapy for heart failure is recognized to improve clinical symptoms. We describe our experience with appendicular thermal therapy applied to a patientfitted with an extracorporeal left ventricular assist device (LVAD) who waswait-listed for a heart transplant. A 21-year-old male with end-stage heartfailure due to dilated cardiomyopathy was fitted with a LVAD. His generalcondition stabilized after LVAD placement and the status of his heart failure hasremained at NYHA class II for the past 13 months. However, his cardiac functiondid not sufficiently recover to discontinue LVAD support. We conductedappendicular thermal therapy using a steam foot bath and heated gloves for 2weeks. Immediately after thermal therapy, his average sublingual temperatureincreased from 36.3 to 37.0 degrees C and the grade of mitral regurgitation, aswell as LV ejection fraction and endothelial function improved. Furthermore,levels of oxidative and anti-oxidative stress markers decreased and increased,respectively, after 2 weeks of therapy. No complications developed. We concludethat appendicular thermal therapy was safe in this patient waiting for a hearttransplant and who had an extracorporeal LVAD, and that the procedure might bebeneficial for others with end-stage heart failure.: 19324130  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1110. j cardiol. 2009 apr;53(2):301-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jjcc.2008.07.020. epub 2008 sep23.experience of appendicular thermal therapy applied to a patient with a leftventricular assist device awaiting heart transplantation.higashi h(1), komamura k, oda n, kato ts, yanase m, mano a, hashimoto s, wada k, shishido t, hashimura k, kitakaze m, kitamura s, nakatani t.author information: (1)division of cardiology, national cardiovascular center, 5-7-1 fujishirodai,suita-shi, osaka 565-8565, japan.thermal therapy for heart failure is recognized to improve clinical symptoms. we describe our experience with appendicular thermal therapy applied to a patientfitted with an extracorporeal left ventricular assist device (lvad) who waswait-listed for a heart transplant. a 21-year-old male with end-stage heartfailure due to dilated cardiomyopathy was fitted with a lvad. his generalcondition stabilized after lvad placement and the status of his heart failure hasremained at nyha class ii for the past 13 months. however, his cardiac functiondid not sufficiently recover to discontinue lvad support. we conductedappendicular thermal therapy using a steam foot bath and heated gloves for 2weeks. immediately after thermal therapy, his average sublingual temperatureincreased from 36.3 to 37.0 degrees c and the grade of mitral regurgitation, aswell as lv ejection fraction and endothelial function improved. furthermore,levels of oxidative and anti-oxidative stress markers decreased and increased,respectively, after 2 weeks of therapy. no complications developed. we concludethat appendicular thermal therapy was safe in this patient waiting for a hearttransplant and who had an extracorporeal lvad, and that the procedure might bebeneficial for others with end-stage heart failure.
