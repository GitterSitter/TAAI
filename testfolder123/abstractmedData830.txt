The effectiveness of hearttransplantation and medical therapy is limited, resulting in the emergence ofmechanical circulatory support as a primary treatment for end-stage heartdisease. Left ventricular assist devices that use rotary pumps are small anddurable, which might reduce morbidity and mortality during support.METHODS: Fifty heart transplant candidates with New York Heart Associationfunctional class IV symptoms were supported at 5 international centers by theHeartWare System for 180 days, until heart transplant, myocardial recovery anddevice explant, or death. Patients who continue to be supported have beenfollowed for a minimum of 2 years.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 20 (40%) received transplants, 4 (8%) had the pumpexplanted after myocardial recovery, and 17 (34%) continue support at 2 years.Nine (18%) patients died during support from sepsis (n = 3), multiple organfailure (n = 3), or hemorrhagic stroke (n = 3). The actual survival at 6, 12, and24 months was 90%, 84%, and 79%, respectively. In the survivors, measures ofquality of life showed a significant improvement over baseline values.Significant improvements were found for recognition memory at 3 months afterimplant (p = 0.006). The most frequent adverse events were infection andbleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with end-stage heart failure can be safely and effectively supported by the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System with improved quality oflife and neurocognitive function.Copyright Â© 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
