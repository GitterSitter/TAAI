Thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricularassist device (VAD) therapy. The program, supported and funded by the nationalhealthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical Center forthe operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.Regional VAD coordinators are educated by the National Center. They are in chargeof regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription, and continuing patients' and caregivers' education, mainly regarding drivelineexit site dressing and driveline stabilization. From November 2011 to November2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support(LVAD): HeartMate II, n=70, HeartWare, n=25. Mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37% of the patients were males. Most patients had INTERMACS profile 4 (55%), followedby 3 and 2 (17% each). Symptomatic and functional improvement are testified bychanges from baseline to month 3 of NYHA functional class (from III-IV to I-II), results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and NT-proBNP levels (from6997 to 1126 pg/ml). Overall 1-year survival was 69%, with a trend for outcomeimprovement over time and a relationship with preoperative INTERMACS profile(1-year survival of 60% in patients with INTERMACS profile 1-2 vs 75% in thosewith INTERMACS profile 3-4). In summary, where and when a heart transplantprogram cannot be implemented, LVAD represents a realistic therapeuticalternative. The key points for a successful VAD program are a dedicated, highly specialized multidisciplinary team at the Cardiac Surgery Center, aninfrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.: 24798865  [pubmed - indexed for medline]194. g ital cardiol (rome). 2014 mar;15(3):144-8. doi: 10.1714/1463.16161.[surgical heart failure treatment program - the experience of kazakhstan].[article in italian]bekbossynov s, medressova a, murzagaliyev m, salov r, dzhetybayeva s, andossovas, bekbossynova m, pya y.in kazakhstan, geographical and cultural reasons do not favor the development of heart transplant activity. thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricularassist device (vad) therapy. the program, supported and funded by the nationalhealthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical center forthe operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.regional vad coordinators are educated by the national center. they are in chargeof regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription, and continuing patients' and caregivers' education, mainly regarding drivelineexit site dressing and driveline stabilization. from november 2011 to november2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support(lvad): heartmate ii, n=70, heartware, n=25. mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37% of the patients were males. most patients had intermacs profile 4 (55%), followedby 3 and 2 (17% each). symptomatic and functional improvement are testified bychanges from baseline to month 3 of nyha functional class (from iii-iv to i-ii), results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and nt-probnp levels (from6997 to 1126 pg/ml). overall 1-year survival was 69%, with a trend for outcomeimprovement over time and a relationship with preoperative intermacs profile(1-year survival of 60% in patients with intermacs profile 1-2 vs 75% in thosewith intermacs profile 3-4). in summary, where and when a heart transplantprogram cannot be implemented, lvad represents a realistic therapeuticalternative. the key points for a successful vad program are a dedicated, highly specialized multidisciplinary team at the cardiac surgery center, aninfrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.
