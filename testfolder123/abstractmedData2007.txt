Implantable LVAD Study Group.McCarthy PM(1), James KB, Savage RM, Vargo R, Kendall K, Harasaki H, Hobbs RE,Pashkow FJ.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cleveland ClinicFoundation, Ohio 44195.BACKGROUND: The implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was designed toprovide circulatory support as an alternative to heart transplantation or tocontinued medical therapy of end-stage heart failure. Initial experience with theimplantable LVAD used as a bridge to heart transplantation provides a clinicalopportunity to study the function of the device and adaptation by the patient.METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen heart transplant candidates (mean age, 50 years; 17males) underwent insertion of the HeartMate LVAD as a bridge to hearttransplantation from December 1991 to November 1993. All patients were incardiogenic shock on inotropes, and 16 (84%) were on an intra-aortic balloonpump. Three patients died because of multiple organ failure; all had rightventricular (RV) dysfunction (2 required RV assist devices). Sixteen patients(84%) improved markedly and were rehabilitated to New York Heart Associationfunctional class I-II. Three patients are still on support. Significantimprovements in hemodynamic function (based on analysis of the percent changefrom pre-LVAD condition to pretransplantation) were observed: cardiac index rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.9 L/min per m2 (P = .0002), left atrial pressurefell from 22.9 +/- 9.5 to 8.0 +/- 5.5 mm Hg (P = .003), RV ejection fractionincreased from 19.8 +/- 11.3% to 40.8 +/- 8.9% (P = .0004), pulmonary vascularresistance decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 Wood units (P = .004).Thirteen patients had successful transplants after a mean duration of 66 days on the LVAD (range, 22 to 101 days). There were no thromboembolic events while thepatients were on the LVAD. Only aspirin with dipyridamole was given foranticoagulation during a total of > 1100 patient days of support.CONCLUSIONS: Bridge to transplant implantable LVAD experience indicates thathemodynamic improvement should be significant after insertion of the devices and that the risk of thromboembolic events with the HeartMate LVAD should beextremely low. Rehabilitation and quality of life should be markedly improved.Limitations of extrapolating this clinical experience to the permanentimplantable LVAD include that these patients were hospitalized (permanentimplants will be outpatients); the "vented-electric" HeartMate LVAD was nottested (it is a portable, battery-powered device), and true "chronic" LVADsupport (> 1 year) was not tested, so questions regarding long-term devicereliability and the chronic risk of infection are unknown.: 7955291  [pubmed - indexed for medline]2008. circulation. 1994 nov;90(5 pt 2):ii83-6.implantable left ventricular assist device. approaching an alternative forend-stage heart failure. implantable lvad study group.mccarthy pm(1), james kb, savage rm, vargo r, kendall k, harasaki h, hobbs re,pashkow fj.author information: (1)department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, cleveland clinicfoundation, ohio 44195.background: the implantable left ventricular assist device (lvad) was designed toprovide circulatory support as an alternative to heart transplantation or tocontinued medical therapy of end-stage heart failure. initial experience with theimplantable lvad used as a bridge to heart transplantation provides a clinicalopportunity to study the function of the device and adaptation by the patient.methods and results: nineteen heart transplant candidates (mean age, 50 years; 17males) underwent insertion of the heartmate lvad as a bridge to hearttransplantation from december 1991 to november 1993. all patients were incardiogenic shock on inotropes, and 16 (84%) were on an intra-aortic balloonpump. three patients died because of multiple organ failure; all had rightventricular (rv) dysfunction (2 required rv assist devices). sixteen patients(84%) improved markedly and were rehabilitated to new york heart associationfunctional class i-ii. three patients are still on support. significantimprovements in hemodynamic function (based on analysis of the percent changefrom pre-lvad condition to pretransplantation) were observed: cardiac index rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.9 l/min per m2 (p = .0002), left atrial pressurefell from 22.9 +/- 9.5 to 8.0 +/- 5.5 mm hg (p = .003), rv ejection fractionincreased from 19.8 +/- 11.3% to 40.8 +/- 8.9% (p = .0004), pulmonary vascularresistance decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 wood units (p = .004).thirteen patients had successful transplants after a mean duration of 66 days on the lvad (range, 22 to 101 days). there were no thromboembolic events while thepatients were on the lvad. only aspirin with dipyridamole was given foranticoagulation during a total of > 1100 patient days of support.conclusions: bridge to transplant implantable lvad experience indicates thathemodynamic improvement should be significant after insertion of the devices and that the risk of thromboembolic events with the heartmate lvad should beextremely low. rehabilitation and quality of life should be markedly improved.limitations of extrapolating this clinical experience to the permanentimplantable lvad include that these patients were hospitalized (permanentimplants will be outpatients); the "vented-electric" heartmate lvad was nottested (it is a portable, battery-powered device), and true "chronic" lvadsupport (> 1 year) was not tested, so questions regarding long-term devicereliability and the chronic risk of infection are unknown.
