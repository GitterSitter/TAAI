Increasing mortality onwaiting list has urged implementation of mechanical circulatory support as anadjunct to the programme of heart transplantation. The objective of the study is to review 7-years experience with paracorporeal assist device in bridging totransplantation.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 53 transplant candidates treatedsince April 2003. 50 patients received paracorporeal assist devices inbiventricular configuration. Most frequent diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathyin 51%.RESULTS: Despite a high risk profile of the patients, 37 of them weresuccessfully transplanted (69.8%). Cumulative support has reached 3513 days.Local exit sites infection was identified as a most frequent complication, sepsisas a most frequent cause of death on support (18.8%). 30-days post-transplantmortality remained low at 5.7%.CONCLUSIONS: Paracorporeal mechanical circulatory assist devices remain effectivealternative for terminal stage heart transplant candidates, especially for those in multiorgan failure who require biventricular support. Success rate of bridgingto transplantation is acceptable, as well as complications rate and quality oflife while on support. Long-term post-transplant survival is not inferior to the results of procedures performed without necessity of previous implantation of theassist device.: 21411147  [pubmed - indexed for medline]833. cas lek cesk. 2011;150(1):44-8.[benefit of paracorporeal pulsatile assist device in multiorgan failing patients in terminal stage of heart failure].[article in czech]netuka i(1), mal„Ω j, r„≠ha h, szarszoi o, dorazilov„° z, skalsky i, turek d, urban m, kettner j, pirk j.author information: (1)institut klinick„© a experiment„°ln„≠ medic„≠ny praha, klinika kardiovaskul„°rn„≠chirurgie. ivan.netuka@ikem.czbackground: prevalence of terminal forms of heart failure is steadily increasing and thus waiting time for heart transplantation, too. increasing mortality onwaiting list has urged implementation of mechanical circulatory support as anadjunct to the programme of heart transplantation. the objective of the study is to review 7-years experience with paracorporeal assist device in bridging totransplantation.material and methods: retrospective review of 53 transplant candidates treatedsince april 2003. 50 patients received paracorporeal assist devices inbiventricular configuration. most frequent diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathyin 51%.results: despite a high risk profile of the patients, 37 of them weresuccessfully transplanted (69.8%). cumulative support has reached 3513 days.local exit sites infection was identified as a most frequent complication, sepsisas a most frequent cause of death on support (18.8%). 30-days post-transplantmortality remained low at 5.7%.conclusions: paracorporeal mechanical circulatory assist devices remain effectivealternative for terminal stage heart transplant candidates, especially for those in multiorgan failure who require biventricular support. success rate of bridgingto transplantation is acceptable, as well as complications rate and quality oflife while on support. long-term post-transplant survival is not inferior to the results of procedures performed without necessity of previous implantation of theassist device.
