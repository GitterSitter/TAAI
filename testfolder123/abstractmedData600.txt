The aim of this studywas to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA)and BSI after implantation of LVAD for advanced heart failure (HF). This was aretrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage HF, who underwent implantation of HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD over a 4 year period. Bloodstream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspectedneurological complications including CVAs were confirmed by neuroimaging.Extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristicswere analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The mean age of our studypopulation was 62.3 Â± 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males (n = 75, 86.2%). The baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients withand without CVAs. Patients with BSI had a much greater incidence of CVA compared to patients without BSI (n = 13, 43.3% vs. n = 5, 10.0%; p < 0.0001). There wasan increased mortality in patients with BSI than those without (n = 57, 65.5% vs.n = 30, 34.5%; p = 0.003). The risk of all CVAs (hemorrhagic/ischemic) waseightfold (odds ratio [OR] = 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4-25.5; p =0.001] in patients with BSI. Patients with BSI had a >20-fold risk of hemorrhagicCVA (OR = 24; 95% CI = 2.8-201.1; p = 0.03). Advanced HF patients with LVADsupport who developed BSI need urgent evaluation and close monitoring forsuspected neurological complications, particularly hemorrhagic CVA.: 22830581  [pubmed - in process]601. asaio j. 2012 sep-oct;58(5):509-13. doi: 10.1097/mat.0b013e318260c6a6.are blood stream infections associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagicstroke in patients with a left ventricular assist device?aggarwal a(1), gupta a, kumar s, baumblatt ja, pauwaa s, gallagher c, treitman a,pappas p, tatooles a, bhat g.author information: (1)center for heart transplant and assist devices, advocate christ medicalcenter, oak lawn, illinois 60453, usa.blood stream infections (bsis) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular assist devices (lvads). the aim of this studywas to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (cva)and bsi after implantation of lvad for advanced heart failure (hf). this was aretrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage hf, who underwent implantation of heartmate ii continuous-flow lvad over a 4 year period. bloodstream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspectedneurological complications including cvas were confirmed by neuroimaging.extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristicswere analyzed using spss statistical software. the mean age of our studypopulation was 62.3 â± 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males (n = 75, 86.2%). the baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients withand without cvas. patients with bsi had a much greater incidence of cva compared to patients without bsi (n = 13, 43.3% vs. n = 5, 10.0%; p < 0.0001). there wasan increased mortality in patients with bsi than those without (n = 57, 65.5% vs.n = 30, 34.5%; p = 0.003). the risk of all cvas (hemorrhagic/ischemic) waseightfold (odds ratio [or] = 7.9; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.4-25.5; p =0.001] in patients with bsi. patients with bsi had a >20-fold risk of hemorrhagiccva (or = 24; 95% ci = 2.8-201.1; p = 0.03). advanced hf patients with lvadsupport who developed bsi need urgent evaluation and close monitoring forsuspected neurological complications, particularly hemorrhagic cva.
