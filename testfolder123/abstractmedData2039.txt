Ann Thorac Surg. 1993 Jun;55(6):1425-30; discussion 1430-1.A reliable bridge to cardiac transplantation: the TCI left ventricular assistdevice.Burton NA(1), Lefrak EA, Macmanus Q, Hill A, Marino JA, Speir AM, Akl BF, AlbusRA, Massimiano PS.Author information: (1)Heart and Lung Transplantation Service, Virginia Heart Center, FairfaxHospital, Falls Church.The Thermo Cardiosystems (TCI) HeartMate, a pneumatically driven, implantableleft ventricular assist device, was designed for long-term support of the failingheart. Between February 1990 and August 1992, the HeartMate was implanted in 11heart transplant candidates because of profound deterioration of left ventricularfunction. Patients had a mean cardiac index of 1.6 L.min-1 x m-2 and a meanpulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 33 mm Hg despite maximal pharmacologicsupport with at least three inotropic medications. In addition, 5 patients werebeing supported with an intraaortic balloon pump. Nine patients were bridgedsuccessfully to cardiac transplantation. The mean cardiac index afterimplantation of the left ventricular assist device was 3.2 L.min-1 x m-2. Supportranged from 2 to 143 days (mean duration, 60 days). One patient died early of lowoutput secondary to right heart failure, and a second died of air embolism, whichoccurred intraoperatively. All surviving patients became fully ambulatory. There were no thromboembolic complications during a total of 658 patient-days ofsupport on a regimen of only 80 mg of aspirin daily. The 9 bridged patients arecurrently alive 4 to 34 months after transplantation. The TCI HeartMate provides safe and effective hemodynamic support with low risk of complications and virtualfreedom from thromboembolism on a regimen of minimal anticoagulation.: 8268522  [pubmed - indexed for medline]2040. ann thorac surg. 1993 jun;55(6):1425-30; discussion 1430-1.a reliable bridge to cardiac transplantation: the tci left ventricular assistdevice.burton na(1), lefrak ea, macmanus q, hill a, marino ja, speir am, akl bf, albusra, massimiano ps.author information: (1)heart and lung transplantation service, virginia heart center, fairfaxhospital, falls church.the thermo cardiosystems (tci) heartmate, a pneumatically driven, implantableleft ventricular assist device, was designed for long-term support of the failingheart. between february 1990 and august 1992, the heartmate was implanted in 11heart transplant candidates because of profound deterioration of left ventricularfunction. patients had a mean cardiac index of 1.6 l.min-1 x m-2 and a meanpulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 33 mm hg despite maximal pharmacologicsupport with at least three inotropic medications. in addition, 5 patients werebeing supported with an intraaortic balloon pump. nine patients were bridgedsuccessfully to cardiac transplantation. the mean cardiac index afterimplantation of the left ventricular assist device was 3.2 l.min-1 x m-2. supportranged from 2 to 143 days (mean duration, 60 days). one patient died early of lowoutput secondary to right heart failure, and a second died of air embolism, whichoccurred intraoperatively. all surviving patients became fully ambulatory. there were no thromboembolic complications during a total of 658 patient-days ofsupport on a regimen of only 80 mg of aspirin daily. the 9 bridged patients arecurrently alive 4 to 34 months after transplantation. the tci heartmate provides safe and effective hemodynamic support with low risk of complications and virtualfreedom from thromboembolism on a regimen of minimal anticoagulation.
