Gastrointestinal (GI)bleeding has been frequently reported within this population.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart MateII from January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence,etiology, and management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regressionanalysis was conducted to identify related risk factors.RESULTS: A significant incidence of GI bleeding (22.8%) occurred in ourpredominantly destination therapy (DT) (93%) population. Fifty-seven percent ofthe patients with bleeding episodes bled from the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37% from ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI) tract. Previous history of GI bleeding(odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95% CI, 2.2-228.6; p=0.008), elevated internationalnormalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9; p=0.02), and low platelet count(OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were independent predictors of GIhemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in older patients (mean, 70 years;p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60%) rebled from the same site. Managementstrategies included temporarily withholding anticoagulation, decreasing the speedof LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide did not impact the amount of packedred blood cells used, rebleeding rates, length of hospital stay, or all-causemortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct consequence of GI bleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors account for GI bleeding in patients on CF-VADs. Aprevious history of bleeding increases risk significantly and warrants carefulmonitoring.Copyright Â© 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
