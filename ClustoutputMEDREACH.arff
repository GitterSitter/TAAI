It is also not clear how intravenous inotropic therapyand mechanical cardiac assist devices (MCAD) affect cognitive function.METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional cognitive preliminary study evaluated252 potential heart transplant candidates assessing functions in memory, motor,and processing speed. Patients were divided into three HF groups based onseverity of disease: group 1 outpatients (n = 113), group 2 in-patients requiringinotropic infusion (n = 83), and group 3 inpatients likely requiring MCAD support(n = 56). Aggregate z-scores for memory, motor, and processing speed andindependent samples t tests assessed intergroup differences on 13 cognitivemeasures.RESULTS: A broad pattern of cognitive impairment was observed within the advancedHF group; fewer deficits were found in group 1 outpatients and more severedeficits in group 3 MCAD subjects.

VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of ourpediatric patients while supported with a VAD.DESIGN: In this prospective study, pediatric patients who underwent VADplacement, and their parents, were administered a generic Pediatric Quality ofLife Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD implant, when feasible, after the acutepostoperative period, and then periodically until heart transplant or death.Their final scores while on support were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls, outpatients with severe heart disease, and childrenafter heart transplant.RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VADsupport greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was 10.0 Â± 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months. Eleven(85\\\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\\\%) patient remaining alive onsupport. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was 1.4(0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total andphysical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups. Self-reportedpsychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy controls only.Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all three comparisongroups for all three categories (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: A large deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patientssupported by a VAD compared with outpatient management of severe heart disease orpostheart transplant patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group withmore severe heart failure.

Thedisease is highly prevalent in the elderly population and often follows a course of progressive disability and deterioration. An estimated 15 000 patients withend-stage heart failure could benefit from heart transplant each year. Yet, as a result of a significant shortage of donor organs, only 2500 hearts are donatedannually, and approximately one-third of patients awaiting heart transplant dieeach year. Mechanical circulatory support, primarily in the form of leftventricular assist devices (LVADs), has come to the forefront of treatment forsevere congestive heart failure by providing a feasible alternative to patientswho might otherwise die awaiting heart transplant. The arrival of LVADs hasresulted in a dramatic shift in the management of heart failure, one that willundoubtedly affect and include a vast proportion of elderly patients. While LVADsrepresent a surgical approach to a disease that has traditionally been managedmedically, the pharmacological application throughout the perioperative periodremains of critical importance. Five primary classes of drugs bear specificapplication to the LVAD population: (i) drugs that provide haemodynamic support; (ii) antimicrobials; (iii) anticoagulants and antiplatelets; (iv) agents thatpromote myocardial recovery; and (v) miscellaneous other medications. Drugs that provide haemodynamic support are subdivided into inotropes, vasopressors andpulmonary vasodilators. Some combination of these medications is usuallyadministered within the perioperative period in order to maintain stable patient haemodynamics and assure proper LVAD function. Antimicrobials are of paramountimportance in the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods to minimise the risk of infection, an unfortunately common complication of LVAD therapy that can havepotentially morbid consequences. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications are necessary for certain types of LVADs and serve to curb the incidence of devicethrombus formation and associated embolic phenomena. Pharmacotherapeutic agentsthat facilitate myocardial recovery are being investigated as adjuncts to LVADsupport so that bridge to recovery can become a realistic outcome for a growingnumber of LVAD patients.

However, expansion of this technology is still limited bycomplications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential toidentify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditionalcardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base tosupport these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did notidentify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potentialpredictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely arelatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasivetechniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow.

De Gasperis, Niguarda Hospital, Milan,Italy. evitali@ospedaleniguarda.itBACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of death in Westerncountries. Heart transplantation currently is the only accepted therapy forpatients with end-stage heart failure, but the supply of donor hearts isinadequate, and different mechanical circulatory support systems have beeninvestigated as bridges to heart transplant.METHODS: Since April 1992, 53 patients (47 men, 6 women, aged 12 to 61 years)received left ventricle mechanical circulatory support as bridge to hearttransplant. The two principal devices used were: the Novacor LVAS in 31 patients and the DeBakey VAD in 11 patients.RESULTS: All patients survived the operation. Mean duration of LVAD support was2.8 +/- 5.6 months. Thirty-seven patients (71.1\\\%) underwent hearttransplantation. Twelve major bleeding episodes occurred in nine patients(16.9\\\%). Globally, major and minor neurologic events occurred in 13 patients(24.5\\\%). Ten patients (19.9\\\%) assisted with the Novacor Wearable LVAS device weredischarged at home while waiting for heart transplant (HTx). The mean follow-upof the 34 discharged transplanted patients was 45.3 +/- 37 months. Actuarialsurvival of transplanted patients while on LVAD was 91.0 +/- 4.9\\\% and 83.4 +/-8.5\\\% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. No differences in post-transplant long-term survival and rejection and allograft vasculopathy occurred between patientstransplanted with or without LVAD implanted.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD therapy proved to be effective in bridging patients withend-stage heart failure to HTx. While on LVAD support, patients assisted withimplantable wearable devices could be discharged at home, ameliorating theirquality of life.

Isolated observations suggest that chronic ventricular unloadingmay lead to normalization of pulmonary pressures and thus render a patient likelyto be a heart transplant candidate.METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of 9 heart failure patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (transpulmonary gradient [TPG] > 15 mm/Hg). Two were treated with a pulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 7 with anaxial-flow LVAD.RESULTS: After LVAD support, mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 39 +/-7 to 31 +/- 5 mm Hg, and the TPG decreased from 19 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg (p <0.01). The 1-year Kaplan-Meier survival curve for patients with pre-LVAD TPG > 15mm Hg vs those with TPG < 15 mm Hg showed no difference in survival (p = 0.6).This finding was supported by analysis of a large multi-institutional cohortobtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database, whereno differences in survival were found in the same groups.CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to congestive heartfailure, as defined by a TPG > 15 mm Hg can be reversed by the use of pulsatileand axial-flow LVADs; furthermore, post-transplant survival for patients withsecondary pulmonary hypertension treated with an LVAD was no different than forthose without pulmonary hypertension who received LVAD support.: 19783184  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1043. j heart lung transplant. 2010 feb;29(2):195-200. doi:10.1016/j.healun.2009.05.030. epub 2009 sep 26.reversal of secondary pulmonary hypertension by axial and pulsatile mechanicalcirculatory support.torre-amione g(1), southard re, loebe mm, youker ka, bruckner b, estep jd,tierney m, noon gp.author information: (1)the department of cardiology, the methodist debakey heart & vascular center,the methodist hospital, houston, texas, usa. gtorres@tmhs.org <gtorres@tmhs.org>background: pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic congestive heartfailure posses a significant risk of morbidity and death after hearttransplantation. isolated observations suggest that chronic ventricular unloadingmay lead to normalization of pulmonary pressures and thus render a patient likelyto be a heart transplant candidate.methods: this study is a retrospective analysis of 9 heart failure patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (transpulmonary gradient [tpg] > 15 mm/hg). two were treated with a pulsatile left ventricular assist device (lvad) and 7 with anaxial-flow lvad.results: after lvad support, mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 39 +/-7 to 31 +/- 5 mm hg, and the tpg decreased from 19 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 4 mm hg (p <0.01). the 1-year kaplan-meier survival curve for patients with pre-lvad tpg > 15mm hg vs those with tpg < 15 mm hg showed no difference in survival (p = 0.6).this finding was supported by analysis of a large multi-institutional cohortobtained from the organ procurement and transplantation network database, whereno differences in survival were found in the same groups.conclusions: pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to congestive heartfailure, as defined by a tpg > 15 mm hg can be reversed by the use of pulsatileand axial-flow lvads; furthermore, post-transplant survival for patients withsecondary pulmonary hypertension treated with an lvad was no different than forthose without pulmonary hypertension who received lvad support.'

However, with dramatic improvements in organ preservation, surgery andimmunosuppressive drug management, short term survival is no longer the pivotalissue for most heart transplant recipients (HTR). Rather, a return to functional lifestyle with good quality of life is now the desired procedural outcome. Toachieve this outcome, aggressive exercise rehabilitation is essential. HTRpresent unique exercise challenges. Preoperatively, most of these patients hadchronic debilitating cardiac illness. Many HTR have had prolongedpretransplantation hospitalisation for inotropic support or a ventricular assist device. Decrements in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and relatedcardiovascular parameters regress approximately 26\\\% within the first 1 to 3 weeksof sustained bed rest. Consequently, extremely poor aerobic capacity and cardiac cachexia are not unusual occurrences in HTR who have required mechanical support or been confined to bed rest. Moreover, HTR must also contend with de novoexercise challenges conferred by chronic cardiac denervation and the multiplesequelae resulting from immunosuppression therapy. There is ample evidence thatboth endurance and resistance training are well tolerated in HTR. Moreover, thereis growing clinical consensus that specific endurance and resistance trainingregimens in HTR can be efficacious adjunctive therapies in the prevention ofimmunosuppression-induced adverse effects and the reversal of pathophysiological consequences associated with cardiac denervation and antecedent heart failure.For example, some HTR who remain compliant during strenuous long term endurancetraining programmes achieve peak heart rate and VO2peak values late aftertransplantation that approach age-matched norms (up to approximately 95\\\% ofpredicted). These benefits are not seen in HTR who do not participate instructured endurance exercise training. Rather, peak heart rate and VO2peakvalues in untrained HTR remain approximately 60 to 70\\\% of predicted indefinitely.However, the mechanisms responsible for improved peak heart rate, VO2peak andtotal exercise time are not completely understood and require furtherinvestigation. Recent studies have also demonstrated that resistance exercisetraining may be an effective countermeasure for corticosteroid-inducedosteoporosis and skeletal muscle myopathy. HTR who participate in specificresistance training programmes successfully restore bone mineral density (BMD) inboth the axial and appendicular skeleton to pretransplantation levels, increaselean mass to levels greater than pretransplantation, and reduce body fat. Incontrast, HTR who do not participate in resistance training lose approximately15\\\% BMD from the lumbar spine early in the postoperative period and experiencefurther gradual reductions in BMD and muscle mass late after transplantation.: 11008069  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1796. sports med. 2000 sep;30(3):171-92.exercise following heart transplantation.braith rw(1), edwards dg.author information: (1)college of health and human performance, and college of medicine (division of cardiology), university of florida, gainesville 32611, usa. rbraith@hhp.ufl.eduduring the past 2 decades, heart transplantation has evolved from an experimentalprocedure to an accepted life-extending therapy for patients with endstage heart failure. however, with dramatic improvements in organ preservation, surgery andimmunosuppressive drug management, short term survival is no longer the pivotalissue for most heart transplant recipients (htr). rather, a return to functional lifestyle with good quality of life is now the desired procedural outcome. toachieve this outcome, aggressive exercise rehabilitation is essential. htrpresent unique exercise challenges. preoperatively, most of these patients hadchronic debilitating cardiac illness. many htr have had prolongedpretransplantation hospitalisation for inotropic support or a ventricular assist device. decrements in peak oxygen consumption (vo2peak) and relatedcardiovascular parameters regress approximately 26\\\% within the first 1 to 3 weeksof sustained bed rest. consequently, extremely poor aerobic capacity and cardiac cachexia are not unusual occurrences in htr who have required mechanical support or been confined to bed rest. moreover, htr must also contend with de novoexercise challenges conferred by chronic cardiac denervation and the multiplesequelae resulting from immunosuppression therapy. there is ample evidence thatboth endurance and resistance training are well tolerated in htr. moreover, thereis growing clinical consensus that specific endurance and resistance trainingregimens in htr can be efficacious adjunctive therapies in the prevention ofimmunosuppression-induced adverse effects and the reversal of pathophysiological consequences associated with cardiac denervation and antecedent heart failure.for example, some htr who remain compliant during strenuous long term endurancetraining programmes achieve peak heart rate and vo2peak values late aftertransplantation that approach age-matched norms (up to approximately 95\\\% ofpredicted). these benefits are not seen in htr who do not participate instructured endurance exercise training. rather, peak heart rate and vo2peakvalues in untrained htr remain approximately 60 to 70\\\% of predicted indefinitely.however, the mechanisms responsible for improved peak heart rate, vo2peak andtotal exercise time are not completely understood and require furtherinvestigation. recent studies have also demonstrated that resistance exercisetraining may be an effective countermeasure for corticosteroid-inducedosteoporosis and skeletal muscle myopathy. htr who participate in specificresistance training programmes successfully restore bone mineral density (bmd) inboth the axial and appendicular skeleton to pretransplantation levels, increaselean mass to levels greater than pretransplantation, and reduce body fat. incontrast, htr who do not participate in resistance training lose approximately15\\\% bmd from the lumbar spine early in the postoperative period and experiencefurther gradual reductions in bmd and muscle mass late after transplantation.'

In this retrospectiveanalysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated withintermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy.METHODS AND RESULTS: 117 consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at ourintensive care heart failure unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients(12Â \\\%) were stabilized and delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103patients (age 42Â Â±Â 15Â years), different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone,adrenaline, noradrenaline, levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\\sspecific characteristics. After initial recompensation, patients were weaned frominotropes as soon as possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4Â days)were given as a predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57Â \\\% of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropicsupport was necessary due to hemodynamic instabilities.

Both the mandatory New York statecardiac surgery database and a voluntary ventricular assist device registry have reported hospital discharge rates of only 25\\\% in postcardiotomy patientssupported with ventricular assist devices. Although many centers have access toshort-term mechanical cardiac assist devices, most lack a dedicated team whichcan resuscitate these critically ill patients. Equally important, these centersdo not have easy access to effective cardiac replacement options, includingimplantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and heart transplantation.METHODS: A referral network based upon the use of implantable LVADs as a bridgeto transplantation in patients with postcardiotomy heart failure was established in the New York City region. Cardiac surgery centers were encouraged to contactour center early following any failed cardiotomy.RESULTS: Forty-four patients entered our postcardiotomy network: 12 recoveredwithout an implantable LVAD, 23 received implantable LVADs, and six expiredwithout long-term LVAD support. Of the 44 referrals, 29 (66\\\%) survived tohospital discharge. Of the 23 patients receiving implantable LVADs, two recoveredmyocardial function and underwent LVAD explant, 14 were bridged to hearttransplant, one underwent an emergent heart transplant, and six expired. Of the23 implantable LVAD patients, 17 (74\\\%) survived to hospital discharge.CONCLUSIONS: Regional networks centered around bridge-to-transplant facilitiesthat have an aggressive approach to implantable LVAD placement may substantially improve the survival rate of patients with postcardiotomy heart failure.: 10567305  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1834. ann thorac surg. 1999 oct;68(4):1187-94.left ventricular assist device bridge-to-transplant network improves survivalafter failed cardiotomy.helman dn(1), morales dl, edwards nm, mancini dm, chen jm, rose ea, oz mc.author information: (1)division of cardiothoracic surgery, columbia-presbyterian medical center, new york, new york 10032, usa.background: postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock has been reported to occur following2\\\% to 6\\\% of cardiac surgical procedures. both the mandatory new york statecardiac surgery database and a voluntary ventricular assist device registry have reported hospital discharge rates of only 25\\\% in postcardiotomy patientssupported with ventricular assist devices. although many centers have access toshort-term mechanical cardiac assist devices, most lack a dedicated team whichcan resuscitate these critically ill patients. equally important, these centersdo not have easy access to effective cardiac replacement options, includingimplantable left ventricular assist devices (lvads) and heart transplantation.methods: a referral network based upon the use of implantable lvads as a bridgeto transplantation in patients with postcardiotomy heart failure was established in the new york city region. cardiac surgery centers were encouraged to contactour center early following any failed cardiotomy.results: forty-four patients entered our postcardiotomy network: 12 recoveredwithout an implantable lvad, 23 received implantable lvads, and six expiredwithout long-term lvad support. of the 44 referrals, 29 (66\\\%) survived tohospital discharge. of the 23 patients receiving implantable lvads, two recoveredmyocardial function and underwent lvad explant, 14 were bridged to hearttransplant, one underwent an emergent heart transplant, and six expired. of the23 implantable lvad patients, 17 (74\\\%) survived to hospital discharge.conclusions: regional networks centered around bridge-to-transplant facilitiesthat have an aggressive approach to implantable lvad placement may substantially improve the survival rate of patients with postcardiotomy heart failure.'

Despite significant advancements in drug therapy,mortality of the disease remains excessively high, as heart transplant remainsthe gold standard treatment for end-stage HF when no contraindications subsist.Traditionally, implanted Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) have been employed in order to provide circulatory support to patients who cannot survive the waitingtime to transplantation, reducing the workload imposed on the heart. In manycases that process could recover its contractility performance.OBJECTIVES: The SensorART platform focuses on the management and remote treatmentof patients suffering from HF. It provides an interoperable, extendable andVAD-independent solution, which incorporates various hardware and softwarecomponents in a holistic approach, in order to improve the quality of thepatients\\ treatment and the workflow of the specialists. This paper focuses onthe description and analysis of Specialist\\s Decision Support System (SDSS), aninnovative component of the SensorART platform.METHODS: The SDSS is a Web-based tool that assists specialists on designing thetherapy plan for their patients before and after VAD implantation, analyzingpatients\\ data, extracting new knowledge, and making informative decisions.RESULTS: SDSS offers support to medical and VAD experts through the differentphases of VAD therapy, incorporating several tools covering all related fields;Statistics, Association Rules, Monitoring, Treatment, Weaning, Speed and Suction Detection.CONCLUSIONS: SDSS and its modules have been tested in a number of patients andthe results are encouraging.: 24574450  [pubmed - in process]241. methods inf med. 2014;53(2):121-36. doi: 10.3414/me13-01-0047. epub 2014 feb 27.a decision support system for the treatment of patients with ventricular assistdevice support.karvounis ec, tsipouras mg, tzallas at, katertsidis ns, stefanou k, goletsis y,frigerio m, verde a, caruso r, meyns b, terrovitis j, trivella mg, fotiadisdi(1).author information: (1)dimitrios i. fotiadis, unit of medical technology and intelligent information systems, dept. of material science and engineering, university of ioannina, pobox 1186, 451 10 ioannina, greece, e-mail: fotiadis@cc.uoi.gr.background: heart failure (hf) is affecting millions of people every year and it is characterized by impaired ventricular performance, exercise intolerance andshortened life expectancy. despite significant advancements in drug therapy,mortality of the disease remains excessively high, as heart transplant remainsthe gold standard treatment for end-stage hf when no contraindications subsist.traditionally, implanted ventricular assist devices (vads) have been employed in order to provide circulatory support to patients who cannot survive the waitingtime to transplantation, reducing the workload imposed on the heart. in manycases that process could recover its contractility performance.objectives: the sensorart platform focuses on the management and remote treatmentof patients suffering from hf. it provides an interoperable, extendable andvad-independent solution, which incorporates various hardware and softwarecomponents in a holistic approach, in order to improve the quality of thepatients\\ treatment and the workflow of the specialists. this paper focuses onthe description and analysis of specialist\\s decision support system (sdss), aninnovative component of the sensorart platform.methods: the sdss is a web-based tool that assists specialists on designing thetherapy plan for their patients before and after vad implantation, analyzingpatients\\ data, extracting new knowledge, and making informative decisions.results: sdss offers support to medical and vad experts through the differentphases of vad therapy, incorporating several tools covering all related fields;statistics, association rules, monitoring, treatment, weaning, speed and suction detection.conclusions: sdss and its modules have been tested in a number of patients andthe results are encouraging.'

(3)NationalHeart Lung Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.BACKGROUND: A previous cost-effectiveness analysis showed that bridge totransplant (BTT) with early design left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) foradvanced heart failure was more expensive than medical management while appearingless beneficial. Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and thirdgeneration LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimatecomparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flowLVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS.METHODS AND RESULTS: A semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHScosts data and patient data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database(BTDB). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY werecalculated for patients receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotropesupported medical management. LVADs cost Â£80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices anddelivered greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilisticincremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was Â£53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95\\\%CI:Â£31,802-Â£94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates weresensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the device cost by15\\\% decreased the ICER to Â£50,106 ($79,533)/QALY.CONCLUSIONS: Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefitsat higher costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK thresholdof Â£20,000 to Â£30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now beginsto approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently recommended by the British NHS.

The question addressed was: Can the temporary use of right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute rightventricular failure after cardiac surgery? More than 183 papers were found using the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer theclinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patientgroup studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers aretabulated. Indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assistdevice insertion. Significant reductions in central venous pressure (P = 0.005)and mean pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.01) were reported during and afterRVAD support. Furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (P <0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05), right ventricular strokework (P < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (P < 0.05) were alsoseen. Assessment by one study showed that on Day 7 after RVAD removal, the right ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40\\\%. Dynamicechocardiography studies performed before, during and after RVAD placementdemonstrated that after RVAD implantation, right ventricular end-diastolicdimensions (P < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (P < 0.05) and right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) increased. Although several studiessuccessfully weaned patients from an RVAD, there were several complications,including bleeding requiring surgical intervention. However, this may be reduced by using percutaneous implantation (bleeding incidence: 4 of 9 patients) ratherthan by a surgically implanted RVAD (bleeding incidence: 5 of 5 patients).However, mortality is higher in percutaneous RVAD patients rather than insurgical RVAD (80-44\\\%) patients. Causes of death cited for patients on an RVADincluded multiorgan failure, sepsis, thromboembolic events, reoccurring rightheart failure and failure to wean due to persistent right ventricular failure. Weconclude that RVADs have been successfully used to bridge patients to recoveryafter cardiac surgery; however, RVADs carry numerous risks and a high mortalityrate.PMCID: PMC3957279: 24372519  [pubmed - indexed for medline]293. interact cardiovasc thorac surg. 2014 apr;18(4):499-510. doi:10.1093/icvts/ivt472. epub 2013 dec 25.can the temporary use of right ventricular assist devices bridge patients withacute right ventricular failure after cardiac surgery to recovery?lang sa(1), o\\neill b, waterworth p, bilal h.author information: (1)school of medicine, university of manchester, manchester, uk.a best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structuredprotocol. the question addressed was: can the temporary use of right ventricular assist devices (rvads) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute rightventricular failure after cardiac surgery? more than 183 papers were found using the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer theclinical question. the authors, journal, date and country of publication, patientgroup studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers aretabulated. indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assistdevice insertion. significant reductions in central venous pressure (p = 0.005)and mean pulmonary artery pressures (p < 0.01) were reported during and afterrvad support. furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (p <0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.05), right ventricular strokework (p < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (p < 0.05) were alsoseen. assessment by one study showed that on day 7 after rvad removal, the right ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40\\\%. dynamicechocardiography studies performed before, during and after rvad placementdemonstrated that after rvad implantation, right ventricular end-diastolicdimensions (p < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (p < 0.05) and right ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.05) increased. although several studiessuccessfully weaned patients from an rvad, there were several complications,including bleeding requiring surgical intervention. however, this may be reduced by using percutaneous implantation (bleeding incidence: 4 of 9 patients) ratherthan by a surgically implanted rvad (bleeding incidence: 5 of 5 patients).however, mortality is higher in percutaneous rvad patients rather than insurgical rvad (80-44\\\%) patients. causes of death cited for patients on an rvadincluded multiorgan failure, sepsis, thromboembolic events, reoccurring rightheart failure and failure to wean due to persistent right ventricular failure. weconclude that rvads have been successfully used to bridge patients to recoveryafter cardiac surgery; however, rvads carry numerous risks and a high mortalityrate.pmcid: pmc3957279'

Neither age nor duration of supportinfluenced outcome. Stroke, ongoing requirement for ventilation while on BH, and diagnosis other than dilated cardiomyopathy were the only independent mortalityrisk factors. Children who weighed < 20 kg had significantly (p = 0.03) longersupport times than bigger children. The number of children treated with a BHincreased over time (p = 0.01).

Thismay be a disadvantage to their priority for organ allocation. We sought todetermine the relationship between VAD implantation and successfultransplantation among patients listed for heart transplant.METHODS: Adults with CHD patients (N = 1,250) were identified from the UnitedNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2010 and compared topatients without congenital etiology for heart failure (N = 59,606). VAD use atlisting, listing status, status upgrades and reasons for upgrade prior totransplant were trended at 5-year intervals and appropriate statisticalcomparisons were made between groups.RESULTS: Since 1985, VAD use prior to transplant has increased significantly inpatients without CHD, but not in CHD patients (17\\\% vs 3\\\% in 2006 to 2010, p <0.0001). CHD patients were more likely to be listed as Status 2, compared tothose without (66\\\% vs 40\\\%, p < 0.001 for 2006 to 2010), and less likely to beupgraded to Status 1 after listing (43\\\% vs 55\\\%, p = 0.03). Among those upgradedto Status 1, CHD patients were less likely to have a VAD at transplant than thosewithout (3\\\% vs 18\\\%, p = 0.005). VAD use was more likely to result in death in CHDpatients.CONCLUSIONS: VAD use is less common in CHD patients than in patients without CHD,both at the time of listing and transplantation. Reduced VAD use appears tocontribute to lower listing status and organ allocation. These differences havegrown more disparate over time.

However,survival is poorer in HHTx recipients, and with improving results in continuousflow ventricular assist devices (VADs), many patients can be bridged to allownormalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic hearttransplant (OHTx) candidates. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyse thesurvival of our HHTx cohort and compare them with our VAD bridge patients.METHODS: A retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 OHTx and 27HHTx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124bridge-to-transplant VAD patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received an OHTx. Pulmonary artery pressures before and after VAD implant were analysed.Survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: HHTx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older, smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the OHTx cohort. Comparison ofthe VAD types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longertime supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than thepulsatile devices. The continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonaryartery pressures pretransplant. The HHTx cohort had a significantly poorersurvival than the OHTx cohort (P=0.002). Survival on a continuous device and thenOHTx was significantly better than either HHTx or pulsatile device support.CONCLUSIONS: The main indication for HHTx, namely fixed elevated pulmonaryhypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.: 23731606  [pubmed - indexed for medline]432. eur j cardiothorac surg. 2014 feb;45(2):372-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281. epub2013 may 31.heterotopic heart transplant: is there an indication in the continuous flowventricular assist device era?marasco sf(1), bell d, lee g, bailey m, bergin p, esmore ds.author information: (1)cardiothoracic surgery unit, the alfred hospital, melbourne, australia.objectives: heterotopic heart transplantation (hhtx) is a therapeutic option inheart failure patients with fixed elevated pulmonary hypertension. however,survival is poorer in hhtx recipients, and with improving results in continuousflow ventricular assist devices (vads), many patients can be bridged to allownormalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic hearttransplant (ohtx) candidates. thus, the aim of this study was to analyse thesurvival of our hhtx cohort and compare them with our vad bridge patients.methods: a retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 ohtx and 27hhtx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124bridge-to-transplant vad patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received an ohtx. pulmonary artery pressures before and after vad implant were analysed.survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses.results: hhtx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older, smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the ohtx cohort. comparison ofthe vad types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longertime supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than thepulsatile devices. the continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonaryartery pressures pretransplant. the hhtx cohort had a significantly poorersurvival than the ohtx cohort (p=0.002). survival on a continuous device and thenohtx was significantly better than either hhtx or pulsatile device support.conclusions: the main indication for hhtx, namely fixed elevated pulmonaryhypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.'

Epub 2013 Apr 28.Is it time for a cardiac allocation score? First results from the Eurotransplant pilot study on a survival benefit-based heart allocation.Smits JM(1), de Vries E, De Pauw M, Zuckermann A, Rahmel A, Meiser B, Laufer G,Reichenspurner H, Strueber M.Author information: (1)Eurotransplant International Foundation Leiden, The Netherlands.jsmits@eurotransplant.orgBACKGROUND: Patients awaiting heart transplantation in Eurotransplant areprioritized by waiting time and medical urgency. To reduce mortality, theintroduction of post-transplant survival in an allocation model based on theconcept of survival benefit might be more appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic accuracy of the heart failure survival score (HFSS), theSeattle heart failure model (SHFM), the Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) model, and the index for mortalityprediction after cardiac transplantation (IMPACT) score for predicting mortality.METHODS: The HFSS, SHFM, the adapted SHFM, and the INTERMACS model were evaluatedfor predicting waiting list mortality among heart transplant candidates, and the IMPACT score was tested for predicting post-transplant mortality in separate Cox regression models. Included were the 448 adult heart transplant candidates listedfor an urgent status between October 2010 and June 2011 in Eurotransplant. Acardiac allocation score (CAS) was calculated based on the estimated survivaltimes as predicted by the scores. All analyses were performed for the totalcohort and separately for ventricular assist device (VAD) and non-VAD patients.RESULTS: Mortality on the waiting list could significantly be predicted in thenon-VAD cohort by HFSS (p = 0.005) and SHFM (p < 0.0001) and after transplant by IMPACT (p < 0.0001).

Several studies showed that use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)in patients with fixed PH who were initially deemed ineligible for HTxeffectively decreased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), thus permitting HTx. We recently encountered a candidate for HTx who had severe PH with extremely highpulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). A 27-year-old female who had been diagnosed with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and who was approved for HTx atage 25 was referred to our institute because of severe fatigability with moderatedyspnea even at rest due to severe bilateral heart failure. Despite continuousinotrope infusion, the patient\\s symptoms were not relieved. Right heartcatheterization (RHC) disclosed a PAP of 62/40 mmHg with severely reduced cardiacoutput (1.8 l/min). A PVR of 15.9 Wood units suggested progressive worsening ofleft ventricular function with almost irreversible remodeling of the pulmonaryvasculature, and the patient was thought to be contraindicated for HTx. Following3 weeks of aggressive medical treatment, repeat RHC demonstrated PVR lowering to 8.16 Wood units. This suggested it was likely that PVR could be reversed, and thepatient underwent LVAD implantation. RHC performed after LVAD implantation showeda fall in PVR from the initial, extremely high measurement of 15.9 Wood units to 3.4 Wood units at 2 months postoperatively, and to 2.2 Wood units at 1 year.

Unloading of the left ventricle with animplantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonaryvascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in acohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy.METHODS: Pulmonary haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eightHeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplantby virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4\\\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\\\%(24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortalitywas 7.7\\\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\\\% (10 of 11). Baseline and post-VAD pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic PAP (mmHg), meanPAP, TPG (mmHg) of 57 Â± 9.5, 42 Â± 4.4 and 14 Â± 3.9 reduced to 32 Â± 7.5, 18 Â± 5.5 and 9 Â± 3.3, respectively. PVR reduced from 5 Â± 1.5 to 2.1 Â± 0.5 Wood units (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In selected heart failure patients with secondary PH, use ofcentrifugal LVAD results in significant reductions in PAP, TPG and PVR, which areobserved within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months.

Mechanicalcirculatory support using VADs has been an essential therapeutic tool forpatients with severe heart failure waiting for a heart transplant in clinicalsite. Adaptive control of VADs that automatically adjust the pump output withchanges in a patient state is one of the important approaches for enhancedtherapeutic efficacy, prevention of complications and quality of lifeimprovement. However adaptively controlling a VAD in the realistic situationwould be difficult because it is necessary to model the whole including the VADand the cardiovascular dynamics. To solve this problem, we propose an applicationof attractor selection algorithm using stochastic behavior to a VAD controlsystem.

Studies have suggested that outcomes after VAD implantation may bedependent on institutional procedural volume, and outcome data fromnon-transplant centres are lacking. This study reviews the outcomes of patientswho received a long-term VAD at our centre to determine if these devices can besafely implanted at tertiary care, low-volume, non-transplant centres.METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study, examining theclinical outcomes of consecutive patients who received a long-term VAD over a42-month period.RESULTS: During the study period 73 patients required MCS, of whom 16 received a long-term VAD. This select group had a mean Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile of 1.6 (0.9) and beforeimplantation 94\\\% required at least 1 inotropic medication, 69\\\% had suffered acardiac arrest, 63\\\% required an intra-aortic balloon pump, 69\\\% requiredmechanical ventilation, and 44\\\% required short-term MCS. The primary outcome ofsurvival to transplant or ongoing MCS at 1 year was achieved in 75\\\% of patients. Operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital survival were 100\\\%, 88\\\%, and81\\\%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term VADs can be implanted at low-volume, nontransplant centreswith survival rates comparable with contemporary clinical trials.

While inhospital, patients with a VAD have traditionally been taught by an educator nursewith VAD expertise in preparation for discharge. In 2004, our centre implemented a successful competency-based patient education program in post-heart transplant patients and thought that a similar program may provide increased confidence for bedside nurses to actively participate in VAD patient education prior todischarge. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to create acompetency-based education program that would provide consistency in patientteaching. A questionnaire was developed and completed by 13 bedside nurses. This pre-test questionnaire indicated the need for a systematic and organized approachto VAD patient teaching. Furthermore, adequate resources, consistency in teachingmethods, and feedback were seen to be essential. A pilot competency-based programwas designed to lead bedside nurses and patients through a series of learningphases and has successfully been implemented. Since its implementation, thequestionnaire has been repeated with results reflecting satisfaction with therevised competency-based program. Our findings and evaluation of the programthrough pre- and post-testing reflect an increase in organization in our teachingmethods and has led to improved confidence and satisfaction for bedside nursesusing this program. By redeveloping the current method of VAD education, our goalhas been to improve the ways in which we deliver teaching to our patients.

The aim of this studywas to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA)and BSI after implantation of LVAD for advanced heart failure (HF). This was aretrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage HF, who underwent implantation of HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD over a 4 year period. Bloodstream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspectedneurological complications including CVAs were confirmed by neuroimaging.Extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristicswere analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The mean age of our studypopulation was 62.3 Â± 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males (n = 75, 86.2\\\%). The baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients withand without CVAs. Patients with BSI had a much greater incidence of CVA compared to patients without BSI (n = 13, 43.3\\\% vs. n = 5, 10.0\\\%; p < 0.0001).

Gastrointestinal (GI)bleeding has been frequently reported within this population.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart MateII from January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence,etiology, and management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regressionanalysis was conducted to identify related risk factors.RESULTS: A significant incidence of GI bleeding (22.8\\\%) occurred in ourpredominantly destination therapy (DT) (93\\\%) population. Fifty-seven percent ofthe patients with bleeding episodes bled from the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54\\\% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37\\\% from ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35\\\% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI) tract. Previous history of GI bleeding(odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95\\\% CI, 2.2-228.6; p=0.008), elevated internationalnormalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9; p=0.02), and low platelet count(OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were independent predictors of GIhemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in older patients (mean, 70 years;p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60\\\%) rebled from the same site. Managementstrategies included temporarily withholding anticoagulation, decreasing the speedof LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide did not impact the amount of packedred blood cells used, rebleeding rates, length of hospital stay, or all-causemortality.

We analyzed the effect on PVR of pretransplantLVAD therapy in patients with PH and compared posttransplant outcome with matchedcontrols. Long-term survival was compared between heart transplant recipientswith mild, moderate or severe PH and patients with no PH.METHODS: Heart transplant recipients 1988-2007 (n=405) were reviewed and divided into two groups with respect to pretransplant PVR: <2.5 WU (n=148) and >2.5 WU(n=158). From the group with PH, patients subjected to pretransplant LVAD therapy(n=11) were analyzed with respect to PVR at implant and at transplant and, withrespect to outcome, compared to matched historical controls (n=22). Patients withPH without LVAD treatment (n=147) were stratified into three subgroups: mild,moderate and severe PH and survival according to Kaplan-Meier was analyzed andcompared to patients with no PH.RESULTS: LVAD therapy reduced PVR from 4.3+/-1.6 to 2.0+/-0.6 WU, p<0.05. Threecases of perioperative heart failure required mechanical support whereas onecontrol patient developed perioperative right heart failure requiring mechanical support. The incidence of other perioperative complications was comparablebetween groups. There was no difference in survival between LVAD patients andcontrols, 30-day survival was 82\\\% and 91\\\%, respectively and 4-year survival was64\\\% and 82\\\%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant LVAD therapy reduces an elevated PVR in hearttransplant recipients, but there was no statistically significant difference inposttransplant survival in patients with PH with, or without LVAD therapy.

(2)Department of CardiovascularSurgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, CzechRepublic.OBJECTIVES: Second-generation axial-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become an established therapy in bridging end-stage heart failure patientsto cardiac transplantation. Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II(HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD.METHODS: This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patientstransplanted during 2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were dividedinto two groups according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) orrequired additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were comparedfor early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major earlypost-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival.RESULTS: Early graft loss was 10.7\\\% in isolated HMII and 25\\\% in HMII + RVADpatients (P = 0.26). There were no observed differences in the rates of primarygraft dysfunction (7.3 vs 0\\\%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5\\\%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25\\\%, P = 0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary arteryresistance (odds ratio: 3.286, 95\\\% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant predictor for adverse outcome ofmechanically-bridged heart transplant recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 Â± 5\\\% in isolated HMII and 75 Â± 15\\\% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that heart transplant recipients who requiredunplanned RV mechanical support after LVAD implantation achieved comparable ratesof early graft loss, post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-yeargraft survival was equivalent between those two groups. Given the small samplesize, further studies involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.Â© The Author 2014.

Children aged 0 to 16 years with severe heart failure (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Supportprofile 1 or 2) due to 2-ventricle heart disease and actively listed for HTcomprise the primary study cohort. The control population is a propensity-matchedretrospective cohort of children supported with extracorporeal membraneoxygenation, the only bridge device available to smaller children before theEXCOR. The primary efficacy end point is survival to heart transplantation orrecovery. The primary safety end point is the incidence of serious adverse eventsas defined by pediatric Interagency Registry for Mechanically AssistedCirculatory Support criteria. The study will enroll a total of 48 subjects in 2cohorts based on body surface area (cohort 1 <0.7 m(2), cohort 2 0.7-1.5 m(2))and is powered to show safety superiority to a prespecified performance goal of0.25 serious adverse events per day of support. Children ineligible for theprimary cohort will still have access to the device in a third compassionate-use cohort where adverse event data will be collected for additional safetycharacterization of the device.CONCLUSION: The Berlin Heart IDE clinical study will be the first bridge-to-HTVAD study designed exclusively for children. It is anticipated that the studywill provide important information on the safety and efficacy of the Berlin HeartEXCOR Pediatric in children while providing valuable lessons into the design and conduct of future VAD studies in children.Copyright Â© 2011 Mosby, Inc.

The aim of the present study was toinvestigate the effects of myocardial redox state on the activities of MMP-2 and -9 implicated in cardiac remodeling in end-stage heart failure patients supportedby left ventricular assist device (LVAD).METHODS AND RESULTS: During heart transplant (HT) surgery, myocardial specimens(MS) from right ventricular walls and LV walls were obtained from 7 LVADrecipients (LVAD group, MS n=35) and from 7 stable HT candidates on medicaltherapy (MT group, MS n=35). Myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression,tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and -4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1 and aminothiol concentrations were measured. MMP-2 and -9 activities were evaluatedalso by incubating MS with different amounts of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH). MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression were lower in the LVAD group,whereas myocardial TIMP-1 and -4 concentrations were comparable to those of MTpatients. Higher GSH and TGF-Î²1 concentrations were found in LVAD-recipients.Only GSH concentrations were inversely related to MMP-2 and -9 activities. Invitro, GSH had an inhibitory effect on MMP-2 and -9 activities.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD recipients show reduced myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression when compared to medically treated patients. Changes of myocardialredox state, predominantly GSH-dependent, appear to modulate MMP-2 and -9activities by an inhibitory effect dependent on thiol content.

For both patient groups, the importance ofscreening for and treatment of psychosocial problems and mental disorders tooptimize compliance and survival has been acknowledged. We compared the use ofpsychotherapeutic support by patients with primary HTX, on VAD support, either ondestination therapy or to be transplanted, and successfully bridged totransplant. In addition, we evaluated the use for supportive psychotherapy forthe families of our patients and present two typical cases.METHODS: Patients with primary HTX (HTX(prim), n=16), with VAD on destinationtherapy (VAD(dest), n=15), with VAD waiting for transplant (VAD(htx), n=9), andpatients who have been successfully bridged on VAD to transplant (HTX(vad), n=11)were analyzed during the preoperative and the in-hospital postoperative period.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10) diagnoses, number of contactswith the psychologist, time expenses for individual interventions, familyinterventions, and concomitant communication were assessed.RESULTS: Adjustment disorders were the most prevalent disturbances. HTX(vad)patients needed more psychotherapeutic interventions and required more time forindividual support than HTX(prim) patients. Partners and families of almostone-half of all patients made use of supportive psychotherapy; there were nodifferences between the groups with regard to the needed time. Further, thegroups did not differ in the time expenses for concomitant communication with thepsychologist. At the latest contact with the psychologist, three VAD(dest)patients did not need further psychotherapy at this time; also, one VAD patientwaiting for transplant and two after primary HTX were psychosocially stable.CONCLUSION: Our data reflect the high emotional distress, especially of HTX(vad) patients. Our data suggest further that patients on VAD support experiencepsychosocial and emotional stress as severe as HTX candidates and recipients do. Patients on destination therapy and those who are waiting for transplantation do not differ in this regard.

HF management and approach to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) may differ from adults without CHD.We sought to compare OHT waitlist characteristics and outcomes for these 2groups.METHODS: The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to identify adults (â¥18 years) listed for OHT from 2005 to 2009. The cohort was divided into those with or without CHD.RESULTS: Of 9,722 adults included, 314 (3\\\%) had CHD. Adults with CHD were younger(35 Â± 13 vs 52 Â± 12 years, p < 0.01) and more often had undergone prior cardiacsurgery (85\\\% vs. 34\\\%, p < 0.01). Patients with CHD were less likely to have adefibrillator (44\\\% vs 75\\\%, p < 0.01) or ventricular assist device (5\\\% vs 14\\\%, p <0.01) and were more likely to be listed at the lowest urgency status thanpatients without CHD (64\\\% vs 44\\\%, p < 0.01). Fewer CHD patients achieved OHT (53\\\%vs 65\\\%, p < 0.001). Although overall waitlist mortality did not differ betweengroups (10\\\% vs 8\\\%, p = 0.15), patients with CHD were more likely to experiencecardiovascular death (60\\\% vs 40\\\%, p = 0.03), including sudden in 44\\\% and due toHF in 16\\\%.CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower urgency status, patients with CHD have greatercardiovascular mortality awaiting OHT than those without. Increased defibrillatoruse could improve survival to OHT, because sudden death is common. VAD supportmay benefit select patients, but experience in CHD is limited. Referral tospecialized adult congenital heart centers can enhance utilization of devicetherapies and potentially improve waitlist outcomes.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
