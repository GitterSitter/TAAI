Epub 2010 Jul 8.Prevalence of de novo aortic insufficiency during long-term support with leftventricular assist devices.Pak SW(1), Uriel N, Takayama H, Cappleman S, Song R, Colombo PC, Charles S,Mancini D, Gillam L, Naka Y, Jorde UP.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used aslong-term therapy for end-stage heart failure patients. We compared theprevalence of aortic insufficiency (AI) after HeartMate II (HMII) vs HeartMateXVE (HMI) support and assessed the role of aortic root diameter and aortic valve opening in the development of AI.METHOD: Pre-operative and post-operative echocardiograms of 93 HMI and 73 HMIIpatients who received implants at our center between January 2004 and September2009 were retrospectively reviewed. After excluding patients with prior orconcurrent surgical manipulation of the aortic valve, with baseline AI, orwithout baseline echoes, 67 HMI and 63 HMII patients were studied. AI was deemed significant if mild to moderate or greater. Pathology reports were reviewed for77 patients who underwent heart transplant.RESULTS: AI developed in 4 of 67 HMI (6.0\%) and in 9 of 63 HMII patients (14.3\%).The median times to AI development were 48 days for HMI patients and 90 days for HMII patients. For patients who remained on device support at 6 and 12 months,freedom from AI was 94.5\% and 88.9\% in HMI patients and 83.6\% and 75.2\% in HMIIpatients (log rank p = 0.194). Aortic root diameters, as determined byechocardiography for the patients with AI, trended to be larger at baseline (3.43Â± 0.43 vs 3.15 Â± 0.40; p = 0.067) and follow-up (3.58 Â± 0.54 vs 3.29 Â± 0.50; p = 0.130) compared with those who did not have AI. Aortic root circumferences wereassessed directly by a pathologist in those patients who underwent transplant andwere significantly larger in HMII patients who had developed AI compared withthose patients who did not (8.44 Â± 0.89 vs 7.36 Â± 1.02 cm; p = 0.034). Lastly, AIwas more common in patients whose aortic valve did not open (11 of 26 vs 1 of 14;p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: Aortic insufficiency occurs frequently in patients who receivecontinuous-flow support with a HMII LVAD, and may be associated with aortic root diameter enlargement and aortic valve opening. These findings warrant a morethorough preoperative patient evaluation and additional studies to investigatethe factors, that may be associated with AI development.Copyright Â© 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.

Ventricular assist devices were placed as a bridge totransplant in 110 patients. We focused our analysis on the 2 most common causesof end-stage heart failure requiring transplantation: idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy (n = 201) and coronary artery disease (n = 213). Data includinggender, age, date of transplant, cause of heart failure, prior heart transplant, placement of a ventricular assist device, type of ventricular assist device, and panel-reactive antibody sensitization were analyzed to derive Kaplan-Meiersurvival probabilities and multivariable Cox regression models.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who received aventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant, survival was decreased at 1 year (P = .008) and 5 years (P = .019), but not at 10 years, posttransplant. Inpatients with coronary artery disease, the use of a ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant did not influence survival at 1, 5, and 10 tearsposttransplant. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who received aHeartmate I (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif) ventricular assist device as abridge to a cardiac transplant, elevation in the pretransplant panel-reactiveantibody correlated with a decrease in long-term survival.CONCLUSION: In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, placement of aHeartmate I ventricular assist device as a bridge to a cardiac transplant isassociated with an elevation in the pretransplant panel-reactive antibody and adecrease in 1- and 5-year survivals after cardiac transplantation.2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Furthermore,prior studies with pulsatile LVADs have shown that transplantation, either early (<6 weeks) or late (>6 months) after LVAD implantation, adversely affectedpost-cardiac transplant survival. We sought to determine factors related toposttransplant survival in patients supported with continuous-flow LVADs.METHODS: The HeartMate II LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif) wasimplanted in 468 patients as a bridge to transplant at 36 centers in amulticenter trial. Patients who underwent transplantation after support werestratified by demographics: gender, age, etiology, body mass index, duration ofdevice support, and by adverse events during support. The median age was 54 years(range 18-73 years); 43\% had ischemic etiology, and 18\% were women. Survival was determined at the specific intervals of 30 days and 1 year after transplantation.RESULTS: Of 468 patients, 250 (53\%) underwent cardiac transplant after a medianduration of LVAD support of 151 days (longest: 3.2 years), 106 (23\%) died, 12(2.6\%) recovered ventricular function and the device was removed, and 100 (21\%)were still receiving LVAD support. The overall 30-day and 1-year posttransplantsurvivals were 97\% and 87\%. There were no significant differences in survivalbased on demographic factors or LVAD duration of less than 30 days, 30 to 90days, 90 to 180 days, and more than 180 days. Patients requiring more than 2units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support had astatistically significant decreased 1-year survival (82\% vs 94\%) when comparedwith patients who did not require more than 2 units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support (P = .03). There was a trend for slightly lowersurvival at 1 year in patients with percutaneous lead infections during LVADsupport versus no infection (75\% vs 89\%; P = .07).CONCLUSIONS: Post-cardiac transplant survival in patients supported withcontinuous-flow devices such as the HeartMate II LVAD is equivalent to that with conventional transplantation. Furthermore, posttransplant survival is notinfluenced by the duration of LVAD support. The improved durability and reducedshort- and long-term morbidity associated with the HeartMate II LVAD has reduced the need for urgent cardiac transplantation, which may have adversely influenced survival in the pulsatile LVAD era.

However, it remains to be seen whether newer continuous-flow leftventricular assist devices have a similar effect on pulmonary hypertension. Theobjective of this study was to determine whether the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp,Pleasanton, Calif), a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device, iseffective in improving pulmonary hemodynamics in the period after leftventricular assist device support and posttransplant.METHODS: Fifty patients with end-stage heart failure underwent HeartMate II left ventricular assist device placement as a bridge to transplant. We evaluated theirpulmonary hemodynamics with right-sided heart catheterization at baseline, after left ventricular assist device placement, and after heart transplant.RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 53.7 +/- 13.5 years. Ischemic etiology was present in 60\% of the patients. After left ventricular assist device placement(mean duration, 135 +/- 60 days), mean systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterypressures decreased significantly from a baseline of 55.2 +/- 13.4 mm Hg and 27.3+/- 6.8 mm Hg, respectively, to 35.9 +/- 10.8 mm Hg and 15.8 +/- 6.5 mm Hg,respectively (P < .001). Similarly, mean pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly from a baseline of 3.6 +/- 1.9 Woods units to 2.1 +/- 0.8 Woodsunits (P < .001). Posttransplant pulmonary hemodynamics also remained withinnormal limits, even in patients with previously severe pulmonary hypertension.CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices effectively improvepulmonary hemodynamics associated with end-stage heart failure. Moreover,pulmonary hemodynamics remain within normal limits in the posttransplant period, even in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

Although cardiac transplantation is anexcellent treatment option, it is a limited resource and most patients areineligible for cardiac transplantation using standard listing criteria.Increasingly, newer surgical options for these patients include the usage ofmarginal donor organs in an extended criteria-alternate list heart transplantprogram (EC-AL), or left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy(DT-LVAD). The purpose of this study was to compare baseline characteristics and outcomes after EC-AL versus DT-LVAD.METHODS: From March 2000 to August 2008, 153 consecutive patients who had beenturned down for standard heart transplantation underwent either EC-AL or DT-LVAD.The most common reasons for standard heart transplant ineligibility for bothgroups were advanced age, diabetes mellitus with end-organ dysfunction, andsignificant renal insufficiency. Patients in the alternate list program received a donor organ that had been turned down by all other centers for standard listrecipients. The most common reasons for donor heart refusal were decreased leftventricular function, left ventricle hypertrophy, or coronary artery disease.Outcomes for both groups were retrospectively reviewed after Institutional ReviewBoard permission was obtained. Comparisons were also made between patients thathad been matched by propensity score analysis.RESULTS: In all, 93 patients underwent EC-AL, and 60 underwent DT-LVAD. Baseline preoperative characteristics of both groups were similar except that 87\% ofDT-LVAD patients (52 of 60) required preoperative mechanical or inotropic supportwhereas only 51\% of EC-AL patients (47 of 93) required support (p<0.0001).Thirty-day operative mortality and 1-year survival were 2.5\% and 82.2\% for EC-AL and 6.7\% and 77.5\% DT-LVAD, respectively (p=0.2411 and p=0.5036). Overallsurvival at 3 years was better for EC-AL versus DT-LVAD. The DT-LVAD patients hadimproved survival compared with the Randomized Evaluation of MechanicalAssistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial DT-LVAD cohort, a historical control. These findings were corroborated in the analysis ofpropensity-matched patients.CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively, the DT-LVAD cohort was more unstable, with greaterneed for inotropes or mechanical support. Despite this, perioperative and 1-year mortality was similar for the two groups. Three-year survival was better forEC-AL. The DT-LVAD patient survival was better than that of the REMATCH DT-LVADcohort.Copyright (c) 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
