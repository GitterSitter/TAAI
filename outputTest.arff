'\r\nVentricular assist device\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\nVentricular assist device\r\nIntervention\r\nVentricular assist device.png\r\nA left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pumping blood from the left ventricle to the aorta, connected to an externally worn control unit and battery pack.\r\nMedlinePlus\t007268\r\nA ventricular assist device (VAD) is an electromechanical circulatory device that is used to partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart. The function of VADs differs from that of artificial cardiac pacemakers. Some VADs are intended for short term use, typically for patients recovering from heart attacks or heart surgery, while others are intended for long-term use (months to years and in some cases for life), typically for patients suffering from advanced congestive heart failure.\r\n\r\nVADs are distinct from artificial hearts, which are designed to completely take over cardiac function and generally require the removal of the patient\'s heart. VADs are designed to assist either the right (RVAD) or left (LVAD) ventricle, or both at once (BiVAD). The type that is used depends primarily on the underlying heart disease and the pulmonary arterial resistance that determines the load on the right ventricle.\r\n\r\nLVADs are most commonly used, but when pulmonary arterial resistance is high, right ventricular assistance may become necessary. Long term VADs are normally used to keep patients alive with a good quality of life while they wait for a heart transplantation (known as a \"bridge to transplantation\"). However, LVADs are sometimes used as destination therapy, meaning they will never undergo heart transplant, and sometimes as a bridge to recovery.[1][2]\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, VADs have improved significantly in terms of providing survival and quality of life among recipients.[3]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Design\r\n1.1 Pumps\r\n2 History\r\n3 Studies and outcomes\r\n3.1 Recent developments\r\n3.2 HeartMate II LVAD pivotal study\r\n3.3 HARPS\r\n3.4 REMATCH\r\n4 Complications and side effects\r\n5 List of implantable VAD devices\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nDesign[edit]\r\n\r\nClose-up illustration of typical left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nPumps[edit]\r\nThe pumps used in VADs can be divided into two main categories â€“ pulsatile pumps, that mimic the natural pulsing action of the heart, and continuous flow pumps.[4] Pulsatile VADs use positive displacement pumps. In some of these pumps, the volume occupied by blood varies during the pumping cycle, and if the pump is contained inside the body then a vent tube to the outside air is required.\r\n\r\nContinuous flow VADs are smaller and have proven to be more durable than pulsatile VADs.[5] They normally use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of the rotor\'s axis.[6]\r\n\r\nAn important issue with continuous flow pumps is the method used to suspend the rotor. Early versions used solid bearings; however, newer pumps, some of which are approved for use in the EU, use either electromagnetic suspension (\"maglev\")[7][8][9][10] or hydrodynamic suspension. These pumps contain only one moving part.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\n\r\n1966 DeBakey ventricular assist device.[11]\r\nThe first successful implantation of a left ventricular assist device was completed in 1966 by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey to a 37-year old woman. A paracorporeal (external) circuit was able to provide mechanical support for 10 days after the surgery.[12] The first successful long-term implantation of an artificial LVAD was conducted in 1988 by Dr. William F. Bernhard of Boston Children\'s Hospital Medical Center and Thermedics, Inc of Woburn, MA under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research contract which developed Heart-mate, an electronically controlled assist device. This was funded by a three year $6.2 million contract to Thermedics and Children\'s Hospital, Boston MA from the National Heart and Lung and Blood Institute, a program of NIH.[13] The early VADs emulated the heart by using a \"pulsatile\" action where blood is alternately sucked into the pump from the left ventricle then forced out into the aorta. Devices of this kind include the HeartMate IP LVAS, which was approved for use in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 1994. These devices are commonly referred to as first generation VADs.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nMore recent work has concentrated on continuous flow pumps, which can be roughly categorized as either centrifugal pumps or axial flow impeller driven pumps. These pumps have the advantage of greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability. These devices are referred to as second generation VADs. A side effect is that the user will not have a pulse, or that the pulse intensity will be seriously reduced[citation needed].\r\n\r\nThird generation VADs suspend the impeller in the pump using either hydrodynamic or electromagnetic suspension, thus removing the need for bearings and reducing the number of moving parts to one.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nAnother technology undergoing clinical trials is the use of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using percutaneous cables. Apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action. A pulsatile pump using this technology has CE Mark approval and is in clinical trials for US FDA approval.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nA very different approach in the early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta. Inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand â€“ in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle. A proposed refinement is to use the patient\'s skeletal muscle, driven by a pacemaker, to power this device which would make it truly self-contained. However a similar operation (cardiomyoplasty) was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results. In any case, it has substantial potential advantages in avoiding the need to operate on the heart itself and in avoiding any contact between blood and the device. This approach involves a return to a pulsatile flow.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPeter Houghton was the longest surviving recipient of a VAD for permanent use. He received an experimental Jarvik 2000 LVAD in June 2000. Since then, he completed a 91-mile charity walk, published two books, lectured widely, hiked in the Swiss Alps and the American West, flew in an ultra-light aircraft, and traveled extensively around the world. He died of acute renal failure in 2007 at the age of 69.[14][15]\r\n\r\nStudies and outcomes[edit]\r\nRecent developments[edit]\r\nIn July 2009 in England, surgeons removed a donor heart that had been implanted in a toddler next to her native heart, after her native heart had recovered. This technique suggests mechanical assist device, such as an LVAD, can take some or all the work away from the native heart and allow it time to heal.[16]\r\nIn July 2009, 18-month follow-up results from the HeartMate II Clinical Trial concluded that continuous-flow LVAD provides effective hemodynamic support for at least 18 months in patients awaiting transplantation, with improved functional status and quality of life. (see below).[17]\r\nHeidelberg University Hospital reported in July 2009 that the first HeartAssist5, known as the modern version of the DeBakey VAD, was implanted there. The HeartAssist5 weighs 92 grams, is made of titanium and plastic, and serves to pump blood from the left ventricle into the aorta.[18]\r\nA phase 1 clinical trial is underway (as of August 2009), consisting of patients with coronary artery bypass grafting and patients in end-stage heart failure who have a left ventricular assist device. The trial involves testing a patch, called Anginera(TM) that contains cells that secrete hormone-like growth factors that stimulate other cells to grow. The patches are seeded with heart muscle cells and then implanted onto the heart with the goal of getting the muscle cells to start communicating with native tissues in a way that allows for regular contractions.[19][20]\r\nIn September 2009, a New Zealand news outlet, Stuff, reported that in another 18 months to two years, a new wireless device will be ready for clinical trial that will power VADs without direct contact. If successful, this may reduce the chance of infection as a result of the power cable through the skin.[21]\r\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a $2.8 million grant to develop a \"pulse-less\" total artificial heart using two VADS by Micromed, initially created by Michael DeBakey and George Noon. The grant was renewed for a second year of research in August 2009. The Total Artificial Heart was created using two HeartAssist5 VADs, whereby one VAD pumps blood throughout the body and the other circulates blood to and from the lungs.[22]\r\nHeartWare International announced in August 2009 that it had surpassed 50 implants of their HeartWare Ventricular Assist System in their ADVANCE Clinical Trial, an FDA-approved IDE study. The study is to assess the system as bridge-to-transplantation system for patients with end-stage heart failure. The study, Evaluation of the HeartWare LVAD System for the Treatment of Advance Heart Failure, is a multi-center study that started in May 2009.[23][24]\r\nOn June 27, 2014 Hannover Medical School in Hannover, Germany performed the first human implant of HeartMate III under the direction of Professor Axel Haverich M.D., chief of the Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery Department and surgeon Jan Schmitto, M.D., Ph.D.[25]\r\nOn January 21, 2015 a study was published in Journal of American College of Cardiology suggesting that long-term use of LVAD may induce heart regeneration.[26] This may explain the bridge to recovery phenomenon first described by the Yacoub group in NEJM in 2009 (above).\r\nThe majority of VADs on the market today are somewhat bulky. The smallest device approved by the FDA, the HeartMate II, weighs about 1 pound (0.45 kg) and measures 3 inches (7.6 cm). This has proven particularly important for women and children, for whom alternatives would have been too large.[27]\r\n\r\nOne device gained CE Mark approval for use in the EU and began clinical trials in the US (VentrAssist). As of June 2007 these pumps had been implanted in over 100 patients. In 2009, Ventracor was placed into the hands of Administrators due to financial problems and was later that year liquidated. No other companies purchased the technology, so as a result the VentrAssist device was essentially defunct. Around 30â€“50 patients worldwide remain supported on VentrAssist devices as of January 2010.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe Heartware HVAD works similarly to the VentrAssist â€“ albeit much smaller and not requiring an abdominal pocket to be implanted into. The device has obtained CE Mark in Europe, and FDA approval in the U.S. Recently, it was shown that the Heartware HVAD can be implanted through limited access without sternotomy.[28]\r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases left ventricular assist devices, combined with drug therapy, have enabled the heart to recover sufficiently for the device to be able to be removed (explanted).[1][2]\r\n\r\nHeartMate II LVAD pivotal study[edit]\r\nA series of studies involving the use of the of HeartMate II LVAD have proven useful in establishing the viability and risks of using LVADs for bridge-to-transplantation and destination therapy.\r\n\r\nThe pilot trial for the HeartMate II LVAS began in November 2003 and consisted of 46 study patients at 15 centers. Results included 11 patients supported for more than one year and three patients supported for more than two years.\r\nThe HeartMate II pivotal trial began in 2005 and included the evaluation of HeartMate II for two indications: Bridge to transplantation (BTT) and destination therapy (DT), or long-term, permanent support. Thoratec Corp. announced that this was the first time the FDA had approved a clinical trial to include both indications in one protocol.[29][30][31]\r\nA multicenter study in the United States from 2005 to 2007 with 113 patients (of which 100 reported principal outcomes) showed that significant improvements in function were prevalent after three months, and a survival rate of 68\% after twelve months.[32]\r\nBased on one-year follow up data from the first 194 patients enrolled in the trial, the FDA approved HeartMate II for bridge-to-transplantation. The trial provided clinical evidence of improved survival rates and quality of life for a broad range of patients.[33][34]\r\nEighteen-month follow up data on 281 patients who had either reached the study end-point or completed 18 months of post-operative follow-up showed improved survival, less frequent adverse events and greater reliability with continuous flow LVADS compared to pulsatile flow devices. Of the 281 patients, 157 patients had undergone transplant, 58 patients were continuing with LVADs in their body and seven patients had the LVAD removed because their heart recovered; the remaining 56 had died. The results showed that the NYHA Class of heart failure the patients had been designated had significantly improved after six months of LVAD support compared to the pre-LVAD baseline. Although this trial involved bridge-to-transplant indication, the results provide early evidence that continuous flow LVADs have advantages in terms of durability and reliability for patients receiving mechanical support for destination therapy.[35]\r\nFollowing the FDA approval of HeartMate II LVAD for bridge-to-transplantation purposes, a post-approval (\"registry\") study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of the device in a commercial setting. The study found that the device improved outcomes, both compared to other LVAD treatments and baseline patients. Specifically, HeartMate II patients showed lower creatinine levels, 30-day survival rates were considerably higher at 96\%, and 93\% reached successful outcomes (transplant, cardiac recovery, or long-term LVAD).[36]\r\nHARPS[edit]\r\nThe Harefield Recovery Protocol Study (HARPS) is a clinical trial to evaluate whether advanced heart failure patients requiring VAD support can recover sufficient myocardial function to allow device removal (known as explantation). HARPS combines an LVAD (the HeartMate XVE) with conventional oral heart failure medications, followed by the novel Î²2 agonist clenbuterol. This opens the possibility that some advanced heart failure patients may forgo heart transplantation.[37]\r\n\r\nTo date, 73\% (11 of 15) of patients who underwent the combination therapy regimen demonstrated sufficient recovery to allow explantation and avoid heart transplantation; freedom from recurrent heart failure in surviving patients was 100\% and 89\% at one and four years after explantation, respectively; average ejection fraction was 64\% at 59 months after explantation â€“ all patients were NYHA Class I; and no significant adverse effects were reported with clenbuterol therapy.\r\n\r\nREMATCH[edit]\r\nThe REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure) clinical trial began in May 1998 and ran through July 2001 in 20 cardiac transplant centers around the USA. The trial was designed to compare long-term implantation of left ventricular assist devices with optimal medical management for patients with end-stage heart failure who require, but do not qualify to receive cardiac transplantation. As a result of the clinical outcomes, the device received FDA approval for both indications, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.[38]\r\n\r\nThe trial demonstrated an 81\% improvement in two-year survival among patients receiving HeartMate XVE compared to optimal medical management. In addition, a destination therapy study following the REMATCH trial demonstrated an additional 17\% improvement (61\% vs. 52\%) in one-year survival of patients that were implanted with a VAD (HeartMate XVE), with an implication for the appropriate selection of candidates and timing of VAD implantation.\r\n\r\nA test carried out in 2001 by Dr. Eric A. Rose and REMATCH study group with patients with congestive heart failure that were ineligible for a transplant showed a survival at two years of 23\% for those implanted with an LVAD compared with 8\% for those who were treated with drugs. The two major complications of VAD implantation were infection and mechanical failure (see below).\r\n\r\nAccording to a retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated with a left ventricular assist device versus inotrope therapy while awaiting heart transplantation, the group treated with LVAD had improved clinical and metabolic function at the time of transplant with better blood pressure, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. After transplant, 57.7\% of the inotrope group had renal failure versus 16.6\% in the LVAD group; 31.6\% of the inotrope group had right heart failure versus 5.6\% in the LVAD group; and event-free survival was 15.8\% in the inotrope group versus 55.6\% in the LVAD group.[39]\r\n\r\nComplications and side effects[edit]\r\nEarly postoperative bleeding complications are a major cause of morbidity and reoperation in LVAD patients.[40] Bleeding is the most common postoperative early complication after implantation or explantation of LVADs, necessitating reoperation in up to 60\% of recipients.[41] The implications of massive blood transfusions are great and include infection, pulmonary insufficiency, increased costs, right heart failure, allosensitization, and viral transmission, some of which can prove fatal or preclude transplantation.[41] When bleeding occurs, it impacts the one year Kaplan-Meier mortality.[40] In addition to complexity of the patient population and the complexity of these procedures contributing to bleeding, the devices themselves may contribute to the severe coagulopathy that can ensue when these devices are implanted.[42] Critical in the management of bleeding in the early hours after implantation or explantation is to adequately evacuate the post-surgical blood from around the heart and lungs to prevent retained blood from contributing to the need for reoperation to wash out clot that can compress the device features and contribute to post operative shock. Preventing chest tube clogging during this period is critical to recovery.[41]\r\n\r\nBecause the devices generally result in blood flowing over a non-biologic surface, predisposing the blood to clotting, there is need for anticoagulation measures. One device, the HeartMate XVE, is designed with a biologic surface derived from fibrin and does not require long term anticoagulation (except aspirin); unfortunately, this biologic surface may also predispose the patient to infection through selective reduction of certain types of leukocytes.[43]\r\n\r\nNew VAD designs which are now approved for use in the European Community and are undergoing trials for FDA approval have all but eliminated mechanical failure.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nVAD-related infection can be caused by a large number of different organisms:[44]\r\n\r\nGram positive bacteria (Staphylococci, especially Staph. aureus, Enterococci)\r\nGram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, Klebsiella species)\r\nFungi. especially Candida species\r\nTreatment of VAD-related infection is exceedingly difficult and many patients die of infection despite optimal treatment. Initial treatment should be with broad spectrum antibiotics, but every effort must be made to obtain appropriate samples for culture. A final decision regarding antibiotic therapy must be based on the results of microbiogical cultures.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nOther problems include immunosuppression, clotting with resultant stroke, and bleeding secondary to anticoagulation. Some of the polyurethane components used in the devices cause the deletion of a subset of immune cells when blood comes in contact with them. This predisposes the patient to fungal and some viral infections necessitating appropriate prophylactic therapy.[45]\r\n\r\nConsidering the multitude of risks and lifestyle modifications associated with ventricular assist device implant,[46] it is important for prospective patients to be informed prior to decision making.[47] In addition to physician consult, various Internet-based patient directed resources are available to assist in patient education.[48][49]\r\n\r\nList of implantable VAD devices[edit]\r\nAmbox current red.svg\r\nThis section is outdated.

Steven Tsui, Clinical Director of Transplant Services at Papworth Hospital, talks to June Davison about how LVADs can act as a bridge to a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nWhy do some people need a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)?\r\nAn LVAD is a kind of artificial heart pump. It is used to treat people with severe heart failure and is sometimes given to people on the waiting list for a heart transplant. Normally, the left ventricle, one of your heart’s four chambers, pumps blood into your aorta (the large artery leaving the heart) and around your body. In the event that someone has severe heart failure, the heart is too weak to pump enough blood around the body.\r\n\r\nSome patients being considered for a heart transplant may need to have an LVAD implanted if they are unlikely to survive until a suitable donor heart becomes available. The device helps the failing heart and aims to restore normal blood flow.\r\n\r\nIs everyone with heart failure considered for an LVAD?\r\nImplanting an LVAD can be life-saving and buys more time for the patient until we can find a suitable donor heart\r\nHeart failure usually develops because the heart has been damaged by a heart attack, or as a result of other conditions such as cardiomyopathy – a disease of the heart muscle. Some patients who have very severe heart failure, which cannot be managed with medicines or other treatments may be considered for a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nHowever, during the wait for a suitable donor, some patients continue to deteriorate. In these cases, implanting an LVAD can be life-saving and buys more time for the patient until we can find a suitable donor heart.\r\n\r\nHow does an LVAD work?\r\nHaving an LVAD is a big operation and involves open heart surgery. We attach one end of the LVAD pump to the left ventricle and the other end to the aorta. Blood flows from the ventricle into the LVAD. The device pumps the blood out into the aorta, where it then flows to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nA fine cable called the driveline connects the LVAD, which is inside the body, through the skin and to a controller, which is outside the body. The controller senses the function of the LVAD and controls the power to make it work. The controller connects to an external battery pack.\r\n\r\nHow reliable is its battery power?\r\nPeople’s lives depend on their LVADs working properly, so the device needs to be extremely reliable and have built-in safety systems.\r\n\r\nIf the battery starts to run low, an alarm sounds to let the person know that it needs changing. An additional battery is always connected to the controller, so if one battery runs down, there is another to power the LVAD for several more hours. Additionally, there is back-up circuitry in the controller, so if the primary circuitry happens to fail, the back-up system kicks in. Modern LVADs are, therefore, very reliable and can support patients for years.\r\n\r\nPeople can choose how they wear their controller and the two batteries. They can put everything into one pack and carry it as a shoulder bag or rucksack. Or they can separate the components and wear them on a belt with a loop, like you might with a camera or mobile phone.\r\n\r\nEveryone is given a portable charger when they leave hospital, so they can charge the batteries anywhere. They are also given an adapter to plug the charger into a car cigarette lighter, so the battery can be recharged during long journeys.\r\n\r\nLVAD facts\r\nApproximate number of people in the UK currently living with an LVAD 100\r\n\r\nAverage number of hours that an LVAD battery lasts 4-6\r\n\r\nNumber of heart transplants performed in the UK in 2011/12 138\r\n\r\nApproximate number of Britons who have an LVAD implanted each year 80\r\n\r\nWhat difference do LVADs make to your patients’ lives?\r\nMost patients who are considered for an LVAD have a very limited quality of life before the operation. They feel tired, weak and are very breathless. Some have difficulty getting washed and dressed and they might not be able to leave the house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the LVAD is implanted, the blood supply to the body returns to normal, so heart failure symptoms improve. Patients who have been too unwell to walk around are quickly able to get up and about. Many patients can soon return to other normal activities like driving and going on holiday; some of them even return to work.\r\n\r\nHow do LVADs act as a bridge to transplant?\r\nThere can be a long wait for a heart donor, so we may consider an LVAD to keep someone alive and well until a suitable match can be found. Ironically, because many patients get so much better after receiving an LVAD, some become a lower priority on the heart transplant list as a result. This is because there’s often someone sicker (who doesn’t have the device) who is more in need of a transplant.\r\n\r\nThe longest that we’ve supported a patient for with an LVAD has been five and a half years. Nowadays, 80–85 per cent of patients are alive a year after having an LVAD fitted and 70–75 per cent after two years. This is fantastic considering that many of them would only have had a life expectancy of 12 months or less before their LVAD treatment.\r\n\r\nWhat does the future hold?\r\nIn the future, having an LVAD fitted could potentially become an alternative to a heart transplant\r\nTechnology has come an amazingly long way in the past decade, with devices becoming smaller and more sophisticated. We are looking forward to further improvements in battery technology, so that they carry their charge for longer and become smaller, lighter and more portable.\r\n\r\nWe are very excited about the potential of wireless devices becoming available in the next few years. With these, the LVAD, controller and batteries all sit inside the person’s body and the batteries are charged through a coil placed on the surface of their skin. This will be fantastic as there’ll be no driveline outside the body – so we won’t have to worry about it being damaged. In the future, having an LVAD fitted could potentially become an alternative to a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nRead Chris\'s story of having an LVAD\r\n\r\nMending broken hearts\r\nOur Mending Broken Hearts Appeal funds vital research into heart failure.

Note the use of a steel retractor to forcefully maintain the exposure of the patient\'s heart.\r\nICD-9-CM\t35-37\r\nMeSH\tD006348\r\nOPS-301 code:\t5-35...5-37\r\nCardiovascular (heart) surgery is surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons. Frequently, it is done to treat complications of ischemic heart disease (for example, coronary artery bypass grafting), correct congenital heart disease, or treat valvular heart disease from various causes including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis. It also includes heart transplantation.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Risks\r\n1.1 Complication risk reduction\r\n2 History\r\n2.1 Early approaches to heart malformations\r\n2.2 Open heart surgery\r\n2.3 Modern beating-heart surgery\r\n2.4 Minimally invasive surgery\r\n2.5 Pediatric cardiovascular surgery\r\n3 See also\r\n4 References\r\n5 Further reading\r\n6 External links\r\nRisks[edit]\r\nThe development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4â€“6\% mortality rates.[1][2] A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 2â€“3\% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke.[citation needed] A more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called \"pumphead\". The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent,[3] but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment.[4]\r\n\r\nHospital readmissions often occur in cardiac surgery patients; in 2010, approximately 18.5\% of patients who had a heart valve procedure in the United States were readmitted within 30 days of the initial hospitalization.[5]\r\n\r\nIn order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge. Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the CQC website.[6]\r\n\r\nNeuropsychological and psychopathologic changes following open heart surgery have been recognized from the very beginning of modern heart surgery. Variables correlated with nonpsychotic mental disorder after cardiac surgery must be divided into pre-, intra- and postoperative. The incidence, phenomenology, and duration of symptoms diverge from patient to patient, and are difficult to define. One wonders whether any of the patients in either group in this analysis underwent any mechanical cardiac valve replacement. If so, one has to consider Skumin syndrome, described by Victor Skumin in 1978 as a \"cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome\"[7] associated with mechanical heart valve implant and manifested by irrational fear, anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and asthenia.[8][9]\r\n\r\nComplication risk reduction[edit]\r\nA 2012 Cochrane systematic review found evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduced postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery such as pneumonia and atelectasis.[10] In addition, the researchers found that preoperative physical therapy decreased the length of hospital stay (on average by more than three days).[10]\r\n\r\nThere is also evidence that quitting smoking at least four weeks before the date of a surgery may reduce the risk of postoperative complications.[11]\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nThe earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero,[12] Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton and Daniel Hale Williams.[13] The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axillae and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day.[14][15] The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.[16][17]\r\n\r\nSurgery in great vessels (aortic coarctation repair, Blalock-Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery.\r\n\r\nEarly approaches to heart malformations[edit]\r\nIn 1925, operations on the heart valves were unknown. Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years[18] but Souttar\'s physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue.[19][20]\r\n\r\nCardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1948, four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy (1914â€“1948) of Charlotte, revived an operation due to Dr Dwight Harken of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve. Charles Bailey (1910â€“1993) at the Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, Dwight Harken in Boston and Russell Brock at Guy\'s Hospital all adopted Souttar\'s method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar\'s technique was widely adopted although there were modifications.[19][20]\r\n\r\nIn 1947, Thomas Holmes Sellors (1902â€“1987) of the Middlesex Hospital operated on a Fallot\'s Tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellor\'s work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later, in 1948, he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with Fallot\'s Tetralogy. Many thousands of these \"blind\" operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.[19]\r\n\r\nOpen heart surgery[edit]\r\nOpen heart surgery is a surgery in which the patient\'s heart is open and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was soon discovered by Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by Dr. C. Walton Lillehei and Dr. F. John Lewis at the University of Minnesota on September 2, 1952. The following year, Soviet surgeon Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia. During this surgery, the heart is exposed and the patient\'s blood is made to bypass it.[citation needed]\r\n\r\n\r\nCardiac surgical procedure at Gemelli Hospital in Rome\r\nSurgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia: complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the brain. The patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method, hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass. Dr. John Heysham Gibbon at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Dr. Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient\'s mother or father was used as a \'heart-lung machine\'. Dr. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nNazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963.[21] In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age 3 1â?„2, using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Dr. Zuhdi performed Oklahoma\'s first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, a cancer sufferer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery.[22]\r\n\r\nModern beating-heart surgery[edit]\r\nSince the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform \"Off-pump\" â€“ coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH).[citation needed]\r\n\r\nSome researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as postperfusion syndrome, and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon\'s preference and hospital results still play a major role.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nMinimally invasive surgery[edit]\r\nA new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robot-assisted heart surgery. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robot\'s much smaller hands to get through.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPediatric cardiovascular surgery[edit]\r\nPediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children. Russell M. Nelson performed the first successful pediatric cardiac operation at the Salt Lake General Hospital in March 1956, a total repair of tetralogy of Fallot in a four-year-old girl.[23]\r\n\r\nSee also[edit]\r\nCardioplegia\r\nEagle score\r\nReferences[edit]\r\nJump up ^ Stark J; Gallivan S; Lovegrove J et al.
