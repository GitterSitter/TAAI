Gastrointestinal (GI)      bleeding has been frequently reported within this population. METHODS: A      retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from      January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and      management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was      conducted to identify related risk factors. RESULTS: A significant incidence of      GI bleeding (22.8\%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93\%)       population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from       the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54\% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37\% from      ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35\% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI)      tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95\% CI, 2.2-228.6;      p=0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9;      p=0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were      independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in      older patients (mean, 70 years; p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60\%) rebled      from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding      anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide       did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates,      length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct       consequence of GI bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors account for GI bleeding      in patients on CF-VADs. A previous history of bleeding increases risk      significantly and warrants careful monitoring.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

VADs may serve as a bridge to heart transplantation or as permanent      circulatory assistance, also referred to as destination therapy. There is a      paucity of information regarding the nutrition complications in VAD patients, and      as such, little is presently known of the optimal means of nutrition assessment      and management of these complex and often critically ill patients. In this      review, a general overview of the VAD, comparisons of nutrition assessment      measures, and strategies to meet the nutrition needs of these patients are      provided using evidence-based information wherever possible. Because there is a      lack of nutrition studies and assessment guidelines specifically for VAD      patients, many of the guidelines for care of these patients are currently based      on the information available for the care of patients with heart failure.      Although the optimal measure to assess nutrition status remains poorly studied, a      systematic, thorough nutrition assessment of patients with heart failure and      heart transplant candidates prior to VAD placement appears to be important to      identify those at nutrition risk and, with appropriate nutrition therapy,      decrease their risk for morbidity and mortality.

Quality of life (QoL) has      not been systematically evaluated in children bridged to heart transplant.      METHODS: All children transplanted for cardiomyopathy during 2001 to 2008 and      currently being followed at our center (n = 84) had QoL assessed during 2006 to      2009, at a median of 3 years post-transplant, using a validated generic measure      (PedsQL4.0). RESULTS: Twenty-six children, aged 2.7 to 18 (median 7.4) years who       were bridged to transplant, were compared with 58 children, aged 2.0 to 18.0      (median 13.0) years, who were transplanted in the same era without bridging.      There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any domains of QoL       assessed by children or parents, although the small number of bridged patients      increases the likelihood of a Type II error. Bridged children who were younger (r      = 0.48, p = 0.02) or more recently transplanted (r = 0.42, p = 0.04) were scored       by their parents as having poorer emotional QoL. Regression analysis indicated      that age at transplant was the only medical or demographic variable associated      with parent-reported total QoL scores (beta = 0.27, p = 0.01). With few links      between QoL scores and medical or demographic factors, other subjective      psychologic factors may be of greater salience in determining QoL. CONCLUSIONS:      Despite greater severity of illness, children who required mechanical bridging to      transplantation report a QoL comparable to that of other children undergoing      heart transplantation. Younger children may require greater psychologic support      to reach their full potential in terms of QoL.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

This study aims to describe our      center\'s multidisciplinary team management of single-ventricle patients supported      long term with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric VAD. Patient #1 was a 4-year-old       with double-outlet right ventricle with aortic atresia, L-looped ventricles, and       heart block who developed heart failure 1 year after Fontan. She initially      required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and was transitioned to      Berlin Heart systemic VAD. She was supported for 363 days (cardiac intensive care      unit [CICU] 335 days, floor 28 days). The postoperative course was complicated by      intermittent infection including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,      intermittent hepatic and renal insufficiencies, and transient antithrombin,      protein C, and protein S deficiencies resulting in multiple thrombi. She had a      total of five pump changes over 10 months. Long-term medical management included       anticoagulation with enoxaparin, platelet inhibition with aspirin and      dipyridamole, and antibiotic prophylaxis using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. She      developed sepsis of unknown etiology and subsequently died from multiorgan      failure. Patient #2 was a 4-year-old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who      developed heart failure 2 years after bidirectional Glenn shunt. At systemic VAD       implantation, he was intubated with renal insufficiency. Post-VAD implantation,      his renal insufficiency resolved, and he was successfully extubated to daytime      nasal cannula and biphasic positive airway pressure at night. He was supported      for 270 days (CICU 143 days, floor 127 days). The pump was upsized to a 50-mL      pump in May 2011 for increased central venous pressures (29 mm Hg).

However, thromboembolic      events, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. We      retrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)      in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in a      pediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March      31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),      median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a left      VAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwent      heart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient is      still on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days of      assistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of nine      patients (56\%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When compared      with noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median      131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care       unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and a      longer length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR      34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced for      thromboembolic issues, most of them (67\%) in patients with VAD-related      infections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BH      endocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,      12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venous      catheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinary      catheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanical      ventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Of      the 17 isolated pathogens, 53\% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence of      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3\%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25\%),      three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50\% of all isolated pseudomonads),      and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients with      infected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospital      with increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.

Case study.PG  - 537-40LID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments for      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right time      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function       of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular      afterload. The experimental implantation of an innovative Religa Heart EXT      prosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. Too short time      of Religa Heart EXT implantation in the discussed patient prevented the      possibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications and      infections compared to the documented complications of POLVAD implanted until      now. OHT is a safe and efficacious method of treatment of patients previously      supported by ECMO and Religa Heart EXT.FAU - Religa, GrzegorzAU  - Religa GAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Institute of Cardiology,      Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Jasinska, MalgorzataAU  - Jasinska MAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Czyzewski, LukaszAU  - Czyzewski LAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Torba, KrzysztofAU  - Torba KAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Rozanski, JacekAU  - Rozanski JAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Institute of Cardiology,      Warsaw, Poland.LA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20141021PL  - PolandTA  - Ann TransplantJT  - Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation SocietyJID - 9802544SB  - IMMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/physiopathology/surgery/therapyMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/instrumentationMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*surgery/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - PolandMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/prevention & controlEDAT- 2014/10/22 06:00MHDA- 2015/05/12 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/22 06:00AID - 891266 [pii]AID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Ann Transplant. 2014 Oct 21;19:537-40. doi: 10.12659/AOT.891266.- 25330851own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20141021dcom- 20150511is  - 2329-0358 (electronic)is  - 1425-9524 (linking)vi  - 19dp  - 2014ti  - the effect of the sequential therapy in end-stage heart failure (eshf)--from      ecmo, through the use of implantable pump for a pneumatic heart assist system,      religa heart ext, as a bridge for orthotopic heart transplant (oht). case study.pg  - 537-40lid - 10.12659/aot.891266 [doi]ab  - background: modern polish medicine offers patients various treatments for      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. methods applied at the right time      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for      survival and prolong life. case report: here, we report on the safety and      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (dcm). a 7-day mechanical blood      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ecmo),      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, religa      heart ext, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant      (oht). on day 40 after oht, the patient was discharged home with stable function       of the circulatory system. we describe our experiences with the qualification,      preparation, and procedure of sequential ecmo, religa heart ext, and oht.      conclusions: application of short-term ecmo as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular      afterload. the experimental implantation of an innovative religa heart ext      prosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. too short time      of religa heart ext implantation in the discussed patient prevented the      possibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications and      infections compared to the documented complications of polvad implanted until      now. oht is a safe and efficacious method of treatment of patients previously      supported by ecmo and religa heart ext.fau - religa, grzegorzau  - religa gad  - department of cardiac surgery and transplantation, institute of cardiology,      warsaw, poland.fau - jasinska, malgorzataau  - jasinska mad  - department of anaesthesiology, institute of cardiology, warsaw, poland.fau - czyzewski, lukaszau  - czyzewski lad  - department of anaesthesiology, institute of cardiology, warsaw, poland.fau - torba, krzysztofau  - torba kad  - department of anaesthesiology, institute of cardiology, warsaw, poland.fau - rozanski, jacekau  - rozanski jad  - department of cardiac surgery and transplantation, institute of cardiology,      warsaw, poland.la  - engpt  - case reportspt  - journal articledep - 20141021pl  - polandta  - ann transplantjt  - annals of transplantation : quarterly of the polish transplantation societyjid - 9802544sb  - immh  - cardiomyopathy, dilated/physiopathology/surgery/therapymh  - *extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/instrumentationmh  - heart failure/physiopathology/*surgery/*therapymh  - *heart transplantationmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - polandmh  - prosthesis designmh  - shock, cardiogenic/prevention & controledat- 2014/10/22 06:00mhda- 2015/05/12 06:00crdt- 2014/10/22 06:00aid - 891266 [pii]aid - 10.12659/aot.891266 [doi]pst - epublishso  - ann transplant. 2014 oct 21;19:537-40. doi: 10.12659/aot.891266.',?
