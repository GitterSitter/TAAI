'\r\nVentricular assist device\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\nVentricular assist device\r\nIntervention\r\nVentricular assist device.png\r\nA left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pumping blood from the left ventricle to the aorta, connected to an externally worn control unit and battery pack.\r\nMedlinePlus\t007268\r\nA ventricular assist device (VAD) is an electromechanical circulatory device that is used to partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart. The function of VADs differs from that of artificial cardiac pacemakers. Some VADs are intended for short term use, typically for patients recovering from heart attacks or heart surgery, while others are intended for long-term use (months to years and in some cases for life), typically for patients suffering from advanced congestive heart failure.\r\n\r\nVADs are distinct from artificial hearts, which are designed to completely take over cardiac function and generally require the removal of the patient\'s heart. VADs are designed to assist either the right (RVAD) or left (LVAD) ventricle, or both at once (BiVAD). The type that is used depends primarily on the underlying heart disease and the pulmonary arterial resistance that determines the load on the right ventricle.\r\n\r\nLVADs are most commonly used, but when pulmonary arterial resistance is high, right ventricular assistance may become necessary. Long term VADs are normally used to keep patients alive with a good quality of life while they wait for a heart transplantation (known as a \"bridge to transplantation\"). However, LVADs are sometimes used as destination therapy, meaning they will never undergo heart transplant, and sometimes as a bridge to recovery.[1][2]\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, VADs have improved significantly in terms of providing survival and quality of life among recipients.[3]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Design\r\n1.1 Pumps\r\n2 History\r\n3 Studies and outcomes\r\n3.1 Recent developments\r\n3.2 HeartMate II LVAD pivotal study\r\n3.3 HARPS\r\n3.4 REMATCH\r\n4 Complications and side effects\r\n5 List of implantable VAD devices\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nDesign[edit]\r\n\r\nClose-up illustration of typical left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nPumps[edit]\r\nThe pumps used in VADs can be divided into two main categories â€“ pulsatile pumps, that mimic the natural pulsing action of the heart, and continuous flow pumps.[4] Pulsatile VADs use positive displacement pumps. In some of these pumps, the volume occupied by blood varies during the pumping cycle, and if the pump is contained inside the body then a vent tube to the outside air is required.\r\n\r\nContinuous flow VADs are smaller and have proven to be more durable than pulsatile VADs.[5] They normally use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of the rotor\'s axis.[6]\r\n\r\nAn important issue with continuous flow pumps is the method used to suspend the rotor. Early versions used solid bearings; however, newer pumps, some of which are approved for use in the EU, use either electromagnetic suspension (\"maglev\")[7][8][9][10] or hydrodynamic suspension. These pumps contain only one moving part.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\n\r\n1966 DeBakey ventricular assist device.[11]\r\nThe first successful implantation of a left ventricular assist device was completed in 1966 by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey to a 37-year old woman. A paracorporeal (external) circuit was able to provide mechanical support for 10 days after the surgery.[12] The first successful long-term implantation of an artificial LVAD was conducted in 1988 by Dr. William F. Bernhard of Boston Children\'s Hospital Medical Center and Thermedics, Inc of Woburn, MA under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research contract which developed Heart-mate, an electronically controlled assist device. This was funded by a three year $6.2 million contract to Thermedics and Children\'s Hospital, Boston MA from the National Heart and Lung and Blood Institute, a program of NIH.[13] The early VADs emulated the heart by using a \"pulsatile\" action where blood is alternately sucked into the pump from the left ventricle then forced out into the aorta. Devices of this kind include the HeartMate IP LVAS, which was approved for use in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 1994. These devices are commonly referred to as first generation VADs.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nMore recent work has concentrated on continuous flow pumps, which can be roughly categorized as either centrifugal pumps or axial flow impeller driven pumps. These pumps have the advantage of greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability. These devices are referred to as second generation VADs. A side effect is that the user will not have a pulse, or that the pulse intensity will be seriously reduced[citation needed].\r\n\r\nThird generation VADs suspend the impeller in the pump using either hydrodynamic or electromagnetic suspension, thus removing the need for bearings and reducing the number of moving parts to one.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nAnother technology undergoing clinical trials is the use of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using percutaneous cables. Apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action. A pulsatile pump using this technology has CE Mark approval and is in clinical trials for US FDA approval.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nA very different approach in the early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta. Inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand â€“ in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle. A proposed refinement is to use the patient\'s skeletal muscle, driven by a pacemaker, to power this device which would make it truly self-contained. However a similar operation (cardiomyoplasty) was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results. In any case, it has substantial potential advantages in avoiding the need to operate on the heart itself and in avoiding any contact between blood and the device. This approach involves a return to a pulsatile flow.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPeter Houghton was the longest surviving recipient of a VAD for permanent use. He received an experimental Jarvik 2000 LVAD in June 2000. Since then, he completed a 91-mile charity walk, published two books, lectured widely, hiked in the Swiss Alps and the American West, flew in an ultra-light aircraft, and traveled extensively around the world. He died of acute renal failure in 2007 at the age of 69.[14][15]\r\n\r\nStudies and outcomes[edit]\r\nRecent developments[edit]\r\nIn July 2009 in England, surgeons removed a donor heart that had been implanted in a toddler next to her native heart, after her native heart had recovered. This technique suggests mechanical assist device, such as an LVAD, can take some or all the work away from the native heart and allow it time to heal.[16]\r\nIn July 2009, 18-month follow-up results from the HeartMate II Clinical Trial concluded that continuous-flow LVAD provides effective hemodynamic support for at least 18 months in patients awaiting transplantation, with improved functional status and quality of life. (see below).[17]\r\nHeidelberg University Hospital reported in July 2009 that the first HeartAssist5, known as the modern version of the DeBakey VAD, was implanted there. The HeartAssist5 weighs 92 grams, is made of titanium and plastic, and serves to pump blood from the left ventricle into the aorta.[18]\r\nA phase 1 clinical trial is underway (as of August 2009), consisting of patients with coronary artery bypass grafting and patients in end-stage heart failure who have a left ventricular assist device. The trial involves testing a patch, called Anginera(TM) that contains cells that secrete hormone-like growth factors that stimulate other cells to grow. The patches are seeded with heart muscle cells and then implanted onto the heart with the goal of getting the muscle cells to start communicating with native tissues in a way that allows for regular contractions.[19][20]\r\nIn September 2009, a New Zealand news outlet, Stuff, reported that in another 18 months to two years, a new wireless device will be ready for clinical trial that will power VADs without direct contact. If successful, this may reduce the chance of infection as a result of the power cable through the skin.[21]\r\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a $2.8 million grant to develop a \"pulse-less\" total artificial heart using two VADS by Micromed, initially created by Michael DeBakey and George Noon. The grant was renewed for a second year of research in August 2009. The Total Artificial Heart was created using two HeartAssist5 VADs, whereby one VAD pumps blood throughout the body and the other circulates blood to and from the lungs.[22]\r\nHeartWare International announced in August 2009 that it had surpassed 50 implants of their HeartWare Ventricular Assist System in their ADVANCE Clinical Trial, an FDA-approved IDE study. The study is to assess the system as bridge-to-transplantation system for patients with end-stage heart failure. The study, Evaluation of the HeartWare LVAD System for the Treatment of Advance Heart Failure, is a multi-center study that started in May 2009.[23][24]\r\nOn June 27, 2014 Hannover Medical School in Hannover, Germany performed the first human implant of HeartMate III under the direction of Professor Axel Haverich M.D., chief of the Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery Department and surgeon Jan Schmitto, M.D., Ph.D.[25]\r\nOn January 21, 2015 a study was published in Journal of American College of Cardiology suggesting that long-term use of LVAD may induce heart regeneration.[26] This may explain the bridge to recovery phenomenon first described by the Yacoub group in NEJM in 2009 (above).\r\nThe majority of VADs on the market today are somewhat bulky. The smallest device approved by the FDA, the HeartMate II, weighs about 1 pound (0.45 kg) and measures 3 inches (7.6 cm). This has proven particularly important for women and children, for whom alternatives would have been too large.[27]\r\n\r\nOne device gained CE Mark approval for use in the EU and began clinical trials in the US (VentrAssist). As of June 2007 these pumps had been implanted in over 100 patients. In 2009, Ventracor was placed into the hands of Administrators due to financial problems and was later that year liquidated. No other companies purchased the technology, so as a result the VentrAssist device was essentially defunct. Around 30â€“50 patients worldwide remain supported on VentrAssist devices as of January 2010.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe Heartware HVAD works similarly to the VentrAssist â€“ albeit much smaller and not requiring an abdominal pocket to be implanted into. The device has obtained CE Mark in Europe, and FDA approval in the U.S. Recently, it was shown that the Heartware HVAD can be implanted through limited access without sternotomy.[28]\r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases left ventricular assist devices, combined with drug therapy, have enabled the heart to recover sufficiently for the device to be able to be removed (explanted).[1][2]\r\n\r\nHeartMate II LVAD pivotal study[edit]\r\nA series of studies involving the use of the of HeartMate II LVAD have proven useful in establishing the viability and risks of using LVADs for bridge-to-transplantation and destination therapy.\r\n\r\nThe pilot trial for the HeartMate II LVAS began in November 2003 and consisted of 46 study patients at 15 centers. Results included 11 patients supported for more than one year and three patients supported for more than two years.\r\nThe HeartMate II pivotal trial began in 2005 and included the evaluation of HeartMate II for two indications: Bridge to transplantation (BTT) and destination therapy (DT), or long-term, permanent support. Thoratec Corp. announced that this was the first time the FDA had approved a clinical trial to include both indications in one protocol.[29][30][31]\r\nA multicenter study in the United States from 2005 to 2007 with 113 patients (of which 100 reported principal outcomes) showed that significant improvements in function were prevalent after three months, and a survival rate of 68\% after twelve months.[32]\r\nBased on one-year follow up data from the first 194 patients enrolled in the trial, the FDA approved HeartMate II for bridge-to-transplantation. The trial provided clinical evidence of improved survival rates and quality of life for a broad range of patients.[33][34]\r\nEighteen-month follow up data on 281 patients who had either reached the study end-point or completed 18 months of post-operative follow-up showed improved survival, less frequent adverse events and greater reliability with continuous flow LVADS compared to pulsatile flow devices. Of the 281 patients, 157 patients had undergone transplant, 58 patients were continuing with LVADs in their body and seven patients had the LVAD removed because their heart recovered; the remaining 56 had died. The results showed that the NYHA Class of heart failure the patients had been designated had significantly improved after six months of LVAD support compared to the pre-LVAD baseline. Although this trial involved bridge-to-transplant indication, the results provide early evidence that continuous flow LVADs have advantages in terms of durability and reliability for patients receiving mechanical support for destination therapy.[35]\r\nFollowing the FDA approval of HeartMate II LVAD for bridge-to-transplantation purposes, a post-approval (\"registry\") study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of the device in a commercial setting. The study found that the device improved outcomes, both compared to other LVAD treatments and baseline patients. Specifically, HeartMate II patients showed lower creatinine levels, 30-day survival rates were considerably higher at 96\%, and 93\% reached successful outcomes (transplant, cardiac recovery, or long-term LVAD).[36]\r\nHARPS[edit]\r\nThe Harefield Recovery Protocol Study (HARPS) is a clinical trial to evaluate whether advanced heart failure patients requiring VAD support can recover sufficient myocardial function to allow device removal (known as explantation). HARPS combines an LVAD (the HeartMate XVE) with conventional oral heart failure medications, followed by the novel Î²2 agonist clenbuterol. This opens the possibility that some advanced heart failure patients may forgo heart transplantation.[37]\r\n\r\nTo date, 73\% (11 of 15) of patients who underwent the combination therapy regimen demonstrated sufficient recovery to allow explantation and avoid heart transplantation; freedom from recurrent heart failure in surviving patients was 100\% and 89\% at one and four years after explantation, respectively; average ejection fraction was 64\% at 59 months after explantation â€“ all patients were NYHA Class I; and no significant adverse effects were reported with clenbuterol therapy.\r\n\r\nREMATCH[edit]\r\nThe REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure) clinical trial began in May 1998 and ran through July 2001 in 20 cardiac transplant centers around the USA. The trial was designed to compare long-term implantation of left ventricular assist devices with optimal medical management for patients with end-stage heart failure who require, but do not qualify to receive cardiac transplantation. As a result of the clinical outcomes, the device received FDA approval for both indications, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.[38]\r\n\r\nThe trial demonstrated an 81\% improvement in two-year survival among patients receiving HeartMate XVE compared to optimal medical management. In addition, a destination therapy study following the REMATCH trial demonstrated an additional 17\% improvement (61\% vs. 52\%) in one-year survival of patients that were implanted with a VAD (HeartMate XVE), with an implication for the appropriate selection of candidates and timing of VAD implantation.\r\n\r\nA test carried out in 2001 by Dr. Eric A. Rose and REMATCH study group with patients with congestive heart failure that were ineligible for a transplant showed a survival at two years of 23\% for those implanted with an LVAD compared with 8\% for those who were treated with drugs. The two major complications of VAD implantation were infection and mechanical failure (see below).\r\n\r\nAccording to a retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated with a left ventricular assist device versus inotrope therapy while awaiting heart transplantation, the group treated with LVAD had improved clinical and metabolic function at the time of transplant with better blood pressure, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. After transplant, 57.7\% of the inotrope group had renal failure versus 16.6\% in the LVAD group; 31.6\% of the inotrope group had right heart failure versus 5.6\% in the LVAD group; and event-free survival was 15.8\% in the inotrope group versus 55.6\% in the LVAD group.[39]\r\n\r\nComplications and side effects[edit]\r\nEarly postoperative bleeding complications are a major cause of morbidity and reoperation in LVAD patients.[40] Bleeding is the most common postoperative early complication after implantation or explantation of LVADs, necessitating reoperation in up to 60\% of recipients.[41] The implications of massive blood transfusions are great and include infection, pulmonary insufficiency, increased costs, right heart failure, allosensitization, and viral transmission, some of which can prove fatal or preclude transplantation.[41] When bleeding occurs, it impacts the one year Kaplan-Meier mortality.[40] In addition to complexity of the patient population and the complexity of these procedures contributing to bleeding, the devices themselves may contribute to the severe coagulopathy that can ensue when these devices are implanted.[42] Critical in the management of bleeding in the early hours after implantation or explantation is to adequately evacuate the post-surgical blood from around the heart and lungs to prevent retained blood from contributing to the need for reoperation to wash out clot that can compress the device features and contribute to post operative shock. Preventing chest tube clogging during this period is critical to recovery.[41]\r\n\r\nBecause the devices generally result in blood flowing over a non-biologic surface, predisposing the blood to clotting, there is need for anticoagulation measures. One device, the HeartMate XVE, is designed with a biologic surface derived from fibrin and does not require long term anticoagulation (except aspirin); unfortunately, this biologic surface may also predispose the patient to infection through selective reduction of certain types of leukocytes.[43]\r\n\r\nNew VAD designs which are now approved for use in the European Community and are undergoing trials for FDA approval have all but eliminated mechanical failure.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nVAD-related infection can be caused by a large number of different organisms:[44]\r\n\r\nGram positive bacteria (Staphylococci, especially Staph. aureus, Enterococci)\r\nGram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, Klebsiella species)\r\nFungi. especially Candida species\r\nTreatment of VAD-related infection is exceedingly difficult and many patients die of infection despite optimal treatment. Initial treatment should be with broad spectrum antibiotics, but every effort must be made to obtain appropriate samples for culture. A final decision regarding antibiotic therapy must be based on the results of microbiogical cultures.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nOther problems include immunosuppression, clotting with resultant stroke, and bleeding secondary to anticoagulation. Some of the polyurethane components used in the devices cause the deletion of a subset of immune cells when blood comes in contact with them. This predisposes the patient to fungal and some viral infections necessitating appropriate prophylactic therapy.[45]\r\n\r\nConsidering the multitude of risks and lifestyle modifications associated with ventricular assist device implant,[46] it is important for prospective patients to be informed prior to decision making.[47] In addition to physician consult, various Internet-based patient directed resources are available to assist in patient education.[48][49]\r\n\r\nList of implantable VAD devices[edit]\r\nAmbox current red.svg\r\nThis section is outdated.

Steven Tsui, Clinical Director of Transplant Services at Papworth Hospital, talks to June Davison about how LVADs can act as a bridge to a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nWhy do some people need a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)?\r\nAn LVAD is a kind of artificial heart pump. It is used to treat people with severe heart failure and is sometimes given to people on the waiting list for a heart transplant. Normally, the left ventricle, one of your heart’s four chambers, pumps blood into your aorta (the large artery leaving the heart) and around your body. In the event that someone has severe heart failure, the heart is too weak to pump enough blood around the body.\r\n\r\nSome patients being considered for a heart transplant may need to have an LVAD implanted if they are unlikely to survive until a suitable donor heart becomes available. The device helps the failing heart and aims to restore normal blood flow.\r\n\r\nIs everyone with heart failure considered for an LVAD?\r\nImplanting an LVAD can be life-saving and buys more time for the patient until we can find a suitable donor heart\r\nHeart failure usually develops because the heart has been damaged by a heart attack, or as a result of other conditions such as cardiomyopathy – a disease of the heart muscle. Some patients who have very severe heart failure, which cannot be managed with medicines or other treatments may be considered for a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nHowever, during the wait for a suitable donor, some patients continue to deteriorate. In these cases, implanting an LVAD can be life-saving and buys more time for the patient until we can find a suitable donor heart.\r\n\r\nHow does an LVAD work?\r\nHaving an LVAD is a big operation and involves open heart surgery. We attach one end of the LVAD pump to the left ventricle and the other end to the aorta. Blood flows from the ventricle into the LVAD. The device pumps the blood out into the aorta, where it then flows to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nA fine cable called the driveline connects the LVAD, which is inside the body, through the skin and to a controller, which is outside the body. The controller senses the function of the LVAD and controls the power to make it work. The controller connects to an external battery pack.\r\n\r\nHow reliable is its battery power?\r\nPeople’s lives depend on their LVADs working properly, so the device needs to be extremely reliable and have built-in safety systems.\r\n\r\nIf the battery starts to run low, an alarm sounds to let the person know that it needs changing. An additional battery is always connected to the controller, so if one battery runs down, there is another to power the LVAD for several more hours. Additionally, there is back-up circuitry in the controller, so if the primary circuitry happens to fail, the back-up system kicks in. Modern LVADs are, therefore, very reliable and can support patients for years.\r\n\r\nPeople can choose how they wear their controller and the two batteries. They can put everything into one pack and carry it as a shoulder bag or rucksack. Or they can separate the components and wear them on a belt with a loop, like you might with a camera or mobile phone.\r\n\r\nEveryone is given a portable charger when they leave hospital, so they can charge the batteries anywhere. They are also given an adapter to plug the charger into a car cigarette lighter, so the battery can be recharged during long journeys.\r\n\r\nLVAD facts\r\nApproximate number of people in the UK currently living with an LVAD 100\r\n\r\nAverage number of hours that an LVAD battery lasts 4-6\r\n\r\nNumber of heart transplants performed in the UK in 2011/12 138\r\n\r\nApproximate number of Britons who have an LVAD implanted each year 80\r\n\r\nWhat difference do LVADs make to your patients’ lives?\r\nMost patients who are considered for an LVAD have a very limited quality of life before the operation. They feel tired, weak and are very breathless. Some have difficulty getting washed and dressed and they might not be able to leave the house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the LVAD is implanted, the blood supply to the body returns to normal, so heart failure symptoms improve. Patients who have been too unwell to walk around are quickly able to get up and about. Many patients can soon return to other normal activities like driving and going on holiday; some of them even return to work.\r\n\r\nHow do LVADs act as a bridge to transplant?\r\nThere can be a long wait for a heart donor, so we may consider an LVAD to keep someone alive and well until a suitable match can be found. Ironically, because many patients get so much better after receiving an LVAD, some become a lower priority on the heart transplant list as a result. This is because there’s often someone sicker (who doesn’t have the device) who is more in need of a transplant.\r\n\r\nThe longest that we’ve supported a patient for with an LVAD has been five and a half years. Nowadays, 80–85 per cent of patients are alive a year after having an LVAD fitted and 70–75 per cent after two years. This is fantastic considering that many of them would only have had a life expectancy of 12 months or less before their LVAD treatment.\r\n\r\nWhat does the future hold?\r\nIn the future, having an LVAD fitted could potentially become an alternative to a heart transplant\r\nTechnology has come an amazingly long way in the past decade, with devices becoming smaller and more sophisticated. We are looking forward to further improvements in battery technology, so that they carry their charge for longer and become smaller, lighter and more portable.\r\n\r\nWe are very excited about the potential of wireless devices becoming available in the next few years. With these, the LVAD, controller and batteries all sit inside the person’s body and the batteries are charged through a coil placed on the surface of their skin. This will be fantastic as there’ll be no driveline outside the body – so we won’t have to worry about it being damaged. In the future, having an LVAD fitted could potentially become an alternative to a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nRead Chris\'s story of having an LVAD\r\n\r\nMending broken hearts\r\nOur Mending Broken Hearts Appeal funds vital research into heart failure.

Note the use of a steel retractor to forcefully maintain the exposure of the patient\'s heart.\r\nICD-9-CM\t35-37\r\nMeSH\tD006348\r\nOPS-301 code:\t5-35...5-37\r\nCardiovascular (heart) surgery is surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons. Frequently, it is done to treat complications of ischemic heart disease (for example, coronary artery bypass grafting), correct congenital heart disease, or treat valvular heart disease from various causes including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis. It also includes heart transplantation.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Risks\r\n1.1 Complication risk reduction\r\n2 History\r\n2.1 Early approaches to heart malformations\r\n2.2 Open heart surgery\r\n2.3 Modern beating-heart surgery\r\n2.4 Minimally invasive surgery\r\n2.5 Pediatric cardiovascular surgery\r\n3 See also\r\n4 References\r\n5 Further reading\r\n6 External links\r\nRisks[edit]\r\nThe development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4â€“6\% mortality rates.[1][2] A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 2â€“3\% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke.[citation needed] A more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called \"pumphead\". The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent,[3] but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment.[4]\r\n\r\nHospital readmissions often occur in cardiac surgery patients; in 2010, approximately 18.5\% of patients who had a heart valve procedure in the United States were readmitted within 30 days of the initial hospitalization.[5]\r\n\r\nIn order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge. Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the CQC website.[6]\r\n\r\nNeuropsychological and psychopathologic changes following open heart surgery have been recognized from the very beginning of modern heart surgery. Variables correlated with nonpsychotic mental disorder after cardiac surgery must be divided into pre-, intra- and postoperative. The incidence, phenomenology, and duration of symptoms diverge from patient to patient, and are difficult to define. One wonders whether any of the patients in either group in this analysis underwent any mechanical cardiac valve replacement. If so, one has to consider Skumin syndrome, described by Victor Skumin in 1978 as a \"cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome\"[7] associated with mechanical heart valve implant and manifested by irrational fear, anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and asthenia.[8][9]\r\n\r\nComplication risk reduction[edit]\r\nA 2012 Cochrane systematic review found evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduced postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery such as pneumonia and atelectasis.[10] In addition, the researchers found that preoperative physical therapy decreased the length of hospital stay (on average by more than three days).[10]\r\n\r\nThere is also evidence that quitting smoking at least four weeks before the date of a surgery may reduce the risk of postoperative complications.[11]\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nThe earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero,[12] Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton and Daniel Hale Williams.[13] The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axillae and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day.[14][15] The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.[16][17]\r\n\r\nSurgery in great vessels (aortic coarctation repair, Blalock-Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery.\r\n\r\nEarly approaches to heart malformations[edit]\r\nIn 1925, operations on the heart valves were unknown. Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years[18] but Souttar\'s physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue.[19][20]\r\n\r\nCardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1948, four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy (1914â€“1948) of Charlotte, revived an operation due to Dr Dwight Harken of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve. Charles Bailey (1910â€“1993) at the Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, Dwight Harken in Boston and Russell Brock at Guy\'s Hospital all adopted Souttar\'s method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar\'s technique was widely adopted although there were modifications.[19][20]\r\n\r\nIn 1947, Thomas Holmes Sellors (1902â€“1987) of the Middlesex Hospital operated on a Fallot\'s Tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellor\'s work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later, in 1948, he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with Fallot\'s Tetralogy. Many thousands of these \"blind\" operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.[19]\r\n\r\nOpen heart surgery[edit]\r\nOpen heart surgery is a surgery in which the patient\'s heart is open and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was soon discovered by Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by Dr. C. Walton Lillehei and Dr. F. John Lewis at the University of Minnesota on September 2, 1952. The following year, Soviet surgeon Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia. During this surgery, the heart is exposed and the patient\'s blood is made to bypass it.[citation needed]\r\n\r\n\r\nCardiac surgical procedure at Gemelli Hospital in Rome\r\nSurgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia: complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the brain. The patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method, hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass. Dr. John Heysham Gibbon at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Dr. Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient\'s mother or father was used as a \'heart-lung machine\'. Dr. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nNazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963.[21] In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age 3 1â?„2, using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Dr. Zuhdi performed Oklahoma\'s first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, a cancer sufferer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery.[22]\r\n\r\nModern beating-heart surgery[edit]\r\nSince the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform \"Off-pump\" â€“ coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH).[citation needed]\r\n\r\nSome researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as postperfusion syndrome, and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon\'s preference and hospital results still play a major role.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nMinimally invasive surgery[edit]\r\nA new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robot-assisted heart surgery. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robot\'s much smaller hands to get through.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPediatric cardiovascular surgery[edit]\r\nPediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children. Russell M. Nelson performed the first successful pediatric cardiac operation at the Salt Lake General Hospital in March 1956, a total repair of tetralogy of Fallot in a four-year-old girl.[23]\r\n\r\nSee also[edit]\r\nCardioplegia\r\nEagle score\r\nReferences[edit]\r\nJump up ^ Stark J; Gallivan S; Lovegrove J et al.

However, it\'s recommended when the doctor can identify a correctable problem that\'s causing heart failure – such as a defect or a blocked coronary artery. Today, doctors are able to correct many problems by implanting devices.\r\n\r\nvalve surgeryValve replacement\r\n\r\nHeart failure is sometimes caused by a defective or diseased heart valve. Heart valves regulate the flow of blood inside the heart. When they don\'t work properly, this puts extra strain on the heart and can lead to heart failure. Correcting the problem surgically can often improve or resolve the condition.\r\n\r\nA variety of different replacement valves can be used: a mechanical valve made from metal and plastic, one made from human or animal tissue. During the surgery, the patient is connected to a heart-lung machine that supplies blood to the brain and body. The bad valve is removed and replaced.\r\n\r\nAfter the operation and depending on the type of replacement heart valve used, patients may take medicines to prevent blood clots from forming around the new heart valve. This treatment is often long-term to ensure the new valve works properly. Most heart valve surgeries are a success, but the operation is only considered as an option when a defective or diseased valve threatens someone\'s life. Read more about heart valve surgery.\r\n\r\nDefibrillator implantation\r\nSome people who have severe heart failure or serious arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) are candidates for implantable defibrillators. These devices are surgically placed and deliver pacing, or an electric countershock, to the heart when a life-threatening abnormal rhythm is detected.\r\nLearn more about implantable devices\r\n\r\nLeft ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nWhat is a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)? \r\nThe left ventricle is the large, muscular chamber of the heart that pumps blood out to the body. A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a battery-operated, mechanical pump-type device that\'s surgically implanted. It helps maintain the pumping ability of a heart that can\'t effectively work on its own.\r\n\r\nThese devices are available in most heart transplant centers.\r\nWhen is an LVAD used?\r\nThis device is sometimes called a \"bridge to transplant,\" but is now used in long-term therapy. People awaiting a heart transplant often must wait a long time before a suitable heart becomes available. During this wait, the patient\'s already-weakened heart may deteriorate and become unable to pump enough blood to sustain life. An LVAD can help a weak heart and \"buy time\" for the patient or eliminate the need for a heart transplant. Most recently, LVADs are being used longer-term as ‘destination therapy’ in end-stage heart failure patients when heart transplantation is not an option. \r\n \r\nHow does an LVAD work?\r\nA common type of LVAD has a tube that pulls blood from the left ventricle into a pump. The pump then sends blood into the aorta (the large blood vessel leaving the left ventricle). This effectively helps the weakened ventricle. The pump is placed in the upper part of the abdomen. Another tube attached to the pump is brought out of the abdominal wall to the outside of the body and attached to the pump\'s battery and control system. LVADs are now portable and are often used for weeks to months. Patients with LVADs can be discharged from the hospital and have an acceptable quality of life while waiting for a donor heart to become available.\r\nCardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)\r\nSome people with heart failure develop abnormal heartbeats, or arrhythmias. Some arrhythmias may reduce how well the heart\'s lower chambers (ventricles) function. Cardiac resynchronization therapy, also known as biventricular pacing, may be needed. In this procedure, a special pacemaker is used to make the ventricles contract at the same time.

Morgan Griffin\r\nWebMD Feature Reviewed by Michael W. Smith, MD\r\nWebMD Archive\r\nImplantable devices have been used for decades to treat heart disease. The first pacemaker was implanted over 40 years ago, and implantable defibrillators were first used in the early 1980s. But the last few years have witnessed a surge in both the types of devices being tested for heart-failure treatment, and in the optimism of experts about their usefulness.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of the big advances that we\'ve had in treating heart failure in the last few years has been with devices,\" says Marvin A. Konstam, MD, chief of cardiology and director of cardiovascular development at Tufts-New England Medical Center. \"It\'s an exciting time.\"\r\n\r\nEric Rose, MD, agrees. \"Things are dramatically different in the last five years,\" says Rose, department of surgery chairman at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. \"For instance, the dream of using machines for long-term supportive patients with end-stage heart failure is now a reality.\"\r\n\r\nBut Rose, who led a study of one such implant used in heart-failure treatment -- the left ventricular assist device -- is temperate in his enthusiasm. \"It\'s a reality, but I should say that it\'s a reality with mediocre outcomes at this point,\" he tells WebMD. \"That\'s still an improvement over God-awful, which is what the prognosis was before.\"\r\n\r\nWhile advances in devices are impressive, all experts agree that we are only in the early stages of their development. It remains to be seen how widely and how quickly these life-saving implants will become available for routine heart-failure treatment.\r\n\r\nGiven that heart failure is not a specific disease in itself, but rather a condition that results from other illnesses, different approaches have been developed to treat the condition. Some stem from the familiar pacemaker, others from devices designed as a stopgap before heart transplant.\r\n\r\nImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs)\r\nAn ICD is used for heart-failure treatment when the person is considered to be a high risk of dying from an abnormal heart rhythm -- called sudden cardiac death. It is a small device that is implanted in the chest and continually monitors the heart\'s rhythm. If the ICD senses a dangerous abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers an internal electric shock to the heart -- the equivalent of being shocked with paddles outside the body -- that hopefully restores a normal heart rhythm.\r\n\r\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 NEXT PAGE >\r\nFurther Reading:\r\nICD Procedure\r\nAssistive Devices and Orthotics-Related Information\r\nAssistive Devices and Orthotics-Topic Overview\r\nCentral Venous Catheters-Credits\r\nCentral Venous Catheters-Related Information\r\nCentral Venous Catheters-Topic Overview\r\nUsing a Cane-Credits\r\nSee All Medical Devices Topics\r\nTop Picks\r\nCoenzyme Q10 (PDQ®): Complementary and alternative medicine - Patient Information [NCI]-Evaluation of CAM Approaches\r\n6 Symptoms You Shouldn\'t Ignore\r\nCauses of Tingling in Hands and Feet\r\nAtherosclerosis-Topic Overview\r\nVideo: Taming Your Trouble Spots: Glutes\r\n20 Food Poisoning Dangers, Common and Uncommon\r\nMedical Devices Home\r\nMedical Reference\r\nFeatures\r\nVideo\r\nMore From WebMD\r\nNews Archive\r\nHeart Failure Health Center\r\nOverview\r\nSymptoms\r\nDiagnosis\r\nTreatment & Care\r\nLiving & Managing\r\nFAQ\r\nRelated to Heart Failure\r\n\r\nCholesterol\r\nHeart Disease\r\nHeart Transplants\r\nHypertension\r\nMedications\r\nMy Medicine\r\nFind a Cardiologist\r\nMore Related Topics\r\nToday on WebMD\r\n How Healthy Is Your Liver?\r\nQUIZ\r\nHow Healthy Is Your Liver?\r\n Heart Disease Myths and Facts\r\nQUIZ\r\nHeart Disease Myths and Facts\r\n \r\n 14 Ways to Lower Triglycerides\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\n14 Ways to Lower Triglycerides\r\n How\'s Your Blood Pressure?\r\nASSESSMENT\r\nHow\'s Your Blood Pressure?\r\n \r\n Are You at Risk for DVT?\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nAre You at Risk for DVT?\r\n The Truth About Omega-3s\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nThe Truth About Omega-3s\r\n \r\n Lowering Blood Pressure\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nLowering Blood Pressure\r\n 15 Tips for Avoiding Heart Disease\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\n15 Tips for Avoiding Heart Disease\r\n \r\n Heart Disease Visual Guide\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nHeart Disease Visual Guide\r\n Wireless Medicine: What\'s Coming\r\nFUTURE OF HEALTH\r\nWireless Medicine: What\'s Coming\r\n \r\n How to Wreck Your Heart\r\nARTICLE\r\nHow to Wreck Your Heart\r\n Can You Reverse Heart Disease?\r\nARTICLE\r\nCan You Reverse Heart Disease?\r\n \r\nSubscribe\r\nto WebMD Newsletters\r\nHeart Health\r\nCholesterol Management\r\nHypertension\r\nFitness\r\nBy clicking submit I agree to WebMD\'s Privacy Policy\r\n Submit\r\nSign up for more topics!\r\nWebMD Special Sections\r\nHeart Attack Quiz\r\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\r\nFeeding a Growing World\r\nAllergy Relief\r\nLactose Intolerant?\r\nIBS-C Symptoms?\r\nCOPD and Alpha-1\r\nCare for Aortic Stenosis?\r\nEnjoy Dairy Everyday\r\nManaging Diabetes\r\n21 Days: A New Routine\r\nKnee Pain Relief\r\nManaging IBS-C Symptoms\r\nChildren\'s Medicine\r\nFrequent Constipation?\r\nAortic Valve Stenosis?\r\nGreater Food Accessibility\r\nMore From WebMD: RA Basics|Severe Psoriasis|ED Causes|Blood Sugar Swings|Caregiver Support|Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms|ADHD in Children|Diabetes Diet Myths\r\nFind us on:\r\nURAC: Accredited Health Web Site TRUSTe online privacy certification HONcode Seal\r\nAbout WebMD Advertise With Us Terms of Use Privacy Policy Sponsor Policy Site Map Careers Contact Us\r\nMedscape Reference eMedicineHealth RxList Medscape MedicineNet BootsWebMD WebMD Corporate\r\nWebMD Health Services First Aid WebMD Magazine WebMD Health Record WebMD Mobile Newsletters\r\nDictionary Physician Directory\r\n©2005-2015 WebMD, LLC.

One recent study found that ICDs reduced sudden cardiac death in people at risk for it -- such as those with a previous heart attack or heart failure -- by more than 50\%.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a potential disadvantage to having an ICD for heart-failure treatment: If the experience of being shocked by a box in your chest doesn\'t sound pleasant, you\'re right. While some report minor discomfort, others find it extremely painful and anxiety-provoking. This is particularly troublesome in people who have frequent episodes of this potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm.\r\n\r\n\"There have been some studies [that] showed that after getting two shocks, people\'s anxiety went sky high,\" says Susan J. Bennett, DNS, RN, a professor in the Indiana University nursing school and a specialist in treating the condition. \"But the other thing that happens is that some patients who get shocked are grateful because they know the device is working and they know that it saved their lives.\" \r\n\r\nICDs can be implanted alone, but they are also combined with other devices, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy, for heart failure treatment.\r\n\r\nCardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)\r\nCardiac resynchronization therapy is a new and promising treatment. \"Resynchronization therapy is the biggest story in device therapy for heart failure,\" says Konstam, who is also president of the Heart Failure Society of America.\r\n\r\nIn some patients with heart failure, the electrical signals that coordinate pumping of the different heart chambers become erratic, making the heart unable to pump blood efficiently. In addition, an already weakened heart wastes energy by fighting against itself.\r\n\r\nCRT devices deliver electrical impulses to both the right and left ventricles -- the two large, main pumping chambers of the heart -- restoring the coordination between the two sides of the heart and improving its function.\r\n\r\nMichael R. Bristow, MD, PhD, of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, was involved in one of the biggest studies of CRT ever done. Results were published in the May 2004 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Participants, all who had advanced heart failure, were divided into three groups: The first group got the best drug treatment -- a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a diuretic -- while the second and third groups got the drug treatment plus either a CRT device or a CRT device with a defibrillator (the two devices now come together in one device). Researchers found that compared with aggressive medication treatment alone, adding CRT to treatment reduced the risk of death by 24\%. Combining CRT with a defibrillator (the two devices now come together in one device) reduced deaths by 36\%.\r\n\r\n\"CRT makes you feel better, keeps you out of the hospital, and gives you a better quality of life,\" Bristow tells WebMD.\r\n\r\n< PREVIOUS PAGE 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 NEXT PAGE >\r\nFurther Reading:\r\nICD Procedure\r\nAssistive Devices and Orthotics-Related Information\r\nAssistive Devices and Orthotics-Topic Overview\r\nCentral Venous Catheters-Credits\r\nCentral Venous Catheters-Related Information\r\nCentral Venous Catheters-Topic Overview\r\nUsing a Cane-Credits\r\nSee All Medical Devices Topics\r\nTop Picks\r\nCoenzyme Q10 (PDQ®): Complementary and alternative medicine - Patient Information [NCI]-Evaluation of CAM Approaches\r\n6 Symptoms You Shouldn\'t Ignore\r\nCauses of Tingling in Hands and Feet\r\nAtherosclerosis-Topic Overview\r\nVideo: Taming Your Trouble Spots: Glutes\r\n20 Food Poisoning Dangers, Common and Uncommon\r\nMedical Devices Home\r\nMedical Reference\r\nFeatures\r\nVideo\r\nMore From WebMD\r\nNews Archive\r\nHeart Failure Health Center\r\nOverview\r\nSymptoms\r\nDiagnosis\r\nTreatment & Care\r\nLiving & Managing\r\nFAQ\r\nRelated to Heart Failure\r\n\r\nCholesterol\r\nHeart Disease\r\nHeart Transplants\r\nHypertension\r\nMedications\r\nMy Medicine\r\nFind a Cardiologist\r\nMore Related Topics\r\nToday on WebMD\r\n How Healthy Is Your Liver?\r\nQUIZ\r\nHow Healthy Is Your Liver?\r\n Heart Disease Myths and Facts\r\nQUIZ\r\nHeart Disease Myths and Facts\r\n \r\n 14 Ways to Lower Triglycerides\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\n14 Ways to Lower Triglycerides\r\n How\'s Your Blood Pressure?\r\nASSESSMENT\r\nHow\'s Your Blood Pressure?\r\n \r\n Are You at Risk for DVT?\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nAre You at Risk for DVT?\r\n The Truth About Omega-3s\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nThe Truth About Omega-3s\r\n \r\n Lowering Blood Pressure\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nLowering Blood Pressure\r\n 15 Tips for Avoiding Heart Disease\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\n15 Tips for Avoiding Heart Disease\r\n \r\n Heart Disease Visual Guide\r\nSLIDESHOW\r\nHeart Disease Visual Guide\r\n How to Wreck Your Heart\r\nARTICLE\r\nHow to Wreck Your Heart\r\n \r\n Virtual Healthcare Is Here\r\nFUTURE OF HEALTH\r\nVirtual Healthcare Is Here\r\n Can You Reverse Heart Disease?\r\nARTICLE\r\nCan You Reverse Heart Disease?\r\n \r\nSubscribe\r\nto WebMD Newsletters\r\nHeart Health\r\nCholesterol Management\r\nHypertension\r\nFitness\r\nBy clicking submit I agree to WebMD\'s Privacy Policy\r\n Submit\r\nSign up for more topics!\r\nWebMD Special Sections\r\nHeart Attack Quiz\r\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\r\nFeeding a Growing World\r\nAllergy Relief\r\nLactose Intolerant?\r\nIBS-C Symptoms?\r\nCOPD and Alpha-1\r\nCare for Aortic Stenosis?\r\nEnjoy Dairy Everyday\r\nManaging Diabetes\r\n21 Days: A New Routine\r\nKnee Pain Relief\r\nManaging IBS-C Symptoms\r\nChildren\'s Medicine\r\nFrequent Constipation?\r\nAortic Valve Stenosis?\r\nGreater Food Accessibility\r\nMore From WebMD: RA Basics|Severe Psoriasis|ED Causes|Blood Sugar Swings|Caregiver Support|Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms|ADHD in Children|Diabetes Diet Myths\r\nFind us on:\r\nURAC: Accredited Health Web Site TRUSTe online privacy certification HONcode Seal\r\nAbout WebMD Advertise With Us Terms of Use Privacy Policy Sponsor Policy Site Map Careers Contact Us\r\nMedscape Reference eMedicineHealth RxList Medscape MedicineNet BootsWebMD WebMD Corporate\r\nWebMD Health Services First Aid WebMD Magazine WebMD Health Record WebMD Mobile Newsletters\r\nDictionary Physician Directory\r\n©2005-2015 WebMD, LLC.

'Summary\r\nHeart surgery can correct problems with the heart if other treatments haven\'t worked or can\'t be used. The most common type of heart surgery for adults is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected, or grafted, to a blocked coronary (heart) artery.\r\n\r\nDoctors also use heart surgery to\r\n\r\nRepair or replace heart valves, which control blood flow through the heart\r\nRepair abnormal or damaged structures in the heart\r\nImplant medical devices that help control the heartbeat or support heart function and blood flow\r\nReplace a damaged heart with a healthy heart from a donor\r\nTreat heart failure and coronary heart disease\r\nControl abnormal heart rhythms\r\nHeart surgery has risks, even though its results often are excellent. Risks include bleeding, infection, irregular heartbeats, and stroke. The risk is higher if you are older or a woman. The risk is also higher if you have other diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, or peripheral arterial disease.\r\n\r\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\r\n\r\nCardiovascular (heart) surgery is surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons. Frequently, it is done to treat complications of ischemic heart disease (for example, coronary artery bypass grafting), correct congenital heart disease, or treat valvular heart disease from various causes including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis. It also includes heart transplantation.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Risks\r\n1.1 Complication risk reduction\r\n2 History\r\n2.1 Early approaches to heart malformations\r\n2.2 Open heart surgery\r\n2.3 Modern beating-heart surgery\r\n2.4 Minimally invasive surgery\r\n2.5 Pediatric cardiovascular surgery\r\n3 See also\r\n4 References\r\n5 Further reading\r\n6 External links\r\nRisks[edit]\r\nThe development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4â€“6\% mortality rates.[1][2] A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 2â€“3\% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke.[citation needed] A more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called \"pumphead\". The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent,[3] but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment.[4]\r\n\r\nHospital readmissions often occur in cardiac surgery patients; in 2010, approximately 18.5\% of patients who had a heart valve procedure in the United States were readmitted within 30 days of the initial hospitalization.[5]\r\n\r\nIn order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge. Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the CQC website.[6]\r\n\r\nNeuropsychological and psychopathologic changes following open heart surgery have been recognized from the very beginning of modern heart surgery. Variables correlated with nonpsychotic mental disorder after cardiac surgery must be divided into pre-, intra- and postoperative. The incidence, phenomenology, and duration of symptoms diverge from patient to patient, and are difficult to define. One wonders whether any of the patients in either group in this analysis underwent any mechanical cardiac valve replacement. If so, one has to consider Skumin syndrome, described by Victor Skumin in 1978 as a \"cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome\"[7] associated with mechanical heart valve implant and manifested by irrational fear, anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and asthenia.[8][9]\r\n\r\nComplication risk reduction[edit]\r\nA 2012 Cochrane systematic review found evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduced postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery such as pneumonia and atelectasis.[10] In addition, the researchers found that preoperative physical therapy decreased the length of hospital stay (on average by more than three days).[10]\r\n\r\nThere is also evidence that quitting smoking at least four weeks before the date of a surgery may reduce the risk of postoperative complications.[11]\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nThe earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero,[12] Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton and Daniel Hale Williams.[13] The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axillae and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day.[14][15] The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.[16][17]\r\n\r\nSurgery in great vessels (aortic coarctation repair, Blalock-Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery.\r\n\r\nEarly approaches to heart malformations[edit]\r\nIn 1925, operations on the heart valves were unknown. Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years[18] but Souttar\'s physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue.[19][20]\r\n\r\nCardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1948, four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy (1914â€“1948) of Charlotte, revived an operation due to Dr Dwight Harken of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve. Charles Bailey (1910â€“1993) at the Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, Dwight Harken in Boston and Russell Brock at Guy\'s Hospital all adopted Souttar\'s method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar\'s technique was widely adopted although there were modifications.[19][20]\r\n\r\nIn 1947, Thomas Holmes Sellors (1902â€“1987) of the Middlesex Hospital operated on a Fallot\'s Tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellor\'s work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later, in 1948, he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with Fallot\'s Tetralogy. Many thousands of these \"blind\" operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.[19]\r\n\r\nOpen heart surgery[edit]\r\nOpen heart surgery is a surgery in which the patient\'s heart is open and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was soon discovered by Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by Dr. C. Walton Lillehei and Dr. F. John Lewis at the University of Minnesota on September 2, 1952. The following year, Soviet surgeon Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia. During this surgery, the heart is exposed and the patient\'s blood is made to bypass it.[citation needed]\r\n\r\n\r\nCardiac surgical procedure at Gemelli Hospital in Rome\r\nSurgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia: complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the brain. The patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method, hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass. Dr. John Heysham Gibbon at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Dr. Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient\'s mother or father was used as a \'heart-lung machine\'. Dr. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nNazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963.[21] In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age 3 1â?„2, using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Dr. Zuhdi performed Oklahoma\'s first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, a cancer sufferer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery.[22]\r\n\r\nModern beating-heart surgery[edit]\r\nSince the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform \"Off-pump\" â€“ coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH).[citation needed]\r\n\r\nSome researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as postperfusion syndrome, and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon\'s preference and hospital results still play a major role.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nMinimally invasive surgery[edit]\r\nA new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robot-assisted heart surgery. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robot\'s much smaller hands to get through.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPediatric cardiovascular surgery[edit]\r\nPediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children. Russell M. Nelson performed the first successful pediatric cardiac operation at the Salt Lake General Hospital in March 1956, a total repair of tetralogy of Fallot in a four-year-old girl.[23]',?
'\r\nSurgery (from the Greek: Ï‡ÎµÎ¹Ï?Î¿Ï…Ï?Î³Î¹ÎºÎ® cheirourgikÄ“ (composed of Ï‡ÎµÎ¯Ï?, \"hand\", and á¼”Ï?Î³Î¿Î½, \"work\"), via Latin: chirurgiae, meaning \"hand work\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum).\r\n\r\nAn act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure, operation, or simply surgery. In this context, the verb operate means to perform surgery. The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments or surgical nurse. The patient or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. A surgeon is a person who practises surgery and a surgeon\'s assistant is a person who practices surgical assistance. A surgical team is made up of surgeon, surgeon\'s assistant, anesthesia provider, circulating nurse and surgical technologist. Surgery usually spans minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term surgery can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.\r\n\r\nElective surgery generally refers to a surgical procedure that can be scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Plastic, or cosmetic surgeries are common elective procedures.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Definitions\r\n1.1 Types of surgery\r\n1.2 Terminology\r\n2 Description of surgical procedure\r\n2.1 Location\r\n2.2 Patient Safety\r\n2.3 Preoperative care\r\n2.4 Staging for surgery\r\n2.5 Surgery\r\n2.6 Post-operative care\r\n3 Epidemiology\r\n4 In special populations\r\n4.1 Elderly people\r\n4.2 Other populations\r\n5 In Low and Middle Income Countries\r\n6 History\r\n6.1 Early modern Europe\r\n6.2 Modern surgery\r\n6.2.1 Infection and antisepsis\r\n7 Surgical specialties\r\n8 See also\r\n8.1 National Societies\r\n8.2 Qualifications in the UK and Ireland\r\n9 Notes and references\r\n10 External links\r\nDefinitions[edit]\r\nSurgery is a technology consisting of a physical intervention on tissues, and muscle.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a patient\'s tissues or closure of a previously sustained wound. Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as angioplasty or endoscopy, may be considered surgery if they involve \"common\" surgical procedure or settings, such as use of a sterile environment, anesthesia, antiseptic conditions, typical surgical instruments, and suturing or stapling. All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; so-called \"noninvasive surgery\" usually refers to an excision that does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. laser ablation of the cornea) or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).\r\n\r\nTypes of surgery[edit]\r\nSurgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.\r\n\r\nBased on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient\'s request, subject to the surgeon\'s and the surgical facility\'s availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time.\r\nBased on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.\r\nBy type of procedure: Amputation involves cutting off a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration is also an example. Resection is the removal of all or part of an internal organ or part of the body. Replantation involves reattaching a severed body part. Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. Cosmetic surgery is done to improve the appearance of an otherwise normal structure. Excision is the cutting out or removal of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the patient. Transplant surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.\r\nBy body part: When surgery is performed on one organ system or structure, it may be classed by the organ, organ system or tissue involved. Examples include cardiac surgery (performed on the heart), gastrointestinal surgery (performed within the digestive tract and its accessory organs), and orthopedic surgery (performed on bones and/or muscles).\r\nBy degree of invasiveness: Minimally invasive surgery involves smaller outer incision(s) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in laparoscopic surgery or angioplasty. By contrast, an open surgical procedure or laparotomy requires a large incision to access the area of interest.\r\nBy equipment used: Laser surgery involves use of a laser for cutting tissue instead of a scalpel or similar surgical instruments. Microsurgery involves the use of an operating microscope for the surgeon to see small structures. Robotic surgery makes use of a surgical robot, such as the Da Vinci or the Zeus surgical systems, to control the instrumentation under the direction of the surgeon.\r\nTerminology[edit]\r\nExcision surgery names often start with a name for the organ to be excised (cut out) and end in -ectomy.\r\nProcedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in -otomy. A surgical procedure cutting through the abdominal wall to gain access to the abdominal cavity is a laparotomy.\r\nMinimally invasive procedures involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted end in -oscopy. For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called laparoscopy.\r\nProcedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a stoma in the body end in -ostomy.\r\nReconstruction, plastic or cosmetic surgery of a body part starts with a name for the body part to be reconstructed and ends in -oplasty. Rhino is used as a prefix for \"nose\", therefore a rhinoplasty is reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose.\r\nRepair of damaged or congenital abnormal structure ends in -rraphy. Herniorraphy is the reparation of a hernia, while perineorraphy is the reparation of perineum.\r\nReoperation (return to the operating room) refers to a return to the operating theater after an initial surgery is performed to re-address an aspect of patient care best treated surgically. Reasons for reoperation include persistent bleeding after surgery, development of or persistence of infection or, more insidiously, retained foreign objects.\r\nDescription of surgical procedure[edit]\r\nLocation[edit]\r\nAt a hospital, modern surgery is often done in an operating theater using surgical instruments, an operating table for the patient, and other equipment. Among United States hospitalizations for nonmaternal and nonneonatal conditions in 2012, more than one-fourth of stays and half of hospital costs involved stays that included operating room (OR) procedures.[1] The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of aseptic technique: the strict separation of \"sterile\" (free of microorganisms) things from \"unsterile\" or \"contaminated\" things. All surgical instruments must be sterilized, and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire (scrubs, a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure. There is moderate-quality evidence that usage of two layers of gloves compared to single gloving during surgery reduces perforations and blood stains on the skin, indicating a decrease in percutaneous exposure incidents.[2]\r\n\r\nPatient Safety[edit]\r\nThe Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality suggests that patients should ask your doctor questions.\r\n\r\nPreoperative care[edit]\r\nMain article: Preoperative care\r\nPrior to surgery, the patient is given a medical examination, certain pre-operative tests, and their physical status is rated according to the ASA physical status classification system. If these results are satisfactory, the patient signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an autologous blood donation may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the digestive system, the patient may be instructed to perform a bowel prep by drinking a solution of polyethylene glycol the night before the procedure. Patients are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an NPO order after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the patient vomits during or after the procedure.\r\n\r\nSome medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly.[3] In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray.[3] Routine x-ray examination is more likely to result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient.[3] Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.[4]\r\n\r\nStaging for surgery[edit]\r\nIn the pre-operative holding area, the patient changes out of his or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details of his or her surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover all of the patient\'s body except for the head[citation needed] and the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an \"ether screen\", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist\'s working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).\r\n\r\nAnesthesia is administered to prevent pain from incision, tissue manipulation and suturing. Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided locally or as general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable. With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the patient can remain conscious or minimally sedated. In contrast, general anesthesia renders the patient unconscious and paralyzed during surgery. The patient is intubated and is placed on a mechanical ventilator, and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents. Choice of surgical method and anaesthetic technique aims to reduce risk of complications, shorten time needed for recovery and minimise the surgical stress response.\r\n\r\nSurgery[edit]\r\nAn incision is made to access the surgical site. Blood vessels may be clamped or cauterized to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open. The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then peritoneum. In certain cases, bone may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the skull for brain surgery or cutting the sternum for thoracic (chest) surgery to open up the rib cage. Whilst in surgery health and safety is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeon will remove hair from the face and eyes, using a head hat. Hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly to prevent germs getting into the operated body, then gloves are placed onto the hands. A PVC apron will be worn at all times, to stop any contamination. A yellow substance â€“ typically an antiseptic iodine solution â€“ is lighly coated onto the located area of the patient\'s body that will be performed on, this stops germs and disease infecting areas of the body, whilst the patient is being cut into.\r\n\r\nWork to correct the problem in body then proceeds. This work may involve:\r\n\r\nexcision â€“ cutting out an organ, tumor,[5] or other tissue.\r\nresection â€“ partial removal of an organ or other bodily structure.\r\nreconnection of organs, tissues, etc., particularly if severed. Resection of organs such as intestines involves reconnection. Internal suturing or stapling may be used. Surgical connection between blood vessels or other tubular or hollow structures such as loops of intestine is called anastomosis.\r\nReduction â€“ the movement or realignment of a body part to its normal position. e.g. Reduction of a broken nose involves the physical manipulation of the bone and/or cartilage from their displaced state back to their original position to restore normal airflow and aesthetics.\r\nligation â€“ tying off blood vessels, ducts, or \"tubes\".\r\ngrafts â€“ may be severed pieces of tissue cut from the same (or different) body or flaps of tissue still partly connected to the body but resewn for rearranging or restructuring of the area of the body in question. Although grafting is often used in cosmetic surgery, it is also used in other surgery. Grafts may be taken from one area of the patient\'s body and inserted to another area of the body. An example is bypass surgery, where clogged blood vessels are bypassed with a graft from another part of the body. Alternatively, grafts may be from other persons, cadavers, or animals.\r\ninsertion of prosthetic parts when needed. Pins or screws to set and hold bones may be used. Sections of bone may be replaced with prosthetic rods or other parts. Sometime a plate is inserted to replace a damaged area of skull. Artificial hip replacement has become more common. Heart pacemakers or valves may be inserted. Many other types of prostheses are used.\r\ncreation of a stoma, a permanent or semi-permanent opening in the body\r\nin transplant surgery, the donor organ (taken out of the donor\'s body) is inserted into the recipient\'s body and reconnected to the recipient in all necessary ways (blood vessels, ducts, etc.).\r\narthrodesis â€“ surgical connection of adjacent bones so the bones can grow together into one. Spinal fusion is an example of adjacent vertebrae connected allowing them to grow together into one piece.\r\nmodifying the digestive tract in bariatric surgery for weight loss.\r\nrepair of a fistula, hernia, or prolapse\r\nother procedures, including:\r\nclearing clogged ducts, blood or other vessels\r\nremoval of calculi (stones)\r\ndraining of accumulated fluids\r\ndebridement- removal of dead, damaged, or diseased tissue\r\nSurgery has also been conducted to separate conjoined twins.\r\nSex change operations\r\nBlood or blood expanders may be administered to compensate for blood lost during surgery. Once the procedure is complete, sutures or staples are used to close the incision. Once the incision is closed, the anesthetic agents are stopped and/or reversed, and the patient is taken off ventilation and extubated (if general anesthesia was administered).[6]\r\n\r\nPost-operative care[edit]\r\nAfter completion of surgery, the patient is transferred to the post anesthesia care unit and closely monitored. When the patient is judged to have recovered from the anesthesia, he/she is either transferred to a surgical ward elsewhere in the hospital or discharged home. During the post-operative period, the patient\'s general function is assessed, the outcome of the procedure is assessed, and the surgical site is checked for signs of infection. There are several risk factors associated with postoperative complications, such as immune deficienty and obesity. Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for adverse post-surgical outcomes. It has been linked to many disorders such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atelectasis and pulmonary embolism, adverse cardiovascular effects, and wound healing complications.[7] If removable skin closures are used, they are removed after 7 to 10 days post-operatively, or after healing of the incision is well under way.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for surgical drains (see Drain (surgery)) to be required to remove blood or fluid from the surgical wound during recovery. Mostly these drains stay in until the volume tapers off, then they are removed. These drains can become clogged, leading to retained blood complications or abscess.\r\n\r\nPostoperative therapy may include adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or administration of medication such as anti-rejection medication for transplants. Other follow-up studies or rehabilitation may be prescribed during and after the recovery period.\r\n\r\nThe use of topical antibiotics on surgical wounds does not reduce infection rates in comparison with non-antibiotic ointment or no ointment at all.[8] Antibiotic ointments will irritate the skin, slow healing, and greatly increase risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance.[8] Because of this, they should only be used when a person shows signs of infection and not as a preventative.[8]\r\n\r\nThrough a retrospective analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44\% and 82\% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This â€œweekday effectâ€? has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.[9]\r\n\r\nEpidemiology[edit]\r\nOf the 38.6 million hospital stays that occurred in U.S. hospitals in 2011, 29\% included at least one operating room procedure. These stays accounted for 48\% of the total $387 billion in hospital costs.[10]\r\n\r\nIn total, there were over 15 million operating room procedures performed in U.S. hospitals in 2011. The overall number of procedures remained stable from 2001-2011.[11]\r\n\r\nA study of data from 2003-2011 showed that U.S. hospital costs were highest for the surgical service line; the surgical service line costs were $17,600 in 2003 and projected to be $22,500 in 2013.[12] For hospital stays in 2012 in the United States, private insurance had the highest percentage of surgical expenditure.[13] Mean hospital costs in the United States in 2012 were highest for surgical stays.[13]\r\n\r\nIn special populations[edit]\r\nElderly people[edit]\r\nOlder adults have widely varying physical health. Frail elderly people are at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients\' recovery trajectories.[14] One frailty scale uses five items: unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed. A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50\% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes.[14] Frail elderly patients (score of 4 or 5) have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.\r\n\r\nOther populations[edit]\r\n[icon]\tThis section requires expansion. (November 2012)\r\nChildren\r\nSurgery on children requires considerations which are not common in adult surgery. Children and adolescents are still developing physically and mentally making it difficult for them to make informed decisions and give consent for surgical treatments. Bariatric surgery in youth is among the controversial topics related to surgery in children.\r\n\r\nSee also: Pediatric surgery and Pediatric plastic surgery\r\nPersons with health conditions\r\nA person with a debilitating medical condition may have special needs during a surgery which a typical patient would not.\r\n\r\nVulnerable populations\r\nDoctors perform surgery with the consent of the patient. Some patients are able to give better informed consent than others. Populations such as incarcerated persons, the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other people who are not able to make decisions with the same authority as a typical patient have special needs when making decisions about their personal healthcare, including surgery.\r\n\r\nIn Low and Middle Income Countries[edit]\r\nIn 2014 the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery was launched to examine the case for surgery as an integral component of global health care and to provide recommendations regarding the delivery of surgical and anesthesia services in low and middle income countries.[15] The primary conclusions of the study were as follows:\r\n\r\nFive billion people worldwide lack access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthesia care. Areas in which especially large proportions of the population lack access include Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, Central Asia, and to a lesser extent, Russia and China. Of the estimated 312.9 million surgical procedures undertaken worldwide in 2012, only 6.3\% were done in countries comprising the poorest 37.3\% of the world\'s population.\r\nAn additional 143 million surgeries are needed each year to prevent unnecessary death and disability.\r\n33 million people face catastrophic payments for surgical and anesthesia care each year.\r\nInvestment in surgical and anesthesia services is cost-effective, saves lives, and promotes economic growth\r\nSurgery is an indispensible part of health care.',?
'f you\'ve had a heart attack, you may have already had certain procedures to help you survive your heart attack and diagnose your condition. For example, many heart attack patients have undergone thrombolysis, a procedure that involves injecting a clot-dissolving agent to restore blood flow in a coronary artery (View an illustration of coronary arteries). This procedure is administered within a few (usually three) hours of a heart attack. If this treatment isn\'t done immediately after a heart attack, many patients will need to undergo coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) later to improve blood supply to the heart muscle.\r\n\r\nSee Diagnostic Tests and Procedures At-A-Glance to better understand the tests you may have to undergo to find out if you had a heart attack, how much damage was done and what degree of coronary artery disease (CAD) you have.\r\n\r\nCardiac Procedures and Surgeries\r\nAngioplasty\r\nAlso known as Percutaneous Coronary Interventions [PCI], Balloon Angioplasty and Coronary Artery Balloon Dilation. (View an animation of angioplasty)\r\n \r\nWhat the Procedure Does\r\nSpecial tubing with an attached deflated balloon is threaded up to the coronary arteries. The balloon is inflated to widen blocked areas where blood flow to the heart muscle has been reduced or cutoff. Often combined with implantation of a stent to help prop the artery open and decrease the chance of another blockage. Considered less invasive because the body is not cut open. Lasts from 30 minutes to several hours. Often requires an overnight hospital stay.\r\n\r\nReason for the Procedure\r\nGreatly increases blood flow through the blocked artery.\r\nDecreases chest pain (angina).\r\nIncreases ability for physical activity.\r\nReduces risk of a heart attack.\r\nCan also be used to open neck and brain arteries to help prevent stroke.',?
