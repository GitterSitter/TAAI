Beer is a beverage known since antiquity and next to wine is probabLy the oldest of prepared food drinks. In modern times the countries of northern Europe set the style of beer as it appears today. In fact, the words \"beer,\" \"brewing,\" and \"Lager\" are all of German origin (1,8).\r\n\r\nBeer is defined in Connecticut Statutes (2) as any beverage obtained by the alcoholic fermentation of an infusion or decoction of barley, malt and hops in drinking water and containing more than one-half of one percent of absolute alcohol. Taxes on beer sold in Connecticut are collected by the Excise Tax Division of the Department of Revenue Services at the rate of $3 per barrel (not less than 28 nor more than 31 gallons per barrel).\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nSamples were collected at wholesale beer distributors in Connecticut by inspectors of the Excise Tax Division of the Department of Revenue Services during April and May, 1987. Analysis for alcohol content was by AOAC methods (5) using gas chromatography (3). Proteins, ash, and solids were analyzed by AOAC methods (5). Carbohydrate content was calculated as percent total solids - (\% protein + \% ash) Calories were calculated as (\% alcohoL X 6.93) + ((96 carbohydrate + \%protein) X 4) (3). Duplicate analyses for alcohol in the same container of beer showed an average deviation of 0.057 percent and duplicates for protein 0.05 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nOf the 202 samples tested, 163 were regular beer (Table 1), 26 were light beer (Table 2), and 13 were non-alcoholic beer (Table 3). These represented 81, 19 and 9 different brands of regular, light, and nonalcoholic beer, respectively. Each Table lists the brand name of the beer, the name of the brewer, the country of origin, alcohol content, and the calories per 100 ml (milliliters) (3.5 ounces).\r\n\r\nAlcohol in regular, light, and non-alcoholic beer averaged 5.0, 4.1, and 0.3 percent, respectively (Table 4). Calories in regular, light and non-alcoholic beer averaged 43, 32, and 17 per 100 ml, respectively. The range in values for alcohol and calories was wide. Alcohol in regular beer ranged from 1.0 to 9.5 percent, while light beer ranged from 2.4 to 5.4 percent and non-alcoholic beer from 0.1 to 0.7 percent. Similarly, calories varied among all types of beer. Some variation was noted in alcohol content among different containers of the same type of beer. A dilference of 1.5 percent was found in one type of regular beer and 1.6 percent in another. Although the labels showed no code numbers, each container of beer is likely from a different manufacturing batch.\r\n\r\nA comparison of alcohol and calorie content between regular and light beer from the same manufacturer can be made by examining Tables 1 and 2. For example, eight regular beers made by Anheuser Busch (does not include beer claiming half the amount of alcohol as regular beer) averaged 5.11 percent alcohol. Four light beers from the same manufacturer averaged 4.17 percent, 15 percent less than found in the regular beer. Calories in the same Anheuser Busch regular beer averaged 44 per 100 ml and 35 in light beer, or 20 percent lower calories. Similar comparisons may be made for other manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nAnalyses were by Lucia McLean, Dr. Vipin Agarwal, Lois Hornig, Deborah Behnfield, and John Hayes. Arrangements and collections of samples were made by Pasquale Oronzo, James Pyne, and Robert Brown of the Excise Tax Division.\r\n',?

The answer is: a matter of perspective. When I began learning how to brew my own beer several years ago, I read every book I could find; books often published 15 years apart. It was evident to me that the state of the art had matured a bit. Where one book would recommend using baking yeast and covering the fermenting beer with a towel, a later book would insist on brewing yeast and perhaps an airlock. So, I felt that another point of view, laying out the hows and whys of the brewing processes, might help more new brewers get a better start.\r\n\r\nHere is a synopsis of the brewing process:\r\n\r\nMalted barley is soaked in hot water to release the malt sugars.\r\nThe malt sugar solution is boiled with Hops for seasoning.\r\nThe solution is cooled and yeast is added to begin fermentation.\r\nThe yeast ferments the sugars, releasing CO2 and ethyl alcohol.\r\nWhen the main fermentation is complete, the beer is bottled with a little bit of added sugar to provide the carbonation.\r\nSounds fairly simple doesn\'t it? It is, but as you read this book you will realize the incredible amount of information that I glossed over with those five steps. The first step alone can fill an entire book, several in fact. But brewing is easy. And it\'s fun. Brewing is an art as well as a science. Some people may be put off by the technical side of things, but this is a science that you can taste. The science is what allows everyone to become the artist. Learning about the processes of beer making will let you better apply them as an artist. As my history teacher used to chide me, \"It\'s only boring until you learn something about it. Knowledge makes things interesting.\"\r\n\r\nAs an engineer, I was intrigued with the process of beermaking. I wanted to know what each step was supposed to be doing so I could understand how to better accomplish them. For instance, adding the yeast to the beer wort: the emphasis was to get the yeast fermenting as soon as possible to prevent unwanted competing yeasts or microbes from getting a foothold. There are actually several factors that influence yeast propagation, not all of which were explained in any one book. This kind of editing was an effort by the authors to present the information that they felt was most important to overall success and enjoyment of the hobby. Each of us has a different perspective.\r\n\r\nFortunately for me, I discovered the Internet and the homebrewing discussion groups it contained. With the help of veteran brewers on the Home Brew Digest (an Internet mailing list) and Rec.Crafts.Brewing (a Usenet newsgroup) I soon discovered why my first beer had turned out so brilliantly clear, yet fit only for mosquitoes to lay their eggs in. As I became more experienced, and was able to brew beer that could stand proudly with any commercial offering, I realized that I was seeing new brewers on the \'Net with the same basic questions that I had. They were reading the same books I had and some of those were excellent books. Well, I decided to write an electronic document that contained everything that a beginning brewer would need to know to get started. It contained equipment descriptions, process descriptions and some of the Why\'s of homebrewing. I posted it to electronic bulletin boards and homebrewing archive computer sites such as Sierra.Stanford.edu . It was reviewed by other brewers and accepted as one of the best brewing guides available. It has been through four revisions as comments were received and I learned more about the Why\'s of brewing. That document, \"How To Brew Your First Beer\" is still available and free to download and/or reproduce for personal use. It was written to help the first-time brewer produce a fool-proof beer - one they could be proud of. That document has apparently served quite well, it has been requested and distributed world-wide, including Europe, North America, Australia, Africa, and Asia- the Middle East and the Far East. Probably several thousand copies have been distributed by now. Glad I could help.\r\n\r\nAs time went by, and I moved on to Partial Mashes (half extract, half malted grain) and All-Grain Brewing, I actually saw requests on the \'Net from brewers requesting \"Palmer-type\" documents explaining these more complex brewing methods. There is a lot to talk about with these methods though, and I realized that it would be best done with a book. So, here we go...\r\n\r\nOh, one more thing, I should mention that Extract Brewing should not be viewed as inferior to brewing with grain, it is merely easier. It takes up less space and uses less equipment. You can brew national competition winning beers using extracts. The reason I moved on to Partial Mashes and then to All-Grain was because brewing is FUN. These methods really let you roll up your sleeves, fire up the kettles and be the inventor. You can let the mad-scientist in you come forth, you can combine different malts and hops at will, defying conventions and conservatives, raising your creation up to the storm and calling down the lightening...Hah hah HAH....\r\n\r\nBut I digress, thermo-nuclear brewing methods will be covered in another book.

'\r\nWhat Is Heart Failure?\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart can\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\'s needs. In some cases, the heart can\'t fill with enough blood. In other cases, the heart can\'t pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems.\r\n\r\nThe term \"heart failure\" doesn\'t mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nHeart failure develops over time as the heart\'s pumping action grows weaker. The condition can affect the right side of the heart only, or it can affect both sides of the heart. Most cases involve both sides of the heart.\r\n\r\nRight-side heart failure occurs if the heart can\'t pump enough blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Left-side heart failure occurs if the heart can\'t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nRight-side heart failure may cause fluid to build up in the feet, ankles, legs, liver, abdomen, and the veins in the neck. Right-side and left-side heart failure also may cause shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness).\r\n\r\nThe leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart. Examples include coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\r\n\r\nOutlook\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a very common condition. About 5.1 million people in the United States have heart failure.\r\n\r\nBoth children and adults can have the condition, although the symptoms and treatments differ. This article focuses on heart failure in adults.\r\n\r\nCurrently, heart failure has no cure. However, treatments—such as medicines and lifestyle changes—can help people who have the condition live longer and more active lives. Researchers continue to study new ways to treat heart failure and its complications.',?

If your condition is serious and other treatments are not managing to improve things or control your symptoms, your cardiologist may send you to a heart transplant centre for a transplant assessment. \r\n\r\nHow do I know if I\'m eligible for a heart transplant?\r\nYour assessment will determine whether you need a transplant and whether you are suitable for one. Based on your assessment, you may be considered:\r\n\r\nsuitable for a transplant, in which case you will be put onto the transplant waiting list. This means you could be called for a transplant at any time.\r\nsuitable for a transplant, but the consultants do not think your condition is severe enough to warrant being put on the waiting list. If this happens your case will be reviewed regularly. If your condition gets worse, you will go on the waiting list.\r\nin need of further investigations or treatment. If your condition changes you can be assessed again.\r\nan unsuitable case for a heart transplant. This could be for a number of reasons. The transplant team will explain why you are not suitable and discuss how you can be treated further. You can also be referred to another centre for a second opinion.\r\nHow long is the wait for a heart transplant?\r\nIf you are considered suitable for a heart transplant you will be added to the transplant waiting list. Once you are on the list, a suitable heart may come along within a few days or it may take many months or even years.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, suitable hearts do not become available for everyone and only 8 out of 10 people receive the heart transplant they require. In the UK, adults and children can wait over a year for a transplant.\r\n\r\nWhat happens during a heart transplant operation?\r\nIllustration of a heart\r\nIt’s natural for you to feel excited, emotional or anxious about your surgery and life afterwards.\r\n\r\nRemember that a transplanted heart is no more than a new pump - it does not change your personality or behaviours.\r\n\r\nA heart transplant operation usually takes between four and six hours:\r\n\r\nAt the start of the procedure you’ll be given a general anaesthetic.\r\nThe surgeon will make a cut in your breastbone to get access to your heart.You will be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine which makes the blood circulate around your body.\r\nYour surgeon will then work on transplanting your new heart.\r\nWhen this is finished, they will start your heart beating again. When you heart begins to take over pumping and your condition is stable, the heart-lung machine will be turned off. \r\nThe surgeon will then close your breastbone with wire, which will stay there for the rest of your life.\r\nAfter the operation you will be moved to the intensive care unit. Most people wake the following day. You will be sedated and breathe with the help of a ventilator machine until you are able to breathe for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or if anything is worrying you, you can talk to your transplant team or call our Heart Helpline on 0300 330 3311.\r\n\r\nWhat happens after the transplant?\r\nMost people leave hospital within about four weeks of the operation, but depending on your condition, you may need to stay in hospital for longer.\r\n\r\nIn the first few months after your surgery you will need to spend a lot of time visiting the hospital – you might even need to stay near the transplant centre. Your transplant team will talk to you about practical arrangements for after your surgery.\r\n\r\nAlthough you will be weak after the operation, recovery can be very quick. It is important to build up your level of activity gradually. You should avoid activities involving lifting and pushing until your breastbone is fully healed, which can take up to three or four months.\r\n\r\nOnce you feel fit and able, you can start doing things like light vacuuming or light gardening.\r\n\r\nWhat is life like after a heart transplant?\r\nOnce you’ve recovered from surgery you should be able to return to a wide range of activities including driving, holidays and physical activity - some people are even able to go back to work. \r\n\r\nYou will need to take a number of medicines, including immunosuppressants, for the rest of your life.  Without them your body would rapidly recognise your new heart as ‘foreign’ and try to reject it.  This type of medicine can have side-effects which your doctor will discuss with you.\r\n\r\nMany people who have had a successful heart transplant go on to live long and healthy lives.  Over three-quarters of heart transplant patients live for over five years.\r\n\r\nWhere can I find out more?\r\nOur heart transplantation booklet talks in detail about heart transplantation and is for people who have had, or are waiting for, a heart transplant. It\'s also suitable for family and friends.\r\nThe NHS Blood and Transplant special health authority within the NHS provides support to transplantation services across the UK and makes sure that donated organs are matched and used in a fair way. They also provide information and statistics on heart and other transplants.\r\nDo you want to help find donor hearts?\r\nDid you know that on average, three people die every day in the UK whilst waiting for an organ transplant? That\'s 1,000 people a year, dying due to a shortage of donor organs. 9 out of 10 people say they support organ donation but only 3 in 10 actually go on to sign the register.\r\n\r\nYou can help by signing up to the NHS Organ Donation Register, and spreading the word to your family and friends. This is a register for anyone who wants to donate their heart or other organs.\r\n\r\nWant to know more?\r\nOrder or download our publications:\r\n\r\n \t \r\n      \r\nSkip to top\r\nFIGHT FOR EVERY HEARTBEAT\r\nOur privacy and cookies policy\r\nTerms and conditions\r\nWork for us\r\nContact us\r\nSign up for email updates\r\nLog in\r\nFooterLogo\r\n  \r\nBritish Heart Foundation is a registered Charity No. 225971.

Dr. Norman Shumway and his colleagues developed the experimental basis for transplants in their early work, which then paved the way for the first adult heart transplant in the U.S. at Stanford in 1968. To date, our medical teams have performed more than 1,200 heart transplants.\r\n\r\nOur multidisciplinary program includes:\r\n\r\nSpecialists in heart failure management and heart transplantation\r\nExperts in cardiothoracic surgery\r\nState-of-the-art diagnostic tests from radiologists, molecular biologists and pathologists\r\nAccess to new clinical trials in heart failure and heart transplantation\r\nInnovations introduced in the transplant field from Stanford include:\r\n\r\nThe operative method for heart transplantation\r\nThe use of percutaneous, transvenous biopsy of the heart to detect rejection\r\nThe use of new immunosuppressive drugs, including cyclosporine, to prevent rejection\r\nThe first successful heart-lung transplantation procedure\r\nThe first successful use of a mechanical device or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge-to-heart transplantation\r\nThe development of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to detect early evidence of transplant coronary artery disease\r\nThe use of peripheral blood gene expression testing to identify patients at low risk for rejection, allowing doctors to safely decrease the number of biopsies performed\r\nApproximately 40 to 50 patients undergo heart transplantation each year at Stanford. The procedures are performed in patients from newborns to adults over 60 years of age. Almost every type of end-stage heart disease has been treated here, and the Stanford team remains a leader in introducing new concepts and treatments to improve outcomes for transplant patients.\r\n\r\nSTANFORD HEALTH NOW\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n \r\nIs Your Heart At Risk?

Here, we can visualize what’s happening in the heart in fine detail, and take measurements of blood pressure and flow. Our colleagues specializing in interventional cardiology can even make a number of repairs with catheterization, like expanding narrowed passages and closing holes.\r\n\r\nDid you know?\r\nMechanical circulatory support with VADs\r\n\r\nBoston Children’s physicians and nurses have played a leading role in the research and regulatory issues surrounding pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) use in the United States. These devices give blood circulation a boost and can serve as a life-saving bridge to transplant. Boston Children’s cardiologists were integral in designing and conducting the multi-institutional study of the Berlin Heart®, which gained FDA approval for use in children in 2011. Boston Children’s continues to expand the field of VAD support in children by introducing new devices such as the HeartWare® HVAD allowing children to be discharged home and to resume activities of life. A Boston Children’s patient was the first child in North America to go back to school with a VAD as she waits for a heart transplant.
