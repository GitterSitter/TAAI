'heart failure\r\nheart transplant\r\nassist support devices\r\nMedicine\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\nThis article is about the science and art of healing. For medications, see Pharmaceutical drug. For other uses, see Medicine (disambiguation).\r\n\r\nAsclepius, the god of medicine and healing in Greek mythology. Depictions of the serpent-entwined rod of Asclepius are frequently used to represent medicine.\r\nMedicine (UK English Listeni/ˈmɛdsɨn/, /ˈmɛdɨsɨn/; US English Listeni/ˈmɛdɨsɨn/) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1][2] The word medicine is derived from the Latin ars medicina, meaning the art of healing.[3][4] Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness.\r\n\r\nContemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, prostheses, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5]\r\n\r\nMedicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.\r\n\r\nPrescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is \"variable and inconsistent\" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, medicine outside the bounds of safety and efficacy is termed quackery.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Clinical practice\r\n2 Institutions\r\n2.1 Delivery\r\n3 Branches\r\n3.1 Basic sciences\r\n3.2 Specialties\r\n3.2.1 Surgical specialty\r\n3.2.2 Internal specialty\r\n3.2.3 Diagnostic specialties\r\n3.2.4 Other major specialties\r\n3.3 Interdisciplinary fields\r\n4 Education\r\n5 Medical ethics\r\n6 Legal controls\r\n7 Criticism of modern medicine\r\n8 Honors and awards\r\n9 History\r\n9.1 Ancient world\r\n9.2 Middle ages\r\n9.3 Modern\r\n10 Mythology\r\n10.1 Patron saints\r\n11 See also\r\n12 Notes and references\r\nClinical practice[edit]\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, by Sir Luke Fildes (1891)\r\nMedical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.[8] Even in the developed world however, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49\% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.[9]\r\n\r\nIn modern clinical practice, doctors personally assess patients in order to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient\'s medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview[10] and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g. stethoscope, tongue depressor) are typically used. After examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g. blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.[11] Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue.\r\n\r\nThe components of the medical interview[10] and encounter are:\r\n\r\nChief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the \'symptoms.\' They are in the patient\'s own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called \'presenting complaint\'.\r\nHistory of present illness/complaint (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom.\r\nCurrent activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.\r\nMedications (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, over-the-counter, and home remedies, as well as alternative and herbal medicines/herbal remedies. Allergies are also recorded.\r\nPast medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past infectious diseases and/or vaccinations, history of known allergies.\r\nSocial history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including diet, medications, tobacco, alcohol).\r\nFamily history (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A family tree is sometimes used.\r\nReview of systems (ROS) or systems inquiry: a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss, change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body\'s main organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).\r\nThe physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable.[12] The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.[13]\r\n\r\nThe clinical examination involves the study of:\r\n\r\nVital signs including height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation\r\nGeneral appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or clubbing)\r\nSkin\r\nHead, eye, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT)\r\nCardiovascular (heart and blood vessels)\r\nRespiratory (large airways and lungs)\r\nAbdomen and rectum\r\nGenitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)\r\nMusculoskeletal (including spine and extremities)\r\nNeurological (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, cranial nerves, spinal cord and peripheral nerves)\r\nPsychiatric (orientation, mental state, evidence of abnormal perception or thought).\r\nIt is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.\r\n\r\nThe treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. Follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system, various forms of \"utilization review\", such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services.[14]\r\n\r\nThe medical decision-making (MDM) process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient\'s problem.\r\n\r\nOn subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations.\r\n\r\nInstitutions[edit]\r\n\r\nThe Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, fresco by Domenico di Bartolo, 1441–1442\r\nContemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems. Legal, credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.[15] Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States)[16][17] and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system, or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.\r\n\r\nMost tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern drug ampoules\r\nTransparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness,[18] new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.\r\n\r\nDelivery[edit]\r\nSee also: Health care, clinic, hospital and hospice\r\nProvision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.\r\n\r\nPrimary care medical services are provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, clinics, nursing homes, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90\% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes.\r\n\r\nSecondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, emergency rooms, intensive care medicine,  services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.\r\n\r\nTertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include trauma centers, burn treatment centers, advanced neonatology unit services, organ transplants, high-risk pregnancy, radiation oncology, etc.\r\n\r\nModern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.\r\n\r\nIn low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that \"user fees\" be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.[19]\r\n\r\nBranches[edit]\r\nWorking together as an interdisciplinary team, many highly trained health professionals besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: nurses, emergency medical technicians and paramedics, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, podiatrists physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, radiographers, dietitians, and bioengineers, surgeons, surgeon\'s assistant, surgical technologist.\r\n\r\nThe scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. Dentistry, while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine, is a medical field.\r\n\r\nA patient admitted to hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the Cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.\r\n\r\nPhysicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.\r\n\r\nThe main branches of medicine are:\r\n\r\nBasic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in biomedical research\r\nMedical specialties\r\nInterdisciplinary fields, where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.\r\nBasic sciences[edit]\r\nAnatomy is the study of the physical structure of organisms. In contrast to macroscopic or gross anatomy, cytology and histology are concerned with microscopic structures.\r\nBiochemistry is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.\r\nBiomechanics is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of Mechanics.\r\nBiostatistics is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to epidemiology and evidence-based medicine.\r\nBiophysics is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of physics and physical chemistry to study biological systems.\r\nCytology is the microscopic study of individual cells.\r\n\r\nLouis Pasteur in his laboratory, 1885\r\nEmbryology is the study of the early development of organisms.\r\nEndocrinology is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.\r\nEpidemiology is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.\r\nGenetics is the study of genes, and their role in biological inheritance.\r\nHistology is the study of the structures of biological tissues by light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\r\nImmunology is the study of the immune system, which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.\r\nMedical physics is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.\r\nMicrobiology is the study of microorganisms, including protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\r\nMolecular biology is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material.\r\nNeuroscience includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the nervous system. A main focus of neuroscience is the biology and physiology of the human brain and spinal cord. Some related clinical specialties include neurology, neuro and psychiatry.\r\nNutrition science (theoretical focus) and dietetics (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, weight and eating disorders, allergies, malnutrition, and neoplastic diseases.\r\nPathology as a science is the study of disease—the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.\r\nPharmacology is the study of drugs and their actions.\r\nPhotobiology is the study of the interactions between non-ionizing radiation and living organisms.\r\nPhysiology is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.\r\nRadiobiology is the study of the interactions between ionizing radiation and living organisms.\r\nToxicology is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and poisons.\r\nSpecialties[edit]\r\nMain article: Medical specialty\r\nIn the broadest meaning of \"medicine\", there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which have its own entrance examination. These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term \"Royal\". The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.\r\n\r\nWithin medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: \"Medicine\" and \".\" \"Medicine\" refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine. In the UK, this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland. \"\" refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General , which in the UK leads to membership of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (MRCS). At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the Royal College of Anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).\r\n\r\nSurgical specialty[edit]\r\nMain article: \r\n\r\nSurgeons in an operating room\r\n is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum).Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards.  has many sub-specialties, including general , cardiovascular , colorectal , neuro, oral and maxillofacial , oncologic , orthopedic , otolaryngology, plastic , podiatric , transplant , trauma , urology, vascular , and pediatric . In some centers, anesthesiology is part of the division of  (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.\r\n\r\nSurgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of  often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming.\r\n\r\nInternal specialty[edit]\r\nMain article: Internal Medicine\r\nInternal medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.[20] In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called \"internists\". Elsewhere, especially in Commonwealth nations, such specialists are often called physicians.[21] These terms, internist or physician (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially  and its subspecialities.\r\n\r\nBecause their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.[22]\r\n\r\nIn the Commonwealth of Nations and some other countries, specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as specialist physicians (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of Primary care.\r\n\r\nThere are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of internal medicine:\r\n\r\nAngiology/Vascular Medicine\r\nCardiology\r\nCritical care medicine\r\nEndocrinology\r\nGastroenterology\r\nGeriatrics\r\nHematology\r\nHepatology\r\nInfectious diseases\r\nNephrology\r\nNeurology\r\nOncology\r\nPediatrics\r\nPulmonology/Pneumology/Respirology\r\nRheumatology\r\nTraining in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on Medical education and Physician for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in , averaging about 60 hours per week in the USA. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic specialties[edit]\r\nClinical laboratory sciences are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, clinical chemistry, hematology, clinical microbiology and clinical immunology.\r\nPathology as a medical specialty is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in evidence-based medicine. Many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.\r\nRadiology is concerned with imaging of the human body, e.g. by x-rays, x-ray computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography.\r\nNuclear medicine is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a gamma camera or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.\r\nClinical neurophysiology is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.\r\nOther major specialties[edit]\r\nThe followings are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups.\r\n\r\nAnesthesiology (also known as anaesthetics): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist\'s role during  is to prevent derangement in the vital organs\' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also served the same function in the labor & delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.\r\nDermatology is concerned with the skin and its diseases. In the UK, dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine.\r\nEmergency medicine is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including trauma, surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.\r\nFamily medicine, family practice, general practice or primary care is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency room coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.\r\nObstetrics and gynecology (often abbreviated as OB/GYN (American English) or Obs & Gynae (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. Reproductive medicine and fertility medicine are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.\r\nMedical Genetics is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.\r\nNeurology is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.\r\nOphthalmology exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa, combining conservative and surgical therapy.\r\nPediatrics (AE) or paediatrics (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.\r\nPharmaceutical medicine is the medical scientific discipline concerned with the discovery, development, evaluation, registration, monitoring and medical aspects of marketing of medicines for the benefit of patients and public health.\r\nPhysical medicine and rehabilitation (or physiatry) is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or congenital disorders.\r\nPodiatric medicine study of, diagnosis, and medical & surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.\r\nPsychiatry is the branch of medicine concerned with the bio-psycho-social study of the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cognitive, perceptual, emotional and behavioral disorders. Related non-medical fields include psychotherapy and clinical psychology.\r\nPreventive medicine is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.\r\nCommunity health or public health is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis.\r\nInterdisciplinary fields[edit]\r\nSome interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine include:\r\n\r\nAerospace medicine deals with medical problems related to flying and space travel.\r\nAddiction medicine deals with the treatment of addiction.\r\nMedical ethics deals with ethical and moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine.\r\nBiomedical Engineering is a field dealing with the application of engineering principles to medical practice.\r\nClinical pharmacology is concerned with how systems of therapeutics interact with patients.\r\nConservation medicine studies the relationship between human and animal health, and environmental conditions. Also known as ecological medicine, environmental medicine, or medical geology.\r\nDisaster medicine deals with medical aspects of emergency preparedness, disaster mitigation and management.\r\nDiving medicine (or hyperbaric medicine) is the prevention and treatment of diving-related problems.\r\nEvolutionary medicine is a perspective on medicine derived through applying evolutionary theory.\r\nForensic medicine deals with medical questions in legal context, such as determination of the time and cause of death, type of weapon used to inflict trauma, reconstruction of the facial features using remains of deceased (skull)thus aiding identification.\r\nGender-based medicine studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease.\r\nHospice and Palliative Medicine is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with terminal illnesses including cancer and heart failure.\r\nHospital medicine is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called hospitalists in the USA and Canada. The term Most Responsible Physician (MRP) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role.\r\nLaser medicine involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics and/or treatment of various conditions.\r\nMedical humanities includes the humanities (literature, philosophy, ethics, history and religion), social science (anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology), and the arts (literature, theater, film, and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice.\r\nMedical informatics, medical computer science, and eHealth are relatively recent fields that deal with the application of computers and information technology to medicine.\r\nNosology is the classification of diseases for various purposes.\r\nNosokinetics is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems.\r\nOccupational medicine\'s principal role is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained.\r\nPain management (also called pain medicine, or algiatry) is the medical discipline concerned with the relief of pain.\r\nPharmacogenomics is a form of individualized medicine.\r\nPodiatric medicine study of, diagnosis, and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.\r\nSexual medicine is concerned with diagnosing, assessing and treating all disorders related to sexuality.\r\nSports medicine deals with the treatment and prevention and rehabilitation of sports/exercise injuries such as muscle spasms, muscle tears, injuries to ligaments (ligament tears or ruptures) and their repair in athletes, amateur and professional.\r\nTherapeutics is the field, more commonly referenced in earlier periods of history, of the various remedies that can be used to treat disease and promote health.[23]\r\nTravel medicine or emporiatrics deals with health problems of international travelers or travelers across highly different environments.\r\nTropical medicine deals with the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. It is studied separately in temperate climates where those diseases are quite unfamiliar to medical practitioners and their local clinical needs.\r\nUrgent care focuses on delivery of unscheduled, walk-in care outside of the hospital emergency department for injuries and illnesses that are not severe enough to require care in an emergency department. In some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency room.\r\nVeterinary medicine; veterinarians apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of animals.\r\nWilderness medicine entails the practice of medicine in the wild, where conventional medical facilities may not be available.\r\nMany other health science fields, e.g. dietetics\r\nEducation[edit]\r\nMain articles: Medical education and Medical school\r\n\r\nPainted by Toulouse-Lautrec in the year of his own death: an examination in the Paris faculty of medicine, 1901\r\n\r\nMedicine section inside a medical library.\r\nMedical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university medical school, followed by a period of supervised practice or internship, and/or residency. This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a Doctor of Medicine degree, often abbreviated M.D., or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in and delivered from a recognized university.\r\n\r\nSince knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require continuing medical education. Medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways, including medical journals, seminars, conferences, and online programs.\r\n\r\nMedical ethics[edit]\r\nMain article: Medical ethics\r\nMedical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:\r\n\r\nautonomy - the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (Voluntas aegroti suprema lex.)\r\nbeneficence - a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (Salus aegroti suprema lex.)\r\njustice - concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).\r\nnon-maleficence - \"first, do no harm\" (primum non nocere).\r\nrespect for persons - the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.\r\ntruthfulness and honesty - the concept of informed consent has increased in importance since the historical events of the Doctors\' Trial of the Nuremberg trials, Tuskegee syphilis experiment, and others.\r\nValues such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions, considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.\r\n\r\nLegal controls[edit]\r\nIn most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in \"evidence based\", Western, or Hippocratic Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.\r\n\r\nIn the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification. The regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC.\r\n\r\nDoctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of medical malpractice and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.\r\n\r\nCriticism of modern medicine[edit]\r\nA major problem for modern medicine has been lack of access in poor regions. There is an \"outcome gap\" between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive-to-treat diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis. The majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich, low-incidence regions such as the West. On the other hand, countries in the developing world have high rates of HIV but lack the necessary resources to treat them.[24]\r\n\r\nMedical errors and overmedication and other forms of iatrogenesis (harms caused by medical treatment) are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage. Practitioners of human factors engineering believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in aviation safety, where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one \"superhuman\" individual and expect him or her not to make errors. Reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice. Clinical versus statistical, algorithmic diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a 1954 book by Paul E. Meehl, which found statistical methods superior.[25] A 2000 meta-analysis comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or \"mechanical\" diagnostic methods were, in general, although not always, superior.[25]\r\n\r\nDisparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy.[26] For example, elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a 2008 study.[27] Rural poor African-American men were used in an infamous study of syphilis that denied them basic medical care.\r\n\r\nHonors and awards[edit]\r\nMain article: Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine\r\nThe highest honor awarded in medicine is the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded since 1901 by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet.\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nMain articles: History of medicine and Timeline of medicine and medical technology\r\nAncient world[edit]\r\n\r\nStatuette of ancient Egyptian physician Imhotep, the first physician from antiquity known by name.\r\nPrehistoric medicine incorporated plants (herbalism), animal parts and minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, shamans, or medicine men. Well-known spiritual systems include animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), spiritualism (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and divination (magically obtaining the truth). The field of medical anthropology examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ancient Greek patient gets medical treatment: this aryballos (circa 480–470 BCE, now in Paris\'s Louvre Museum) probably contained healing oil\r\n\r\nThe Greek physician Hippocrates (ca. 460 BCE – ca. 370 BCE), considered the father of medicine.[28][29]\r\nEarly records on medicine have been discovered from ancient Egyptian medicine, Babylonian medicine, Ayurvedic medicine (in the Indian subcontinent), classical Chinese medicine (predecessor to the modern traditional Chinese Medicine), and ancient Greek medicine and Roman medicine.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, Imhotep (3rd millennium BC) is the first physician in history known by name. The oldest Egyptian medical text is the Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus from around 2000 BCE, which describes gynaecological diseases. The Edwin Smith Papyrus dating back to 1600 BCE is an early work on , while the Ebers Papyrus dating back to 1500 BCE is akin to a textbook on medicine.[30]\r\n\r\nIn China, archaeological evidence of medicine in Chinese dates back to the Bronze Age Shang Dynasty, based on seeds for herbalism and tools presumed to have been used for .[31] The Huangdi Neijing, the progenitor of Chinese medicine, is a medical text written beginning in the 2nd century BCE and compiled in the 3rd century.[32]\r\n\r\nIn India, the surgeon Sushruta described numerous surgical operations, including the earliest forms of plastic .[33][dubious – discuss][34][35] Earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from Mihintale in Sri Lanka where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found.[36][37]\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the Greek physician Hippocrates, the \"father of medicine\",[28][29] laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine. Hippocrates introduced the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, \"exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence\".[38][39] The Greek physician Galen was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations, including brain and eye surgeries. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the onset of the Early Middle Ages, the Greek tradition of medicine went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued uninterrupted in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.\r\n\r\nMost of our knowledge of ancient Hebrew medicine during the 1st millennium BC comes from the Torah, i.e. the Five Books of Moses, which contain various health related laws and rituals. The Hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the Byzantine Era, with the physician Asaph the Jew.[40]\r\n\r\nMiddle ages[edit]\r\n\r\nA manuscript of Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah by Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imam of Shia Muslims. The text says: \"Golden dissertation in medicine which is sent by Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha, peace be upon him, to al-Ma\'mun.\"\r\nAfter 750 CE, the Muslim world had the works of Hippocrates, Galen and Sushruta translated into Arabic, and Islamic physicians engaged in some significant medical research. Notable Islamic medical pioneers include the Persian polymath, Avicenna, who, along with Imhotep and Hippocrates, has also been called the \"father of medicine\".[41] He wrote The Canon of Medicine, considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine.[42] Others include Abulcasis,[43] Avenzoar,[44] Ibn al-Nafis,[45] and Averroes.[46] Rhazes[47] was one of first to question the Greek theory of humorism, which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval Western and medieval Islamic medicine.[48] Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah by Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imam of Shia Muslims, is revered as the most precious Islamic literature in the Science of Medicine.[49] The Islamic Bimaristan hospitals were an early example of public hospitals.[50][51]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Charlemagne decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian Geoffrey Blainey likened the activities of the Catholic Church in health care during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: \"It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal\". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The Benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great Abbey of Cluny. The Church also established a network of cathedral schools and universities where medicine was studied. The Schola Medica Salernitana in Salerno, looking to the learning of Greek and Arab physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in Medieval Europe.[52]\r\n\r\n\r\nPanorama of Siena\'s Santa Maria della Scala Hospital, one of Europe\'s oldest hospitals. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church established universities which revived the study of sciences - drawing on the learning of Greek and Arab physicians in the study of medicine.\r\nHowever, the fourteenth and fifteenth century Black Death devastated both the Middle East and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East.[53] In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including Gabriele Falloppio and William Harvey.\r\n\r\nThe major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the \'traditional authority\' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see Copernicus\'s rejection of Ptolemy\'s theories on astronomy). Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\nAndreas Vesalius was the author of De humani corporis fabrica, an important book on human anatomy.[54] Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, initiating the scientific field microbiology.[55] Independently from Ibn al-Nafis, Michael Servetus rediscovered the pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the \"Manuscript of Paris\"[56] in 1546, and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553. Later this was described by Renaldus Columbus and Andrea Cesalpino. Herman Boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a \"father of physiology\" due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook \'Institutiones medicae\' (1708). Pierre Fauchard has been called \"the father of modern dentistry\".[57]\r\n\r\nModern[edit]\r\n\r\nPaul-Louis Simond injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898\r\nVeterinary medicine was, for the first time, truly separated from human medicine in 1761, when the French veterinarian Claude Bourgelat founded the world\'s first veterinary school in Lyon, France. Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.\r\n\r\nModern scientific biomedical research (where results are testable and reproducible) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek \"four humours\" and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with Edward Jenner\'s discovery of the smallpox vaccine at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of inoculation earlier practiced in Asia), Robert Koch\'s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of antibiotics around 1900.\r\n\r\nThe post-18th century modernity period brought more groundbreaking researchers from Europe. From Germany and Austria, doctors Rudolf Virchow, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, Karl Landsteiner and Otto Loewi made notable contributions. In the United Kingdom, Alexander Fleming, Joseph Lister, Francis Crick and Florence Nightingale are considered important. Spanish doctor Santiago Ramón y Cajal is considered the father of modern neuroscience.\r\n\r\nFrom New Zealand and Australia came Maurice Wilkins, Howard Florey, and Frank Macfarlane Burnet.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, William Williams Keen, William Coley, James D. Watson, Italy (Salvador Luria), Switzerland (Alexandre Yersin), Japan (Kitasato Shibasabur?), and France (Jean-Martin Charcot, Claude Bernard, Paul Broca and others did significant work). Russian Nikolai Korotkov also did significant work, as did Sir William Osler and Harvey Cushing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Fleming\'s discovery of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern antibiotics.\r\nAs science and technology developed, medicine became more reliant upon medications. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only animal and plant products were used as medicine, but also human body parts and fluids.[58] Pharmacology developed from herbalism and many drugs are still derived from plants (atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, aspirin, digoxin, vinca alkaloids, taxol, hyoscine, etc.). Vaccines were discovered by Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur.\r\n\r\nThe first antibiotic was arsphenamine / Salvarsan discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not. The first major class of antibiotics was the sulfa drugs, derived by German chemists originally from azo dyes.\r\n\r\nPharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated; modern biotechnology allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed, sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce side-effects. Genomics and knowledge of human genetics is having some influence on medicine, as the causative genes of most monogenic genetic disorders have now been identified, and the development of techniques in molecular biology and genetics are influencing medical technology, practice and decision-making.\r\n\r\nEvidence-based medicine is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective algorithms of practice (ways of doing things) through the use of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The movement is facilitated by modern global information science, which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The Cochrane Collaboration leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3\% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20\% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5\% concluded positive effect.[59]\r\n\r\nMythology[edit]\r\n\r\n\r\nHygieia by Gustaf Klimt.

Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2014)\r\nThere are a number of patron saints for physicians, the most important of whom are Saint Luke the Evangelist the physician and disciple of Christ, Saints Cosmas and Damian (3rd-century physicians from Syria), and Saint Pantaleon (4th-century physician from Nicomedia). Archangel Raphael is also considered a patron saint of physicians. In India and in Hinduism, Dhanavantari, a form of Lord Vishnu and \"Vaidyanatha\" meaning \'Lord of Medicine\', a form of Lord Shiva are the patron deities of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe patron saints for surgeons are Saint Luke the Evangelist, the physician and disciple of Christ, Saints Cosmas and Damian (3rd-century physicians from Syria), Saint Quentin (3rd-century saint from France), Saint Foillan (7th-century saint from Ireland), and Saint Roch (14th-century saint from France).\r\n\r\nSee also[edit]\r\nFind more about\r\nMedicine\r\nat Wikipedia\'s sister projects\r\nSearch Wiktionary\tDefinitions from Wiktionary\r\nSearch Wikinews\tNews stories from Wikinews\r\nSearch Wikiquote\tQuotations from Wikiquote\r\nSearch Wikisource\tSource texts from Wikisource\r\nSearch Commons\tMedia from Commons\r\nSearch Wikibooks\tTextbooks from Wikibooks\r\nSearch Wikiversity\tLearning resources from Wikiversity\r\nMain articles: Outline of medicine and Outline of health\r\nList of causes of death by rate\r\nList of disorders\r\nList of important publications in medicine\r\nLists of diseases\r\nMedical encyclopedia\r\nMedical equipment\r\nMedical literature\r\nMedical psychology\r\nMedical sociology\r\nPhilosophy of healthcare\r\nNotes and references[edit]\r\nJump up ^ \"Medicine, n.1\".

Name of the medicinal product\r\nAbidec Multivitamin Drops\r\n2. Qualitative and quantitative composition\r\nAbidec Multivitamin Drops contains 1333 IU retinol (as vitamin A palmitate), 400 IU ergocalciferol solution, 0.4 mg thiamine hydrochloride, 0.8 mg riboflavin, 0.8 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride, 8 mg nicotinamide, and 40 mg ascorbic acid in each 0.6 ml dose.\r\n3. Pharmaceutical form\r\nA yellow to orange brown oral drops solution which darkens upon storage, with some cloudiness.\r\n4. Clinical particulars\r\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\r\nAbidec Multivitamin Drops is indicated for the prevention of vitamin deficiencies and for the maintenance of normal growth and health during the early years of infancy and childhood; multivitamin supplement.\r\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\r\nAdults and children over 12 years:\r\nNot appropriate.\r\nChildren aged 1 to 12 years:\r\nOral. One 0.6 ml dose taken daily.\r\nMaximum daily dose: 0.6 ml\r\nChildren under 1 year:\r\nOral. One 0.3 ml dose taken daily.\r\nMaximum daily dose: 0.3 ml\r\nThe Elderly:\r\nNot appropriate\r\nHepatic/renal dysfunction\r\nNormal dosage is appropriate.\r\n4.3 Contraindications\r\nAbidec Multivitamin Drops is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the product or any of its components including peanut oil.\r\nAbidec Multivitamin Drops contains Arachis oil (peanut oil) and should not be taken by patients known to be allergic to peanut. As there is a possible relationship between allergy to peanut and allergy to Soya, patients with Soya allergy should also avoid Abidec Multivitamin Drops.\r\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\r\nWhen prescribing Abidec Multivitamin Drops, as with all multi-vitamin preparations, allowance should be made for vitamins obtained from other sources.\r\nWhile children are taking Abidec Multivitamin Drops no other vitamin supplement containing vitamins A and D should be taken unless under medical supervision.\r\nThis multivitamin supplement should not be given to babies who are receiving more than 500mls of formula milk per day to avoid exceeding the safe upper limit of Vitamin A.\r\nExcessive dosage of vitamin A and D may lead to hypervitaminoses. Due allowance should always be made for intake of these vitamins from other sources.\r\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.\r\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\r\nNone.\r\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation\r\nNot indicated.\r\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\r\nNone known\r\n4.8 Undesirable effects\r\nVitamin A palmitate\r\nAdverse effects are extremely rare at daily doses of less than 9 mg (16363.6 iu).\r\nErgocalciferol (Vitamin D2)\r\nThe only known adverse effects of vitamin D occur when excessive doses are taken. Adverse effects are not anticipated at the quantity present in Abidec Multivitamin Drops.\r\nAscorbic Acid (C), Nicotinamide, Pyridoxine (B6), Riboflavin (B2) & Thiamine (B1)\r\nThese water soluble vitamins are generally non toxic compounds with a wide margin of safety, the excess amounts being rapidly excreted in the urine. Adverse effects arenot anticipated at the quantities present in Abidec Multivitamin Drops.\r\n4.9 Overdose\r\nSymptoms and signs\r\nAbidec Multivitamin Drops contains levels of vitamins which present little risk in overdose.\r\nVitamin A palmitate\r\nAcute administration of high doses of vitamin A can cause headache, nausea, vomiting and irritability. In infants acute toxicity can lead to transient hydrocephalus. All these effects disappear within 24 hours of taking retinol.\r\nErgocalciferol (Vitamin D2)\r\nExcessive doses of vitamin D, 60 000 units per day, can result in hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. Adverse effects of hypercalcaemia may include muscle weakness, apathy, headache, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.\r\nThiamine hydrochloride (Vitamin B1)\r\nWhen taken orally, thiamine is non-toxic. If large doses are ingested they are not stored by the body but excreted unchanged by the kidneys.\r\nRiboflavin (Vitamin B2)\r\nRiboflavin has been found to be practically non-toxic.\r\nPyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B6)\r\nAcute doses less than 500mg per day appear to be safe. Excessive doses may lower serum folate concentrations. Sensory neuropathy has been described with chronic dosing of 200 mg daily.\r\nNicotinamide\r\nA single large overdose of nicotinamide is unlikely to have serious ill effects, though transient abnormalities of liver function might occur.\r\nAscorbic acid (Vitamin C)\r\nAscorbic acid is not stored to a great extent by the body, any excess amounts are eliminated in the urine. Ascorbic acid is thought to become toxic at chronic doses in excess of 6 g.\r\nTreatment\r\nTreatment should be supportive and symptomatic.\r\n5. Pharmacological properties\r\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\r\nVitamin A palmitate\r\nVitamin A plays an essential role in the function of the retina, the growth and function of epithelial tissue, bone growth, reproduction and embryonic development.\r\nErgocalciferol (Vitamin D2)\r\nVitamin D is a regulator of both calcium and phosphate homeostasis.\r\nThiamine hydrochloride (Vitamin B1)\r\nVitamin B1 is essential for proper carbohydrate metabolism and plays an essential role in the decarboxylation of alpha keto acids.\r\nRiboflavin (Vitamin B2)\r\nRiboflavin is essential for the utilisation of energy from food. It is a component of co-enzymes which play an essential role in oxidative/ reductive metabolic reactions. Riboflavin is also necessary for the functioning of pyridoxine and nicotinic acid.\r\nPyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B6)\r\nVitamin B6 is a constituent of the co-enzymes, pyridoxal pyrophosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate, both of which play an important role in protein metabolism.\r\nNicotinamide\r\nNicotinamide is an essential component of co-enzymes responsible for proper tissue respiration.\r\nAscorbic acid (Vitamin C)\r\nAscorbic acid is a water soluble vitamin and a powerful antioxidant.\r\nIt is a cofactor in numerous biological processes, such as the metabolism of folic acid, amino acid oxidation and the absorption and transport of iron.\r\nIt is also required for the formation, maintenance and repair of intercellular cement material. Ascorbic acid is important in the defence against infection, the normal functioning of T-lymphocytes and for the effective phagocytic activity of leucocytes. It also protects cells against oxidation damage to essential molecules.\r\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\r\nAbsorption\r\nVitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, D2 and nicotinamide are well absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract.\r\nDistribution\r\nThe vitamins present in Abidec Multivitamin Drops are widely distributed to all tissues in the body.\r\nMetabolism and elimination\r\nVitamin A palmitate\r\nVitamin A palmitate is hydrolysed in the intestinal lumen to retinol which is then absorbed. Retinol circulates in the blood bound to retinol binding protein which protects it from glomerular filtration. The complex circulates to target tissues where the vitamin is released, permeates the cell and binds intracellularly to cellular retinol binding protein. Of the absorbed retinol 20 - 50 \% is either conjugated or oxidised to various products and excreted over a matter of days in the urine and faeces, while the remainder is stored. This stored retinol is gradually metabolised by the liver and peripheral tissues.\r\nErgocalciferol (Vitamin D2)\r\nVitamin D circulates in the blood associated with vitamin D binding protein. It is stored in fat deposits. Ergocalciferol is hydroxylated in the liver and gut to 25-hydroxy colecalciferol which is then further metabolised in the kidney to the active form 1,25-dihydroxycolecalciferol and other hydroxylated metabolites. Ergocalciferol and its metabolites are excreted largely in bile with eventual elimination in the faeces, with only small amounts of some of the metabolites appearing in the urine.\r\nThiamine hydrochloride (Vitamin B1)\r\nThiamine has a plasma half life of 24 hours and is not stored to any great extent in the body. Excess ingested thiamine is excreted in the urine as either the free vitamin or as the metabolite, pyrimidine.\r\nRiboflavin (Vitamin B2)\r\nFollowing absorption riboflavin is converted into the co-enzymes: flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).\r\nRiboflavin is not stored in body tissues to any great extent and amounts in excess of the body\'s requirements are excreted in the urine largely unchanged.\r\nPyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B6)\r\nThe half life of pyridoxine ranges from 15 - 20 days. Once absorbed vitamin B6 is converted to its active co-enzyme form pyridoxal 5-phosphate. Muscle is the major storage site for pyridoxal 5-phosphate. It is degraded in the liver to 4-pyridoxic acid which is eliminated by the kidneys.\r\nNicotinamide\r\nNicotinamide is readily taken up into tissues and utilised for the synthesis of the co-enzyme forms nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Nicotinamide is degraded in the liver and other organs to a number of products that are excreted in the urine, the major metabolites being n-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and n-methylnicotinamide.\r\nAscorbic acid (Vitamin C)\r\nAscorbic acid reaches a maximum plasma concentration 4 hours following oral administration after which there is rapid urinary excretion. Following oral administration 60 \% of the dose is excreted in 24 hours either as ascorbic acid or its metabolite dihydroascorbic acid.\r\nPharmacokinetics in Renal Impairment\r\nThere have been no specific studies of Abidec Multivitamin Drops in renal impairment.\r\nPharmacokinetics in the Elderly\r\nNot appropriate.\r\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\r\nMutagenicity\r\nThere is insufficient information to determine the mutagenic potential of the active ingredients. However very large doses of vitamin C are claimed to be mutagenic.\r\nCarcinogenicity\r\nThere is insufficient information to determine the carcinogenic potential of the active ingredients.\r\nTeratogenicity\r\nHigh doses of vitamin D are known to be teratogenic in experimental animals, but direct evidence for this is lacking in humans.\r\nThe teratogenicity of vitamin A in animals is well known, both high and low levels of the vitamin result in defects. But the significance of this for humans is in dispute. Synthetic versions of vitamin A (Isotretinoin and Etretinate) have been shown to be powerful teratogens. There is insufficient information to determine the teratogenic potential of the other active ingredients.\r\nFertility\r\nNot appropriate.\r\n6.

Name of the medicinal product\r\nABILIFY 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection\r\n2. Qualitative and quantitative composition\r\nEach ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole.\r\nEach vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole.\r\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\r\n3. Pharmaceutical form\r\nSolution for injection\r\nClear, colourless, aqueous solution.\r\n4. Clinical particulars\r\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\r\nABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.\r\nTreatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated.\r\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\r\nPosology\r\nAdults\r\nThe recommended initial dose for aripiprazole solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered as a single intramuscular injection. The effective dose range of aripiprazole solution for injection is 5.25-15 mg as a single injection. A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of individual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5). A second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual clinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period.\r\nThe maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of aripiprazole).\r\nIf continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution.\r\nPaediatric population\r\nThere is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\r\nPatients with hepatic impairment\r\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\r\nPatients with renal impairment\r\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\nOlder people\r\nThe effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).\r\nGender\r\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).\r\nSmoking status\r\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).\r\nDose adjustments due to interactions\r\nWhen concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).\r\nWhen concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).\r\nMethod of administration\r\nABILIFY solution for injection is for intramuscular use.\r\nTo enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended.\r\nABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. ABILIFY solution for injection is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1).\r\n4.3 Contraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\r\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\r\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has not been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder.\r\nSimultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be associated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5).\r\nPatients receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly.\r\nThe safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products).\r\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\'s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.\r\nSuicidality\r\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy. Results of an epidemiological study suggested that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There are insufficient paediatric data to evaluate this risk in younger patients (below 18 years of age), but there is evidence that the risk of suicide persists beyond the first 4 weeks of treatment for atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole.\r\nCardiovascular disorders\r\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.\r\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic drugs. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with ABILIFY and preventive measures undertaken.\r\nConduction abnormalities\r\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.\r\nTardive dyskinesia\r\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.\r\nOther extrapyramidal symptoms\r\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and parkinsonism were observed. If signs and symptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking ABILIFY, dose reduction and close clinical monitoring should be considered.\r\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\r\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products. In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.\r\nSeizure\r\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.\r\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis\r\nIncreased mortality\r\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 \% compared to 1.7 \% in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature.\r\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions\r\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 \% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 \% of placebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole.\r\nABILIFY is not indicated for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.\r\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\r\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY. Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.\r\nHypersensitivity\r\nAs with other medicinal products, hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).\r\nWeight gain\r\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY. When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar mania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically significant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8).\r\nDysphagia\r\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic treatment, including ABILIFY. Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic active substances should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.\r\nPathological gambling\r\nPost-marketing reports of pathological gambling have been reported among patients prescribed ABILIFY, regardless of whether these patients had a prior history of gambling. Patients with a prior history of pathological gambling may be at increased risk and should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8).\r\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity\r\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are available on concomitant use of ABILIFY and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be taken when these drugs are co-administered.\r\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\r\nDue to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.\r\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse reactions such as sedation (see section 4.8).\r\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.\r\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY\r\nThe administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone.\r\nA gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.\r\nAripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.\r\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors\r\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 \%, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 \% and 47 \%. ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs. Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.\r\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors\r\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 \% and 37 \%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 \% and 43 \%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.\r\nUpon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.\r\nWhen weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.\r\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers\r\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 \% and 73 \% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 \% and 71 \% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.\r\nABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine. Other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.\r\nValproate and lithium\r\nWhen either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.\r\nSerotonin syndrome\r\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and symptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic drugs, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with drugs that are known to increase aripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8).\r\nPotential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products\r\nThe administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone.\r\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.\r\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there was no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations.\r\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\r\nPregnancy\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital anomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\r\nNeonates exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully.\r\nBreast-feeding\r\nAripiprazole is excreted in human breast milk. Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.\r\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\r\nAs with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely. Some paediatric patients with Bipolar I Disorder have an increased incidence of somnolence and fatigue (see section 4.8).\r\n4.8 Undesirable effects\r\nSummary of the safety profile\r\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials are nausea, dizziness and somnolence each occurring in more than 3 \% of patients treated with aripiprazole solution for injection.\r\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\r\nThe following adverse reactions occurred more often (≥ 1/100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*) in clinical trials with aripiprazole solution for injection (see section 5.1).\r\nThe frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100).\r\nNervous system disorders\r\nCommon: somnolence, dizziness, headache, akathisia\r\nCardiac disorders\r\nUncommon: tachycardia*\r\nVascular disorders\r\nUncommon: orthostatic hypotension*, increased diastolic blood pressure*\r\nGastrointestinal disorders\r\nCommon: nausea, vomiting\r\nUncommon: dry mouth*\r\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\r\nUncommon: fatigue*\r\nThe following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*) in clinical trials with oral formulations of aripiprazole (see section 5.1):\r\nPsychiatric disorders\r\nCommon: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety\r\nUncommon: depression*\r\nNervous system disorders\r\nCommon: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache\r\nEye disorders\r\nCommon: blurred vision\r\nUncommon: diplopia\r\nCardiac disorders\r\nUncommon: tachycardia*\r\nVascular disorders\r\nUncommon: orthostatic hypotension*\r\nGastrointestinal disorders\r\nCommon: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion\r\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\r\nCommon: fatigue\r\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\r\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):\r\nSchizophrenia:- in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8 \%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3 \%). In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19 \% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 \% for placebo-treated patients. In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 \% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 \% for olanzapine-treated patients. Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 \% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 \% for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6 \% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 \% for those treated with lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2 \% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 \% for placebo-treated patients.\r\nAkathisia\r\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 \% with aripiprazole and 3.2 \% with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 \% with aripiprazole and 3.0 \% with placebo.\r\nDystonia\r\nClass Effect - Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.\r\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no medically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 \% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 \% of patients who received placebo.\r\nOther findings\r\nAdverse reactions known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse reactions and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).\r\nPaediatric population\r\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older\r\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with schizophrenia, the frequency and type of undesirable effects were similar to those in adults except for the following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving oral aripiprazole than in adults receiving oral aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): somnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (≥ 1/10), and dry mouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (≥ 1/100, < 1/10).\r\nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled trial.\r\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 29.5 \% and 48.3 \%, respectively.\r\nIn the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole exposure of 5 to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 25.6 \% and 45.0 \%, respectively.\r\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older\r\nThe frequency and type of undesirable effects in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to those in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (≥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0 \%), extrapyramidal disorder (18.4 \%), akathisia (16.0 \%), and fatigue (11.8 \%); and commonly (≥ 1/100, < 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle twitching, and dyskinesia.\r\nThe following undesirable effects had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder (incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 \%, 30 mg, 28.8 \%, placebo, 1.7 \%,); and akathisia (incidences were 10 mg, 12.1 \%, 30 mg, 20.3 \%, placebo, 1.7 \%).\r\nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for aripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively.\r\nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with bipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia.\r\nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10-17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 28.0 \% and 53.3 \%, respectively.\r\nPost-Marketing\r\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during post-marketing surveillance. The frequency of these reactions is considered not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\r\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\r\nleukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia\r\nImmune system disorders:\r\nallergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema including swollen tongue, tongue oedema, face oedema, pruritus, or urticaria)\r\nEndocrine disorders:\r\nhyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmolar coma\r\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders:\r\nweight gain, weight decreased, anorexia, hyponatremia\r\nPsychiatric disorders:\r\nagitation, nervousness, pathological gambling; suicide attempt, suicidal ideation, and completed suicide (see section 4.4)\r\nNervous system disorders:\r\nspeech disorder, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), grand mal convulsion, serotonin syndrome\r\nCardiac disorders:\r\nQT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, sudden unexplained death, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, bradycardia\r\nVascular disorders:\r\nsyncope, hypertension, venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis)\r\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:\r\noropharyngeal spasm, laryngospasm, aspiration pneumonia\r\nGastrointestinal disorders:\r\npancreatitis, dysphagia, abdominal discomfort, stomach discomfort, diarrhoea\r\nHepatobiliary disorders:\r\nhepatic failure, jaundice, hepatitis, increased Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), increased Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), increased alkaline phosphatase\r\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\r\nrash, photosensitivity reaction, alopecia, hyperhidrosis\r\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:\r\nrhabdomyolysis, myalgia, stiffness\r\nRenal and urinary disorders:\r\nurinary incontinence, urinary retention\r\nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions:\r\ndrug withdrawal syndrome neonatal (see section 4.6)\r\nReproductive system and breast disorders:\r\npriapism\r\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\r\ntemperature regulation disorder (e.g. hypothermia, pyrexia), chest pain, peripheral oedema\r\nInvestigations:\r\nincreased Creatine Phosphokinase, blood glucose increased, blood glucose fluctuation, glycosylated haemoglobin increased\r\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\r\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard.\r\n4.9 Overdose\r\nSigns and symptoms\r\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.\r\nManagement of overdose\r\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\r\nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 \% and AUC by about 51 \%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.\r\nHaemodialysis\r\nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.\r\n5. Pharmacological properties\r\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\r\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12\r\nMechanism of action\r\nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole\'s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.\r\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.\r\nClinical efficacy and safety\r\nAgitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with aripiprazole solution for injection\r\nIn two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic adult patients presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol. In one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for aripiprazole. In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size.\r\nSchizophrenia with oral aripiprazole\r\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.\r\nABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult patients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (oral aripiprazole 77 \% and haloperidol 73 \%). The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43 \%) than for oral haloperidol (30 \%). Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.\r\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 \% in oral aripiprazole group and 57 \% in placebo.\r\nWeight gain :in clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7 \% weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 \% of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine (n = 45, or 33 \% of evaluable patients).\r\nLipid parameters: in a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL.\r\n-Total cholesterol: incidence of changes in levels from normal (<5.18 mmol/l) to high (≥ 6.22 mmol/l) was 2.5 \% for aripiprazole and 2.8 \% for placebo and mean change from baseline was -0.15 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.182, -0.115) for aripiprazole and -0.11 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.148, -0.066) for placebo.\r\n-Fasting triglycerides: incidence of changes in levels from normal (<1.69 mmol/l) to high (≥ 2.26 mmol/l) was 7.4 \% for aripiprazole and 7.0 \% for placebo and mean change from baseline was -0.11 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.182, -0.046) for aripiprazole and -0.07 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.148, 0.007) for placebo.\r\n-HDL: incidence of changes in levels from normal (≥ 1.04 mmol/l) to low (<1.04 mmol/l) was 11.4 \% for aripiprazole and 12.5 \% for placebo and mean change from baseline was -0.03 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.046, -0.017) for aripiprazole and -0.04 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.056, -0.022) for placebo.\r\n-Fasting LDL: incidence of changes in levels from normal (<2.59 mmol/l) to high (≥ 4.14 mmol/l) was 0.6 \% for aripiprazole and 0.7 \% for placebo and mean change from baseline was -0.09 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.139, -0.047) for aripiprazole and -0.06 mmol/l (95 \% CI: -0.116, -0.012) for placebo.\r\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole\r\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.\r\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.\r\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.\r\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.\r\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.\r\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores ≤ 12) on aripiprazole (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 \% decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in preventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 \% decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo on the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania).\r\nIn this trial, patients were assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine partial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination of aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer.\r\nStabilized patients were then randomised to continue the same mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were assessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; placebo + valproate.\r\nThe Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive treatment arm were 16 \% in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 \% in aripiprazole + valproate compared to 45 \% in placebo + lithium and 19 \% in placebo + valproate.\r\nPaediatric population\r\nSchizophrenia in adolescents with oral aripiprazole\r\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.\r\nIn a sub-analysis of the adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 \% of the total enrolled population, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial.\r\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents with oral aripiprazole\r\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents (10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score ≥20 at baseline. Among the patients included in the primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD.\r\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS total score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients with associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no difference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established.\r\nTable 1: Mean improvement from baseline YMRS score by psychiatric comorbidity\r\nPsychiatric comorbidities\r\nWeek 4\r\nWeek 12\r\nADHD\r\nWeek 4\r\nWeek 12\r\nABILIFY 10 mg (n = 48)\r\n14.9\r\n15.1\r\nABILIFY 10 mg (n = 44)\r\n15.2\r\n15.6\r\nABILIFY 30 mg (n = 51)\r\n16.7\r\n16.9\r\nABILIFY 30 mg (n = 48)\r\n15.9\r\n16.7\r\nPlacebo (n = 52)a\r\n7.0\r\n8.2\r\nPlacebo (n = 47)b\r\n6.3\r\n7.0\r\nNo psychiatric comorbidities\r\nWeek 4\r\nWeek 12\r\nNo ADHD\r\nWeek 4\r\nWeek 12\r\nABILIFY 10 mg (n = 27)\r\n12.8\r\n15.9\r\nABILIFY 10 mg (n = 37)\r\n12.7\r\n15.7\r\nABILIFY 30 mg (n = 25)\r\n15.3\r\n14.7\r\nABILIFY 30 mg (n = 30)\r\n14.6\r\n13.4\r\nPlacebo (n = 18)\r\n9.4\r\n9.7\r\nPlacebo (n = 25)\r\n9.9\r\n10.0\r\na n = 51 at Week 4\r\nb n = 46 at Week 4\r\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were extrapyramidal disorder (28.3 \%), somnolence (27.3 \%), headache (23.2 \%), and nausea (14.1 \%). Mean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients treated with placebo.\r\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with ABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\r\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\r\nAbsorption\r\nAripiprazole solution for injection administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and has an absolute bioavailability of 100 \%. The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90 \% greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations. In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing.\r\nDistribution\r\nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 \% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.\r\nBiotransformation\r\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 \% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.\r\nElimination\r\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.\r\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic.\r\nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 \% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 \% in the faeces. Less than 1 \% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 \% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.\r\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups\r\nPaediatric population\r\nThe pharmacokinetics of oral aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights.\r\nOlder people\r\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.\r\nGender\r\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.\r\nSmoking and Race\r\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.\r\nRenal impairment\r\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.\r\nHepatic impairment:\r\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.\r\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\r\nAdministration of aripiprazole solution for injection was well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures (AUC) that were 15 and 5 times, respectively, human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular. In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies, no new safety concerns were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 (rat) and 29 (rabbit) times human exposure at 30 mg.\r\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development.\r\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/kg/day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose). The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.\r\nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/kg/day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m2). However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6 \% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6 \%) their limits of in vitro solubility.\r\nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable to that observed in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse effects on development.\r\nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic. Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.\r\n6.

Company studies proved that each drug, on its own, works and is safe. But what about when they are taken together?\r\n\r\nBy mining tens of thousands of electronic patient records, researchers at Stanford University quickly discovered an unexpected answer: people who take both drugs have higher blood glucose levels. The effect was even greater in diabetics, for whom excess blood sugar is a health danger. \r\n\r\nThe research is an example of the increasing ease with which scientists now scour digitized medical results, like glucose tests and drug prescriptions, to find hidden patterns. “You’re not constrained by the need to actually get patients lined up in a clinical trial that would be incredibly expensive,? says Russ Altman, director of Stanford’s Biomedical Informatics Training Program, whose group published the Paxil/Pravachol result in the journal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics this July. “We had most of this paper done probably in a month.?\r\n\r\nThe spread of electronic patient records, with their computer-readable entries, is opening new possibilities for medical data mining. Instead of being limited to carefully planned studies on volunteers, scientists can increasingly carry out research virtually by sifting through troves of data collected from the unplanned experiments of real life, as preserved in medical records from scores of hospitals.\r\n\r\nSuch techniques are allowing researchers to ask questions never envisioned at the time of a drug’s approval, such as how a medicine might affect particular ethnicities. They are also being used to uncover evidence of economic problems, such as overbilling and unnecessary procedures. Mining of health records “is going to build advancements in research, but also efficiencies in the health delivery system,? says Margaret Anderson, executive director of FasterCures, a think tank in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nSome large hospital systems that use electronic records now employ full-time database research teams. Laurence Meyer, associate chief of staff for research at the Salt Lake City Veterans Administration Medical Center, says he knows of more than 100 research projects using electronic records from the VA’s six million patients, who are seen at 152 hospitals and 804 outpatient clinics across the country.\r\n\r\nPAGE1\r\n2\r\nCONTINUE\r\nNext in this Business Report:\r\nTechnology Listens as Doctors Keep Talking\r\n\r\nCONTINUE\r\n0 COMMENTS about this story.

'\r\n\r\nSurgery\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\nThis article is about the medical specialty. For other uses, see Surgery (disambiguation).\r\n\r\n\r\nOperations\r\nSurgery (from the Greek: χει?ου?γική cheirourgikē (composed of χεί?, \"hand\", and ἔ?γον, \"work\"), via Latin: chirurgiae, meaning \"hand work\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum).\r\n\r\nAn act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure, operation, or simply surgery. In this context, the verb operate means to perform surgery. The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments or surgical nurse. The patient or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. A surgeon is a person who practises surgery and a surgeon\'s assistant is a person who practices surgical assistance. A surgical team is made up of surgeon, surgeon\'s assistant, anesthesia provider, circulating nurse and surgical technologist. Surgery usually spans minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term surgery can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.\r\n\r\nElective surgery generally refers to a surgical procedure that can be scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency.

Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as angioplasty or endoscopy, may be considered surgery if they involve \"common\" surgical procedure or settings, such as use of a sterile environment, anesthesia, antiseptic conditions, typical surgical instruments, and suturing or stapling. All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; so-called \"noninvasive surgery\" usually refers to an excision that does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. laser ablation of the cornea) or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).\r\n\r\nTypes of surgery[edit]\r\nSurgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.\r\n\r\nBased on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient\'s request, subject to the surgeon\'s and the surgical facility\'s availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time.\r\nBased on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.\r\nBy type of procedure: Amputation involves cutting off a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration is also an example. Resection is the removal of all or part of an internal organ or part of the body. Replantation involves reattaching a severed body part. Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. Cosmetic surgery is done to improve the appearance of an otherwise normal structure. Excision is the cutting out or removal of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the patient. Transplant surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.\r\nBy body part: When surgery is performed on one organ system or structure, it may be classed by the organ, organ system or tissue involved. Examples include cardiac surgery (performed on the heart), gastrointestinal surgery (performed within the digestive tract and its accessory organs), and orthopedic surgery (performed on bones and/or muscles).\r\nBy degree of invasiveness: Minimally invasive surgery involves smaller outer incision(s) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in laparoscopic surgery or angioplasty. By contrast, an open surgical procedure or laparotomy requires a large incision to access the area of interest.\r\nBy equipment used: Laser surgery involves use of a laser for cutting tissue instead of a scalpel or similar surgical instruments. Microsurgery involves the use of an operating microscope for the surgeon to see small structures. Robotic surgery makes use of a surgical robot, such as the Da Vinci or the Zeus surgical systems, to control the instrumentation under the direction of the surgeon.\r\nTerminology[edit]\r\nExcision surgery names often start with a name for the organ to be excised (cut out) and end in -ectomy.\r\nProcedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in -otomy. A surgical procedure cutting through the abdominal wall to gain access to the abdominal cavity is a laparotomy.\r\nMinimally invasive procedures involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted end in -oscopy. For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called laparoscopy.\r\nProcedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a stoma in the body end in -ostomy.\r\nReconstruction, plastic or cosmetic surgery of a body part starts with a name for the body part to be reconstructed and ends in -oplasty. Rhino is used as a prefix for \"nose\", therefore a rhinoplasty is reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose.\r\nRepair of damaged or congenital abnormal structure ends in -rraphy. Herniorraphy is the reparation of a hernia, while perineorraphy is the reparation of perineum.\r\nReoperation (return to the operating room) refers to a return to the operating theater after an initial surgery is performed to re-address an aspect of patient care best treated surgically. Reasons for reoperation include persistent bleeding after surgery, development of or persistence of infection or, more insidiously, retained foreign objects.\r\nDescription of surgical procedure[edit]\r\nLocation[edit]\r\nAt a hospital, modern surgery is often done in an operating theater using surgical instruments, an operating table for the patient, and other equipment. Among United States hospitalizations for nonmaternal and nonneonatal conditions in 2012, more than one-fourth of stays and half of hospital costs involved stays that included operating room (OR) procedures.[1] The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of aseptic technique: the strict separation of \"sterile\" (free of microorganisms) things from \"unsterile\" or \"contaminated\" things. All surgical instruments must be sterilized, and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire (scrubs, a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure. There is moderate-quality evidence that usage of two layers of gloves compared to single gloving during surgery reduces perforations and blood stains on the skin, indicating a decrease in percutaneous exposure incidents.[2]\r\n\r\nPatient Safety[edit]\r\nThe Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality suggests that patients should ask your doctor questions.\r\n\r\nPreoperative care[edit]\r\nMain article: Preoperative care\r\nPrior to surgery, the patient is given a medical examination, certain pre-operative tests, and their physical status is rated according to the ASA physical status classification system. If these results are satisfactory, the patient signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an autologous blood donation may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the digestive system, the patient may be instructed to perform a bowel prep by drinking a solution of polyethylene glycol the night before the procedure. Patients are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an NPO order after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the patient vomits during or after the procedure.\r\n\r\nSome medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly.[3] In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray.[3] Routine x-ray examination is more likely to result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient.[3] Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.[4]\r\n\r\nStaging for surgery[edit]\r\nIn the pre-operative holding area, the patient changes out of his or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details of his or her surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover all of the patient\'s body except for the head[citation needed] and the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an \"ether screen\", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist\'s working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).\r\n\r\nAnesthesia is administered to prevent pain from incision, tissue manipulation and suturing. Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided locally or as general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable. With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the patient can remain conscious or minimally sedated. In contrast, general anesthesia renders the patient unconscious and paralyzed during surgery. The patient is intubated and is placed on a mechanical ventilator, and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents. Choice of surgical method and anaesthetic technique aims to reduce risk of complications, shorten time needed for recovery and minimise the surgical stress response.\r\n\r\nSurgery[edit]\r\nAn incision is made to access the surgical site. Blood vessels may be clamped or cauterized to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open. The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then peritoneum. In certain cases, bone may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the skull for brain surgery or cutting the sternum for thoracic (chest) surgery to open up the rib cage. Whilst in surgery health and safety is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeon will remove hair from the face and eyes, using a head hat. Hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly to prevent germs getting into the operated body, then gloves are placed onto the hands. A PVC apron will be worn at all times, to stop any contamination. A yellow substance – typically an antiseptic iodine solution – is lighly coated onto the located area of the patient\'s body that will be performed on, this stops germs and disease infecting areas of the body, whilst the patient is being cut into.\r\n\r\nWork to correct the problem in body then proceeds. This work may involve:\r\n\r\nexcision – cutting out an organ, tumor,[5] or other tissue.\r\nresection – partial removal of an organ or other bodily structure.\r\nreconnection of organs, tissues, etc., particularly if severed. Resection of organs such as intestines involves reconnection. Internal suturing or stapling may be used. Surgical connection between blood vessels or other tubular or hollow structures such as loops of intestine is called anastomosis.\r\nReduction – the movement or realignment of a body part to its normal position. e.g. Reduction of a broken nose involves the physical manipulation of the bone and/or cartilage from their displaced state back to their original position to restore normal airflow and aesthetics.\r\nligation – tying off blood vessels, ducts, or \"tubes\".\r\ngrafts – may be severed pieces of tissue cut from the same (or different) body or flaps of tissue still partly connected to the body but resewn for rearranging or restructuring of the area of the body in question. Although grafting is often used in cosmetic surgery, it is also used in other surgery. Grafts may be taken from one area of the patient\'s body and inserted to another area of the body. An example is bypass surgery, where clogged blood vessels are bypassed with a graft from another part of the body. Alternatively, grafts may be from other persons, cadavers, or animals.\r\ninsertion of prosthetic parts when needed. Pins or screws to set and hold bones may be used. Sections of bone may be replaced with prosthetic rods or other parts. Sometime a plate is inserted to replace a damaged area of skull. Artificial hip replacement has become more common. Heart pacemakers or valves may be inserted. Many other types of prostheses are used.\r\ncreation of a stoma, a permanent or semi-permanent opening in the body\r\nin transplant surgery, the donor organ (taken out of the donor\'s body) is inserted into the recipient\'s body and reconnected to the recipient in all necessary ways (blood vessels, ducts, etc.).\r\narthrodesis – surgical connection of adjacent bones so the bones can grow together into one. Spinal fusion is an example of adjacent vertebrae connected allowing them to grow together into one piece.\r\nmodifying the digestive tract in bariatric surgery for weight loss.\r\nrepair of a fistula, hernia, or prolapse\r\nother procedures, including:\r\nclearing clogged ducts, blood or other vessels\r\nremoval of calculi (stones)\r\ndraining of accumulated fluids\r\ndebridement- removal of dead, damaged, or diseased tissue\r\nSurgery has also been conducted to separate conjoined twins.\r\nSex change operations\r\nBlood or blood expanders may be administered to compensate for blood lost during surgery. Once the procedure is complete, sutures or staples are used to close the incision. Once the incision is closed, the anesthetic agents are stopped and/or reversed, and the patient is taken off ventilation and extubated (if general anesthesia was administered).[6]\r\n\r\nPost-operative care[edit]\r\nAfter completion of surgery, the patient is transferred to the post anesthesia care unit and closely monitored. When the patient is judged to have recovered from the anesthesia, he/she is either transferred to a surgical ward elsewhere in the hospital or discharged home. During the post-operative period, the patient\'s general function is assessed, the outcome of the procedure is assessed, and the surgical site is checked for signs of infection. There are several risk factors associated with postoperative complications, such as immune deficienty and obesity. Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for adverse post-surgical outcomes. It has been linked to many disorders such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atelectasis and pulmonary embolism, adverse cardiovascular effects, and wound healing complications.[7] If removable skin closures are used, they are removed after 7 to 10 days post-operatively, or after healing of the incision is well under way.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for surgical drains (see Drain (surgery)) to be required to remove blood or fluid from the surgical wound during recovery. Mostly these drains stay in until the volume tapers off, then they are removed. These drains can become clogged, leading to retained blood complications or abscess.\r\n\r\nPostoperative therapy may include adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or administration of medication such as anti-rejection medication for transplants. Other follow-up studies or rehabilitation may be prescribed during and after the recovery period.\r\n\r\nThe use of topical antibiotics on surgical wounds does not reduce infection rates in comparison with non-antibiotic ointment or no ointment at all.[8] Antibiotic ointments will irritate the skin, slow healing, and greatly increase risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance.[8] Because of this, they should only be used when a person shows signs of infection and not as a preventative.[8]\r\n\r\nThrough a retrospective analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44\% and 82\% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This “weekday effect? has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.[9]\r\n\r\nEpidemiology[edit]\r\nOf the 38.6 million hospital stays that occurred in U.S. hospitals in 2011, 29\% included at least one operating room procedure. These stays accounted for 48\% of the total $387 billion in hospital costs.[10]\r\n\r\nIn total, there were over 15 million operating room procedures performed in U.S. hospitals in 2011. The overall number of procedures remained stable from 2001-2011.[11]\r\n\r\nA study of data from 2003-2011 showed that U.S. hospital costs were highest for the surgical service line; the surgical service line costs were $17,600 in 2003 and projected to be $22,500 in 2013.[12] For hospital stays in 2012 in the United States, private insurance had the highest percentage of surgical expenditure.[13] Mean hospital costs in the United States in 2012 were highest for surgical stays.[13]\r\n\r\nIn special populations[edit]\r\nElderly people[edit]\r\nOlder adults have widely varying physical health. Frail elderly people are at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients\' recovery trajectories.[14] One frailty scale uses five items: unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed. A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50\% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes.[14] Frail elderly patients (score of 4 or 5) have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.\r\n\r\nOther populations[edit]\r\n[icon]\tThis section requires expansion. (November 2012)\r\nChildren\r\nSurgery on children requires considerations which are not common in adult surgery. Children and adolescents are still developing physically and mentally making it difficult for them to make informed decisions and give consent for surgical treatments. Bariatric surgery in youth is among the controversial topics related to surgery in children.\r\n\r\nSee also: Pediatric surgery and Pediatric plastic surgery\r\nPersons with health conditions\r\nA person with a debilitating medical condition may have special needs during a surgery which a typical patient would not.\r\n\r\nVulnerable populations\r\nDoctors perform surgery with the consent of the patient. Some patients are able to give better informed consent than others. Populations such as incarcerated persons, the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other people who are not able to make decisions with the same authority as a typical patient have special needs when making decisions about their personal healthcare, including surgery.\r\n\r\nIn Low and Middle Income Countries[edit]\r\nIn 2014 the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery was launched to examine the case for surgery as an integral component of global health care and to provide recommendations regarding the delivery of surgical and anesthesia services in low and middle income countries.[15] The primary conclusions of the study were as follows:\r\n\r\nFive billion people worldwide lack access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthesia care. Areas in which especially large proportions of the population lack access include Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, Central Asia, and to a lesser extent, Russia and China. Of the estimated 312.9 million surgical procedures undertaken worldwide in 2012, only 6.3\% were done in countries comprising the poorest 37.3\% of the world\'s population.\r\nAn additional 143 million surgeries are needed each year to prevent unnecessary death and disability.\r\n33 million people face catastrophic payments for surgical and anesthesia care each year.\r\nInvestment in surgical and anesthesia services is cost-effective, saves lives, and promotes economic growth\r\nSurgery is an indispensible part of health care.\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nMain articles: History of surgery, Prehistoric medicine and History of general anesthesia\r\n\r\nPlates vi & vii of the Edwin Smith Papyrus, an Egyptian surgical treatise\r\nSurgical treatments date back to the prehistoric era. The oldest for which there is evidence is trepanation,[16] in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull, thus exposing the dura mater in order to treat health problems related to intra cranial pressure and other diseases. Prehistoric surgical techniques are seen in Ancient Egypt, where a mandible dated to approximately 2650 BCE shows two perforations just below the root of the first molar, indicating the draining of an abscessed tooth. Remains from the early Harappan periods of the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300 BCE) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years.[17] Instruments resembling surgical tools have also been found in the archaeological sites of Bronze Age China dating from the Shang Dynasty, along with seeds likely used for herbalism.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nHippocrates stated in the oath (c. 400 BC) that general physicians must never practice surgery and that surgical procedures are to be conducted by specialists.\r\nThe oldest known surgical texts date back to ancient Egypt about 3500 years ago. Surgical operations were performed by priests, specialized in medical treatments similar to today.[19] and the use of sutures to close wounds.[20] Infections were treated with honey.[21] In ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as Asclepieia (Greek: Ασκληπιεία, sing. Asclepieion Ασκληπιείον), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.[22] In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place.[6] The Greek Galen was one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye surgery—that were not tried again for almost two millennia.\r\n\r\n\r\n12th century medieval eye surgery in Italy\r\nIn the Middle East, surgery was developed to a high degree in the Islamic world. Abulcasis (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi), an Andalusian-Arab physician and scientist who practised in the Zahra suburb of Córdoba, wrote medical texts that influenced European surgical procedures.[23]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the demand grew for surgeons to formally study for many years before practicing; universities such as Montpellier, Padua and Bologna were particularly renowned. In the 15th century, Rogerius Salernitanus composed his Chirurgia, laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals. Barber-surgeons generally had a bad reputation that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine, rather than an accessory field.[24] Basic surgical principles for asepsis etc., are known as Halsteads principles.\r\n\r\nEarly modern Europe[edit]\r\n\r\nAmbroise Paré (ca. 1510–1590), father of modern military surgery.\r\nThere were some important advances to the art of surgery during this period. The professor of anatomy at the University of Padua, Andreas Vesalius, was a pivotal figure in the Renaissance transition from classical medicine and anatomy based on the works of Galen, to an empirical approach of \'hands-on\' dissection. In his anatomic treatis, De humani corporis fabrica, he exposed the many anatomical errors in Galen and advocated that all surgeons should train by engaging in practical dissections themselves.\r\n\r\nThe second figure of importance in this era was Ambroise Paré (sometimes spelled \"Ambrose\"[25]), a French army surgeon from the 1530s until his death in 1590. The practice for cauterizing gunshot wounds on the battlefield had been to use boiling oil; an extremely dangerous and painful procedure. Paré began to employ a less irritating emollient, made of egg yolk, rose oil and turpentine. He also described more efficient techniques for the effective ligation of the blood vessels during an amputation.\r\n\r\nModern surgery[edit]\r\n\r\nJohn Syng Dorsey wrote the first American textbook on surgery\r\nThe discipline of surgery was put on a sound, scientific footing during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe. An important figure in this regard was the English surgical scientist, John Hunter, generally regarded as the father of modern scientific surgery.[26] He brought an empirical and experimental approach to the science and was renowned around Europe for the quality of his research and his written works. Hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch; refusing to rely on the testimonies of others he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine the truth of the matter. To aid comparative analysis, he built up a collection of over 13,000 specimens of separate organ systems, from the simplest plants and animals to humans.\r\n\r\nHe greatly advanced knowledge of venereal disease and introduced many new techniques of surgery, including new methods for repairing damage to the Achilles tendon and a more effective method for applying ligature of the arteries in case of an aneurysm.[27] He was also one of the first to understand the importance of pathology, the danger of the spread of infection and how the problem of inflammation of the wound, bone lesions and even tuberculosis often undid any benefit that was gained from the intervention. He consequently adopted the position that all surgical procedures should be used only as a last resort.[28]\r\n\r\nOther important 18th and early 19th century surgeons included Percival Pott (1713 -1788) who described tuberculosis on the spine and first demonstrated that a cancer may be caused by an environmental carcinogen - (he noticed a connection between chimney sweep\'s exposure to soot and their high incidence of scrotal cancer. Astley Paston Cooper (1768-1841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta, and James Syme (1799-1870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the ankle joint and successfully carried out the first hip disarticulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn operation in 1753, painted by Gaspare Traversi.\r\nModern pain control through anesthesia was discovered in the mid-19th century. Before the advent of anesthesia, surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient suffering. This also meant that operations were largely restricted to amputations and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as ether, first used by the American surgeon Crawford Long, and chloroform, discovered by James Young Simpson and later pioneered by John Snow, physician to Queen Victoria.[29] In addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body. In addition, the discovery of muscle relaxants such as curare allowed for safer applications.\r\n\r\nInfection and antisepsis[edit]\r\nUnfortunately, the introduction of anesthetics encouraged more surgery, which inadvertently caused more dangerous patient post-operative infections. The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths, however the Royal Society dismissed his advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Lister, pioneer of antiseptic surgery.\r\nUntil the pioneering work of British surgeon Joseph Lister in the 1860s, most medical men believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see \"miasma\") was responsible for infections in wounds, and facilities for washing hands or a patient\'s wounds were not available.[30] Lister became aware of the work of French chemist Louis Pasteur, who showed that rotting and fermentation could occur under anaerobic conditions if micro-organisms were present. Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the micro-organisms responsible for gangrene: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to chemical solutions. Lister confirmed Pasteur\'s conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds. As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third, spraying carbolic acid on his instruments. He found that this remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene and he published his results in The Lancet. [31] Later, on 9 August 1867, he read a paper before the British Medical Association in Dublin, on the Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery, which was reprinted in The British Medical Journal.[32][33][34] His work was groundbreaking and laid the foundations for a rapid advance in infection control that saw modern antiseptic operating theatres widely used within 50 years.\r\n\r\nLister continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Lister introduced the Steam Steriliser to sterilize equipment, instituted rigorous hand washing and later implemented the wearing of rubber gloves. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.\r\n\r\nThe use of X-rays as an important medical diagnostic tool began with their discovery in 1895 by German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen. He noticed that these rays could penetrate the skin, allowing the skeletal structure to be captured on a specially treated photographic plate.\r\n\r\nSurgical specialties[edit]\r\nGeneral surgery\r\nCardiothoracic Breast Colorectal Endocrine Oncological Paediatric (Pediatric) Plastic Skin Transplant Trauma Vascular\r\ncraniofacial surgery\r\nDental surgery\r\nGynaecology\r\nNeurosurgery\r\nOphthalmology\r\nOral and maxillofacial surgery\r\nOrthopaedic surgery\r\nOtolaryngology\r\nPodiatric surgery\r\nUrology\r\nDiagnoses and treatments that involve the use of invasive methods – such as catheterization and endoscopy – are also sometimes considered to be \"surgery\" or \"surgical\", although not by most of the medical profession.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nSee also[edit]\r\nAnesthesia\r\nASA physical status classification system or pre-operative physical fitness\r\nBiomaterial\r\nCardiac surgery\r\nSurgical drain\r\nEndoscopy\r\nFluorescence image-guided surgery\r\nHypnosurgery\r\nJet ventilation\r\nList of surgical procedures\r\nMinimally invasive procedure\r\nOperative report\r\nPerioperative mortality\r\nRobotic surgery\r\nSurgeon\'s assistant\r\nSurgical Outcomes Analysis and Research\r\nSurgical Sieve\r\nTrauma surgery\r\nReconstructive surgery\r\nWHO Surgical Safety Checklist\r\nNational Societies[edit]\r\nAmerican College of Surgeons\r\nAmerican College of Osteopathic Surgeons\r\nAmerican Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons\r\nAmerican College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons\r\nRoyal Australasian College of Surgeons\r\nRoyal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons\r\nRoyal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons in Ireland\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh\r\nRoyal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons of England\r\nQualifications in the UK and Ireland[edit]\r\nFellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons\r\nMembership of the Royal College of Surgeons\r\nNotes and references[edit]\r\nJump up ^ Fingar KR, Stocks C, Weiss AJ, Steiner CA (December 2014). \"Most Frequent Operating Room Procedures Performed in U.S. Hospitals, 2003-2012\".

Today, gallbladder surgery is performed laparoscopically. The medical name for this procedure is Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.\r\n\r\nWhat Is The Gallbladder?\r\n\r\nThe gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that rests beneath the right side of the liver.\r\nIts main purpose is to collect and concentrate a digestive liquid (bile) produced by the liver. Bile is released from the gallbladder after eating, aiding digestion. Bile travels through narrow tubular channels (bile ducts) into the small intestine.\r\nRemoval of the gallbladder is not associated with any impairment of digestion in most people.\r\nWhat Causes Gallbladder Problems?\r\n\r\nGallbladder problems are usually caused by the presence of gallstones: small hard masses consisting primarily of cholesterol and bile salts that form in the gallbladder or in the bile duct.\r\nIt is uncertain why some people form gallstones.\r\nThere is no known means to prevent gallstones.\r\nThese stones may block the flow of bile out of the gallbladder, causing it to swell and resulting in sharp abdominal pain, vomiting, indigestion and, occasionally, fever.\r\nIf the gallstone blocks the common bile duct, jaundice (a yellowing of the skin) can occur.\r\nHow Are These Problems Found and Treated?\r\n\r\nUltrasound is most commonly used to find gallstones.\r\n\r\nIn a few more complex cases, other X-ray tests may be used to evaluate gallbladder disease.\r\nGallstones do not go away on their own. Some can be temporarily managed with drugs or by making dietary adjustments, such as reducing fat intake. This treatment has a low, short-term success rate. Symptoms will eventually continue unless the gallbladder is removed.\r\nSurgical removal of the gallbladder is the time honored and safest treatment of gallbladder disease.\r\nWhat Are The Advantages of Performing Cholecystectomy Laparoscopically?\r\n\r\nRather than a five to seven inch incision, the operation requires only four small openings in the abdomen.\r\nPatients usually have minimal post-operative pain.\r\nPatients usually experience faster recovery than open gallbladder surgery patients.\r\nMost patients go home within one day and enjoy a quicker return to normal activities.\r\nKeep reading...\r\n\r\nPage 1 of 3123»\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBrought to you by:\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF AMERICAN GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPIC SURGEONS (SAGES)\r\n11300 West Olympic Blvd., Suite 600\r\nLos Angeles, CA 90064\r\nTel:\r\n(310) 437-0544\r\nFax:\r\n(310) 437-0585\r\nE-Mail:\r\npublications@sages.org\r\nPurchase bulk reprints of SAGES Patient Information Brochures\r\nFind a SAGES Member in your area\r\nThis brochure is intended to provide a general overview of a surgery.

The SASD include encounter-level data for ambulatory surgeries and may also include various types of outpatient services such as observation stays, lithotripsy, radiation therapy, imaging, chemotherapy, and labor and delivery. The specific types of ambulatory surgery and outpatient services included in each SASD vary by State and data year. All SASD include data from hospital-owned ambulatory surgery facilities. In addition, some States include data from nonhospital-owned facilities. \r\n\r\nDeveloped through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, HCUP data inform decisionmaking at the national, State, and community levels. \r\n\r\nThis page provides an overview of the SASD. For more details, see SASD Database Documentation and the Introduction to the SASD (PDF file, 196 KB; HTML). \r\n\r\nContents:\r\nAbout the SASD\r\nSASD Data Elements\r\nSASD Areas of Research and HCUP Publications\r\nPurchase the SASD\r\nSASD Hardware and Software Requirements\r\n\r\nAbout the SASD\r\nThe SASD include encounter-level data for ambulatory surgery and other outpatient services from hospital-owned facilities. In addition, some States provide ambulatory surgery and outpatient services from nonhospital-owned facilities. The specific types of ambulatory surgery and outpatient services included in each SASD vary by State and data year. A number of States make their SASD files available for purchase through the HCUP Central Distributor. \r\n\r\nThirty-four States now participate in the SASD: \r\n\r\nThe SASD include encounter-level data for ambulatory surgery and other outpatient services from hospital-owned facilities in participating States that are translated into a uniform format to facilitate multistate comparisons and analyses.\r\nAll SASD include data from hospital-owned ambulatory surgery facilities. In addition, some States include data from facilities not owned by a hospital.\r\nThe databases contain a core set of clinical and nonclinical information on all patients, regardless of payer, including those covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured.\r\nIn addition to the core set of uniform data elements common to all SASD, some include other elements such as the patient\'s race.\r\nFree HCUP Tools & Software are also available to identify preventable hospitalizations, estimate costs, assess quality of care and patient safety, categorize diagnoses and procedures, and identify comorbidities. \r\n\r\nAdditional information on the SASD may be found in the Introduction to the SASD (PDF file, 196 KB; HTML).\r\nReturn to Contents\r\n \r\nSASD Data Elements\r\n\r\nThe SASD contain clinical and resource-use information that is included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources). The SASD contain more than 100 clinical and nonclinical variables included in a hospital discharge abstract, such as: \r\n\r\nAll-listed diagnoses and procedures\r\nPatient demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, age, and, for some States, race)\r\nExpected payment source\r\nTotal charges\r\nHospital identifiers that permit linkage to inpatient hospital databases, such as the AHRQ-sponsored State Inpatient Databases (SID) and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey File\r\nElements included in the SASD are not always available for all States, including the hospital county identifiers or HCUP\'s Revisit Variables. Please see the Availability of Data Elements by Year.\r\nReturn to Contents\r\n \r\nSASD Areas of Research and HCUP Publications\r\n\r\nThe SASD are well suited for research that requires complete enumeration of ambulatory surgery in hospital-owned facilities within market areas or States. Used with the SID, the SASD may be used to compare inpatient surgery data with ambulatory surgery data. The SASD promote comparative studies of health care services and support health care policy research on a variety of topics, including: \r\n\r\nAnalyses of ambulatory surgeries\r\nTrends in ambulatory surgery utilization, access, charges, and outcomes\r\nShift in surgical procedures to outpatient facilities\r\nDiffusion of medical technology\r\nThe SASD are used in a variety of publications: \r\n\r\nHCUP Statistical Briefs highlight a variety of health topics.\r\nUse the HCUP Publications Search Tool to find publications using the SASD.\r\nReview featured publications on the HCUP Research Spotlights page.\r\nRead publications by the winners of the HCUP Outstanding Article of the Year Awards.\r\nReturn to Contents\r\n \r\nPurchase the SASD\r\n\r\nSASD releases beginning in data year 1997 are available for purchase through the HCUP Central Distributor. Costs vary by State and data year. \r\n\r\nPrior to purchasing HCUP data, all individuals are required to take the online HCUP Data Use Agreement Training Course, and users of the SASD must read and sign the Data Use Agreement for State Databases (PDF file, 206 KB; HTML). \r\n\r\nThe SASD are available for purchase online through the HCUP Central Distributor. \r\n\r\nQuestions regarding purchasing databases can be directed to the HCUP Central Distributor:\r\nE-mail: HCUPDistributor@AHRQ.gov \r\nTelephone: (866) 556-4287 (toll free)\t\r\nFax: (866) 792-5313 (toll free)\r\n\r\nReturn to Contents\r\n \r\nSAS Hardware and Software Requirements\r\n\r\nThe SASD data set comes in ASCII format and can be run on desktop computers with a DVD drive.

Click image to see graphic Graphic\r\nAmi Sedghi\r\nMonday 3 February 2014 13.28 GMT Last modified on Friday 8 August 2014 16.55 BST\r\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+\r\nShares\r\n119\r\nComments\r\n3\r\nSuck in, declares the latest audit from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps), for 2013 recorded a 41\% rise in liposuction procedures.\r\n\r\nAccording to Baaps, there were 50,122 surgical procedures performed in 2013 - a rise of 17\% on average since 2012. The association represents one in three cosmetic surgeons in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe audit which highlights an \"impressive double-digit rise in all cosmetic procedures\", reports that not a single individual procedure saw a decrease on the year - a trend it claims has not been seen since pre-recession.\r\n\r\nBreast augmentation (otherwise known as \'boob jobs\') remained the most popular procedure overall. Denis Campbell writes today:\r\n\r\nDemand [for cosmetic surgery] grew despite the scandal over potentially hazardous PIP breast implants and grew by levels unseen since before the recession began in 2008.\r\n\r\nBreast enlargement remains the most popular procedure, with 11,135 augmentations performed in 2013  up 13\% year-on-year  according to figures collected by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS).\r\n\r\nBut the biggest increase on the year was for liposuction. A total of 4,326 liposuction procedures were performed last year - an increase of 41\% on the year. It was the sixth most popular procedure among women and the fourth most popular among men.\r\n\r\nThe Baaps credit the rise in liposuction with a possible backlash against non-surgical treatments for body contouring, claiming that patients may have found these \"less effective than advertised.\" Rajiv Grover, consultant plastic surgeon and president of the Bapps said:\r\n\r\nThe continued double digit rise of cosmetic surgery underlines the fact that whether it is breast augmentation or antiageing procedures like facelifting the public are choosing tried and tested surgical methods rather than the magical-sounding quick fixes that fail to deliver promised results.\r\n\r\nThe Baaps data does not include non-surgical \"lunchtime\" cosmetic procedures, such as botox injections.\r\n\r\nAccording to the review of the regulation of cosmetic interventions by the Department of Health in 2013, the value of UK cosmetic procedures was worth 2.3bn in 2010 and is estimated to rise to 3.6bn by 2015. The report also stated that non-surgical procedures account for nine out of ten procedures and 75\% of the market value.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Baaps figures only include surgical procedures, these still provide an interesting insight into cosmetic surgery trends. We\'ve picked out some of the key numbers from its 2013 audit below.\r\n\r\nWomen\r\nIn the UK, women accounted for 90.5\% of all cosmetic procedures in 2013 with a total of 45,365 procedures.\r\n\r\nBreast augmentation was the most popular with 11,123 surgical procedures carried out in 2013 - a rise of 13\% on the previous year. Blepharoplasty (eyelid ops) were the second most popular cosmetic procedure followed by face or neck lifts in third place.\r\n\r\nLiposuction procedures saw the biggest increase - 3,772 procedures were performed in 2013 (an increase of 43\% since 2012). Although none of the top ten surgical procedures for women recorded a decrease, some did see a slight decline in popularity; abdominoplasty dropped from sixth most popular in 2012 to seventh in 2013 and fat transfer procedures have dropped from seventh place to eighth.\r\n\r\nMen\r\nMen had 9.5\% of all cosmetic procedures in 2013 with a total of 4,757 in total - a rise of 16\% on 2012.\r\n\r\nRhinoplasty was the most popular with 1,037 surgical procedures carried out last year. Eyelid ops were the second most popular procedure for men in 2013, followed by breast reduction.\r\n\r\nLiposuction procedures saw the biggest rise with a 28\% increase on 2012. 554 men opted for liposuction last year according to the Bapps data. Although none of the top ten surgical procedures for men saw a decrease in numbers, otoplasty (ear correction) dropped from fourth most popular procedure for more men to fifth.\r\n\r\nThe downloadable spreadsheet has the Bapps data going back to 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\nCosmetic surgery statistics, UK\r\nType of procedure\tSex\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\t2012\t2013\r\nBreast augmentation\tMen & Women\t8449\t8565\t9430\t10015\t9854\t11135\r\nBlepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)\tMen & Women\t5130\t5443\t5779\t6057\t6829\t7808\r\nFace/Neck Lift\tMen & Women\t4547\t4241\t4756\t4968\t5660\t6380\r\nBreast Reduction\tMen & Women\t3845\t4703\t4207\t5291\t4859\t5476\r\nAbdominoplasty (tummy tuck)\tMen & Women\t3638\t3403\t3147\t3375\t2989\t3466\r\nLiposuction\tMen & Women\t3249\t3509\t3369\t3581\t3071\t4326\r\nRhinoplasty\tMen & Women\t3065\t3836\t4207\t4518\t4180\t4878\r\nFat transfer\tMen & Women\t\t\t\t2551\t2882\t3302\r\nOtoplasty (ear correction)\tMen & Women\t1260\t1349\t1114\t1170\t1066\t1213\r\nBrow lifts\tMen & Women\t1004\t1433\t1513\t1543\t1812\t2138\r\nALL PROCEDURES\tMen & Women\t34187\t36482\t38274\t43069\t43172\t50122\r\nBreast augmentation\tWomen\t8449\t8537\t9418\t10003\t9843\t11123\r\nBlepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)\tWomen\t4520\t4827\t5127\t5373\t6071\t6921\r\nFace/Neck Lift\tWomen\t4355\t4005\t4493\t4700\t5324\t6016\r\nBreast Reduction\tWomen\t3522\t4122\t4218\t4501\t4217\t4680\r\nAbdominoplasty (tummy tuck)\tWomen\t3526\t3268\t3039\t3251\t2882\t3343\r\nLiposuction\tWomen\t2770\t3010\t2896\t3070\t2638\t3772\r\nRhinoplasty\tWomen\t2367\t2959\t3214\t3475\t3228\t3841\r\nFat transfer\tWomen\t\t\t\t2331\t2641\t3037\r\nOtoplasty (ear correction)\tWomen\t752\t807\t618\t649\t563\t670\r\nBrow lifts\tWomen\t932\t1324\t1390\t1418\t1663\t1962\r\nALL PROCEDURES\tWomen\t31183\t32859\t34413\t38771\t39070\t45365\r\nBreast augmentation\tMen\t0\t28\t0\t12\t11\t12\r\nBlepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)\tMen\t610\t616\t652\t684\t758\t887\r\nFace/Neck Lift\tMen\t192\t236\t263\t268\t306\t364\r\nBreast Reduction\tMen\t323\t581\t741\t790\t642\t796\r\nAbdominoplasty (tummy tuck)\tMen\t112\t135\t108\t124\t107\t123\r\nLiposuction\tMen\t479\t499\t473\t511\t433\t554\r\nRhinoplasty\tMen\t698\t877\t993\t1043\t952\t1037\r\nFat transfer\tMen\t\t\t\t220\t241\t265\r\nOtoplasty (ear correction)\tMen\t508\t542\t496\t521\t503\t543\r\nBrow lifts\tMen\t72\t109\t123\t125\t149\t176\r\nOther\tMen\t10\t0\t12\t\t\t\r\nALL PROCEDURES\tMen\t3004\t3623\t3861\t4298\t4102\t4757\r\n\r\nDownload the data\r\n DATA: download the full spreadsheet\r\n\r\nMore open data\r\nData journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian\r\n\r\nDevelopment and aid data\r\n Search the world\'s global development data with our gateway\r\n\r\nCan you do more with this data?\r\n Contact us at data@guardian.co.uk\r\n\r\n Follow us on Twitter\r\n Like us on Facebook\r\n\r\nMore blogposts Topics\r\nHealth  Health & wellbeing  Cosmetic surgery\r\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+\r\nMost popular in US\r\n\r\nPublication of the Prince Charles \'black spider\' letters: live\r\n \r\nA picture of loneliness: you are looking at the last male northern white rhino | Jonathan Jones\r\n \r\nPrince Charles \'black spider\' memos reveal lobbying of Tony Blair\r\n \r\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie: \'Fear of causing offence becomes a fetish\'\r\n \r\nCate Blanchett reveals \'many\' past relationships with women\r\nmore on this story\r\n\r\nWould you have cosmetic surgery?
