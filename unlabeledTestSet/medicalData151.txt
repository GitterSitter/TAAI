Pre-existing native aortic insufficiency, aortic valve      incompetence acquired during support, as well as previously placed prosthetic      aortic valves present unique problems for these patients. METHODS: We reviewed      and analyzed data for 28 patients who underwent left ventricular outflow tract      closure associated with HeartMate I (n =12) and HeartMate II (n = 16) LVAD      insertion or exchange. Indications for valve closure, surgical technique, LVAD      function, survival rates and complications were retrospectively analyzed.      Survival rates were compared with those of HeartMate LVAD patients (n = 104) who       did not undergo aortic valve closure. RESULTS: Indications for closure included      native aortic valve insufficiency (10 patients), aortic valve deterioration after      prolonged LVAD support (8 patients) and previously placed mechanical (9 patients)      or bioprosthetic aortic prostheses (1 patient). There were 2 operative and 5 late      deaths (mean 227 days post-operatively). Of the deaths, none were due to aortic      valve closure. Actuarial survival was 78% at 1 year and 53% at 3 years, which was      statistically better than for our patients with an intact aortic outflow (61% at       1 year, 45% at 3 years; p < 0.05). Five patients had transplants, 1 patient was      successfully bridged to recovery, and 15 patients remain on LVAD support. No      patient with outflow closure developed regurgitation, embolization or compromised      LVAD support. CONCLUSION: Outflow tract closure in LVAD-supported patients is      safe, often necessary and well tolerated.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
