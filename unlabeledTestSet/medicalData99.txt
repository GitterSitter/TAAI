In this paper, we present our       single-center report of adult patients in whom bridging was used with VAD.      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 14 adult patients who underwent      heart transplantation after insertion of a long-term VAD. The study spans from      February 2006 until September 2010. The mean patient age was 44.28 +/- 11.06      years. We used the Berlin Heart EXCOR VADs (n = 11; Berlin Heart AG Berlin,      Germany), or the Berlin Heart Incor (n = 2), or the Abiomed AB500 (n = 1).      Preimplantation status of the subjects were critical cardiogenic shock (n = 6),      deterioration on inotropes (n = 3), or stable but inotrope-dependent (n = 5).      RESULTS: Mean VAD support time was 153.71 days (range, 25-517). Major adverse      events during VAD support included reexploration for bleeding (n = 3; 21.4%),      neurologic events (n = 2; 14.3%), left VAD-related infection (n = 2; 14.3%),      pneumonia (n = 1; 14.3%), or primary device failure (n = 1; 7.1%). One (7.1%)      patient showed evidence of human leukocyte antigen sensitization. There were 2      deaths (14.3%) over a mean of 324 days follow-up after heart transplantation: One      due to biventricular failure in the early postoperative period and the other, at       69 days from pneumonia. Rejection was observed in 2 patients who had      International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 2R without      hemodynamic deterioration. In our series, the 1-year mortality was 14.4% among      heart transplantations without VAD implantation and 14.2% among the      bridge-to-transplantation group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that VAD implantation      improved end-organ function before heart transplantation in critically ill      patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
