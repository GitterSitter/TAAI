These devices provide either pulsatile or      continuous blood flow. To determine eventual physiological effects of these      different types of flow on the aorta,a computational fluid dynamics model of the       aorta and its thoracic branches was implemented. Pulsatile and continuous flow      fields were calculated by implementing a comprehensive computational framework      with a stabilized finite element method. The computed results revealed that the      pulsatile pump support results in a lower mean shear stress and higher      oscillatory shear stress index than the continuous pump support. The flow      patterns for the pulsatile pump support above the closed aortic valves show a      similar washout as for the continuous pump support. In summary, from the flow      pattern simulation there was no particular preference for either pulsatile or      continuous devicesFAU - Filipovic, NenadAU  - Filipovic NAD  - Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Kragujevac, Sestre Janjica 6,      Kragujevac, Serbia. fica@kg.ac.rsFAU - Schima, HeinrichAU  - Schima HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - Aorta, Thoracic/*physiologyMH  - Computer SimulationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - *HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Models, CardiovascularMH  - Pulsatile FlowEDAT- 2011/05/11 06:00MHDA- 2011/08/16 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/11 06:00AID - AOR1194 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2010.01194.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2011 Apr;35(4):E73-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2010.01194.x.
