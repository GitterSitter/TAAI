Advantages include ease of use, excellent reliability, and low thrombosis risk,.       which may allow wider application of short-term support and improved outcomes in       patients with cardiogenic shock. This multi-institutional study evaluated safety,      effectiveness, and outcomes of the CentriMag in patients with cardiogenic shock.       METHODS: Thirty-eight patients were supported at 7 centers. Patients included 12       after cardiotomy, 14 after myocardial infarction, and 12 with right ventricular      failure after implantable left ventricular assist device placement. Devices were       implanted in left (n = 8), right (n = 12), or biventricular (n = 18)      configuration. Support was continued until recovery, transplantation, or      implantation of long-term ventricular assist device. RESULTS: Mean support      duration for the entire cohort (n = 38) was 13 days (1-60 days), with 47% of      patients (18/38) surviving 30 days after device removal. Mean CentriMag      biventricular support (n = 18) duration was 15 days (1-60 days), with 44% (8/18)       surviving at 30 days. Mean CentriMag right ventricular support with a      commercially available left ventricular assist device (n = 12) duration was 14      days (1-29 days), with 58% (7/12) surviving at 30 days. Complications included      bleeding (21%), infection (5%), respiratory failure (3%), hemolysis (5%), and      neurologic dysfunction (11%). There were no CentriMag or pump failures.      CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, the CentriMag provided short-term support      for patients with cardiogenic shock with a low incidence of device-related      complications and no device failures.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
