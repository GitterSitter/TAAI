METHODS: We reviewed our patients </= 10 kg with those who were bridged      to OHT using ventricular assist device (VAD) Berlin Heart (BH) Excor +/-      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) between 2004 and 2009. RESULTS: Eleven      children </= 10 kg with end-stage heart failure (cardiomyopathy or myocarditis)      were treated with VAD as bridge to OHT: the median weight was 8.0 (range 3.9-10.0      kg)kg and median age was 12.3 (range 1.2-33.9 months) months. Five (45%) required      ECMO support pre-BH and six were on mechanical ventilation and inotropes. In 9/11      (82%), the support mode was left ventricular assist device (L-VAD) (all alive):      one of two patients needing Bi-VAD support died. On BH, the median support time      was 27 days and time to extubation was 8 days. Two out of 11 (18%) suffered      strokes confirmed on brain imaging; both recovered and one underwent resection of      infarcted small bowel. Ten out of 11 (91%) were transplanted, one remains in      hospital and nine are at home in good health. When compared to patients >10 kg      bridged with BH (n = 15), the mortality (p = 0.51) and rates of neurological      complications (p = 0.54) were similar. Post-transplant recovery (ventilation      times and time to home discharge) was similar between the bridged children </= 10      kg and non-bridged children </= 10 kg who underwent OHT. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical       bridging to transplantation is clinically feasible in children </= 10 kg,      achieving excellent outcomes. Judicious use of VADs in smaller children will      optimise the use of donor organs; however, the effect on overall OHT waiting      times, if mechanical bridging was extended to a large number of small children,      is unknown.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
