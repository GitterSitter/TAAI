With the      advent of continuous-flow LVADs, safe and effective long-term circulatory support      is available for properly identified candidates. RECENT FINDINGS: The highest      mortality following LVAD implant is observed in the sickest patients (INTERMACS      profile 1); therefore, there is an increasing trend toward selecting patients      with INTERMACS profiles 2-5. The less-ill patients will be studied in the planned      REVIVE-IT trial. The Heart Failure Survival Score, Seattle Heart Failure Model,      and Destination Therapy Risk Score may provide guidance for patient selection and      preoperative optimization therapy, but these tools need to be updated for current      LVAD technology. The current 1-year survival rate for patients supported for      destination therapy with a continuous-flow LVAD is 74%, which represents an      increase of 6% since the clinical trial was completed 2 years ago. SUMMARY:      Substantial progress has been made concerning survival and quality of life since       destination therapy was first introduced 10 years ago. Advances in patient      selection, improved LVAD technology, and optimized treatment strategies provide      much optimism for the treatment of more heart failure patients in the future.FAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSAD  - Division of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Louisville, 201      Abraham Flexner Way, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. mark.slaughter@louisville.eduFAU - Meyer, Anna LAU  - Meyer ALFAU - Birks, Emma JAU  - Birks EJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin CardiolJT  - Current opinion in cardiologyJID - 8608087SB  - IMMH  - Disease ProgressionMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*therapyMH  - *Heart VentriclesMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *Patient SelectionMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2011/03/25 06:00MHDA- 2011/08/06 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/25 06:00AID - 10.1097/HCO.0b013e328345aff4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Cardiol. 2011 May;26(3):232-6. doi: 10.1097/HCO.0b013e328345aff4.
