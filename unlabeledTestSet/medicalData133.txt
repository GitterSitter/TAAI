In such situations, emergent initiation of      mechanical circulatory assistance is the only therapeutic option to rescue these       dying patients. This study was designed to evaluate the outcomes, health-related       quality of life and frequencies of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress      disorder symptoms in fulminant myocarditis patients rescued by mechanical      circulatory assistance, since these major components of outcome evaluation after       serious illnesses have not yet been assessed in this setting. DESIGN: A      retrospective, single-center, observational study and a cross-sectional survey to      assess health-related quality of life by the Short Form-36 questionnaire and      frequencies of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms by       the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale,      respectively. SETTING: An 18-bed tertiary intensive care unit in a university      hospital. PATIENTS: We analyzed the short- and long-term outcomes of 41 patients       hospitalized at our institution between 2003 and 2009 and who received either a      Thoratec BiVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) (n = 6) or extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation (n = 35) to combat refractory cardiogenic shock due to fulminant      myocarditis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intensive care unit survival was 68%,      and four (10%) patients underwent heart transplantation. Independent predictors      of in-intensive care unit death were Simplified Acute Physiology Score II >/=56      (odds ratio = 10.23) and troponin Ic >/=12 mug/L (odds ratio = 7.49) at      admission. Complete follow-up (median, 525 days) was available for 26 of 28      survivors. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, Short Form-36 evaluation of      health-related quality of life revealed satisfactory mental health and vitality      but persistent physical and psychosocial-related difficulties. Lastly, anxiety,      depression, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were reported by 38%,      27% and 27% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical circulatory      assistance rescued 68% of patients with refractory circulatory failure due to      fulminant myocarditis. Greater disease severity and higher troponin Ic levels at       extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation predicted poorer prognosis.      Because up to one-third of the patients reported anxiety, depression, and/or      posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, strategies aimed at attenuating their      emotional and psychologic distress might significantly improve their long-lasting      well-being.FAU - Mirabel, MarianaAU  - Mirabel MAD  - Service de Reanimation Medicale, Institut de Cardiologie, Hopital      Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite      Pierre-et-Marie-Curie, Paris, France.FAU - Luyt, Charles-EdouardAU  - Luyt CEFAU - Leprince, PascalAU  - Leprince PFAU - Trouillet, Jean-LouisAU  - Trouillet JLFAU - Leger, PhilippeAU  - Leger PFAU - Pavie, AlainAU  - Pavie AFAU - Chastre, JeanAU  - Chastre JFAU - Combes, AlainAU  - Combes ALA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Crit Care MedJT  - Critical care medicineJID - 0355501SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Crit Care Med. 2011 May;39(5):1211-3.
