It collects and stores pump parameters when connected to the      controller and enables remote monitoring via the Internet. It charges and      reconditions the batteries and can provide electrical power from the wall. It      eliminates the need for the Clinical Data Acquisition System and the Patient Home      Support System. The new controller, in all modes, displays pump flow (L/min),      current/amps, power/watts, rpm, and diagnostic and emergency alarms. The      HeartAssist 5 is CE-approved in Europe. A new U.S. Food and Drug Administration      study of the HeartAssist 5 as a bridge to transplant is being finalized.FAU - Noon, George PAU  - Noon GPAD  - Division of Transplant & Assist Devices, Department of Surgery, Baylor College of      Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. gnoon@bcm.eduFAU - Loebe, MatthiasAU  - Loebe MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Tex Heart Inst JJT  - Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke's      Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children's HospitalJID - 8214622SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgery/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular FunctionPMC - PMC3014118OID - NLM: PMC3014118EDAT- 2011/01/13 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/26 06:00CRDT- 2011/01/13 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Tex Heart Inst J. 2010;37(6):652-3.
