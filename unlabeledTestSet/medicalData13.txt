The device is a major      bodily invasion that challenges everyday life. Only few studies have explored the      psychosocial adjustments of patients living with an LVAD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of      this study was to explore the lived experience of patients with LVADs. METHODS:      The present study had a qualitative explorative design using in-depth interviews       of 10 adult patients that had experienced life with an LVAD from 2008 to 2010 in       Denmark. We constructed an interview guide with themes relating to the chronology      of the illness trajectory. Data were managed by the qualitative computer package       NVivo 8. As a theoretical framework, we chose a life-stage model for the main      theme: Life With LVAD. The model describes the developmental tasks in each age      group, and we looked at the physical, psychological, social, and vocational      adjustments of patients with LVADs. RESULTS: Despite the suddenness of onset and       gravity of illness, the patients in our study coped well with their situation.      While bridging to transplantation, the patients experienced the ambivalence of      gratitude and frustration toward the LVAD, and during preparation for cardiac      transplantation, they experienced the ambivalence of hope and fear. Some resolved      their emotional ambiguity by procrastination in relation to vocational      adjustments that were necessary due to their illness. Older patients with      occupational security were quicker to resume work and everyday life. CONCLUSIONS:      Patients with LVADs succeeded somewhat in reestablishing their lives, but the      younger individuals still need to consider vocational options. Some patients need      help to get out of the sick role that kept them on disability benefits. The      patients all relied on support from close family: parents, spouses, and children.FAU - Overgaard, DortheAU  - Overgaard DAD  - Heart Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Denmark.      dorthe.overgaard@rh.regionh.dkFAU - Grufstedt Kjeldgaard, HeidiAU  - Grufstedt Kjeldgaard HFAU - Egerod, IngridAU  - Egerod ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc NursJT  - The Journal of cardiovascular nursingJID - 8703516SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - *Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - OccupationsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/09/14 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/08 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/14 06:00AID - 10.1097/JCN.0b013e318227f119 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2012 Sep-Oct;27(5):394-402. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0b013e318227f119.
