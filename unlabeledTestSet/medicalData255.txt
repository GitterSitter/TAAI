METHODS AND      RESULTS: We studied 132 consecutive CRT patients with class III and IV heart      failure, ejection fraction (EF) < or =35%, and QRS > or =120 ms from three      international centres. Baseline dyssynchrony was evaluated by four speckle      tracking strain methods; radial, circumferential, transverse, and longitudinal (>      or =130 ms opposing wall delay for each). Pre-specified outcome variables were EF      response and three serious long-term events: death, transplant, or left      ventricular assist device. Of 120 patients (91%) with baseline dyssynchrony data,      both short-axis radial strain and transverse strain from apical views were      associated with favourable EF response 7 +/- 4 months and long-term outcome over       3.5 years (P < 0.01). Radial strain had the highest sensitivity at 86% for      predicting EF response with a specificity of 67%. Serious long-term unfavourable       events occurred in 20 patients after CRT, and happened three times more      frequently in those who lacked baseline radial or transverse dyssynchrony than in      patients with dyssynchrony (P < 0.01). Patients who lacked both radial and      transverse dyssynchrony had unfavourable clinical events occur in 53%, in      contrast to events occurring in 12% if baseline dyssynchrony was present (P <      0.01). Circumferential and longitudinal strains predicted response when      dyssynchrony was detected, but failed to identify dyssynchrony in one-third of      patients who responded to CRT. CONCLUSION: Dyssynchrony by speckle-tracking      echocardiography using radial and transverse strains is associated with EF      response and long-term outcome following CRT.FAU - Tanaka, HidekazuAU  - Tanaka HAD  - University of Pittsburgh, Scaife Hall 564, 200 Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA      15213-2582, USA.FAU - Nesser, Hans-JoachimAU  - Nesser HJFAU - Buck, ThomasAU  - Buck TFAU - Oyenuga, OlusegunAU  - Oyenuga OFAU - Janosi, Rolf AlexanderAU  - Janosi RAFAU - Winter, SiegmundAU  - Winter SFAU - Saba, SamirAU  - Saba SFAU - Gorcsan, John 3rdAU  - Gorcsan J 3rdLA  - engGR  - 2 K24 HL004503-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20100608PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Arrhythmias, Cardiac/physiopathology/*therapy/ultrasonographyMH  - *Cardiac Resynchronization TherapyMH  - Echocardiography/*methodsMH  - Feasibility StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapy/ultrasonographyMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Sensitivity and SpecificityMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC2903716OID - NLM: PMC2903716EDAT- 2010/06/10 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/29 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/10 06:00PHST- 2010/06/08 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2010/06/16 [aheadofprint]AID - ehq213 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehq213 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Heart J. 2010 Jul;31(14):1690-700. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehq213.
