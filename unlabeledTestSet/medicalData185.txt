Analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing      (UNOS).PG  - 395-401LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.09.008 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) now survive into      adulthood and often present with end-stage heart failure (HF). HF management and       approach to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) may differ from adults without CHD.      We sought to compare OHT waitlist characteristics and outcomes for these 2      groups. METHODS: The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United       Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to identify adults (>/=18      years) listed for OHT from 2005 to 2009. The cohort was divided into those with      or without CHD. RESULTS: Of 9,722 adults included, 314 (3%) had CHD. Adults with       CHD were younger (35 +/- 13 vs 52 +/- 12 years, p < 0.01) and more often had      undergone prior cardiac surgery (85% vs. 34%, p < 0.01). Patients with CHD were      less likely to have a defibrillator (44% vs 75%, p < 0.01) or ventricular assist       device (5% vs 14%, p < 0.01) and were more likely to be listed at the lowest      urgency status than patients without CHD (64% vs 44%, p < 0.01). Fewer CHD      patients achieved OHT (53% vs 65%, p < 0.001). Although overall waitlist      mortality did not differ between groups (10% vs 8%, p = 0.15), patients with CHD       were more likely to experience cardiovascular death (60% vs 40%, p = 0.03),      including sudden in 44% and due to HF in 16%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower urgency       status, patients with CHD have greater cardiovascular mortality awaiting OHT than      those without. Increased defibrillator use could improve survival to OHT, because      sudden death is common. VAD support may benefit select patients, but experience      in CHD is limited. Referral to specialized adult congenital heart centers can      enhance utilization of device therapies and potentially improve waitlist      outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
