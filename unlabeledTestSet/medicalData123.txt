Increasing mortality on      waiting list has urged implementation of mechanical circulatory support as an      adjunct to the programme of heart transplantation. The objective of the study is       to review 7-years experience with paracorporeal assist device in bridging to      transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 53 transplant      candidates treated since April 2003. 50 patients received paracorporeal assist      devices in biventricular configuration. Most frequent diagnosis was dilated      cardiomyopathy in 51%. RESULTS: Despite a high risk profile of the patients, 37      of them were successfully transplanted (69.8%). Cumulative support has reached      3513 days. Local exit sites infection was identified as a most frequent      complication, sepsis as a most frequent cause of death on support (18.8%).      30-days post-transplant mortality remained low at 5.7%. CONCLUSIONS:      Paracorporeal mechanical circulatory assist devices remain effective alternative       for terminal stage heart transplant candidates, especially for those in      multiorgan failure who require biventricular support. Success rate of bridging to      transplantation is acceptable, as well as complications rate and quality of life       while on support. Long-term post-transplant survival is not inferior to the      results of procedures performed without necessity of previous implantation of the      assist device.FAU - Netuka, IvanAU  - Netuka IAD  - Institut klinicke a experimentalni mediciny Praha, Klinika kardiovaskularni      chirurgie. ivan.netuka@ikem.czFAU - Maly, JiriAU  - Maly JFAU - Riha, HynekAU  - Riha HFAU - Szarszoi, OndrejAU  - Szarszoi OFAU - Dorazilova, ZoraAU  - Dorazilova ZFAU - Skalsky, IvoAU  - Skalsky IFAU - Turek, DanielAU  - Turek DFAU - Urban, MarianAU  - Urban MFAU - Kettner, JiriAU  - Kettner JFAU - Pirk, JanAU  - Pirk JLA  - czePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Prinos dlouhodobe pulzatilni mechanicke srdecni podpory u multiorganove      selhavajicich pacientu v terminalnim srdecnim selhani.PL  - Czech RepublicTA  - Cas Lek CeskJT  - Casopis lekaru ceskychJID - 0004743SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/complications/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Multiple Organ Failure/complications/*therapyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/03/17 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/30 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/17 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Cas Lek Cesk. 2011;150(1):44-8.
