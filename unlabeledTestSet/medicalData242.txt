The devices have shown efficacy both as       a bridge to transplantation and as a bridge to recovery. The potential      complications that may occur with long-term support have not been fully      described. This article reports the occurrence of a large pseudoaneurysm      associated with the ascending aorta following explantation of the EXCOR Pediatric      ventricular assist device. A management strategy for this potentially lethal      complication is described.FAU - Arain, NofilAU  - Arain NAD  - Division of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.FAU - Bryant, Roosevelt 3rdAU  - Bryant R 3rdFAU - Ameduri, RebeccaAU  - Ameduri RFAU - Gruenstein, DanielAU  - Gruenstein DFAU - Braunlin, ElizabethAU  - Braunlin EFAU - Joyce, LyleAU  - Joyce LFAU - St Louis, JamesAU  - St Louis JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart SurgJT  - World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgeryJID - 101518415OTO - NOTNLMOT  - aneurysmOT  - aorta/aorticOT  - circulatory assist devicesOT  - complicationEDAT- 2010/07/01 00:00MHDA- 2010/07/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/06/28 06:00AID - 1/2/259 [pii]AID - 10.1177/2150135110372639 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg. 2010 Jul;1(2):259-61. doi:      10.1177/2150135110372639.
