The high mortality rates      for medically treated stage D heart failure have not improved in the last 10      years, and patients at this advanced stage require either palliative measures or       surgical management of heart failure. In recent years, surgically implanted      ventricular assist devices (VADs) have become available for long-term use and are      now commonly used as a therapy for advanced heart failure. The data generated      from this early experience have clearly shown that VADs improve survival and      quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure when implanted as a      temporary measure or as long-term support. However, with a growing heart failure       population, there is much work to be done to continually improve VAD technology,       patient selection criteria, and postimplantation management to define the optimal      role for assist devices in the management of systolic heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011.
