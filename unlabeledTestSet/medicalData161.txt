The uniquely      incorporated inflow cannula was originally designed to be inserted into the      diaphragmatic surface of the heart, allowing the pump to sit on the flattened      diaphragmatic surface. Commonly, however, the inflow cannula is placed through      the usual left ventricular assist device insertion site, anterolateral to the      left ventricular apex. We describe the original, intended technique for inflow      cannula insertion and HVAD placement on the diaphragmatic surface of the left      ventricle. Our experience has confirmed that this placement results in the      optimal left ventricular position, with orientation of the inlet cannula parallel      to the short axis of the left ventricle and anterior to the papillary muscle      insertion. This approach should protect against inflow obstruction and      endocardial contact, with resulting arrhythmias. In addition, this position      results in lateral placement of the outflow graft, avoiding the anterior and      retrosternal surface of the right ventricle.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
