Between February 2004 and May 2010, 42 consecutive adult       patients were supported with Levitronix at our institution (32 men; age 62.3 +/-       10.5 years, range: 31-76 years). Indications for support were (group A, n = 37)      failure to wean from the cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy       (n = 23), primary donor graft failure (n = 4), or right ventricular failure after      axial left VAD (LVAD) placement (n = 10) and (group B, n = 5) refractory heart      failure after acute myocardial infarction. The mean support time was 11.2 +/- 6.8      days (range: 3-43 days) in group A and 8.6 +/- 4.3 days (range: 5-11 days) in      group B. In the postcardiotomy cohort (group A), 11 (47.8%) patients were weaned       from support as all were supported graft failure patients. Eight patients of      axial LVAD cohort were weaned from right VAD (RVAD). One patient was bridged to      heart transplantation (Htx). Thirteen (35.1%) patients died on support in group      A. In group B, one patient was bridged to Htx and four died on support. In      overall population, bleeding requiring reoperation occurred in 15 (35.7%) cases      and cerebral major events in four (9.5%). There were no device failures. Of the      23 (54.7%) patients who recovered and were discharged home, 20 (47.6%) are      presently alive, and additionally, two patients of both groups who were bridged      to Htx (overall n = 22, 52.3%). The Levitronix proved to be useful in patients      previously considered nonsuitable for transplantation or long-term assist device.      The device was technically easy to manage, and the results were encouraging.FAU - Loforte, AntonioAU  - Loforte AAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, San Camillo Hospital, Rome,      Italy. antonioloforte@yahoo.itFAU - Montalto, AndreaAU  - Montalto AFAU - Ranocchi, FedericoAU  - Ranocchi FFAU - Della Monica, Paola LillaAU  - Della Monica PLFAU - Casali, GiovanniAU  - Casali GFAU - Lappa, AngelaAU  - Lappa AFAU - Contento, CarloAU  - Contento CFAU - Musumeci, FrancescoAU  - Musumeci FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cardiopulmonary BypassMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/methodsMH  - Heart Ventricles/pathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/*surgeryMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/pathology/*therapyEDAT- 2011/06/28 06:00MHDA- 2011/10/20 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/25 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31821f2116 [doi]AID - 00002480-201107000-00001 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2011 Jul-Aug;57(4):247-53. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31821f2116.
