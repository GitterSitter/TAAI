We report our experience using a low dose of      double antiplatelet therapy for patients provided with the INCOR LVAD system as a      bridge to transplantation. Twelve patients (10 males, 35-60 years old) with acute      or end-stage heart failure were included in this study. The mean follow-up was 10      months (cumulative 4.9 years). For antiplatelet therapy, we use an association of      variable doses of aspirin and clopidogrel. The use of a platelet aggregation test      (PAT) allows reducing the dose of the drugs to the minimum needed. The primary      end point was to check the safety of the therapy, analyzing the incidence of      major and minor bleeding complications. The secondary end point was to check the       effectiveness of the therapy, evaluating the incidence of major and minor      thromboembolic events. We had three (25%) cases of early postoperative      mediastinal bleeding. On the contrary, no episodes of major bleeding occurred      during the follow-up period. The rate of minor bleeding complications was low:      0.2 events per patient/year. The rate of major and minor thromboembolic events      was acceptable (respectively 0.09 and 0.2 per patient/year). During LVAD support,      double antiplatelet therapy with a low dose of aspirin and clopidogrel was safe      and effective. PAT allows reducing the dose of antiplatelet drugs, avoiding      complications related to excessive or insufficient dose administration.FAU - Attisani, MatteoAU  - Attisani MAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, San Giovanni Battista Hospital, University of Turin,      C.so Bramante 88, 10127, Turin, Italy. matteoatti@libero.itFAU - Centofanti, PaoloAU  - Centofanti PFAU - La Torre, MicheleAU  - La Torre MFAU - Campanella, AntonioAU  - Campanella AFAU - Sansone, FabrizioAU  - Sansone FFAU - Rinaldi, MauroAU  - Rinaldi MLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20101204PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648RN  - 0 (Anticoagulants)RN  - 0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Anticoagulants/administration & dosage/*adverse effectsMH  - Drug Therapy, CombinationMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - Hemorrhage/*chemically inducedMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effectsMH  - Thromboembolism/*etiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2010/12/04 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/07 06:00CRDT- 2010/12/04 06:00PHST- 2010/02/23 [received]PHST- 2010/11/02 [accepted]PHST- 2010/12/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-010-0527-7 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2010 Dec;13(4):202-6. doi: 10.1007/s10047-010-0527-7.
