DESIGN: Case report. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: The Berlin-Heart biventricular      assist was successfully used as a bridge to heart transplantation (178 days) in a      child with hemophilia A; post-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was       implanted until the patient recovered from primary graft failure. Anticoagulant      therapy varied as a function of patient status: 1) postoperative bleeding was      treated by partial replacement of deficient factors (VII and VIII) and      hemoderivatives in order to maintain factor VIII at 50% of normal levels; 2) once      the bleeding had stopped, the effect of the hemophilia itself maintained the      degree of anticoagulation required by the ventricular assist device; and 3)      transplant surgery was followed by complete replacement of factor VIII and      intravenous heparinization (a simple way of preventing clot formation in the      device and to ensure proper scarring of surgical wounds). CONCLUSIONS: Selection       of anticoagulant therapy as a function of patient status in terms of bleeding and      surgical-wound scarring progress is vital for the proper functioning of support      techniques (Berlin-Heart biventricular assist and extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation) in hemophiliac patients. Collagen dressings placed on surgical      wounds achieved good functional and aesthetic results, as well as mechanically      isolating the scars from the exterior.FAU - Frias, Manuel AngelAU  - Frias MAAD  - Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and Hematology Service , University Hospital Reina       Sofia. mafri@ono.comFAU - Jaraba, SusanaAU  - Jaraba SFAU - Ibarra, IgnacioAU  - Ibarra IFAU - Arroyo, Maria JoseAU  - Arroyo MJFAU - Velasco, Maria JoseAU  - Velasco MJFAU - Ulloa, EstherAU  - Ulloa EFAU - Velasco, FranciscoAU  - Velasco FFAU - Perez-Navero, Juan LuisAU  - Perez-Navero JLLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Pediatr Crit Care MedJT  - Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care      Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care      SocietiesJID - 100954653RN  - 0 (Anticoagulants)RN  - 9001-25-6 (Factor VII)RN  - 9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)SB  - IMMH  - Anticoagulants/therapeutic useMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - Factor VII/therapeutic useMH  - Factor VIII/therapeutic useMH  - Heart Failure/surgeryMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - *Hemophilia AMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Postoperative Hemorrhage/drug therapyMH  - *Primary Graft DysfunctionEDAT- 2011/09/20 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/11 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/20 06:00AID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31822f1b63 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2011 Nov;12(6):e432-5. doi: 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31822f1b63.
