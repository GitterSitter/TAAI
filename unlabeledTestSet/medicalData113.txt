DESCRIPTION: Seven children (aged 6 to 16 years) received implantation of a novel      third-generation, continuous flow, ventricular assist device (HeartWare,      HeartWare Inc, Miami Lakes, FL) as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.      EVALUATION: All children were in terminal heart failure despite inotropic      support, and signs of renal or hepatic impairment developed. Six children had      dilatative cardiomyopathy and 1 had congenital heart disease (hypoplastic left      heart, total cavopulmonary connections with extracardiac conduit). Six patients      have been successfully bridged to transplantation. Median support time was 75      days (range, 1 to 136 days). One child is still under continuous mechanical      support. None of the patients suffered a thromboembolic event or an infection.      CONCLUSIONS: The HeartWare assist system can be successfully used as a bridge to       transplantation in children and adolescents with end-stage heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
