METHODS: We performed a retrospective nonrandomized review of all patients who      underwent insertion of a Berlin Heart Excor VAD or heart transplantation in our      clinic. The study spans from July 2005 to July 2010. We transplanted 11 patients       of mean age 11.8 +/- 4.49 years, 3 of whom with critical hemodynamic situations      were bridged to heart transplantation by VAD implantation. Despite the poor right      ventricular systolic functions, they did not require right rVAD. In addition, 2      patients who underwent VAD implantation are still awaiting a donor heart. The      mean follow-up was 825.27 +/- 630.23 days (range, 21-1,888 days). RESULTS: There       was no serious complication during VAD support. The overall heart transplantation      mortality rate was 9.1% (1/11). In all patients, impaired end-organ functions      were improved by VAD implantation before the heart transplantation. Cardiac      biopsies revealed 4 grade 2R rejection episodes, which were successfully      controlled in 3 patients. CONCLUSION: Heart transplantation is highly effective      therapy for pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure. Pediatric VAD      implantation provided satisfactory safe circulatory support for small children in      poor condition on the waiting list. This option should be considered for all      pediatric candidates who show a poor hemodynamic status.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
