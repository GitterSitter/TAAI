Nevertheless      early and late morbidity and mortality are influenced by acute rejection, cardiac      allograft vasculopathy (CAV), malignancy, renal failure, and graft failure.      METHODS: We evaluated our results after HTx in children under the age of 18 years      with 23 years of follow-up. Perioperative characteristics, probability of      survival, and time-related morbidity were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: We      included 169 pediatric HTx recipients, transplanted between 05/1986 and 05/2010.       One hundred and one were males with a median age of 8.7 (0.02-23.2) years at the       time of HTx. Main preoperative diagnoses were cardiomyopathy (CMP) (n = 139) with      a median survival of 7.0 (0-23.2) years and congenital heart disease (CHD) (n =      30), median survival 11.3 (0-19.9) years. Overall survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15      years was 87%, 76%, 68%, and 50%, respectively. Patient survival was      significantly reduced in patients with 0-1 year at the time of HTx versus 1-10      and 11-18 years: 2.3 (0-13.2) years versus 1-10 years = 8.6 (0-23.2) years; 11-18      years = 5.9 (0.003-18.5) years. Fifty-one patients were on mechanical circulatory      support as a bridge-to-HTx with increased early but not late mortality. Ten      patients underwent retransplant due to acute or chronic graft failure after a      median posttransplant time of 12.25 (0.3-17.45) years. Late mortality was      influenced by rejection, infection, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease      (PTLD) (11.8%), or CAV with an incidence of 25% at 5 years, 50% at 10 years, and       approximately 75% at 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric HTx is a safe and effective      treatment for terminal heart failure. In our experience, there is no adverse      effect of previous cardiac assist device implantation in long-term follow-up.      Virtually all anatomic malformations are amenable to orthotopic HTx. Significant       progress has been achieved in controlling rejection through improved      immunosuppression and noninvasive rejection monitoring.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
