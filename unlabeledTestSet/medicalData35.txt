METHODS:      Heart failure was reproduced in Lewis rats by ligating left anterior descending      (LAD) artery. After 4 weeks, the failing hearts and right lungs were      heterotopically transplanted into the abdomen of the recipients by anastomosing      their ascending aorta to the recipients' descending aorta in the heart      transplantation group. Two weeks after transplantation, heart weight, left      ventricular weight, myocyte diameter and myocardial fibrosis were determined ,      and beta adrenergics receptors mRNA expression was essayed by real-time      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Seven normal Lewis rats served as control.      RESULTS: The weight of the enlarged heart, left ventricular weight and myocyte      diameter of the failing hearts were decreased to normal after transplantation.      The levels of beta1- and beta2- adrenergic receptors mRNA expression were      significantly lowered in heart failure group compared with that of normal      group(0.09 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.04, 0.07 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02, both P      <0.05). The level of beta2- adrenergic receptor mRNA expression in heart      transplantation group (0.11 +/- 0.05) rose to normal (P>0.05), but beta1-      adrenergic receptor mRNA expression (0.08 +/- 0.06) was lower in heart      transplantation group than that in normal group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Myocardium       reverse remodeling after left ventricular unloading is accompanied by the change       in cardiomyocyte in molecular level , such as the change in beta adrenergic      receptors , which may involve in the improvement of heart function after being      supported by left ventricular assist device.FAU - Gao, XiaAU  - Gao XAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Henan Chest Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008,      Henan, China. gaoxiaxinwai@yahoo.com.cnFAU - Zhang, Rui-chengAU  - Zhang RCFAU - Zhu, Ru-junAU  - Zhu RJFAU - Liang, Zhi-qiangAU  - Liang ZQFAU - Wang, Jian-weiAU  - Wang JWFAU - Meng, Xian-huiAU  - Meng XHFAU - Sun, FangAU  - Sun FFAU - Wei, LiAU  - Wei LLA  - chiPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ChinaTA  - Zhongguo Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi XueJT  - Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo      weizhongbing jijiuyixueJID - 9887521RN  - 0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Disease Models, AnimalMH  - Heart Failure/*metabolism/surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart VentriclesMH  - MaleMH  - Myocardium/*metabolismMH  - RatsMH  - Rats, Inbred LewMH  - Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/*metabolismMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - *Ventricular RemodelingEDAT- 2011/07/27 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/31 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/27 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Zhongguo Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue. 2011 Jul;23(7):405-8.
