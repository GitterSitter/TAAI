RECENT FINDINGS: In this article, we highlight several factors that      will need to be optimized if we are to achieve clinically effective      cardiomyogenesis, such as the identification of optimal stem cell populations,      and the ideal time and methods for cell transplantation. So far, educated      attempts at achieving transplanted stem cell-induced myogenesis have largely      failed outside of the embryonic stem cell realm, and we present the rationale for      also considering acellular techniques, which may enhance the potential of      endogenous progenitor populations. SUMMARY: In today's cardiovascular field, once      a cardiomyocyte is lost it is lost for good, without any form of direct      therapeutic option. For these reasons, cell therapy justifies our continued      attention and efforts, and may constitute the holy grail of cardiovascular      therapeutics.FAU - Kuraitis, DrewAU  - Kuraitis DAD  - Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa,      Ontario, Canada.FAU - Suuronen, Erik JAU  - Suuronen EJFAU - Sellke, Frank WAU  - Sellke FWFAU - Ruel, MarcAU  - Ruel MLA  - engGR  - MOP-77536/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/CanadaPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin CardiolJT  - Current opinion in cardiologyJID - 8608087SB  - IMMH  - Embryonic Stem Cells/*transplantationMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Myocardium/*cytologyMH  - Myocytes, Cardiac/transplantationMH  - Pluripotent Stem Cells/*transplantationMH  - *Regenerative MedicineMH  - Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*trendsEDAT- 2010/09/23 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/03 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/23 06:00AID - 10.1097/HCO.0b013e32833f0318 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Cardiol. 2010 Nov;25(6):575-82. doi: 10.1097/HCO.0b013e32833f0318.
