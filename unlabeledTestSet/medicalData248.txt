A major concern is the flow      field changes related to the volume decrease and its effect on device      thrombogenicity. Previous studies of similar devices have shown that changes in      the orientation of the inlet valve can lead to improvement in the flow field.      Herein, the fluid dynamic effects of orientation changes at both the inlet and      outlet valves are studied. Using two-dimensional particle image velocimetry, we      examine the flow field in vitro using an acrylic model of the PVAD in a mock      circulatory loop. Regardless of valve orientation, the overall flow pattern      inside the PVAD remains similar, but important differences were seen locally in      the wall shear rates, which is notable because shear rates >500 s may prevent      thrombus formation. As the inlet valve was rotated toward the fluid side of the      PVAD, we observed an increase in inlet jet velocity and wall shear rates along      the inlet port wall. A corresponding rotation of the outlet valve increases the      wall shear rate along the outer wall near the device outlet. Wall shear rates      were all higher when both valves were rotated toward the fluid side of the      device, with the best rates found at orientations of +15 degrees for both the      inlet and outlet valves. Overall, orientations of +15 degrees or +30 degrees of      both the inlet and outlet valve resulted in an increase in wall shear rates and      could aid in the reduction of thrombus formation inside the PVAD.FAU - Roszelle, Breigh NAU  - Roszelle BNAD  - Department of Bioengineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park,      Pennsylvania, USA.FAU - Deutsch, StevenAU  - Deutsch SFAU - Manning, Keefe BAU  - Manning KBLA  - engGR  - HV 48191/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *Models, CardiovascularMH  - Prosthesis Design/*methodsMH  - Pulsatile Flow/*physiologyEDAT- 2010/06/19 06:00MHDA- 2010/09/30 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/19 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181e3cb22 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2010 Jul-Aug;56(4):356-63. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181e3cb22.
