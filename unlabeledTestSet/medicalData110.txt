However, since 2005 the Berlin Heart      pediatric ventricular assist device has been increasingly widely used for both      biventricular and left ventricular support. The device is available in a wide      range of sizes, allowing its use in children as small as 5 kg and as large as 60       kg. It has been applied in end-stage heart failure of both structural/congenital       and myopathic etiology (including myocarditis). In the article the technique for       implantation of the device will be described, with focus on certain details that       facilitate safe implantation and subsequent explantation, whether in the setting       of a heart transplant operation or in the setting of recovery of native heart      function.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
