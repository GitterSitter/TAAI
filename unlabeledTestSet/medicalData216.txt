Nonetheless, end-of-life (EOL) issues are inevitable and how to approach them      underreported. METHODS: Our DT data registry was queried for eligible patients,      defined as those individuals who actively participated in EOL decision making.      The process from early EOL discussion to palliation and death was reviewed. We      recorded the causes leading to EOL discussion, time from EOL decision to      withdrawal and from withdrawal to death, and location. Primary caregivers were      surveyed to qualify their experience and identify themes relevant to this      process. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2009, 92 DT LVADs were implanted in 69      patients. Twenty patients qualified for inclusion (mean length of support: 833      days). A decrease in quality of life from new/worsening comorbidities usually      prompted EOL discussion. Eleven patients died at home, 8 in the hospital and 1 in      a nursing home. Time from EOL decision to LVAD withdrawal ranged from <1 day to 2      weeks and from withdrawal until death was <20 minutes in all cases. Palliative      care was provided to all patients. Ongoing assistance from the healthcare team      facilitated closure and ensured comfort at EOL. CONCLUSIONS: With expanding      indications and improved technology, more DT LVADs will be implanted and for      longer durations, and more patients will face EOL issues. A multidisciplinary      team approach with protocols involving DT patients and their families in EOL      decision making allows for continuity of care and ensures dignity and comfort at       EOL.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
