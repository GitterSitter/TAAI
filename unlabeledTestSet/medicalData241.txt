This article is the second       in a 2-part series reviewing interventional heart failure therapy. Interventions       included in this discussion include those indicated for the treatment of      end-stage refractory heart failure, including interventional medical therapy,      interventional treatment of valvular disease, mechanical assist devices, and      heart transplantation. Also included is a review of the currently available      catheter-based pumps, which are intended to provide temporary support in patients      with acute hemodynamic compromise. The use of cellular or stem cell therapy for      the treatment of heart failure is an emerging interventional therapy and data      supporting its use for the treatment heart failure will also be presented, as      will a discussion of the role of palliative care and self-care in heart failure      therapy.FAU - Thompson, Keith AAU  - Thompson KAAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Cedars Sinai Heart Institute,      Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.FAU - Philip, Kiran JAU  - Philip KJFAU - Simsir, SinanAU  - Simsir SFAU - Schwarz, Ernst RAU  - Schwarz ERLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20100701PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Pharmacol TherJT  - Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeuticsJID - 9602617RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)SB  - IMMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/therapeutic useMH  - Heart Failure/drug therapy/surgery/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Valve Diseases/drug therapy/surgery/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Palliative CareMH  - Self CareMH  - Stem Cell TransplantationEDAT- 2010/07/03 06:00MHDA- 2010/12/24 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/03 06:00PHST- 2010/07/01 [aheadofprint]AID - 1074248410369111 [pii]AID - 10.1177/1074248410369111 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther. 2010 Sep;15(3):231-43. doi:      10.1177/1074248410369111.
