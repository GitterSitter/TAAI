Advanced stage of heart failure].PG  - 343-6AB  - Heart failure is considering one of the most prevalent diseases in recent years.       Despite advances in the treatment with new drugs and devices such as implantable       defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy, the progression in heart      failure leads to deterioration in the quality of life, frequent hospitalizations       and high mortality rates. Advanced stage of this disease remains heart      transplantation for treatment choice, although is not the adequate therapy for      all the patients. Many of them require support with inotropic drugs, which lead      to a progressive deterioration and limited survival, because waiting times are      prolonged or transplantation is not performed. Therefore, progress in circulatory      support devices allow to consider these as the treatment while awaiting      transplantation and an alternative when the transplant is not considered an      option. It is our objective to review the progress and the usefulness of      circulatory support devices in patients with advanced heart failure, in which the      last option is heart transplantation.FAU - Ventura, HectorAU  - Ventura HAD  - Seccion Miocardiopatia y Trasplante Cardiaco.
