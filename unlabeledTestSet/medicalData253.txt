The purpose of this study was to compare waitlist mortality and      survival for ECMO versus ventricular assist device (VAD) support. A review was      conducted of all patients listed for heart transplantation (HTx) since 2002 and      requiring mechanical support. VAD support has been available from 2004 (Berlin      Heart Excor Pediatrics). Competing risks analysis was used to model survival to      one of four outcomes (HTx, death on waitlist, delisting, improvement). Thirty-six      patients were on mechanical support while awaiting HTx (21 ECMO, 12 VAD, three      both). Median age at listing was 1.2 years (birth-16.6 years) for ECMO and 11.3      years (0.3-14.6 years) for VAD. Diagnosis was cardiomyopathy in 33% for ECMO and       93% for VAD. Median time to HTx was 37 days (1-930) overall, 20 days (1-85) for      ECMO, and 39 days (5-108) for VAD. Mechanical support was associated with      increased odds of HTx (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [1.7-3.3], P < 0.0001) but also      delisting or death waiting (HR 3.0 [1.1-7.8], P = 0.03). Waitlist mortality of      38% on ECMO was reduced to 13% with VAD use. Survival post-HTx to hospital      discharge was better in the group on VAD support (92 vs. 80%). Pediatric patients      requiring mechanical support as a bridge to HTx have short wait times but high      waitlist mortality. Those patients who survived to be put on the Berlin Heart      Excor Pediatric device based on individualized clinical decision making then had       a lower waitlist mortality, a longer duration of support, and a higher survival      to transplantation and hospital discharge.CI  - (c) 2010, Copyright the Authors.
