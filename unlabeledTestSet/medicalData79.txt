Studies addressing the effect of VADs on post-transplant      outcomes have shown conflicting results. It is imperative to review this evidence      to inform clinical decision making and future research. Our aim was to      systematically evaluate the effect of VAD therapy on long-term post-transplant      outcomes in heart transplant recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched online       databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL) and references of included      articles. Comparative studies evaluating the effect of VADs on post-transplant      outcomes in adults were included and study results were meta-analysed using      random-effects models. We conducted subgroup analyses to assess the effect      estimate of extra- vs. intra-corporeal VADs and to evaluate the impact of      transplant era and listing status. Overall, we identified 31 observational      studies. One-year post-transplant mortality in recipients bridged with an      extra-corporeal VAD was significantly higher than in non-bridged recipients (RR      1.8, 95% CI 1.53-2.13, I(2)= 1%), while patients supported with an      intra-corporeal VAD had similar mortality to non-bridged recipients (RR 1.08, 95%      CI 0.95-1.22, I(2)= 0%). The risks of rejection within the first post-transplant       year and coronary allograft vasculopathy were not significantly different between      patients with or without VAD support prior to transplant. Publication bias was      low; however, the risk of bias across studies was moderate to high. CONCLUSION:      Intra-corporeal VAD support does not have a deleterious impact on post-transplant      outcomes. However, post-transplant survival may be poorer in the subgroup of      patients supported with extra-corporeal devices. Studies with greater      methodological rigour are warranted.FAU - Alba, Ana CAU  - Alba ACAD  - Division of Cardiology and Heart Transplantation, Toronto General Hospital, 585      University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. carolina.alba@uhn.on.caFAU - McDonald, MichaelAU  - McDonald MFAU - Rao, VivekAU  - Rao VFAU - Ross, Heather JAU  - Ross HJFAU - Delgado, Diego HAU  - Delgado DHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20110506PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595SB  - IMMH  - Confidence IntervalsMH  - Heart Failure/epidemiology/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - RiskMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Time FactorsMH  - TransplantationMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2011/05/10 06:00MHDA- 2011/11/11 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/10 06:00PHST- 2011/05/06 [aheadofprint]AID - hfr050 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfr050 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2011 Jul;13(7):785-95. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hfr050.
