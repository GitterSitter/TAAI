Despite significant progress in the treatment of systolic heart failure using      medical and device therapies, this terminal phase continues to be prevalent and      associated with unacceptably high morbidity and mortality. Given the inability to      offer cardiac transplantation to the majority of those presenting with advanced      heart failure, alternative strategies for cardiac replacement therapy are often      required. Although there has been interest in using mechanical devices to support      the circulation since the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass, it is only in the      past 20 years that ventricular assist devices (VAD) have become viable options      for therapy. Indeed, we are now entering an era where circulatory assist devices       are being used not only to temporarily support patients with post-cardiotomy      shock, but also as a long-term treatment in ambulatory heart failure patients.      Furthermore, we are now able to utilize data from multicenter trials and      registries to guide treatment decisions. These data have clearly shown that VADs       improve survival and quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure when      implanted as a temporary measure (bridge to recovery and bridge to transplant) or      as long-term support (destination therapy). However, with a growing heart failure      population there is much work to be done to improve VAD technology, patient      selection, post-implantation management, and to define the optimal role for      assist devices in the management of systolic heart failure. We are also in the      nascent stages of fully understanding the impact of mechanical support on the      failing myocardium, and developing research methodologies to study novel      therapies in tandem with VADs to facilitate ventricular recovery. These important      questions are currently being addressed in ongoing clinical trials, registry      analyses, and translational research endeavors.FAU - Patel, Chetan BAU  - Patel CBAD  - Division of Cardiology, Duke University Medical Center, Box 3034 DUMC, Durham,      NC, 27710, USA.FAU - Alexander, Kevin MAU  - Alexander KMFAU - Rogers, Joseph GAU  - Rogers JGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc MedJT  - Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicineJID - 9815942EDAT- 2010/11/11 06:00MHDA- 2010/11/11 06:01CRDT- 2010/11/11 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11936-010-0093-6 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2010 Dec;12(6):549-65. doi:      10.1007/s11936-010-0093-6.
