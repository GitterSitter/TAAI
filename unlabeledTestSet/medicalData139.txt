However, it is unknown whether functionally competent CSCs of both      classes are present in the myocardium of patients affected by end-stage cardiac      failure, and whether these cells can be harvested from relatively small      myocardial samples. OBJECTIVE: To establish whether a clinically relevant number       of mCSCs and vCSCs can be isolated and expanded from endomyocardial biopsies of      patients undergoing cardiac transplantation or left ventricular assist device      implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endomyocardial biopsies were collected with a       bioptome from the right side of the septum of explanted hearts or the apical LV      core at the time of left ventricular assist device implantation. Two to 5      biopsies from each patient were enzymatically dissociated, and, after expansion,       cells were sorted for c-kit (mCSCs) or c-kit and KDR (vCSCs) and characterized.      mCSCs and vCSCs constituted 97% and 3% of the c-kit population, respectively.      Population doubling time averaged 27 hours in mCSCs and vCSCs; 5x10(6) mCSCs and       vCSCs were obtained in 28 and 41 days, respectively. Both CSC classes possessed      significant growth reserve as documented by high telomerase activity and      relatively long telomeres. mCSCs formed mostly cardiomyocytes, and vCSCs      endothelial and smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: The growth properties of mCSCs       and vCSCs isolated from endomyocardial biopsies from patients with advanced heart      failure were comparable to those obtained previously from larger myocardial      samples of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.FAU - D'Amario, DomenicoAU  - D'Amario DAD  - Departments of Anesthesia and Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard      Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. panversa@partners.orgFAU - Fiorini, ClaudiaAU  - Fiorini CFAU - Campbell, Patricia MAU  - Campbell PMFAU - Goichberg, PolinaAU  - Goichberg PFAU - Sanada, FumihiroAU  - Sanada FFAU - Zheng, HanqiaoAU  - Zheng HFAU - Hosoda, ToruAU  - Hosoda TFAU - Rota, MarcelloAU  - Rota MFAU - Connell, John MAU  - Connell JMFAU - Gallegos, Robert PAU  - Gallegos RPFAU - Welt, Frederick GAU  - Welt FGFAU - Givertz, Michael MAU  - Givertz MMFAU - Mitchell, Richard NAU  - Mitchell RNFAU - Leri, AnnarosaAU  - Leri AFAU - Kajstura, JanAU  - Kajstura JFAU - Pfeffer, Marc AAU  - Pfeffer MAFAU - Anversa, PieroAU  - Anversa PLA  - engSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00893360GR  - P01 AG023071/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - P01 AG023071-01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - P01 HL092868/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - P01 HL092868-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - P20 HL101866-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG017042/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG017042-06/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG026107/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG026107-01A1/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG037490/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG037490-01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG037495/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AG037495-01A1/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL039902/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL039902-17/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL065573/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL065573-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL065573-05A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL065577/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL065577-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL075480/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL075480-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL091021/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL105532/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL105532-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL111183/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R21 HL094894/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R21 HL094894-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R37 HL081737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R37 HL081737-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20110217PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ ResJT  - Circulation researchJID - 0047103SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Adult Stem Cells/*pathology/*physiologyMH  - AgedMH  - BiopsyMH  - Cardiomyopathies/*pathology/physiopathologyMH  - Cell Differentiation/physiologyMH  - Cell ProliferationMH  - Cells, CulturedMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/pathology/physiopathologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardium/*pathologyMH  - Telomere/pathologyPMC - PMC3074470MID - NIHMS279959OID - NLM: NIHMS279959OID - NLM: PMC3074470EDAT- 2011/02/19 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/18 06:00CRDT- 2011/02/19 06:00PHST- 2011/02/17 [aheadofprint]AID - CIRCRESAHA.111.241380 [pii]AID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.241380 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ Res. 2011 Apr 1;108(7):857-61. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.241380.
