METHODS: From December 1996 to July 2006 the ECMO was implanted in      108 patients (73 adult, mean age: 49.3+/-18.0 yrs and 35 children, mean age: 1.3       +/- 2.7 yrs) with mostly postcardiotomy cardiac low output. The surgical      procedures included congenital heart surgery (n=35), heart transplantation (HTx)       (n=21), coronary artery bypass operation (CABG) and/or valvular operation (n=33),      other operations (n=6) and 13 patients with ECMO support for bridge to recovery.       RESULTS: The mean supporting time was 5.1+/-5.6 days. Overall, 30-day-survival      was 40.2%. Best survival rates were seen after congenital heart surgery (24/35,      65.7%) and after HTx (9/21, 42.9%); the worst rates were in the group of CABG      and/or valvular operations (5/33, 15.2%), only ECMO support (3/13, 23.1%) and      other operations (1/6, 16.7%). Fifty-four patients died while supported by ECMO,       15 were weaned from ECMO but died in hospital, 39 patients were weaned and      survived. Causes of death were multi-organ failure (40.6%), bleeding (23.2%),      persistent cardiac low output (21.7%), thrombembolic events (8.7%), and graft      failure (5.8%). Markers for adverse outcome were identified as older age, high      body weight, increased AST/GOT levels, and lower thrombocyte count in adults; and      as higher levels of serum creatinine in pediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO      support showed best results in pediatric patients after congenital heart surgery       and in patients after HTx in contrast to multimorbid, older patients with often      irreversible myocardial damage.FAU - Beiras-Fernandez, AndresAU  - Beiras-Fernandez AAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Grosshadern University Hospital,      Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) Munich - Germany. abeiras@med.uni-muenchen.deFAU - Deutsch, Marcus-AndreAU  - Deutsch MAFAU - Kainzinger, SandraAU  - Kainzinger SFAU - Kaczmarek, IngoAU  - Kaczmarek IFAU - Sodian, RalfAU  - Sodian RFAU - Ueberfuhr, PeterAU  - Ueberfuhr PFAU - Meiser, BrunoAU  - Meiser BFAU - Schmoeckel, MichaelAU  - Schmoeckel MFAU - Reichart, BrunoAU  - Reichart BFAU - Brenner, PaoloAU  - Brenner PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ItalyTA  - Int J Artif OrgansJT  - The International journal of artificial organsJID - 7802649RN  - 0 (Biocompatible Materials)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Biocompatible MaterialsMH  - *Cardiac OutputMH  - Cardiac Output, Low/etiology/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects/mortalityMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/adverse effects/instrumentation/mortalityMH  - FemaleMH  - GermanyMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Infant, NewbornMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Survival RateMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/05/03 06:00MHDA- 2011/08/24 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/03 06:00PHST- 2011/01/24 [accepted]AID - 4BA88B3A-438E-4F4E-A530-222DC945CB8F [pii]AID - 10.5301/IJAO.2011.7727 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Artif Organs. 2011 Apr;34(4):365-73. doi: 10.5301/IJAO.2011.7727.
