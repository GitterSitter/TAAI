Heart transplantation provides an effective treatment for a subset of these      patients. This article provides cardiologists with up-to-date information about      referral for transplantation, the role of left ventricular assist devices prior      to transplant, patient selection, waiting-list management and donor heart      availability. Timing is of central importance; patients should be referred before      complications (eg, cardiorenal syndrome or secondary pulmonary hypertension) have      developed that will increase the risk of, or potentially contraindicate,      transplantation. Issues related to heart failure aetiology, comorbidity and      adherence to medical treatment are reviewed. Finally, the positive role that      cardiologists can play in promoting and facilitating organ donation is discussed.FAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRAD  - Consultant in Cardiology, Transplant Medicine and Circulatory Support, The Royal       Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, Harefield Hospital, Hill End Road, Harefield,      Middlesex UB9 6JH, UK. n.banner@rbht.nhs.ukFAU - Bonser, Robert SAU  - Bonser RSFAU - Clark, Andrew LAU  - Clark ALFAU - Clark, StephenAU  - Clark SFAU - Cowburn, Peter JAU  - Cowburn PJFAU - Gardner, Roy SAU  - Gardner RSFAU - Kalra, Paul RAU  - Kalra PRFAU - McDonagh, TheresaAU  - McDonagh TFAU - Rogers, Chris AAU  - Rogers CAFAU - Swan, LornaAU  - Swan LFAU - Parameshwar, JayanAU  - Parameshwar JFAU - Thomas, Helen LAU  - Thomas HLFAU - Williams, Simon GAU  - Williams SGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - HeartJT  - Heart (British Cardiac Society)JID - 9602087SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - Great BritainMH  - Heart Failure/complications/*surgery/therapyMH  - *Heart Transplantation/adverse effectsMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Physician's RoleMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Referral and ConsultationMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Waiting ListsEDAT- 2011/08/23 06:00MHDA- 2011/10/14 06:00CRDT- 2011/08/23 06:00AID - heartjnl-2011-300048 [pii]AID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2011-300048 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart. 2011 Sep;97(18):1520-7. doi: 10.1136/heartjnl-2011-300048.
