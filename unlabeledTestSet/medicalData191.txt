TECHNIQUE: The technique is illustrated      in a 72-year-old man with end-stage lung disease who received a left single lung       transplant. On postoperative day 54, he was evaluated for recurrent dyspnea on      exertion that was due to a severe stenosis at the site of the pulmonary artery      anastomosis. Balloon angioplasty was performed, and a 10-mm stent was deployed,      with marked clinical improvement. Fourteen months later, he presented with      recurrent symptoms due to in-stent restenosis. Multiple attempts at      catheterization and balloon angioplasty of the stent failed. Due to the technical      difficulty involved in maneuvering the balloon while maintaining stability, it      was decided to repeat the angioplasty with the assistance of a Hansen Sensei      remote robotic navigation system. The robotic arm markedly enhanced stability and      facilitated successful navigation of the stented site. A 16-mm-diameter Wallstent      was placed through the previously placed balloon-expandable stent and      postdilated. CONCLUSION: A remote robotic catheter navigation system was able to       assist stenting of an anastomotic pulmonary artery stenosis following failure of       conventional interventional techniques.FAU - Lumsden, Alan BAU  - Lumsden ABAD  - Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery,       The Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.
