However, implanting all components of a      pulsatile total artificial heart (TAH) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      is complex because of the requirement for a continuous electrical power supply      and the need for volume compensation. Implantable compliance chambers were      developed for early LVAD designs, and although they functioned properly during      initial laboratory tests, air loss by diffusion and the development of fibrous      tissue around the sac eventually rendered them ineffective. Because these      problems have not yet been overcome, volume displacement LVADs are currently      designed with either a direct communication to an external drive console or an      atmospheric vent. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETSs) were also      developed, but because the skin was being penetrated for volume compensation, it       seemed more efficient to transmit electrical power through wires incorporated      into the venting apparatus. More recently, TETSs were used clinically for both a       pulsatile TAH and LVAD in a small number of patients, but for reasons unrelated      to the TETS, neither of these devices is presently in use. Because the newer      continuous-flow LVADs do not require a compliance chamber, they present a      potential future application for TETS technology, because infections of the      percutaneous tube continue to be one of the most important limitations of      long-term circulatory support. A totally implantable LVAD with an incorporated      TETS for destination therapy could become an important advance in the treatment      of end-stage heart failure.FAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSAD  - Division of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA. mark.slaughter@louisville.eduFAU - Myers, Timothy JAU  - Myers TJLA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - Electric Power SuppliesMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/instrumentation/*methodsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*historyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - History, 21st CenturyMH  - HumansEDAT- 2010/07/21 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/22 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/21 06:00AID - JCS1074 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01074.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2010 Jul;25(4):484-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01074.x.
