The ventricular assist devices and extracorporeal membrane oxygenators      are the mainstay of mechanical circulatory support devices for the patients with       extremely low cardiac output. However, they come at a price of significant risk      factors, including intracranial hemorrhage. The incidence of intracranial      hemorrhage on extracorporeal membrane oxygenators and on ventricular assist      devices is 37% and 13% to 14%, respectively. METHODS/RESULTS: The cases in this      series focus on the risks of ICH and the decompressive craniotomies that were      carried out on patients while they were on mechanical circulatory support. The      intraoperative anesthetic management for patients on mechanical circulatory      support for the noncardiothoracic anesthesiologist is highlighted. CONCLUSIONS:      The results of recent cardiothoracic surgery trials have led to an increase of      surgical management instead of medical management in the treatment of heart      failure. Although most agree with the immediate reversal of anticoagulation and      antiplatelet therapy, there is no standard protocol for restarting      anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after craniotomy in this population. The       standard practices of resuscitation and ACLS including inotropes, vasopressors,      and vasodilators (with the exception of chest compressions that can dislodge the       devices), can be used as needed. The identification of cardiothoracic surgeons      and perfusionists who are available for immediate assistance as and when required      during the surgery and transportation is an important factor.FAU - Factora, Faith N FAU  - Factora FNAD  - Anesthesiology Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.FAU - Bustamante, SergioAU  - Bustamante SFAU - Spiotta, AlejandroAU  - Spiotta AFAU - Avitsian, RafiAU  - Avitsian RLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Neurosurg AnesthesiolJT  - Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiologyJID - 8910749SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aortic Valve/surgeryMH  - BioprosthesisMH  - Brain Edema/etiology/therapyMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/surgeryMH  - Cerebral Hemorrhage, Traumatic/surgeryMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - Fatal OutcomeMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/complicationsMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Valve ProsthesisMH  - Heart Valve Prosthesis ImplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Intensive CareMH  - Intracranial Hemorrhages/*surgeryMH  - Intraoperative CareMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Mitral Valve/surgeryMH  - Postoperative Complications/therapyMH  - Tomography, X-Ray ComputedEDAT- 2010/08/14 06:00MHDA- 2011/05/05 06:00CRDT- 2010/08/14 06:00AID - 10.1097/ANA.0b013e3181eee55e [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Neurosurg Anesthesiol. 2011 Jan;23(1):30-4. doi: 10.1097/ANA.0b013e3181eee55e.
