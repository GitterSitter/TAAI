This study      examined the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-tissue inhibitors of      metalloproteinases (TIMP) axis in the process of recovery after unloading in a      rat ischemic-induce heart failure (HF) model. Myocardial infarction model was      created with the coronary artery ligation. The infarcted rats hearts were      unloaded by heterotopic cardiac transplantation (n=14). 2 weeks later, the      function of normal and infarcted hearts with or without loading was evaluated by       Langendorff perfusion model. The hearts were then harvested and prepared for the       study of expression of MMPs and TIMPs. Developed pressure in the unloading group       was higher than the loading group (P=0.0074). Unloading increased the ratio of      TIMP-1-MMP-1(1.38+/-0.11 vs. 0.76+/-0.09, P<0.05), TIMP-2-MMP-2 (1.06+/-0.10 vs.       0.33+/-0.07, P<0.01), TIMP-3-MMP-9(1.07+/-0.08 vs. 0.59+/-0.06, P<0.05). Although      MMP-1, 2, 9 were downregulated (P<0.01, 0.01, 0.05, respectively), TIMP-2 and      TIMP-3 upregulated (P<0.01, 0.05, respectively), MMP-7 and TIMP-1 was not      affected significantly. The infarcted cardiac function could be improved by      unloading. It was attributed to downregulation of MMP-1, 2 and 9, and      upregulation of TIMP-2 and -3, and furthermore, the ratio of TIMPs to MMPs was      increased, which might be more sensitive than sole MMPs or TIMPs for the judgment      of myocardial matrix homeostasis.FAU - Wang, Wei-jianAU  - Wang WJAD  - Department of Anesthesiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical      College, Zhejiang, 325003, People's Republic of China.FAU - Meng, Zi-liAU  - Meng ZLFAU - Mo, Yun-changAU  - Mo YCFAU - Liu, Jun-weiAU  - Liu JWFAU - Sun, Cheng-chaoAU  - Sun CCFAU - Hu, Sheng-shouAU  - Hu SSFAU - Zhang, HaoAU  - Zhang HLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110511PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Mol Biol RepJT  - Molecular biology reportsJID - 0403234RN  - 0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)RN  - EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Blood PressureMH  - Blotting, WesternMH  - Coronary Vessels/surgeryMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - Gene Expression Regulation/*physiologyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*physiologyMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - LigationMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolismMH  - Myocardial Infarction/*surgeryMH  - RatsMH  - Recovery of Function/*physiologyMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/*metabolismMH  - Transplantation, Heterotopic/*physiologyEDAT- 2011/05/12 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/22 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/12 06:00PHST- 2010/08/10 [received]PHST- 2011/04/23 [accepted]PHST- 2011/05/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s11033-011-0736-z [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Mol Biol Rep. 2012 Jan;39(1):277-83. doi: 10.1007/s11033-011-0736-z.
