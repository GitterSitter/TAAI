Together with their      potential for miniaturization, these pumps seem suitable for long-term support of      patients with a wide range of body surface areas (BSA). Recently, the novel HVAD       pump (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA), a miniaturized centrifugal pump with a      hydrodynamic, magnetically levitated rotor, became ready for clinical      application. METHODS: In a multi-institutional trial in Europe and Australia, 23       patients (mean age, 47.9 +/- 12 years) in end-stage heart failure were enrolled      in 5 centers. The primary end point of the bridge-to-transplant study was      survival to heart transplant or survival to 180 days on the device, whichever      occurred first. Follow-up data at 1 year are presented. The small size of the      device allows for intrapericardial placement of the pump. RESULTS: Implant      procedures were generally fast and uneventful. Mean duration of support was 167      +/- 143 days (range, 13-425 days), and mean blood flow provided by the pump was      6.1 +/- 1.1 liters/min. At the 180-day end point, 2 patients had undergone      successful transplant at 157 and 175 days, 2 patients died while on the device,      and 19 patients continued pump support for more than 180 days. Actuarial survival      after 6 months was 91% and was 86% at the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The      design of the HVAD pump enables a quick and less invasive implantation. The      results to date demonstrate satisfactory long-term survival with excellent      quality of life in this cohort of 23 patients of the initial multi-institutional       Conformite Europeene (CE) mark trial.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
