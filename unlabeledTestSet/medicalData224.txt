Pre-existing valve abnormalities are common in this       population, and subsequent development of valve abnormalities after LVAD      placement is also often noted. Although native mitral and tricuspid valve disease      is more common in heart failure patients before LVAD placement, aortic valves are      much more likely to generate abnormal pathophysiology in the LVAD patient during       as well as after LVAD placement. The aim of this comprehensive review is to      review aortic valve function in LVAD patients and highlight the consideration of       pre-existing valve disease on patient treatment at the time of LVAD implant. The       basis for structural changes leading to valve pathophysiology during and after      LVAD placement will be described, providing a basis for improved clinical      understanding and new strategies to prevent these conditions.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
