We aimed to evaluate the quality of two      different systems based on patients' perspective and its interrelationship with      quality of life. Differential assessment of the HeartMate II axial flow pump (n =      17; Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and the HVAD centrifugal pump (n = 10;      HeartWare, Inc., Miramar, FL, USA) was obtained from 27 outpatients by a      questionnaire 2 months to 2.9 years after device implantation. In addition, a      health-related quality of life questionnaire (Short Form-36 [SF-36]) was      completed. Overall patients' satisfaction was high. Severe limitations were      attributed to the loudness of the power base unit in HeartMate II patients (P =      0.00), and HVAD patients were dissatisfied by the length of the driveline (P =      0.02). Between HVAD and HeartMate II patients, no significant differences in the       quality of life (assessed by SF-36) were reported. While the overall satisfaction      of outpatients on LVAD support was high, differences between the systems were      found. Patients' perspectives may have an important impact on future modification      of external components. Ultimately, this may also contribute to an improvement in      the quality of life of chronic LVAD patients.CI  - (c) 2010, Copyright the Authors.
