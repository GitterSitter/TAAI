METHODS AND RESULTS: A       prospective, longitudinal study was designed with predefined dyssynchrony indexes      and outcome variables to test the hypothesis that baseline dyssynchrony is      associated with long-term survival after CRT. We studied 229 consecutive class      III to IV heart failure patients with ejection fraction </=35 and QRS duration      >/=120 milliseconds for CRT. Dyssynchrony before CRT was defined as tissue      Doppler velocity opposing-wall delay >/=65 milliseconds, 12-site SD (Yu Index)      >/=32 milliseconds, speckle tracking radial strain anteroseptal-to-posterior wall      delay >/=130 milliseconds, or pulsed Doppler interventricular mechanical delay      >/=40 milliseconds. Outcome was defined as freedom from death, heart      transplantation, or left ventricular assist device implantation. Of 210 patients       (89) with dyssynchrony data available, there were 62 events: 47 deaths, 9      transplantations, and 6 left ventricular assist device implantations over 4      years. Event-free survival was associated with Yu Index (P=0.003), speckle      tracking radial strain (P=0.003), and interventricular mechanical delay      (P=0.019). When adjusted for confounding baseline variables of ischemic origin      and QRS duration, Yu Index and radial strain dyssynchrony remained independently       associated with outcome (P<0.05). Lack of radial dyssynchrony was particularly      associated with unfavorable outcome in those with QRS duration of 120 to 150      milliseconds (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The absence of echocardiographic      dyssynchrony was associated with significantly less favorable event-free survival      after CRT. Patients with narrower QRS duration who lacked dyssynchrony had the      least favorable long-term outcome. These observations support the relationship of      dyssynchrony and CRT response.FAU - Gorcsan, John 3rdAU  - Gorcsan J 3rdAD  - University of Pittsburgh, Scaife 564, 200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2582,       USA. gorcsanj@upmc.eduFAU - Oyenuga, OlusegunAU  - Oyenuga OFAU - Habib, Phillip JAU  - Habib PJFAU - Tanaka, HidekazuAU  - Tanaka HFAU - Adelstein, Evan CAU  - Adelstein ECFAU - Hara, HideyukiAU  - Hara HFAU - McNamara, Dennis MAU  - McNamara DMFAU - Saba, SamirAU  - Saba SLA  - engGR  - K24 HL004503/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K24 HL004503-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K24 HL04503-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL086918/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL086918-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL086918-03S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20101025PL  - United StatesTA  - CirculationJT  - CirculationJID - 0147763SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Circulation. 2011 Jul 12;124(2):e37; author reply e38.
