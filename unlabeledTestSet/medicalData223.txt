The operative and      peri-operative management of these patients has been varied. METHODS: A      retrospective study of VADs between January 1994 and June 2008 revealed 10      patients with previous prosthetic valves requiring management during and after      VAD placement. Three patients were supported postcardiotomy after valve surgery.       Two patients were supported due to cardiogenic shock postoperatively. Four      patients were supported as a bridge to transplantation. One patient was supported      as a destination therapy (DT). RESULTS: The mitral, valve was left untreated      during VAD implantation regardless of valve repair or replacement. For aortic      valves, the mechanical aortic valve was replaced with tissue valve in two      patients and left untreated in one case. One patient had tricuspid valve repair      previously and was left untouched. All patients with prosthetic valves in aortic,      mitral and tricuspid position during VAD support received anticoagulation      therapy. There were four deaths, and four went on to transplantation. One patient      was weaned from VAD and discharged from the hospital. One patient received      HeartMate I as DT. The most common causes of death were multisystem organ failure      (MSOF) and sepsis. One patient had a thromboembolic event. CONCLUSIONS: The      survival rate of 60% is encouraging when compared to overall survival rates. The       most common cause of death was MSOF. Patients with prosthetic valves may be      safely managed during VAD support.CI  - (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Liu, TongAU  - Liu TAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,       Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.FAU - Jessup, MariellAU  - Jessup MFAU - Acker, MichaelAU  - Acker MFAU - Morris, RohintonAU  - Morris RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - *BioprosthesisMH  - Cardiomyopathies/diagnosis/surgeryMH  - *Cause of DeathMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Valve Diseases/mortality/*surgeryMH  - *Heart Valve ProsthesisMH  - Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation/*methods/mortalityMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hospital Mortality/trendsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Monitoring, Intraoperative/methodsMH  - Postoperative Complications/physiopathologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Sampling StudiesMH  - Survival RateEDAT- 2010/08/04 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/08 06:00CRDT- 2010/08/04 06:00AID - JCS1098 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01098.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2010 Sep;25(5):601-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01098.x.
