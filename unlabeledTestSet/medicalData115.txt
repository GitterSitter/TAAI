The purpose of this study was to compare the gene expression profiles      of recovered and non-recovered LVAD patients in order to identify mechanisms      underlying the recovery process and differences which may determine outcome.      Myocardial expression of 54 genes chosen for their potential role in heart      failure and tissue repair was measured using quantitative PCR at the time of LVAD      implantation and again at explantation (recovery, n = 13) or transplantation      (non-recovery, n = 5). Patients who went on to recover had higher levels of      Gialpha2, EPAC2 and lower levels of IGF2 at the time of LVAD implant compared to       patients who failed to recover. During recovery, expression of BNP, IL-1beta, VWF      and SFRP1 was decreased whilst RGS4 increased. Expression of IGF1 and      pro-fibrotic genes was coordinated during recovery. Correlation analysis      identified a novel co-regulation of SFRP1 and betaMHC in myocardium. In summary,       the gene expression profile underlying recovery is complex and comprises both      regression and exacerbation of elements of the pathological gene program.      Modulation of Gialpha2, EPAC2, RGS4 and SFRP1 indicates that inhibition of cAMP      signalling may potentiate recovery prior to treatment whilst enhanced cAMP and      Wnt signalling may underlie recovery during LVAD support.FAU - Felkin, Leanne ElizabethAU  - Felkin LEAD  - Heart Science Centre, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London,      Harefield, Middlesex, UK.FAU - Lara-Pezzi, Enrique AAU  - Lara-Pezzi EAFAU - Hall, Jennifer LAU  - Hall JLFAU - Birks, Emma JAU  - Birks EJFAU - Barton, Paul J RAU  - Barton PJLA  - engGR  - R21 DK078029/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110322PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Transl ResJT  - Journal of cardiovascular translational researchJID - 101468585RN  - 0 (Cardiovascular Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiovascular Agents/*pharmacologyMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - EnglandMH  - FemaleMH  - Gene Expression Profiling/methodsMH  - Gene Expression Regulation/drug effectsMH  - Heart Failure/drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence AnalysisMH  - Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Stroke Volume/*drug effects/geneticsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Function, Left/*drug effects/geneticsMH  - Ventricular Remodeling/*drug effects/geneticsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/03/23 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/17 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/23 06:00PHST- 2010/12/07 [received]PHST- 2011/02/15 [accepted]PHST- 2011/03/22 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12265-011-9267-1 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2011 Jun;4(3):321-31. doi: 10.1007/s12265-011-9267-1.
