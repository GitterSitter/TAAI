We created biVAD using the artificial       muscles (AMs) that supports both ventricles at the same time. We developed the      test bench (TB) as the in vitro evaluating system to enable the measurement of      performance. The biVAD exerts different pressure between left and right ventricle      like the heart physiologically does. The heart model based on child's heart was      constructed in silicone. This model was fitted with the biVAD. Two pipettes      containing water with an ultrasonic sensor placed on top of each and attached to       ventricles reproduced the preload and the after load of each ventricle by the      real-time measurement of the fluid height variation proportionally to the exerted      pressure. The LabVIEW software extrapolated the displaced volume and the pressure      generated by each side of our biVAD. The development of a standardized protocol      permitted the validation of the TB for in vitro evaluation, measurement of the      performances of the AM biVAD herein, and reproducibility of data.FAU - Muradbegovic, MirzaAU  - Muradbegovic MAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Centre Hospitalier Univesitaire Vaud      (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland. mirza.muradbegovic@chuv.chFAU - Taub, StevenAU  - Taub SFAU - Rizzo, ElenaAU  - Rizzo EFAU - von Segesser, Ludwig KAU  - von Segesser LKFAU - Tozzi, PiergiorgioAU  - Tozzi PLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Validation StudiesPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Artificial OrgansMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - ChildMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - In Vitro TechniquesMH  - Models, CardiovascularMH  - MusclesMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - SoftwareEDAT- 2011/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/13 06:00CRDT- 2011/01/15 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2011 Jan-Feb;57(1):62-7.
