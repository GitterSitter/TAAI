Many of these patients ultimately develop end-stage heart       failure requiring left ventricular assist device implantation (LVAD). However,      morphologic differences in the systemic ventricle of these patients require      careful attention to cannula placement. We report on the evolution of our      surgical technique for implanting LVADs in 3 patients with transposition of the      great arteries and congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.      Applying standard LV cannulation techniques to the systemic ventricle led us too       anteriorly in our first patient, creating obstruction by the moderator band.      Subsequent use of epicardial and transesophageal echocardiography allowed for      intraoperative localization of the intracardiac muscular structures to identify      the optimal cannulation site. The acute angle of the inflow cannula on the      DeBakey LVAD (MicroMed Technology, Houston, TX) required flipping the device 180       degrees . The HeartMate II device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) could be shifted      towards the midline. One patient underwent successful transplant and 2 are home      waiting for a donor organ. We conclude from our experience that LVAD surgery can       be safely performed in patients with congenital heart disease when implanted      under echocardiographic guidance.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
