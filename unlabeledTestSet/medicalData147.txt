This increase is based largely on the results of several      recently completed clinical trials with the new second-generation continuous-flow      devices that showed significant improvements in survival, functional capacity,      and quality of life. Additional information on the use of the first- and      second-generation left ventricular assist devices has come from a recently      released report spanning the years 2006 to 2009, from the Interagency Registry      for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, a National Heart, Lung, and Blood       Institute-sponsored collaboration between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,       the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the scientific community. The      authors review the latest clinical trials and data from the registry, with tight       integration of the landmark molecular, cellular, and genomic research that      accompanies the reverse remodeling of the human heart in response to a left      ventricular assist device and functional recovery that has been reported in a      subset of these patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
