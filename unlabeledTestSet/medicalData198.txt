Newer generation      continuous-flow (CF) LVADs are smaller, requiring smaller pump pockets and      drive-line exit sites as compared with pulsatile-flow (PF) devices. With their      recent adoption, CF device patients benefit from improved provider experience in       the detection and treatment of infectious complications. Given these advances in       design and experience, we examined the incidence of infectious complications in      patients receiving CF and PF devices. METHODS: We reviewed patients who received       CF or PF LVADs (June 2000 to May 2009) at our institution. Incidences and timing       of systemic infections (bacteremia, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock),      device-associated infections (drive-line, LVAD pocket, sternal wound) and      non-device-associated infections (catheter-related bloodstream, pneumonia,      urinary tract) were compared between devices. Primary outcomes were sepsis,      severe sepsis, a composite of drive-line and LVAD pocket infection, and      catheter-related bloodstream infection. RESULTS: Of 133 LVADs, 86 were CF. CF      patients had lower pre-operative risk, more recent device implantation, and      longer LVAD support time. Device type was highly correlated with reduced      infections; however, on multivariate analysis, implantation date appeared to      drive this association. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from all primary      outcomes were improved with more recent implantation (p < 0.05). On multivariate       analysis, implantation date was predictive of all primary outcomes except severe       sepsis, for which advanced age and worse Seattle Heart Failure Model score were      predictive. CONCLUSION: In this institutional review of post-LVAD infections, a      decrease in infectious complications in CF patients was likely related to      increased provider experience associated with a more recent date of implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
