The aim of this study was to report our experience of the      use of VADs in patients with prosthetic mitral valves. METHODS: A retrospective      analysis of 747 VAD patients from January 1995 to May 2010 was performed.      RESULTS: Thirteen patients with a prosthetic mitral valve (average age 56 +/- 10       years of age, nine mechanical valve, four biological valve) were identified.      Indications for VAD implantation were as a bridge to transplant in 11 patients      and destination therapy in two patients. At the time of VAD implant, no      intervention to the prosthetic mitral valve was performed. Eight patients      received a HeartMate I (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA), three      patients received a HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation), and two patients      received a Thoratec VAD (Thoratec Corporation). Among nine mechanical valve      patients, six patients were anticoagulated with warfarin, and one patient with      heparin, while two patients did not receive anticoagulation due to bleeding. Ten       patients were successfully transplanted at an average of 123 days post-VAD      implant, one died after 48 days from multiorgan failure, and two remained on VAD       support. No clinical thromboembolic events were observed. No intracardiac      thrombus was detected by echocardiogram or on the pathology of the explanted      hearts. Five patients had experienced a bleeding event (postoperative mediastinal      bleeds, gastrointestinal bleedings, retroperitoneal hematoma, and subconjuctival       bleeding). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mitral valve prostheses who require VAD       support, leaving the prosthesis intact does not increase the incidence of adverse      events.CI  - (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Goda, AyumiAU  - Goda AAD  - Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University,       New York, New York, USA.FAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HFAU - Koeckert, MichaelAU  - Koeckert MFAU - Pak, Sang-WooAU  - Pak SWFAU - Sutton, Evelyne MAU  - Sutton EMFAU - Cohen, SaraAU  - Cohen SFAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NFAU - Jorde, UlrichAU  - Jorde UFAU - Mancini, DonnaAU  - Mancini DFAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110411PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/complications/*surgeryMH  - Heart Valve Diseases/complications/*surgeryMH  - *Heart Valve ProsthesisMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*utilizationMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Mitral ValveMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/04/13 06:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2011/04/13 06:00PHST- 2011/04/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2011.01248.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2011 May;26(3):334-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2011.01248.x.
