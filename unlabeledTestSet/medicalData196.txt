Initially designed to be a bridge to      transplantation, MCS also has proven itself as a durable therapy for patients who      are not transplant candidates. As outcomes for patients with MCS have improved,      research interest in device development has flourished, with many new device      types under investigation. In addition to improvement of MCS devices,      investigational work continues to achieve appropriate patient selection and      complication management.FAU - Shreenivas, Satya SAU  - Shreenivas SSAD  - Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, University of Pennsylvania      School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.FAU - Rame, J EduardoAU  - Rame JEFAU - Jessup, MariellAU  - Jessup MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Heart Fail RepJT  - Current heart failure reportsJID - 101196487SB  - IMMH  - Equipment Design/instrumentation/trendsMH  - Evaluation Studies as TopicMH  - Heart Failure/complications/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart Transplantation/contraindications/instrumentationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/classificationMH  - HumansMH  - Outcome Assessment (Health Care)MH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Shock/etiology/physiopathology/*therapyPMC - PMC2970816OID - NLM: PMC2970816EDAT- 2010/10/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/28 06:00CRDT- 2010/10/08 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11897-010-0026-4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2010 Dec;7(4):159-66. doi: 10.1007/s11897-010-0026-4.
