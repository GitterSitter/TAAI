Ventricular assist devices are a      practical long-term surgical option for a select group of patients with end-stage      heart failure. METHOD: A case study is used to demonstrate the process of      selection and evaluation of patients with end-stage heart failure for ventricular      assist device therapy. Also, a detailed description of all aspects of care of      patients before, during, and after implantation of a ventricular assist device is      presented. CONCLUSION: A ventricular assist device is a superior therapeutic      option for patients with end-stage heart failure who have become intolerant to      medical therapy or in whom medical therapy has been unsuccessful. Advances in      device technology through the development of nonpulsatile continuous flow devices      are showing favorable long-term outcomes for patients with a ventricular assist      device by minimizing complications and enhancing quality of life.FAU - Kurien, SudhaAU  - Kurien SAD  - Center for Heart Transplant & Assist Devices, Advocate Christ Medical Center,      Oaklawn, IL 60453, USA. sudha.kurien@advocatehealth.comFAU - Gallagher, ColleenAU  - Gallagher CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Prog TransplantJT  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)JID - 100909380SB  - NMH  - AgedMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Postoperative CareEDAT- 2010/07/21 06:00MHDA- 2010/08/19 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/21 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Prog Transplant. 2010 Jun;20(2):134-41.
