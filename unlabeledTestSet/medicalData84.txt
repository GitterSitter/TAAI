We hypothesized that evaluation of myocyte      contractility and biochemistry at the sarcomere level before and after LVAD may      explain organ-level changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Paired LV tissue samples were      frozen from 8 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy at LVAD implantation      (before LVAD) and before cardiac transplantation (after LVAD). These were      compared with 8 nonfailing hearts. Isolated skinned myocytes were purified and      attached to a force transducer, and dimensions, maximum calcium-saturated force,       calcium sensitivity, and myofilament cooperativity were assessed. Relative      isoform abundance and phosphorylation levels of sarcomeric contractile proteins      were measured. With LVAD support, the unloaded EF improved (10.0+/-1.0% to      25.6+/-11.0%, P=0.007), LV size decreased (LV internal dimension at end diastole,      7.6+/-1.2 to 4.9+/-1.4 cm; P<0.001), and myocyte dimensions decreased      (cross-sectional area, 1247+/-346 to 638+/-254 mum(2); P=0.001). Maximum      calcium-saturated force improved after LVAD (3.6+/-0.9 to 7.3+/-1.8 mN/mm(2),      P<0.001) implantation but was still lower than in nonfailing hearts (7.3+/-1.8      versus 17.6+/-1.8 mN/mm(2), P<0.001). An increase in troponin I (TnI)      phosphorylation after LVAD implantation was noted, but protein kinase C      phosphorylation of TnI decreased. Biochemical changes of other sarcomeric      proteins were not observed after LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant      improvement in LV and myocyte size with LVAD, but there is only partial recovery       of EF and myocyte contractility. LVAD support was associated only with      biochemical changes in TnI, suggesting that alternate mechanisms might contribute      to contractile changes after LVAD and that additional interventions may be needed      to alter biochemical remodeling of the sarcomere to further enhance myofilament      and organ-level recovery.FAU - Ambardekar, Amrut VAU  - Ambardekar AVAD  - Division of Cardiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.
