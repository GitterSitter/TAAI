MCS      devices have successfully improved clinical outcomes, which are comparable with      heart transplantation and result in better 1-year survival than optimal medical      management therapies. The quality of perfusion provided during MCS therapy may      play an important role in patient outcomes. Despite demonstrated physiologic      benefits of pulsatile perfusion, continued use or development of pulsatile MCS      devices has been widely abandoned in favor of continuous flow pumps owing to the       large size and adverse risks events in the former class, which pose issues of      thrombogenic surfaces, percutaneous lead infection, and durability.      Next-generation MCS device development should ideally implement designs that      offer the benefits of rotary pump technology while providing the physiologic      benefits of pulsatile end-organ perfusion.FAU - Guan, YulongAU  - Guan YAD  - Department of Pediatrics, Penn State Milton S.
