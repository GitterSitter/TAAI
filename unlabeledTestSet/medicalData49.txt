Ventricular assist devices       (VADs) are employed to support these cases while awaiting cardiac recovery or      transplantation, or in some cases as destination therapy. While left ventricular       assist device (LVAD) therapy alone is effective in many instances, up to 50% of      LVAD recipients demonstrate clinically significant postoperative right      ventricular failure and potentially need a biventricular assist device (BiVAD).      In these cases, the BiVAD can effectively support both sides of the failing      heart. This article presents a technical review of BiVADs, both clinically      applied and under development. The BiVADs which have been used clinically are      predominantly first generation, pulsatile, and paracorporeal systems that are      bulky and prone to device failure, thrombus formation, and infection. While they       have saved many lives, they generally necessitate a large external pneumatic      driver which inhibits normal movement and quality of life for many patients. In      an attempt to alleviate these issues, several smaller, implantable second and      third generation devices that use either immersed mechanical blood bearings or      hydrodynamic/magnetic levitation systems to support a rotating impeller are under      development or in the early stages of clinical use. Although these rotary devices      may offer a longer term, completely implantable option for patients with      biventricular failure, their control strategies need to be refined to compete      with the inherent volume balancing ability of the first generation devices. The      BiVAD systems potentially offer an improved quality of life to patients with      total heart failure, and thus a viable alternative to heart transplantation is      anticipated with continued development.FAU - Gregory, Shaun DAU  - Gregory SDAD  - School of Engineering Systems and Medical Device Domain, Institute of Health and       Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001,      Australia. shaun.gregory@qut.edu.auFAU - Timms, DanielAU  - Timms DFAU - Gaddum, NicholasAU  - Gaddum NFAU - Mason, David GAU  - Mason DGFAU - Fraser, John FAU  - Fraser JFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20110708PL  - United StatesTA  - Ann Biomed EngJT  - Annals of biomedical engineeringJID - 0361512SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleEDAT- 2011/07/09 06:00MHDA- 2011/12/14 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/09 06:00PHST- 2011/05/16 [received]PHST- 2011/06/28 [accepted]PHST- 2011/07/08 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10439-011-0348-8 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Biomed Eng. 2011 Sep;39(9):2313-28. doi: 10.1007/s10439-011-0348-8.
