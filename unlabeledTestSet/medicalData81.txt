BACKGROUND: After a multicenter pivotal clinical      trial conducted from 2005 to 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved      the HM II LVAD for bridge to transplantation (BTT). A post-approval study was      required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine whether results      with the device in a commercial setting are comparable to other available devices      for the same indication. METHODS: The study was a prospective evaluation of the      first 169 consecutive HM II patients enrolled in the national INTERMACS      (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) who were      listed for transplant or likely to be listed. Patients were enrolled from April      through August 2008 at 77 U.S. centers and followed for at least 1 year after      implant. A comparison group (COMP) included all patients (n = 169 at 27 centers)       enrolled in the INTERMACS registry with other types of LVADs (79% HeartMate XVE,       21% Implantable Ventricular Assist Device [Thoratec Corporation]) for the same      BTT indication in the same time period. Survival rates, adverse events, and      quality of life with the EuroQol EQ-5D visual analog scale were obtained in the      INTERMACS registry. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar, but      creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were lower in the HM II versus COMP groups,      and there were fewer patients in the highest-risk INTERMACS patient profile      Number 1 (24% for HM II vs. 39% for COMP). Adverse event rates were similar or      lower for HM II versus COMP for all events. Bleeding was the most frequent      adverse event for both groups (1.44 vs. 1.79 events/patient-year). Operative      30-day mortality for HM II was 4% versus 11% for COMP. The percentage of patients      reaching transplant, cardiac recovery, or ongoing LVAD support by 6 months was      91% for HM II and 80% for COMP, and the Kaplan-Meier survival for patients      remaining on support at 1 year was 85% for HM II versus 70% for COMP. Quality of       life was significantly improved at 3 months of support and sustained through 12      months in both groups compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results in a      post-market approval, actual patient care setting BTT population support the      original findings from the pivotal clinical trial regarding the efficacy and risk      profile of the HM II LVAD. These data suggest that dissemination of this      technology after approval has been associated with continued excellent results.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
