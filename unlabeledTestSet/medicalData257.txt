SUMMARY: The SynCardia      CardioWest Temporary TAH System is the only TAH approved by the Food and Drug      Administration (FDA), Health Canada and Consultants Europe (CE) for BTT.      CardioWest implantation involves cardiectomy thus avoiding pulmonary      hypertension, right heart failure, inotropic or anti-arrhythmic agents,      myocardial and valve related problems. CardioWest has a fixed beat rate and      cardiac output is dependent upon venous return and preload. Both TAH and LVADs      are adaptive with exercise, increasing cardiac output during activities, allowing      for conditioning to occur peripherally. Left ventricular assist devices have      portable drivers permitting discharge home, while the CardioWest's large driver      console necessitates inpatient therapy. Exercise progression, positioning, and      monitoring of exercise intolerance are similar with LVAD and TAH. Ventricular      fill volumes in TAH dictate cardiac output and require close attention.      Cardiectomy in TAH prevents electrocardiography, telemetry, and native pulse rate      monitoring. CONCLUSION: While mechanical differences exist between TAH and LVAD,       physical therapists can provide evidence-based treatment for patients with TAH      using previously established guidelines for patients with heart failure and      mechanical circulatory support.FAU - Nicholson, ClareAU  - Nicholson CAD  - Cleveland Clinic, Division of Physical Therapy, Walsh University.FAU - Paz, Jaime CAU  - Paz JCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Cardiopulm Phys Ther JJT  - Cardiopulmonary physical therapy journalJID - 101155626PMC - PMC2879422OID - NLM: PMC2879422OTO - NOTNLMOT  - artificial heartOT  - heart failureOT  - physical therapyEDAT- 2010/06/04 06:00MHDA- 2010/06/04 06:01CRDT- 2010/06/04 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Cardiopulm Phys Ther J. 2010 Jun;21(2):13-21.
