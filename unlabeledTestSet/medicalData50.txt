METHODS: A      flexible outflow cannula placed from the right internal jugular vein to the      pulmonary artery and an inflow cannula placed from the femoral vein to the right       atrium constituted the perc CM-RVAD. When needed, biventricular support was      provided with left VAD (LVAD), either with a percutaneous LVAD placed through      axillary or femoral artery access or with a fully implantable LVAD. RESULTS:      Between January 2009 and June 2010, all of the attempted patients successfully      received perc CM-RVAD (n = 8). Mean blood pressure, heart rate, and central      venous pressure showed a trend toward improvement after the perc CM-RVAD, with      less inotrope/vasopressor requirement. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO(2))      increased significantly from 64 +/- 20 Torr to 78 +/- 6 Torr (P < 0.01). The      percutaneous VADs were explanted after myocardial recovery in seven patients;      however, in three of these, perc CM-RVAD was used as a temporary bridge to other       devices. One patient was bridged to a surgical biventricular assist device      (BiVAD) and transferred back to the referring hospital on support. One death      occurred due to multiple-organ failure 8 days after explantation of the RVAD with      recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Perc CM-RVAD was feasible and provided hemodynamic      improvement.FAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York,      NY 10032, USA.FAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YFAU - Kodali, Susheel KAU  - Kodali SKFAU - Vincent, Julie AAU  - Vincent JAFAU - Addonizio, Linda JAU  - Addonizio LJFAU - Jorde, Ulrich PAU  - Jorde UPFAU - Williams, Mathew RAU  - Williams MRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20111212PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - ChildMH  - Feasibility StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/etiology/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/methodsMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/*methodsMH  - Retrospective StudiesEDAT- 2011/07/09 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/02 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/09 06:00PHST- 2011/12/12 [aheadofprint]AID - S1010-7940(11)00577-X [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.05.041 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Feb;41(2):423-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.05.041.
