DATA SOURCES: The      MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from 1960 to July      2010 for articles published in English using the search terms mechanical      circulatory support, ventricular assist system, ventricular assist device, left      ventricular assist device, right ventricular assist device, biventricular assist       device, total artificial heart, pulsatile, positive displacement, axial,      centrifugal, hemostasis, bleeding, hemodynamic, blood pressure, thrombosis,      antithrombotic therapy, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, right ventricular failure,      ventricular arrhythmia, anemia, arteriovenous malformation, stroke, infection,      and clinical pharmacist. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All relevant      original studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, and reviews were      assessed for inclusion. References from pertinent articles were examined for      content not found during the initial search. DATA SYNTHESIS: MCS has advanced      significantly since the first left ventricular assist device was implanted in      1966. Further advancements in MCS technology that occurred in the latter decade      are changing the overall management of endstage heart failure care and cardiac      transplantation. These pumps allow for improved bridge-to-transplant rates,      enhanced survival, and quality of life. Pharmacotherapy associated with MCS      devices may optimize the performance of the pumps and improve patient outcomes,      as well as minimize morbidity related to their adverse effects. This review      highlights the knowledge needed to provide appropriate clinical pharmacy services      for patients supported by MCS devices. CONCLUSIONS: The HeartMate II clinical      investigators called for the involvement of pharmacists in MCS patient assessment      and optimization. Pharmacotherapeutic management of patients supported with MCS      devices requires individualized care, with pharmacists as part of the team, based      on the characteristics of each pump and recipient.FAU - Ensor, Christopher RAU  - Ensor CRAD  - School of Pharmacy, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA. censor1@jhmi.eduFAU - Paciullo, Christopher AAU  - Paciullo CAFAU - Cahoon, William D JrAU  - Cahoon WD JrFAU - Nolan, Paul E JrAU  - Nolan PE JrLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20110104PL  - United StatesTA  - Ann PharmacotherJT  - The Annals of pharmacotherapyJID - 9203131SB  - IMMH  - Assisted Circulation/adverse effects/*methods/trendsMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Heart Failure/*drug therapy/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - Individualized MedicineMH  - Pharmaceutical Services/*trendsMH  - PharmacistsMH  - Professional RoleEDAT- 2011/01/06 06:00MHDA- 2011/05/20 06:00CRDT- 2011/01/06 06:00PHST- 2011/01/04 [aheadofprint]AID - aph.1P459 [pii]AID - 10.1345/aph.1P459 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Pharmacother. 2011 Jan;45(1):60-77. doi: 10.1345/aph.1P459.
