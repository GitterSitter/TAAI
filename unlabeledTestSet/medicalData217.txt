One of      the main complications inherent following institution of LVAD therapy is right      ventricular (RV) failure, manifested by the need for inotropic and/or nitric      oxide support >14 days after LVAD implant and/or the need for right-sided      mechanical circulatory support. RV failure is a major contributor of significant       morbidity and mortality after LVAD placement. The complex pathophysiology of RV      failure, which could potentially be related to RV myocardial dysfunction,      interventricular dependence, and RV afterload, has led to inconsistencies in      predicting risk factors for RV dysfunction. Several strategies have evolved over       the years of experience with mechanical circulatory support that have aimed to      avoid as well as reduce the incidence of RV failure. It is imperative that      patients who definitely need biventricular support are identified. Despite the      numerous risk factors identified in many studies as well as the development of      risk factor profile scores, this continues to be a challenging problem. However,       the lower incidence of RV failure following LVAD in the current era is      encouraging, suggesting a favorable relationship between RV unloading and      function, and continuous-flow physiology.FAU - John, RanjitAU  - John RAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN      55455, USA. johnx008@umn.eduFAU - Lee, SangjinAU  - Lee SFAU - Eckman, PeterAU  - Eckman PFAU - Liao, KennethAU  - Liao KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20100901PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Transl ResJT  - Journal of cardiovascular translational researchJID - 101468585SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/*etiology/physiopathology/therapyMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - *Ventricular Function, RightEDAT- 2010/09/03 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/22 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/03 06:00PHST- 2010/05/14 [received]PHST- 2010/08/11 [accepted]PHST- 2010/09/01 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12265-010-9216-4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2010 Dec;3(6):604-11. doi: 10.1007/s12265-010-9216-4.
