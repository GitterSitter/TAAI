We report on      our experience in the pediatric population. A retrospective review of 17      consecutive children offered mechanical support with Berlin Heart as a bridge to       heart transplant from February 2002 to April 2010 was conducted. The median      patient age was 3.9 years (75 days to 13.3 years). The median patient weight was       14.1 kg (2.9-43kg). Before VAD implantation, all children were managed by      multiple intravenous inotropes and mechanical ventilation (14) or extracorporeal       membrane oxygenation (3). All patients had right ventricular dysfunction. Nine      patients required biventricular mechanical support (BVAD), but in all other cases      a single left ventricular assist device proved sufficient (47%). The median      duration of VAD support was 47 days (1-168 days). The median pre-VAD pulmonary      vascular resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5 to 14.4WU/m(2) ). Eleven      patients (65%) were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median       duration of mechanical support of 68 days (6-168 days). Six deaths occurred      (35%), three for neurological complications, one for sepsis, and two others for      device malfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our patients has      increased from 43% to 80%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from 86% to 30%.      In two patients with Rpi >10WU/m(2) , unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilatator      therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of BVAD support,      respectively. Seven patients (41%) required at least one pump change. Of 11      patients undergoing heart transplant, four developed an extremely elevated (>60%)      panel reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed by      Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of rejection in the      first month after heart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The survival rate      after heart transplantation was 100% with a median follow-up of 25.4 months (6      days to 7.7 years). Mechanical support in children with end-stage heart failure      is an effective strategy as a bridge to heart transplantation with a reasonable      morbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer an additional means to reverse      extremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.CI  - (c) 2010, Copyright the Authors.
