We used United Network for Organ Sharing data to examine panel      reactive antibody titers in patients bridged to transplant with left ventricular       assist devices. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of the United Network      for Organ Sharing dataset for all patients bridged to orthotopic heart      transplantation with a HeartMate II or HeartMate XVE (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton,       Calif) from January 2004 to December 2009. Patients were primarily stratified by       device type and secondarily grouped for comparisons by high (>25%) versus low      (0%) panel reactive antibody activity (class I and II). Outcomes included      survival (30-day and 1-year), treated rejection in the year after orthotopic      heart transplantation, and primary graft dysfunction. Cox proportional hazards      regression examined 30-day and 1-year survival. RESULTS: A total of 871 patients       (56.1%) received the HeartMate II device, and 673 patients (43.9%) received the      HeartMate XVE device. Patients with high panel reactive antibody had longer      duration on the wait list (205 days [interquartile range, 81-344] vs 124 days      [interquartile range, 51-270], P = .01). High panel reactive antibody class II      was more common in patients with the HeartMate XVE device (51/547 [9.3%] vs      42/777 [5.4%], P < .001). When the entire cohort was examined together, there was      no 30-day or 1-year survival difference based on panel reactive antibody      activity. Device type did not affect post-orthotopic heart transplantation      survival, and panel reactive antibody activity was not associated with worse      mortality in Cox regression. Although panel reactive antibody activity did not      affect rejection in the year after orthotopic heart transplantation for either      device type, high panel reactive antibody class II was associated with higher      rates of primary graft dysfunction for both devices (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: This       is the largest modern study to examine the impact of detailed panel reactive      antibody information in patients bridged to transplant. High panel reactive      antibody levels do not affect drug-treated rejection episodes in the first year      post-orthotopic heart transplantation; however, there is an associated higher      rate of primary graft dysfunction, regardless of device type. Highly sensitized      patients bridged to transplant experience excellent survival outcomes after      orthotopic heart transplantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
