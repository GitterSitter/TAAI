BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a worldwide epidemic. The effectiveness of      heart transplantation and medical therapy is limited, resulting in the emergence       of mechanical circulatory support as a primary treatment for end-stage heart      disease. Left ventricular assist devices that use rotary pumps are small and      durable, which might reduce morbidity and mortality during support. METHODS:      Fifty heart transplant candidates with New York Heart Association functional      class IV symptoms were supported at 5 international centers by the HeartWare      System for 180 days, until heart transplant, myocardial recovery and device      explant, or death. Patients who continue to be supported have been followed for a      minimum of 2 years. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 20 (40%) received transplants, 4      (8%) had the pump explanted after myocardial recovery, and 17 (34%) continue      support at 2 years. Nine (18%) patients died during support from sepsis (n = 3),       multiple organ failure (n = 3), or hemorrhagic stroke (n = 3). The actual      survival at 6, 12, and 24 months was 90%, 84%, and 79%, respectively. In the      survivors, measures of quality of life showed a significant improvement over      baseline values. Significant improvements were found for recognition memory at 3       months after implant (p = 0.006). The most frequent adverse events were infection      and bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with end-stage heart failure can be safely      and effectively supported by the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System with      improved quality of life and neurocognitive function.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
