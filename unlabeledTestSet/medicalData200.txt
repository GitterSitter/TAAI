Nevertheless,       we have successfully implanted LVADs in 5 patients with native AV insufficiency      or an AV prosthesis by closing the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT).      METHODS: The method of LVOT closure was tailored to the patients' differing      circumstances. Patient 1 had a regurgitant tri-leaflet native AV. Patient 2 had      undergone previous aortic root reconstruction with a porcine bioprosthesis.      Patient 3 had a congenitally bicuspid AV with significant insufficiency. Patient       4 had a native tri-leaflet valve that developed thrombus and insufficiency after       previous LVAD placement. Patient 5 required removal of a recently placed      mechanical AV. Accordingly, the LVOT was closed with a bovine pericardial patch      in Patients 1, 4 and 5, and the lines of coaptation of the AV leaflets were      closed primarily in Patients 2 and 3. RESULTS: Four months post-operatively, 1      patient underwent heart transplantation; on removal of the heart, LVOT patch      integrity was confirmed visually. After a follow-up period of 6 months to 2      years, the remaining 4 patients are in New York Heart Association Functional      Class I while awaiting cardiac transplantation. Transesophageal echocardiography       has confirmed persistent LVOT closure. CONCLUSION: In all 5 cases, LVOT closure      circumvented the challenges associated with LVAD therapy in the presence of      native AV insufficiency or an AV prosthesis.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
