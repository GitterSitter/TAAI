Whereas      myocardial gene expression profile changes have been well established after LVAD       support, the consequences on the protein level largely remain unclear. METHODS:      Pre-LVAD and post-LVAD myocardial tissue specimens from dilated cardiomyopathy      (DCM) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients were analyzed by fluorescent      2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, and differentially expressed      proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In the DCM group, 16      proteins were detected that showed statistically significant downregulation from       pre-LVAD to post-LVAD tissue. In IHD patients, 50 alterations were found,      including upregulated (n = 12) and downregulated (n = 38) proteins. The      identified proteins in both groups partially overlapped and included proteins      from cytoskeleton and mitochondrial energy metabolism. The latter changes were      paralleled by severe abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology, as shown by      electron microscopy. Post-LVAD proteomes of both DCM and IHD patients largely      mimicked the protein profiles of non-failing hearts. Downregulation of the serine      protease inhibitor alpha-1-antichymotrypsin in both DCM and IHD patients after      LVAD support was confirmed by immunosorbent assay. CONCLUSIONS: LVAD-induced      cardiac remodeling in DCM and IHD patients is associated with downregulation of      alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and specific atrophic changes in protein expression      profiles predominantly involved in cytoskeleton integrity and mitochondrial      energy metabolism.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
