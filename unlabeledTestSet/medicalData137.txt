This process may be reversible in some      pacemaker-dependent patients upgraded to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).      We examined the clinical characteristics of pacemaker-dependent patients who      exhibit hyperresponse (i.e., normalization of LV function) with CRT upgrade.      METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 51 chronically RV-paced patients with no      coronary artery disease, LV ejection fraction (EF) </= 35%, and severe HF      symptoms who were upgraded to CRT-defibrillators (CRT-D). Echocardiograms were      performed before and >/=6 months after CRT. Patients with follow-up LVEF >/= 50%       were deemed hyperresponders. Clinical outcomes of death, cardiac transplant,      mechanical circulatory support, and HF hospitalizations were assessed. Fifteen      patients were CRT hyperresponders; all demonstrated >/=15% relative LV      end-systolic volume decrease. Hyperresponders had smaller baseline LV dimensions       and shorter known cardiomyopathy duration than nonhyperresponders (P < 0.01). The      best predictors of hyperresponse using receiver operating characteristic analysis      were LV end-systolic dimension <48 mm (area under the curve [AUC] 0.92, P <      0.001), LV end-diastolic dimension <58 mm (AUC 0.86, P < 0.001), and      cardiomyopathy duration <24 months (AUC 0.82, P < 0.001). No hyperresponders      died, received a cardiac transplant, or required mechanical circulatory support      during 42 +/- 22 months follow-up, whereas 5 nonhyperresponders died, 2 underwent      transplant, and 1 required an assist device (log rank P = 0.049). CONCLUSION:      Among chronically RV paced patients who are upgraded to CRT-D, smaller baseline      LV dimensions and shorter known cardiomyopathy duration predict hyperresponse.      Hyperresponders have excellent long-term survival.CI  - (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Adelstein, EvanAU  - Adelstein EAD  - Cardiovascular Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,      Pennsylvania, USA. adelsteinec@upmc.eduFAU - Schwartzman, DavidAU  - Schwartzman DFAU - Gorcsan, John 3rdAU  - Gorcsan J 3rdFAU - Saba, SamirAU  - Saba SLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110218PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc ElectrophysiolJT  - Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiologyJID - 9010756SB  - IMCIN - J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol. 2011 Aug;22(8):912-4.
