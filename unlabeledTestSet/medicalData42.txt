The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) is a      20-variable model that combines clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data.      Although both models have excellent accuracy, only the HFSS was derived and      validated in patients referred for transplantation, and the HFSS and SHFM have      not been directly compared. METHODS: We tested the accuracy of the SHFM and      compared the HFSS and SHFM in 715 patients referred for heart transplantation.      RESULTS: Over a follow-up of 962 +/- 912 days, 354 patients died or received an      urgent heart transplantation or a ventricular assist device. One-year event-free       survival was 89%, 72% and 60%, respectively, for the low-, medium- and high-risk       HFSS strata, and 93%, 76%, and 58%, respectively, for the low-, medium- and      high-risk SHFM strata. The HFSS and SHFM were modestly correlated (R = -0.48, p <      0.001). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the      curves (AUCs) for the HFSS and SHFM were comparable (1 year: 0.72 vs 0.73;      2-year: 0.70 vs 0.74, respectively) and incremental to New York Heart Association      class. The 1- and 2-year combined HFSS+SHFM AUCs were 0.77 and 0.76,      respectively, significantly better than the HFSS or SHFM alone. CONCLUSIONS: The       HFSS and SHFM provide accurate and comparable risk stratification in CHF patients      referred for transplantation. Combining the HFSS and SHFM improves predictive      ability.CI  - 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. Published by      Elsevier Inc.
