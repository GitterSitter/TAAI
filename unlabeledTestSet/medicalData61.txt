However, there are no      previous case reports in the literature describing mycotic SMA aneurysm after      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. We describe the case of a      31-year-old male diagnosed with congestive heart failure due to nonischemic      dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent LVAD implantation for bridge to heart      transplantation. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was      maintained on anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. There were no signs of      pump failure or device-related infections. However, 7 months post-LVAD support,      the patient complained of abdominal symptoms (nausea and vomiting) with low-grade      fever. Computed tomography identified an aneurysmal change of the SMA (2.2 x 1.8       cm). There was no evidence of thrombus or septic vegetation inside the heart.      Aneurysm and segmental small bowel resection was performed. Pathological study      revealed typical findings of mycotic aneurysm with significant infiltration of      inflammatory cells. The patient, however, expired due to concurrent brain      hemorrhage. Postmortem study indicated no sign of pump thrombus or septic emboli       inside the pump or inflow/outflow conduit. This case report presents a rare      mycotic aneurysm that developed in the SMA after chronic LVAD support.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.
