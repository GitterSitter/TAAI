As the population      of patients with severe heart failure has grown, the utilization of MCSDs has      increased considerably. That trend is expected to continue, especially in light      of dramatic advances in MCSD technology. This review outlines the current status       and future directions of mechanical circulatory support therapy in the setting of      a constantly evolving field of supportive devices and adjuvant therapies.FAU - Fitzpatrick Iii, J RaymondAU  - Fitzpatrick Iii JRAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of      Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.FAU - Woo, Y JosephAU  - Woo YJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20101207PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2010/12/15 06:00MHDA- 2011/02/26 06:00CRDT- 2010/12/15 06:00PHST- 2010/12/07 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-10-1091 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2011;75(1):38-46.
