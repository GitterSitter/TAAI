In order to meet the special requirements for      neonates' and infants' MCS, pediatric circulatory support devices must be compact      with low priming volume, easily controllable with low flow, less traumatic for      blood cells and tissues, and biocompatible with minimum anticoagulation. We have       designed and developed a miniature rotary centrifugal blood pump, "TinyPump,"      with a priming volume of 5 mL, which has already demonstrated its controllable      performance for low flow and durability in vitro. To evaluate the feasibility of       the TinyPump as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) suitable for neonates and      infants, we have examined the biocompatibility and hemodynamic performance of the      TinyPump in a pediatric animal model using Shiba goats. The TinyPump is a      miniaturized centrifugal pump weighing 150 g comprising a disposable pump head      with a 30-mm diameter impeller having six straight-vanes and a reusable motor      driver. The impeller in the pump head is supported by a hydrodynamic bearing at      its center and is driven by radial magnetic force coupled to the motor driver.      TinyPump implantations were performed in 22 Shiba goats (17 female and 5 male),      with body weights ranging from 8.4 to 27.2 kg. Under gas anesthesia, via left      lateral thoracotomy, a 22 Fr inflow cannula was inserted through the left      ventricular apex, while a 6-mm outflow graft was anastomosed to the descending      aorta, which were then connected to a TinyPump mounted on the animal's back.      Postoperative hemodynamic monitoring included heart rate, arterial and central      venous pressure, pump flow, and rotation speed. Target pump flow in all animals      was maintained at 0.9 +/- 0.1 L/min, which is approximately half the normal      pulmonary artery flow measured in control animals. Blood samples were collected      to evaluate peripheral organ functions, hemolysis, and thrombosis. Goats were      divided into three groups-acute phase (6 h; n = 4), subchronic phase (6 h 2      postoperative days [POD]; n = 11), and chronic phase (3 POD-16 POD; n = 8)-based       on their survival duration. In the early experiments, hemolysis and thrombi      formation at the impeller bearing resulted in termination of the study.      Subsequent modifications of the bearing design, pump housing design, and magnetic      coupling force helped to minimize the hemolysis and thrombi formation, prolonging      the survival duration of the Shiba goats to 2 weeks with minimum adverse effects       on the blood components and organ functions. With further experiments and      improvements in pump durability and hemocompatibility, the TinyPump can serve as       a suitable circulatory support device for neonates and infants bridging to heart       transplantation as well as to heart recovery.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.
