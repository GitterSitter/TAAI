We have been studying      the safety and efficacy of the partial support Synergy(R) Pocket Micro-pump as      bridge-to-transplant in a less-sick group of patients as a prelude to a study of       its use for destination therapy. METHODS: The CircuLite(R) Synergy device is      implanted via a small right-sided thoracotomy with an inflow cannula in the left       atrium and an outflow graft connected to the right subclavian artery without the       use of extracorporeal circulation. The micro-pump is the size of an AA battery,      sits in the 'pacemaker' pocket subcutaneously in the right clavicular groove and       pumps up to 3.0 l min(-)(1) from the left atrium to the right subclavian artery.       RESULTS: The device has been implanted in 27 patients awaiting cardiac transplant      (22 males), age 54.8 +/- 10.0 years with ejection fraction (EF) 21 +/- 6%, mean      arterial pressure 73.5 +/- 8.8 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)      27.5 +/- 7.8 mm Hg and cardiac index (CI) 2.0 +/- 0.4 l min(-)(1) m(-)(2).      Duration of support has ranged from 6 to 281 days. Right-heart catheterization      showed significant hemodynamic improvement in the short- and intermediate term      after implant, with increases in CI from 2.0 +/- 0.4 to 2.8 +/- 0.6 l min(-)(1)      m(-)(2) (p < 0.001) and reductions in PCWP from 28 +/- 6 to 18 +/- 7 mm Hg (p =      0.002) at an average of 9.5 +/- 5.5 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The Synergy device      provides partial hemodynamic support and its use is associated with significantly      improved hemodynamics, thus appearing to interrupt and partially reverse the      progressive hemodynamic deterioration typical of end-stage heart failure. Ongoing      efforts are aimed at demonstrating additional clinical benefits and continuing to      further improve the risk/benefit ratio.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
