Unfortunately, due to the limited pool of organs, many of these      children do not survive to transplant. Mechanical circulatory support of the      failing heart in pediatrics is a new and rapidly developing field world-wide. It       is utilized in children with acute congestive heart failure associated with      congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis, both as a bridge to      transplantation and as a bridge to myocardial recovery. The current arsenal of      mechanical assist devices available for children is limited to ECMO, intra-aortic      balloon counterpulsation, centrifugal pump ventricular assist devices, the      DeBakey ventricular assist device Child; the Thoratec ventricular assist device;       and the Berlin Heart. In the spring of 2004, five contracts were awarded by the      National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to support preclinical development for a      range of pediatric ventricular assist devices and similar circulatory support      systems. The support of early development efforts provided by this program is      expected to yield several devices that will be ready for clinical trials within      the next few years. Our work reviews the current international experience with      mechanical circulatory support in children and summarizes our own experience      since 2005 with the Berlin Heart, comparing the indications for use, length of      support, and outcome between these modalities.FAU - Gazit, Avihu ZAU  - Gazit AZAD  - Division of Pediatric Critical Care, Saint Louis Children's Hospital, Washington       University School of Medicine, St Louis, Mo., USA.FAU - Gandhi, Sanjiv KAU  - Gandhi SKFAU - C Canter, CharlesAU  - C Canter CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United Arab EmiratesTA  - Curr Cardiol RevJT  - Current cardiology reviewsJID - 101261935PMC - PMC2845794OID - NLM: PMC2845794OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Ventricular assist deviceOT  - heart failureOT  - heart transplantation.EDAT- 2011/02/03 06:00MHDA- 2011/02/03 06:01CRDT- 2011/02/03 06:00PHST- 2009/01/20 [received]PHST- 2009/09/24 [revised]PHST- 2009/10/10 [accepted]AID - 10.2174/157340310790231617 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Cardiol Rev. 2010 Feb;6(1):46-53. doi: 10.2174/157340310790231617.
