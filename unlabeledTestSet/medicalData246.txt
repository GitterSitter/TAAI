However, their survival is limited if multiorgan      failure (MOF) proves to be irreversible. Although ventricular assist devices      (VADs) have been shown to reverse end-organ failure in some patients, the      pathophysiological mechanisms of end-organ failure and its regression are not      fully understood, and clinical markers and thresholds for the "point of no      return" are lacking. We investigated predictors of 30-day survival in patients      supported with a biventricular assist device (BVAD). We studied 157 patients      implanted with a Berlin Heart EXCOR BVAD between 1987 and 2006. Children younger       than 10 years and cases with postcardiotomy syndrome and transplant failure were       excluded from the analysis as well as patients with technical or bleeding      problems requiring rethoracotomy. In total, 69 clinical, hemodynamic,      echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Most of the patients      suffered from ischemic cardiomyopathy or acute myocardial infarction. In      addition, the preoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and the      sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated. The patients      were divided into two groups regarding procedural success: group I-survival >30      days or heart transplantation or weaning from device (n = 105) and group II-death      on system <30 days after surgery (n = 52). The 30-day procedural success rate was      67%. The patients in group I had higher systolic blood pressure (96.7 vs. 90.1 mm      Hg, p = 0.027), lower serum creatinine (1.96 vs. 2.4 mg/dl, p = 0.001), and      higher arterial pH (7.43 vs. 7.37, p = 0.02). The multivariate analysis      recognized age, body temperature, systolic blood pressure, MODS score, and higher      arterial pH as significant predictors for 30-day mortality. Standard markers for       severity of cardiogenic shock and MOF do not predict survival on BVAD. As      expected, older patients are at higher risk for death on BVAD. Acidosis and high       MODS score predict unfavorable outcome. However, the prediction of clinical      outcome in patients in severe cardiogenic shock supported by BVAD is possible in       extreme situations only.FAU - Potapov, Evgenij VAU  - Potapov EVAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin,       Berlin, Germany. potapov@dhzb.deFAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Kukucka, MarianAU  - Kukucka MFAU - Ba Fadhl, Faiz HAU  - Ba Fadhl FHFAU - Qedra, NaserAU  - Qedra NFAU - Weng, YuguoAU  - Weng YFAU - Pasic, MiralemAU  - Pasic MFAU - Lehmkuhl, Hans BAU  - Lehmkuhl HBFAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)SB  - IMMH  - AcidosisMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - AgedMH  - Biological Markers/*analysisMH  - Blood PressureMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Hydrogen-Ion ConcentrationMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Multiple Organ Failure/*mortality/*physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/*mortality/*physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/06/19 06:00MHDA- 2010/09/30 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/19 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181dbefd0 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2010 Jul-Aug;56(4):273-8. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181dbefd0.
