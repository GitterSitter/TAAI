Limited      availability of organs for transplantation, coupled with wider selection criteria      for destination therapy, has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of       patients with permanently assisted circulation. Given the high rate of      complications related to circulatory assist devices, it is expected that these      patients will be undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures more commonly.      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a laparoscopic splenectomy in a patient      supported with a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device. Using this case as       a model, we discuss hemodynamic changes associated with pneumoperitoneum and      anesthesia induction. Additionally, an extensive literature search was performed       to asses the frequency of laparoscopic procedures performed on patients with      circulatory support. RESULTS: Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed without      significant hemodynamic changes. To our knowledge, this is the first laparoscopic      splenectomy performed in a patient with this mode of circulatory support.      CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic procedures can safely be performed in patients with      compensated heart failure, who are supported with ventricular assist devices.FAU - Samoukovic, GordanAU  - Samoukovic GAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, McGill University Health Center, Montreal,      Quebec, Canada.FAU - Vassiliou, MelinaAU  - Vassiliou MFAU - Giannetti, NadiaAU  - Giannetti NFAU - Al-Sabah, SalmanAU  - Al-Sabah SFAU - Lash, VynkaAU  - Lash VFAU - Cecere, RenzoAU  - Cecere RLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech AJT  - Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.
