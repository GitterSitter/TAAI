The outcome of additional      procedures to the aortic valve at the time of VAD placement is unclear. METHODS:       A retrospective analysis of 712 VAD patients from 1995 to 2009 was performed.      RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were identified who underwent aortic valve      procedures in addition to VAD placement. Indication for VAD placement was bridge       to transplant in 23 patients, destination therapy in 4, and postcardiotomy shock       in 1. Aortic valve procedures were performed for preexisting mechanical aortic      prosthesis in 8 (7 closure and 1 aortic valve replacement with biological      prosthesis), and for moderate or severe aortic insufficiency in 20 patients (10      repair, 9 closure, and 1 aortic valve replacement with biological prosthesis). At      the last follow-up, 16 patients had undergone heart transplant, 6 remained on VAD      support, and 5 had died. While on VAD support, no adverse events related to the      aortic valve procedures occurred. The 30-day operative mortality was 0.4%. No      clinical thromboembolic events were observed. In 2 patients, there was evidence      of thrombus formation in the explanted heart. Four patients had bleeding      complications. Of the 9 patients who received aortic valve repair, 2 had      recurrent aortic insufficiency on echocardiograms during an average follow-up of       118 days. CONCLUSIONS: Additional procedures to the aortic valve at the time of      VAD placement are feasible. Overall outcomes are comparable to those seen in      patients without the need for aortic valve manipulation at the time of VAD      placement.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
