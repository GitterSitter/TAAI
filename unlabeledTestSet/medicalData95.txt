The availability of relatively low-cost short-term      mechanical support devices has altered the management of primary graft failure      but there are few data on clinical outcome. Here, we describe the UK experience      with Levitronix CentriMag support following heart transplantation across multiple      centres. METHODS: Data for all adult heart transplants and all CentriMag devices       used within 30 days of heart transplantation in the UK between November 2003 and       July 2008 were collected. Transplant characteristics were compared for those who       did and did not receive CentriMag support, and device outcomes and survival rates      were summarised. RESULTS: A total of 572 heart transplants were performed in this      period. As many as 38 patients (6.6%) were implanted with CentriMag devices for      primary graft failure. Four patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation      concurrently and were excluded from further analysis. There were no significant      differences in transplant characteristics between the patients who received      CentriMag support and those who did not. Twelve patients were explanted; nine      survived but three died shortly afterwards. Five underwent acute      retransplantation; two survived and three died. Seventeen patients died on      support. The 30-day and 1-year survival rates were 50% (95% confidence interval      (CI) 32-65%) and 32% (95% CI 18-48%), respectively. Patients who previously had a      bridge-to-transplant ventricular assist device (VAD) had significantly better      survival than those who did not (1-year survival 71% vs 22%, p = 0.029).      CONCLUSIONS: Primary graft failure remains an important early complication of      heart transplantation. Levitronix CentriMag support led to the salvage of 32% of       patients with severe allograft failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
