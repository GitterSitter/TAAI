These devices not only      increase survival time, they also significantly improve quality of life.      Implantation of a LVAD improves hemodynamics and reduces congestion in both the      pulmonary and peripheral vasculature. Improvements in forward blood flow are      probably responsible for the significant reduction in the severity of dyspnea and      fatigue postimplant. Quality of life is a subjective evaluation and includes      aspects of physical, mental and social functioning. Quality of life is      significantly improved after implantation of a LVAD, changes little over the      duration of support and improves again following heart transplantation. Patients       who are discharged home on support report significantly better quality of life      than patients who remain in hospital. At home patients can resume physical,      mental and social activities that were compromised preimplant. A significant      decline in functional ability while on support may be a trigger for patients to      initiate discussions regarding LVAD withdrawal. While the bulk of evidence was      generated during the era of pulsatile support, preliminary information suggests      similar results can be anticipated for patients supported on continuous-flow      devices.FAU - Maciver, JaneAU  - Maciver JAD  - Heart Transplant Program, Peter Munk Cardiac Center, Toronto General Hospital,      11C-1203, 585 University Ave., Toronto ON, M5G 2N2, Canada.FAU - Rao, VivekAU  - Rao VFAU - Ross, Heather JAU  - Ross HJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Med DevicesJT  - Expert review of medical devicesJID - 101230445SB  - IMMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - QuestionnairesEDAT- 2011/05/06 06:00MHDA- 2011/10/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/06 06:00AID - 10.1586/erd.11.9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2011 May;8(3):325-37. doi: 10.1586/erd.11.9.
