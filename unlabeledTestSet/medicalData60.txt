They may be in need of a heart transplant, but because of the limited      amount of donor hearts available, other options need to be available. Because of       the advancement of technology, there are now other options, and one option      available would be a mechanical circulatory and cardiac support device.      Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been developed over the past 30 years.      From larger, earlier pulsatile devices to smaller, hand-held, newer axial flow or      rotary pump devices, VADs are implanted cardiac assist devices. They are      implanted to provide cardiac support and can be used temporarily as a bridge to      transplant (for those awaiting a heart transplant) or implanted permanently,      which is known as destination therapy. With the changes in the size of device,      decrease in the size of drive line, increased length of battery life, as well as       length of device life, thousands of people now have these implanted VAD devices      and are living quality lives and functioning at high levels. Currently, there are      3 generations of the left ventricular assist devices being used throughout the      world. Five of the most well-known type of left ventricular assist devices are      discussed in this article.FAU - Litton, Kimberley AAU  - Litton KAAD  - Allegheny General Hospital/WPAHS, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212, USA.
