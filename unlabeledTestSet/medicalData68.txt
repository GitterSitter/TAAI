Most VADs are used as a bridge to heart      transplantation; however, in certain cases, myocardial function recovers and VADs      can be explanted after the patient is weaned. The objectives of this study were      to describe patients who required Heartmate II VAD insertion, followed by      myocardial recovery and explanation in a quaternary heart centre. METHODS:      Patients who had a VAD explanted were identified in the mechanical support      institutional database and their outcomes were analyzed. Clinical examinations,      biochemical markers, and serial echocardiograms were used to demonstrate      myocardial recovery. RESULTS: Seventeen patients had a Heartmate II VAD inserted       between 2008 and 2010. Four patients underwent successful weaning and subsequent       VAD explantation. Etiology of decompensated heart failure was idiopathic dilated       cardiomyopathy (n = 1), ischemic (n = 1), or myocarditis (n = 2). Mean age was      35.3 years. Patients were supported for 213 days (range 70-293 days) and were in       New York Heart Association class I in the community before explantation. The      devices were explanted via a minimally invasive approach, without cardiopulmonary      bypass. All patients survived explantation and were discharged alive from      hospital after an average of 5.7 +/- 1.5 days post pump explantation. No adverse       events were reported after explantation. Only one patient required allogenic      blood transfusion after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring VAD      support for myocardial failure can undergo significant reverse remodelling.      Explantation can lead to optimal outcome with minimal morbidity. Methods for      assessment of reverse remodelling, weaning protocol, and optimal timing of      explantation remain under evaluation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
