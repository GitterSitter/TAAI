We analyzed the      effects of ventricular decompression by continuous-flow versus pulsatile-flow      LVADs on myocardial structure and function in this population. METHODS AND      RESULTS: Sixty-one patients who underwent LVAD implantation as      bridge-to-transplant were analyzed (pulsatile-flow LVAD: group P, n=31;      continuous-flow LVAD: group C, n=30). Serial echocardiograms, serum levels of      brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and extracellular matrix biomarkers (ECM) were      compared between the groups. Myocardial BNP and ECM gene expression were      evaluated in a subset of 18 patients. Postoperative LV ejection fraction was      greater (33.2+/-12.6% versus 17.6+/-8.8%, P<0.0001) and the mitral E/E' was lower      (9.9+/-2.6 versus 13.2+/-3.8, P=0.0002) in group P versus group C. Postoperative       serum levels of BNP, metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP      (TIMP)-4 were significantly lower in group P compared with group C (BNP:      552.6+/-340.6 versus 965.4+/-805.7 pg/mL, P<0.01; MMP9: 309.0+/-220.2 versus      475.2+/-336.9 ng/dL, P<0.05; TIMP4: 1490.9+/-622.4 versus 2014.3+/-452.4 ng/dL,      P<0.001). Myocardial gene expression of ECM markers and BNP decreased in both      groups; however, expression of TIMP-4 decreased only in group P (P=0.024).      CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical unloading of the failing myocardium using pulsatile      devices is more effective as indicated by echocardiographic parameters of      systolic and diastolic LV function as well as dynamics of BNP and ECM markers.      Therefore, specific effects of pulsatile mechanical unloading on the failing      myocardium may have important implications for device selection especially for      the purpose of bridge-to-recovery in patients with advanced HF.FAU - Kato, Tomoko SAU  - Kato TSAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.FAU - Chokshi, AalapAU  - Chokshi AFAU - Singh, ParvatiAU  - Singh PFAU - Khawaja, TubaAU  - Khawaja TFAU - Cheema, FaisalAU  - Cheema FFAU - Akashi, HirokazuAU  - Akashi HFAU - Shahzad, KhurramAU  - Shahzad KFAU - Iwata, ShinichiAU  - Iwata SFAU - Homma, ShunichiAU  - Homma SFAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HFAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YFAU - Jorde, UlrichAU  - Jorde UFAU - Farr, MaryjaneAU  - Farr MFAU - Mancini, Donna MAU  - Mancini DMFAU - Schulze, P ChristianAU  - Schulze PCLA  - engGR  - K23 HL095742/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL095742-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL095742-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - P30 HL101272-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110715PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
