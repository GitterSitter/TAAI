Cardiac catheterization revealed      bi-ventricular hypokinesis, with an estimated ejection fraction of 15%. Despite      moderate inotropic support, the patient's liver enzymes, international      normalization ratio (INR), and creatinine became grossly elevated, indicating      multi-organ injury from hypoperfusion. Due to the patient's state of shock and      probable bleeding complications, a full sternotomy and emergent biventricular      assist device insertion was deemed very high risk. In order to achieve      hemodynamic stability, a decision was made for extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation (ECMO) support. ECMO support was quickly initiated by percutaneous      cannulation of the femoral vein and artery. The ECMO circuit was comprised of a      Centrimag blood pump and Quadrox-D Safeline-coated membrane oxygenator. With      successful perfusion and organ resuscitation, abnormal liver function tests, INR,      and creatinine all returned to normal in less than one week. With normal organ      function, especially the liver, the patient successfully underwent an implantable      left ventricular assist device, HeartMate II LVAD, without requiring mechanical      right heart support. Prior to ECMO, the patient was at very high risk of needing       biventricular support. Thus, the temporary use of ECMO allowed for a safer and      more durable bridge to transplantation. The use of percutaneous ECMO has many      advantages, including improving the patient condition and allowing for time to      evaluate fully the LVAD patient.FAU - Fitzgerald, DavidAU  - Fitzgerald DAD  - The INOVA Heart and Vascular Institute, Falls Church, VA, USA.
