A major problem in these operations is the risk of air      embolization, particularly in a nonsternotomy approach that precludes access to      the outflow aortic graft and to the ascending aorta. We report a minimally      invasive, nonsternotomy HeartMate II implantable left ventricular assist device      (LVAD) exchange, using peripheral cardiopulmonary support and a novel approach to      continuous intravascular ascending aortic air removal.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
