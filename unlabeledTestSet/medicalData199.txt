METHODS: We evaluated renal function in heart failure patients supported      by the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) continuous-flow left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) who required renal replacement therapy (RRT) by       continuous venovenous hemofiltration dialysis (CVVHD) or hemodialysis, or both.      Indications for RRT included oliguria (urine < 400 ml/day) unresponsive to      diuretic therapy for > 24 hours with a creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dl or 1.5 times       that of the pre-implant creatinine level, severe acidemia, and volume overload.      RESULTS: Of 107 consecutive patients who underwent HeartMate II implantation at      our center and had been supported for > 30 days, 15 (13 men and 2 women) required      post-implant RRT. Of the 15 patients, 3 received CVVHD and 12 received CVVHD and       hemodialysis. Renal function improved within 2 months of support compared with      average values before support (creatinine clearance, 64 +/- 39 vs 92 +/- 55      ml/min, p = 0.041; glomerular filtration rate, 46.9 +/- 20.7 vs 73.2 +/- 38.9      ml/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.032). Renal function improved after HeartMate II      implantation in 10 patients, and RRT was removed. Of these 10 patients, 2      underwent heart transplantation 4 months after RRT was removed, 1 underwent heart      and kidney transplantation 4 years later, 2 died at home of conditions unrelated       to renal function 6 months after RRT was removed, and 5 are awaiting heart      transplantation, with good quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients       who experienced clinical recovery after the LVAD implant had subsequent recovery       of renal function after continuous-flow LVAD support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
