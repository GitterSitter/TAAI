Also reviewed is the less studied but clinically important       area of sleep apnea. Finally, patients with advanced HF represent a group of      patients who pose major difficulties to clinicians. Advanced HF therefore is      examined from the perspectives of HF complicated by renal failure, the role of      palliative care, and the role of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). All of      these topics are reviewed from a perspective of practical applications. Important      new studies have demonstrated in less symptomatic HF patients that cardiac      resynchronization therapy will be of benefit. As well, aldosterone receptor      antagonists can be used with benefit in less symptomatic HF patients. The      important role of palliative care and the need to address end-of-life issues in      advanced HF are emphasized. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of      sleep apnea complicating the course of HF and the role of a sleep study for the      proper assessment and management of the conditon. Patients with either acute      severe or chronic advanced HF with otherwise good life expectancy should be      referred to a cardiac centre capable of providing MCS. Furthermore, patients      awaiting heart transplantation who deteriorate or are otherwise not likely to      survive until a donor organ is found should be referred for MCS.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
