The      introduction of short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices offers      potential therapy to these critically ill patients. The BVS 5000 device (ABIOMED       Inc, USA) is widely used in the United States, but rarely in Canada, where device      reimbursement remains a barrier. OBJECTIVE: To present the Toronto General      Hospital's (Toronto, Ontario) initial five-year experience with this device to      highlight the indications for use, common complications and overall success      rates. METHODS AND RESULTS: The institutional MCS database from 2001 to 2006 was       reviewed, and 18 patients who received 30 devices in a variety of configurations       were identified. The most common support configuration consisted of biventricular      support (n=12), followed by isolated left ventricular support (n=4) and isolated       right ventricular support in two recipients of an implantable long-term left      ventricular assist device. Overall survival to device explant or transplant was      55% (n=10), of which five (50%) were successfully discharged from the hospital.      The overall survival from device implant to hospital discharge was 28% (five of      18). The most common cause of death was multisystem organ failure. CONCLUSIONS:      MCS with the ABIOMED BVS 5000 can successfully resuscitate critically ill      patients; however, earlier institution of this device would avoid irreversible      end-organ injury, and lead to higher rates of device explant and hospital      discharge. Short-term MCS devices should be available in all cardiac surgical      centres in Canada to permit stabilization and evaluation of the acutely ill      cardiac patient and subsequent management in a heart transplant facility.FAU - Lad, VidyadharAU  - Lad VAD  - Heart Transplant Program, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, Toronto General Hospital and      University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.FAU - Elhenawy, AbdelsalamAU  - Elhenawy AFAU - Harwood, SteveAU  - Harwood SFAU - Maciver, JaneAU  - Maciver JFAU - Badiwala, Mitesh VallabhAU  - Badiwala MVFAU - Vallelonga, MarkAU  - Vallelonga MFAU - Yau, Terrence MAU  - Yau TMFAU - Cusimano, Robert JAU  - Cusimano RJFAU - Delgado, Diego HAU  - Delgado DHFAU - Ross, Heather JAU  - Ross HJFAU - Rao, VivekAU  - Rao VLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - Can J CardiolJT  - The Canadian journal of cardiologyJID - 8510280SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*instrumentationMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/instrumentationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - Hospital RecordsMH  - Hospitals, GeneralMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Medical RecordsMH  - Middle AgedMH  - OntarioMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/mortality/surgeryMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC2989351OID - NLM: PMC2989351EDAT- 2010/11/16 06:00MHDA- 2011/01/01 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/16 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can J Cardiol. 2010 Nov;26(9):467-70.
