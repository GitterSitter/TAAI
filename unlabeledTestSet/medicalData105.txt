Consequently, the aims of this      study were to gain an understanding of children's and parents' experience where      children have been supported with a VAD as a bridge to heart transplantation and       to use this information to improve the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) VAD      program. This study employed a qualitative approach using purposive sampling.      Semistructured interviews were conducted with children aged 13 years or more and       their parents to determine their experience of having required VAD support as a      bridge to transplantation. Results demonstrated a lack of information that      prepared families and children for the anticipated course of treatment on VAD      support. Recommendations to improve the VAD program for parents and children      include more information through meetings, as well as in a written format, and      speaking to other families who had already experienced VAD. For children in      particular, a visual of the VAD, its associated equipment, and an image of where       it is placed in the body is vital information that is necessary prior to VAD      support. Overall, the recommendations are important and should be made available       to improve the experience for children and parents, not only of the RCH VAD      program but for all hospitals offering VAD therapy.FAU - Gilmore, HollieAU  - Gilmore HAD  - Department of Cardiology, The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, 3052,      Australia. hollie.gilmore@rch.org.auFAU - Newall, FionaAU  - Newall FLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110409PL  - United StatesTA  - Pediatr CardiolJT  - Pediatric cardiologyJID - 8003849SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Parents/*psychologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesEDAT- 2011/04/12 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/04 06:00CRDT- 2011/04/12 06:00PHST- 2010/11/03 [received]PHST- 2011/03/16 [accepted]PHST- 2011/04/09 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00246-011-9962-3 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Cardiol. 2011 Aug;32(6):772-7. doi: 10.1007/s00246-011-9962-3.
