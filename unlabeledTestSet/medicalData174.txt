METHODS: We analyzed 759 consecutive CRT-defibrillator recipients who were      categorized as never on inotropes (NI; n = 585), weaned from inotropes before      implant (PI; n = 124), or on inotropes at implant (II; n = 50). Survival free      from heart transplant or ventricular assist device and overall survival were      compared using the Social Security Death Index. A patient cohort who underwent      unsuccessful CRT implantation and received a standard defibrillator (SD; n = 94)       comprised a comparison group. Propensity score analysis was used to control for      intergroup baseline differences. RESULTS: Compared with the other cohorts, II      patients had more comorbidities. Both survival endpoints differed significantly      (P < .001) among the 4 cohorts; II patients demonstrated shorter survival than NI      patients, with the PI and SD groups having intermediate survival. After adjusting      for propensity scores, overall differences and patterns in survival endpoints      persisted (P < .01), but the only statistically significant pairwise difference      was overall survival between the NI and II groups at 12 months (hazard ratio      2.95, 95% confidence interval 1.05-8.35). CRT recipients ever on inotropes (PI      and II) and SD patients ever requiring inotropes (n = 17) experienced similar      survival endpoints. Among II patients, predictors of hospital discharge free from      inotropes after CRT included male gender, older age, and ability to tolerate      beta-blockade. CONCLUSIONS: Inotrope-dependent HF patients show significantly      worse survival despite CRT than inotrope-naive patients, in part because of more       comorbid conditions at baseline. CRT may not provide a survival advantage over a       standard defibrillator among patients who have received inotropes before CRT.      Weaning from inotropes and initiating neurohormonal antagonists before CRT should      be an important goal among inotrope-dependent HF patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
