METHODS: A      cohort of 520 patients was analyzed. Mean age was 43.7 +/- 13.6 years. The main      causes of cardiac failure were ischemic cardiomyopathy (39%), idiopathic dilated       cardiomyopathy (41.3%), or myocarditis (6.4%). Bridge to transplantation was      indicated in 87.8% of patients, bridge to recovery in 9%, while destination      therapy was proposed in 3.2% of patients. RESULTS: For patients in cardiogenic      shock or advanced heart failure undergoing device implantation as bridge to      transplantation or recovery (n=458), overall mortality was 39% (n=179). The main       causes of mortality under MCS were multi-organ failure (MOF) (57.4%),      neurological events (14.1%), or infections (11.9%). Heart transplantation was      performed in 249 (54.3%) patients. The main causes of death following heart      transplantation were primary graft failure (22.4%), MOF (14.3%), neurological      event (14.3%), or infection (10.2%). Long-term survival in transplanted patients       was 75 +/- 2.8% at 1 year and 66 +/- 3.4% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: MCS is an      essential therapeutic tool to save the life of young patients with cardiogenic      shock or advanced cardiac failure. Early MCS implantation and the availability of      a device that is adapted to the patient's clinical status are prerequisites for      reducing overall mortality rates.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
