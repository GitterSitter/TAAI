Most      studies examining risk stratification have been limited to pulsatile devices. We       use the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support      (INTERMACS) to stratify patients with continuous-flow devices and assess outcomes      in less severe, but functionally impaired, heart failure patients. METHODS: This       study included 101 bridge-to-transplant and destination-therapy patients at 3      centers. Three groups were studied: Group 1, cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS Profile      1); Group 2, inotrope-dependent (INTERMACS Profile 2 or 3); and Group 3,      ambulatory advanced heart failure (INTERMACS Profiles 4 to 7). The outcomes of      interest were actuarial survival, survival to discharge and length of stay.      RESULTS: Survival at 36 months was better in Group 3 than in Group 1 (95.8% vs      51.1%, p = 0.011), but not between Groups 2 and 3 (68.8 vs 95.8%, p = 0.065).      Lengths of stay for Groups 1 to 3 were 44, 41 and 17 days: Groups 1 vs 3, p <      0.001; Groups 2 vs 3, p < 0.001; and Groups 1 vs 2, p = 0.62. Lengths of stay for      survivors were 49, 39 and 14 for the 3 groups: Groups 1 vs 3, p < 0.001; Groups 2      vs 3, p < 0.001; and Groups 1 vs 2, p = 0.28. CONCLUSION: INTERMACS      classification is a useful metric for risk-stratifying candidates for MCS. Less      acutely ill but functionally impaired heart failure patients receiving      continuous-flow LVADs had longer short- and long-term survival and shorter      lengths of stay compared with patients who were more acutely ill.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
