In the United States, there was really very little activity      focused on the development and implementation of durable mechanical assist      devices for small children until the early part of this millennium. At present,      the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device (Berlin Heart Inc.,      The Woodlands, TX) is currently the only device available to provide long-term      support to small children awaiting cardiac transplantation; this device is only      available through either compassionate use solicitation or within the confines of      an ongoing investigation device exemption trial. There are several other devices       being developed at this time, but it will be years before they are tested in      clinical trials. In this article, we will review the current status of mechanical      circulatory support devices and therapy strategies for infants and small children      presenting in acute heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
