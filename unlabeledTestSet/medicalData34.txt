The issue was to determine the impact of bridge-to-transplant      ventricular assist device support on survival after cardiac transplantation.      Altogether 428 papers were found using the reported search, of which 12      represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors,      journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type,      relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The treatment      options for patients with advanced heart failure or those with deteriorating      end-organ function on maximal medical therapy are limited to intravenous      inotropes and mechanical assistance with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or      ventricular assist device (VAD). Studies exploring the effect of VADs on      post-transplant mortality have yielded conflicting results. The Registry of the      International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation continues to identify      mechanical support as a risk factor for decreased survival after transplantation.      A limitation of this report is that the multivariable adjustment uses variables      recorded not at the time of device implant but at the time of transplant. Some of      the recipient characteristics thus may be altered by the device implant. Compared      with the previous reports the latest data show improvement in post-transplant      survival in the recent era. In addition, the excess risk appears to be limited to      the early post-transplant period. Experienced centers consistently report      outstanding post-transplant results with left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      bridging. Of the 12 papers seven showed no difference in survival, and five      showed a reduced survival. In the papers showing no difference, one year survival      averaged from 85% in supported patients to 87% in non-supported patients. In      papers reporting a difference in outcome, one year averaged survival was 74% in      LVAD recipients compared to 90% in non-bridged patients. Decreased survival is      associated with patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, transplanted      within two weeks of LVAD implantation and bridged to transplantation before 2003       as opposed to patients transplanted more recently. Based on the available      evidence we conclude that in selected patients survival after heart      transplantation in patients bridged with VAD is comparable to those who did not      receive the device.FAU - Urban, MarianAU  - Urban MAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine,       Videnska 1958/9, 14021 Prague, Czech Republic. maub@ikem.czFAU - Pirk, JanAU  - Pirk JFAU - Dorazilova, ZoraAU  - Dorazilova ZFAU - Netuka, IvanAU  - Netuka ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20110725PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - AgedMH  - BenchmarkingMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/mortalityMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - *Waiting ListsEDAT- 2011/07/27 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/13 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/27 06:00PHST- 2011/07/25 [aheadofprint]AID - icvts.2011.273722 [pii]AID - 10.1510/icvts.2011.273722 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2011 Oct;13(4):405-9. doi:      10.1510/icvts.2011.273722.
