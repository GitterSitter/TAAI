The present study reviewed our results      following VAD implantation. We retrospectively reviewed patients that underwent      implantation of a VAD between October 2004 and October 2008. Data collected      included age at implantation, gender, weight, underlying disease, pre- and      postdevice clinical status, complications, and outcome. Fifteen patients were      identified (9 female and 6 male, average age: 8.8 years, range 0.3-14.8; average       weight 31.1 kg, range 5.2-86.4). Indications for VAD support were dilated      cardiomyopathy in 14 patients and progressing heart failure with a single      ventricle physiology (bidirectional Glenn shunt) in one patient. Three patients      (20%) were bridged from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to VAD. Average      support was 29 (1-108) days. Fourteen patients were on a bi-VAD, one patient      (single ventricle) had single VAD support. Three patients developed      mediastinal/pericardial fluid collections, requiring surgical exploration in two,      and drain insertion in one. Three patients presented with neurological symptoms.       In two patients, a total of three blood pumps were exchanged due to thrombus      formation. No patient was weaned off the VAD; two patients (13%) died on the VAD.      All surviving patients are neurologically intact at follow-up. In our experience,      VAD support provides an effective means of bridging children with advanced      dilated cardiomyopathy or heart failure to transplantation with a relatively      small number of complications and deaths given the complexity of the patient      population.CI  - (c) 2010, Copyright the Authors.
