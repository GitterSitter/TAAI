Patients deteriorating on transplantation waiting      lists or those unsuitable for transplantation have been treated with ventricular       assist devices. In this report, we have presented application of ventricular      assist systems for patients with end-stage heart failure. METHODS: Between April       2007 and September 2010, we treated 37 patients with end-stage heart failure with      mechanical circulatory support, including 5 children younger than 16 years of      age. Three patients were females, and the overall mean age was 40 +/- 18 years      (range, 1.5-67). In 29 patients we implanted paracorporeal pneumatic ventricular       assist devices. Axial flow pumps were chosen to support the left ventricle in 8      patients. Biventricular support was applied in 9 patients because of their poor      preoperative clinical conditions and advanced evidence of right ventricular      failure. RESULTS: Heart transplantation was performed in 16 patients (43%). One      subject, who was managed with a left ventricular assist device implantation and      coronary bypass grafting, was weaned from the system because of recovery of      ventricular functions. Eleven patients (30%) are still on pump support. Nine      patients (24%) died during mechanical circulatory support. The most prevalent      cause of mortality was multiorgan failure (n = 5; 13.5%). Cerebrovascular      hemorrhage was the cause of death in 2 patients. One patient died due to acute      lung injury, and an other due to malignant melanoma. CONCLUSION: Use of a      ventricular assist device as a bridge-to-transplantation or as destination      therapy can be performed with acceptable mortality. It may be the most promising       option for patients with end-stage heart failure. Development of device      technology, advanced monitoring of anticoagulation and anti-aggregation therapy,       and greater clinical experience may yield better results.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
