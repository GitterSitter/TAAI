The use       of ventricular assist devices (VAD) in these patients is now available as a      bridge to heart transplantation. The use of a VAD may reveal the presence of a      silent interatrial septal defect or a patent foramen ovale (PFO), inducing a      right to left shunt resulting in systemic desaturation and hemodynamic      instability. We present two cases of low weight infants on circulatory support      with VADs and right to left shunt through interatrial septum that were      successfully treated by percutaneous intervention with an occlusion device.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.FAU - Gagliardi, Maria GiuliaAU  - Gagliardi MGAD  - Department of Paediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, Bambino Gesu Paediatric       Hospital, Rome, Italy. gagliard@opbg.netFAU - Papavasileiou, LidaAU  - Papavasileiou LFAU - Pongiglione, GiacomoAU  - Pongiglione GLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Catheter Cardiovasc IntervJT  - Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the      Society for Cardiac Angiography & InterventionsJID - 100884139SB  - IMMH  - *Cardiac Catheterization/instrumentationMH  - Echocardiography, TransesophagealMH  - Foramen Ovale, Patent/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Failure/complications/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Septal Defects, Atrial/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - MaleMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Septal Occluder DeviceMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2010/09/21 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/11 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/21 06:00AID - 10.1002/ccd.22800 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2011 Mar 1;77(4):577-9. doi: 10.1002/ccd.22800.
