In general, consideration for VAD implantation      is appropriate in patients with endstage heart failure who are failing optimal      medical therapy and in whom no alternative traditional surgical treatment options      are available. However, identifying when a particular patient has reached this      point is not always straightforward. There are a broad range of medical and      surgical therapies for patients with overt heart failure, and this armamentarium       is constantly expanding. The risks, benefits, and expected outcomes with VAD      therapy have also undergone dramatic changes over the last decade. Advances in      technology have led to a proliferation of newer generation devices that are      smaller, lighter, easier to implant, and more reliable than previous generation      devices. This, in turn, has led to a markedly improved risk-benefit ratio, with      increased durability and reduced morbidity. The indications for the implantation       of ventricular assist devices have also evolved over the last several years, and       specific patient presentations and goals of therapy have led to specific      indications. Device therapy has traditionally been classified as bridge to      recovery, bridge to transplantation, and destination therapy. However, such      designations may not be well defined at the time of implantation, and recovery      and response following initiation of VAD support may allow patients to change      from one classification to another. The current data regarding indications and      timing of device implantation are reviewed.FAU - Tang, Daniel GAU  - Tang DGAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305,      USA.FAU - Oyer, Philip EAU  - Oyer PEFAU - Mallidi, Hari RAU  - Mallidi HRLA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20090319PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Transl ResJT  - Journal of cardiovascular translational researchJID - 101468585SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/historyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - History, 21st CenturyMH  - HumansMH  - *Patient SelectionMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeRF  - 49EDAT- 2010/06/19 06:00MHDA- 2010/10/05 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/19 06:00PHST- 2009/02/12 [received]PHST- 2009/02/26 [accepted]PHST- 2009/03/19 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12265-009-9098-5 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2009 Jun;2(2):159-67. doi: 10.1007/s12265-009-9098-5.
