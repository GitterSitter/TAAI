METHODS: Between June 1990 and December 2009, 53 patients after 1417      heart transplants (3.7%) required post-transplant MCS for acute rejection (n=17),      biventricular failure (n=16), right ventricular failure (n=16), left ventricular       failure (n=1), or respiratory failure (n=3). Although support was occasionally      instituted remotely post-transplant (5>1 year), in 39 (73%) instances it was      required within 1 week. Initial mode of support was extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation in 43 patients (81%), biventricular assist device in 4 (7.5%), and      right ventricular assist device in 6 (11%). RESULTS: Risk of requiring      respiratory support was highest in those with restrictive cardiomyopathy as      indication for transplant, women, and those with elevated pulmonary pressure or      renal failure. Complications of support, which increased progressively with its      duration, included stroke in two patients (3.8%), infection in two (3.8%), and      reoperation for bleeding (seven instances) in four (7.0%). Nineteen patients      (36%) recovered and were removed from support, five (9.4%) underwent      retransplantation (four after biventricular failure and one after acute      rejection), and 29 died while on support (55%). Overall survival after initiating      support was 94%, 83%, 66%, and 43% at 1, 3, 7, and 30 days, respectively.      Patients requiring support for biventricular failure had better survival than      those having acute rejection or other indications (P=0.03). Survival after      retransplantation or removal from support following recovery was 88% at 1 year      and 61% at 10 years. CONCLUSION: Severe refractory heart failure after      transplantation is a rare catastrophic event for which MCS offers the possibility      of recovery or bridge to retransplantation, particularly for patients with      biventricular failure in the absence of rejection. Early retransplantation should      be considered in patients who show no evidence of graft recovery on MCS.FAU - Mihaljevic, TomislavAU  - Mihaljevic TAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,      OH 44195, USA. mihaljt@ccf.orgFAU - Jarrett, Craig MAU  - Jarrett CMFAU - Gonzalez-Stawinski, GonzaloAU  - Gonzalez-Stawinski GFAU - Smedira, Nicholas GAU  - Smedira NGFAU - Nowicki, Edward RAU  - Nowicki ERFAU - Thuita, LucyAU  - Thuita LFAU - Mountis, MariaAU  - Mountis MFAU - Blackstone, Eugene HAU  - Blackstone EHLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AdultMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/adverse effects/*methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Graft Rejection/therapyMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative Care/methodsMH  - Primary Graft Dysfunction/etiology/*therapyMH  - ReoperationMH  - Survival AnalysisPMC - PMC3241119OID - NLM: PMC3241119EDAT- 2011/06/07 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/02 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/07 06:00AID - j.ejcts.2011.04.017 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.04.017 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jan;41(1):200-6; discussion 206. doi:      10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.04.017.
