METHODS: Between January 1999 and December 2009, 56 small children with       body surface area<1.2 m(2) were implanted with Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric VAD      in Germany Heart Institute Berlin. The etiology of end-stage myocardial failure      included non-congenital (75%) and congenital heart disease (25%); the median age       at implant was 1 year (12 days to 14 years), and the median support time was 55      days (1-432 days). RESULTS: Of the 56 pediatric patients, 24 were bridged to      heart transplantation, 12 were explanted following myocardial recovery, two      continued to receive support, and the other 18 died on support. The accurate rate      of survival on VAD support was 81.1% +/- 5.8% and 51.4% +/- 9.3% at 30 days and 1      year after EXCOR implantation. Patients receiving biventricular support had a      trend towards higher post-implantation mortality as compared with children      implanted with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (P = 0.09). Lower      post-implantation survival was also observed in patients with congenital cardiac       disease compared with children with a non-congenital etiology (P < 0.001).      CONCLUSIONS: Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric VAD could provide satisfactory and safe      circulatory support for small children with end-stage heart disease.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
