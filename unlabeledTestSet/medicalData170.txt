Continuous-flow rotary LVADs have been developed in the hopes of      delivering circulatory support in a more durable manner with fewer device-related      complications. The HeartMate((R)) II continuous-flow left ventricular assist      system (LVAS; Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) has become the standard       of care for heart failure patients who require long-term mechanical circulatory      support. The efficacy of the HeartMate II has been demonstrated in patients where      temporary support with an LVAD is needed until a suitable donor organ can be      found for transplant (termed 'bridge to transplantation'), as well as for      terminally-ill heart failure patients who are not candidates for transplant      ('destination therapy'). When directly compared with a pulsatile LVAD, the      implantation of a HeartMate II LVAS resulted in an overall improvement in      survival with a reduction in the number of device-related complications and      adverse events. The purpose of this article is threefold: to describe the history      of the development of continuous-flow LVADs; to describe the technology of the      HeartMate II; and, finally, to review the clinical outcomes in patients who have       been implanted with the device.FAU - Sheikh, Farooq HAU  - Sheikh FHAD  - Johns Hopkins Hospital, 600 North Wolfe Street, Carnegie 568, Baltimore, MD      21287, USA.FAU - Russell, Stuart DAU  - Russell SDLA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Med DevicesJT  - Expert review of medical devicesJID - 101230445SB  - IMMH  - Clinical Trials as TopicMH  - Databases as TopicMH  - *Heart VentriclesMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/historyMH  - Hemorheology/*physiologyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - History, 21st CenturyMH  - HumansMH  - Ventricular FunctionEDAT- 2010/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/24 06:00CRDT- 2010/12/17 06:00AID - 10.1586/erd.10.77 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2011 Jan;8(1):11-21. doi: 10.1586/erd.10.77.
