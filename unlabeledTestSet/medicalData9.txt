At the time of admission to our hospital, he      could not be registered as a candidate for heart transplantation because of      severe renal failure with a serum creatinine level of 4.6 mg/dl. We considered      that he was a marginal candidate for heart transplantation; thus, it was      essential to understand the etiology of renal failure and estimate whether it was      reversible. Cardiac catheterization revealed poor hemodynamic function with a      systemic pressure of 107/60 mmHg, cardiac index of 2.5 l/min/m(2), and pulmonary       artery pressure of 63/27 mmHg, despite intense medical treatment. Contrary to      biochemical examination findings of blood, renal biopsy findings showed no      significant glomerular abnormality. Furthermore, the severity of tubular atrophy       and interstitial fibrosis in the cortex was mild. These pathological findings      suggested that the renal dysfunction in this case was possibly attributable to a       hemodynamic factor. His symptoms gradually deteriorated despite an increasing      dose of inotropic support; thus, we planned implantation of a Jarvik 2000      axial-flow pump (Jarvik Heart Inc., New York, NY, USA) as a bridge to      eligibility, and informed consent was obtained. Because of a tight adhesion on      the anterior wall, we placed the device on the lateral wall of the left      ventricle, making sure not to direct the pump at the septum. Postoperatively, the      implantable left ventricular assist device provided relief from heart failure      symptoms as well as recovery of renal function, with serum the creatinine level      at 1.2 mg/dl, which allowed the patient to become an appropriate candidate for      heart transplantation. At an 18-month follow-up examination, his status was      uneventful, and he is now at home awaiting heart transplantation.FAU - Kainuma, SatoshiAU  - Kainuma SAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of      Medicine, 2-2 E1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan. s.kainuma@hotmail.co.jpFAU - Sakaguchi, TaichiAU  - Sakaguchi TFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Miyagawa, ShigeruAU  - Miyagawa SFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Yamauchi, TakashiAU  - Yamauchi TFAU - Sakata, YasushiAU  - Sakata YFAU - Takahashi, AtsushiAU  - Takahashi AFAU - Uehata, TakuyaAU  - Uehata TFAU - Kuratani, ToruAU  - Kuratani TFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110918PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/complications/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - Heart Ventricles/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Kidney/*physiopathology/surgeryMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/09/20 06:00MHDA- 2012/07/24 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/20 06:00PHST- 2011/06/25 [received]PHST- 2011/08/26 [accepted]PHST- 2011/09/18 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-011-0602-8 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2012 Mar;15(1):83-6. doi: 10.1007/s10047-011-0602-8.
