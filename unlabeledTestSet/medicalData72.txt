There have been few      reports of LVAD implantation for more than a month in children weighing under 5      kg. We report the case of a 4-month-old female infant who survived for 2 months      after being diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with extracorporeal      centrifugal pump support. In recent years, although pumps designed for small      children have been introduced and are used as a bridge to transplantation or      recovery, mid-term or long-term mechanical support for small children with heart       failure is still difficult. We managed to successfully provide support for a      low-body-weight child with a centrifugal pump over a mid-term period. We achieved      acceptable control of thrombosis, but eventually the infant died of sepsis.      Autopsy revealed no prominent thrombosis in the perfusion cannula, drainage      cannula, the pump, or the left ventricle. This is the first case report of LVAD      support with the centrifugal pump, ROTAFLOW((R)) (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany), for       2 months in a child weighing under 5 kg. Our method may potentially save severe      heart failure children who need mid-term LVAD support.FAU - Inoue, TakafumiAU  - Inoue TAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo,      Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. takainoue-tky@umin.ac.jpFAU - Nishimura, TakashiAU  - Nishimura TFAU - Murakami, ArataAU  - Murakami AFAU - Itatani, KeiichiAU  - Itatani KFAU - Takaoka, TetsuhiroAU  - Takaoka TFAU - Kitahori, KazuoAU  - Kitahori KFAU - Umeki, AkihideAU  - Umeki AFAU - Takezoe, ToshikoAU  - Takezoe TFAU - Kashiwa, KoichiAU  - Kashiwa KFAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SFAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110520PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMMH  - Fatal OutcomeMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/05/21 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/17 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/21 06:00PHST- 2010/12/28 [received]PHST- 2011/04/26 [accepted]PHST- 2011/05/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-011-0572-x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2011 Sep;14(3):253-6. doi: 10.1007/s10047-011-0572-x.
