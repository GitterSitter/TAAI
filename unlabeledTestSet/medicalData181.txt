The goal of the      present study was to determine whether combining a cardiac support device with      cell-based therapy could prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling, more than      either therapy alone. METHODS: The present study was completed in 2 parts. In the      first part, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rodent femurs and seeded on      a collagen-based scaffold. In the second part, myocardial infarction was induced       in 60 rats. The 24 survivors were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: control,      stem cell therapy, cardiac support device, and a combination of stem cell therapy      and cardiac support device. Left ventricular function was measured with biweekly       echocardiography, followed by end-of-life histopathologic analysis at 6 weeks.      RESULTS: After myocardial infarction and treatment intervention, the ejection      fraction remained preserved (74.9-80.2%) in the combination group at an early      point (2 weeks) compared with the control group (66.2-82.8%). By 6 weeks, the      combination therapy group had a significantly greater fractional area of change      compared with the control group (69.2% +/- 6.7% and 49.5% +/- 6.1% respectively,       P = .03). Also, at 6 weeks, the left ventricular wall thickness was greater in      the combination group than in the stem cell therapy alone group (1.79 +/- 0.11      and 1.33 +/- 0.13, respectively, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Combining a cardiac      support device with stem cell therapy preserves left ventricular function after      myocardial infarction, more than either therapy alone. Furthermore, stem cell      delivery using a cardiac support device is a novel delivery approach for      cell-based therapies.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
