Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are a      type of mechanical circulatory support that aids in systemic perfusion by      maintaining unidirectional flow while reducing the oxygen demand of the failing      ventricle. There are 3 generations of VADs in circulation used as a bridge to      transplantation, a bridge to recovery, or as destination therapy. Due to the      increasing use of these devices, it is likely that anesthetists will encounter      patients with these devices more frequently, which requires adequate preoperative      discussion with the care team. Intraoperatively, it is important to realize that       patients with VADs are at higher risk for aspiration, to recognize      electromagnetic interference from surgical devices, to maintain hemodynamic      stability, and to monitor coagulation status. With proper knowledge, and adequate      preoperative preparation and intraoperative care, anesthetists should be able to       achieve safe and successful patient outcomes through anesthesia care.FAU - Khoo, Kristin AAU  - Khoo KAAD  - Anethesia Nursing Program, College of Nursing, University of Iowa, Iowa City,      USA.
