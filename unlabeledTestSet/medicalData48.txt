The aim of this study was to establish and characterise adult      human myocardial slices from small patients' heart biopsies as a simple,      reproducible and relevant preparation suitable for the study of human cardiac      tissue at the multicellular level. Vibratome-cut myocardial slices were prepared       from left ventricular biopsies obtained from end-stage heart failure patients      undergoing heart transplant or ventricular assist device implantation, and from      hearts of normal dogs. Multiple slices were prepared from each biopsy. Regular      contractility was observed at a range of stimulation frequencies (0.1-2 Hz), and       stable electrical activity, monitored using multi-electrode arrays (MEA), was      maintained for at least 8 h from slice preparation. ATP/ADP and      phosphocreatine/creatine ratios were comparable to intact organ values, and      morphology and gap junction distribution were representative of native      myocardium. MEA recordings showed that field potential duration (FPD) and      conduction velocity (CV) in human and dog slices were similar to the values      previously reported for papillary muscles, ventricular wedges and whole hearts.      Longitudinal CV was significantly faster than transversal CV, with an anisotropic      ratio of 3:1 for human and 2.3:1 for dog slices. Importantly, slices responded to      the application of E-4031, chromanol and 4-aminopyridine, three potassium channel      blockers known to affect action potential duration, with an increase in FPD. We      conclude that viable myocardial slices with preserved structural, biochemical and      electrophysiological properties can be prepared from adult human and canine heart      biopsies and offer a novel preparation suitable for the study of heart failure      and drug screening.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
