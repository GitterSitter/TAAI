The combination of LVADs and cell transplantation (CTx) is expected to      be effective to improve the success rate of LVAD removal. We investigated the      feasibility of combined CTx therapy and LVAD support with a new heterotopic rat      heart-lung transplantation model that could simulate LVAD support and LVAD      removal. The heart and both lungs of a rat were heterotopically transplanted, and      the heart was kept unloaded for two weeks. The heart was then reloaded for two      weeks (LVAD group). Syngenic smooth muscle cells were transplanted into the      hearts that had been unloaded for a week, and the hearts were kept unloaded for      another week and then reloaded (CT-LVAD group). In the unloaded state, CTx could       reduce the left ventricle (LV) volume more effectively than LVAD therapy alone      (P<0.01) and maintain the LV volume even after the hearts were reloaded (P<0.01).      The results suggest that CTx with LVAD support can prevent recurrent LV dilation       after LVAD removal and improve the success rate of LVAD removal.FAU - Mizuno, TomohiroAU  - Mizuno TAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Machida Municipal Hospital, 2-15-41      Asahi-machi, Machida, Tokyo 194-0023, Japan. t-mizuno@yhc.att.ne.jpLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20101006PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399RN  - 0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)RN  - EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)RN  - EC 3.4.24.24 (Mmp2 protein, rat)RN  - EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cells, CulturedMH  - Device RemovalMH  - Feasibility StudiesMH  - Heart Ventricles/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - *Heart-Lung TransplantationMH  - Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology/*prevention &       controlMH  - MaleMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolismMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolismMH  - Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/*transplantationMH  - RatsMH  - Rats, Inbred LewMH  - ReoperationMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/metabolismMH  - Transplantation, HeterotopicMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Ventricular PressureEDAT- 2010/10/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/09 06:00CRDT- 2010/10/08 06:00PHST- 2010/10/06 [aheadofprint]AID - icvts.2010.239806 [pii]AID - 10.1510/icvts.2010.239806 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2011 Jan;12(1):10-4. doi:      10.1510/icvts.2010.239806.
