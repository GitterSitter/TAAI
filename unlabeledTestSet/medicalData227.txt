End-organ dysfunction is often reversed, optimizing the      patient's condition to enhance survival, and quality of life. Questions have been      raised regarding the potential for continuous flow LVADs (CF-LVADs) to provide      the same quality of circulatory support. Prior research showing that PF is      superior to continuous, non-PF does not appear to be relevant with CF-LVADs for      BTT and DT. Under most clinical conditions, arterial pulsatility is present      during CF-LVAD support, and this type of support should not be termed      "nonpulsatile." Clinical studies have shown that renal, hepatic, and      neurocognitive function is either maintained within a normal range, or is      significantly improved, during CF-LVAD support for durations up to 15 months.      Results of the randomized clinical trial between the CF HeartMate II and the      pulsatile HeartMate XVE (both by Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA, USA) are pending       final US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and are not yet published.      Studies of microcirculation during CF-LVAD support indicate that capillary blood       flow is adequate to support cellular function. There are anecdotal cases of      patients being supported with a CF-LVAD for over seven years with preserved      end-organ function. Presently, there are no clinical reports indicating that      end-organ function is not well maintained. Current clinical evidence indicates      that end-organ perfusion and function can be well maintained for extended      durations of support with a CF-LVAD.FAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSAD  - Division of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA. mark.slaughter@louisville.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/complications/mortality/psychology/*surgeryMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - KentuckyMH  - MicrocirculationMH  - Multiple Organ Failure/etiology/*prevention & controlMH  - Quality of Life/psychologyMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2010/07/21 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/22 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/21 06:00AID - JCS1075 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01075.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2010 Jul;25(4):490-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01075.x.
