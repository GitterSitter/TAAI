METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 145 patients with heart      failure and severe PH treated by LVAD support between 2000 and 2009. There were      133 men (91.7%) and 12 women (8.3%) with a mean age of 52.95+/-12.01 years.      Patients were divided into two groups depending on preoperative PH reversibility.      Fixed PH was defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >25 mmHg, a      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >2.5 Wood Unit (WU) and a transpulmonary      gradient (TPG) >12 mmHg, despite pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-six      patients had fixed PH (group A) and 89 reversible PH (group B). Only 27 patients       of group A underwent right heart catheterization evaluation during LVAD support;       the remaining 29 patients had other contraindications to heart transplantation      (HTx). The 27 patients were divided into three subgroups on the basis of      examination time during LVAD support: <6 months (11 patients), between 6 and 12      months (six patients) and >12 months (10 patients). The mPAP, PVR, and TPG      decreased significantly during LVAD support (mPAP, 37.26+/-6.35 mmHg vs      21.00+/-7.51 mmHg, p=0.007; PVR, 3.49+/-1.47 WU vs 1.53+/-0.66 WU, p=0.000; and      TPG, 15.04+/-5.22 mmHg vs 7.78+/-3.21 mmHg, p=0.019). A significant reduction of       all parameters was observed during the first 6 months and later on there was no      further decrease. There were no significant differences between the three      subgroups (mPAP, p=0.680; PVR, p=0.723; and TPG, p=0.679) in terms of time of      reversibility. LVAD support allowed 19 patients to be transplanted. CONCLUSIONS:       Patients with fixed PH can be treated with LVAD support. Our data suggest that 6       months after LVAD implantation it is possible to observe an important reduction      of PH and evaluate the potential transplantability of patients. Longer support      does not add any effect of LVAD on PH.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published by      Elsevier B.V.
