Both the numbers and ages of patients      in which they are used are rising worldwide, especially when used as a permanent       support (bridge to destination, BTD). Due to the continuing lack of donor organs,      these devices now represent a viable alternative to bridge patients to      transplantation (BTT), with a 1-year survival rate of 86%. BTD, especially in      long-term support, might be a valid, and the sole, option for those patients in      whom heart transplantation is contraindicated. Patient selection, pre- and      intra-operative preparation, as well as the timing of VAD implantation are      important factors critical to successful circulatory support. While BTT remains      the goal in the majority of patients, the number of permanent VADs (i. e. BTD) is      rising significantly. Although explantation of a VAD system as a bridge to      recovery (BTR) can be considered in only a small number of patients, it      represents a very special part of this therapy modality.FAU - Krabatsch, TAU  - Krabatsch TAD  - Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Deutschland.FAU - Schweiger, MAU  - Schweiger MFAU - Stepanenko, AAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Drews, TAU  - Drews TFAU - Potapov, EAU  - Potapov EFAU - Pasic, MAU  - Pasic MFAU - Weng, YAU  - Weng YFAU - Huebler, MAU  - Huebler MFAU - Hetzer, RAU  - Hetzer RLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Fortschritte bei implantierbaren mechanischen Kreislaufunterstuzungssystemen :      Literaturubersicht und Update.PL  - GermanyTA  - HerzJT  - HerzJID - 7801231SB  - IMMH  - Activities of Daily Living/classificationMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart, ArtificialMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Survival RateMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyEDAT- 2011/09/14 06:00MHDA- 2012/04/26 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/14 06:00AID - 10.1007/s00059-011-3509-5 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Herz. 2011 Oct;36(7):622-9. doi: 10.1007/s00059-011-3509-5.
