In this report, we present the largest US single-center report of      pediatric VAD use to date. We present detailed descriptions of morbidity and      mortality associated with VAD support, using standard Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) criteria for pediatrics to       facilitate the comparison of these results to other studies. METHODS AND RESULTS:      We retrospectively identified 25 patients younger than 18 years with 27 episodes       of mechanical circulatory support using VADs as bridge to heart transplantation      from January 1998 to December 2007. Survival to transplant for the entire cohort       was 74%. The most common major morbidities, as defined by INTERMACS criteria for       a pediatric population, were respiratory failure, major localized infections,      major bleeding events, hepatic dysfunction, and right heart failure. Major      neurological events occurred in 48% of the study population. The median time to      the first occurrence of an adverse event was less than 14 days for respiratory      failure, right heart failure, major localized infection, and major bleeding.      Patients who died before transplantation had significantly more adverse events      per day of support than did those who were successfully transplanted. Episodes of      major bleeding, tamponade, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and right      heart failure were all associated with increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:       INTERMACS criteria can be successfully used to analyze pediatric VAD outcomes.      These data serve as a baseline for future studies of VAD support in children and       indicate good survival rates but considerable morbidity.FAU - Stein, Mary LynetteAU  - Stein MLAD  - Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.FAU - Robbins, RobertAU  - Robbins RFAU - Sabati, Arash AlenAU  - Sabati AAFAU - Reinhartz, OlafAU  - Reinhartz OFAU - Chin, CliffordAU  - Chin CFAU - Liu, EstherAU  - Liu EFAU - Bernstein, DanielAU  - Bernstein DFAU - Roth, StephenAU  - Roth SFAU - Wright, GailAU  - Wright GFAU - Reitz, BruceAU  - Reitz BFAU - Rosenthal, DavidAU  - Rosenthal DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20100831PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
