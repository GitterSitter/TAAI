Recovery of dilated cardiomyopathies with the      combination left ventricular decompression with a VAD and treatment with maximal       medical therapy has been possible in some adults, and may be more feasible in      infants and children. We used pulsatile and continuous flow VADs and the total      artificial heart (TAH) as bridges to transplantation or to recovery. Candidates      for native heart recovery were treated with maximal medical therapy for      congestive heart failure and short-term dobutamine prior to weaning off device      support. Since 1997, 28 infants and children, ages 1 month to 16 years, were      implanted for durations of 3-107 days (mean 27). Eighteen received left VADs      (LVAD), seven biventricular assist devices (BiVADs), and three TAHs.      Device-related mortality was 7/28 (25%), leaving 21/28 (75%) surviving to      transplantation or weaning from device support and 20/28 (71%) discharged from      the hospital and currently surviving for 2 months to 9 years. Ten of 11      transplant recipients (90%) have survived 2 to 9 years. All 10 with recovered      hearts are alive and well for 2 months to 5 years. Eight of 12 (67%) LVAD      patients with dilated hearts recovered. None of the recovery patients were over 6      years old. Infants and children who have failed inotropic therapy may be treated       with an LVAD and medical therapy for congestive heart failure anticipating native      heart recovery. A variety of devices have been tried. All small LVADs yielded      comparable results. Larger and older children also have a chance of recovery, but      our experience with them is too small except to note that they do well with      larger devices and transplantation.CI  - (c) 2010, Copyright the Authors.
