This      study involved a retrospective observational cohort. Records of patients      supported with the BH VAD were reviewed. Data regarding age, sex, weight,      diagnosis, preoperative condition, single versus biventricular support,      morbidity, and mortality were collected. Criteria for single versus biventricular      support and intensive care unit management were registered. The procedure was      approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee, and informed consent was      obtained. Between March 2006 and March 2010, 12 patients with diagnosis of      dilated (n = 10) and restrictive (n = 2) cardiomyopathy were supported. Median      age was 56.6 months (range 20.1-165.9); mean weight was 18.3 kg (range 8.5-45);      and nine patients were female. Every patient presented with severe heart failure       refractory to pharmacological therapy. Biventricular support was necessary in      four patients. Nine patients underwent heart transplantation. No child was weaned      off the BH VAD because of myocardial recovery. Mean length of support was 73 days      (range 3-331), and the total number of days of support was 1373. Three patients      had fatal complications: 2 had thrombo-hemorrhagic stroke leading to brain death,      and one had refractory vasoplegic shock. The BH VAD is a useful and reasonable      safe device for cardiac transplantation bridging in children with end-stage heart      failure. Team experience resulted in less morbidity and mortality, and time for      implantation, surgical procedure, anticoagulation monitoring, and patient care      improved.FAU - Moreno, Guillermo EAU  - Moreno GEAD  - Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, Hospital de Pediatria "Dr. Juan P.
