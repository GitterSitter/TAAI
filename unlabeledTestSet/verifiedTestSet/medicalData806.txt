However, thromboembolic      events, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. We      retrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)      in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in a      pediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March      31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),      median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a left      VAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwent      heart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient is      still on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days of      assistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of nine      patients (56%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When compared      with noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median      131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care       unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and a      longer length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR      34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced for      thromboembolic issues, most of them (67%) in patients with VAD-related      infections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BH      endocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,      12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venous      catheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinary      catheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanical      ventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Of      the 17 isolated pathogens, 53% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence of      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25%),      three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50% of all isolated pseudomonads),      and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients with      infected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospital      with increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.
