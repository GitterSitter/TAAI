As these patients progress to      end-stage heart failure they pose a unique set of challenges. Heart transplant      remains the standard of care; the donor pool, however, remains limited. Following      the experience from the adult realm, the pediatric ventricular assist device      (VAD) has emerged as a valid treatment option as a bridge to transplant. Due to      the infrequent necessity and the uniqueness of each case, the pediatric VAD in      the CHD population remains a topic with limited information. Given the experience      in the adult realm, we were tasked with reviewing pediatric VADs and their use in      patients with CHD and comparing this therapy to heart transplantation when      possible.FAU - Miller, Jacob RAU  - Miller JRAD  - Section of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of      Medicine, St Louis Children's Hospital, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.FAU - Eghtesady, PiroozAU  - Eghtesady PLA  - engGR  - R01 HL098634/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32 HL007776/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32 HL007776/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - EnglandTA  - J Comp Eff ResJT  - Journal of comparative effectiveness researchJID - 101577308SB  - IMPMC - PMC4231823MID - NIHMS639353OID - NLM: NIHMS639353 [Available on 07/01/15]OID - NLM: PMC4231823 [Available on 07/01/15]OTO - NOTNLMOT  - congenital heart diseaseOT  - heart failureOT  - heart transplantOT  - pediatricOT  - single ventricleOT  - ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2014/10/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/29 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/29 06:00PMCR- 2015/07/01 00:00AID - 10.2217/cer.14.42 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Comp Eff Res. 2014 Sep;3(5):533-46. doi: 10.2217/cer.14.42.- 25350804own - nlmstat- in-processda  - 20141029lr  - 20150217is  - 2042-6313 (electronic)is  - 2042-6305 (linking)vi  - 3ip  - 5dp  - 2014 septi  - ventricular assist device use in congenital heart disease with a comparison to      heart transplant.pg  - 533-46lid - 10.2217/cer.14.42 [doi]ab  - despite advances in medical and surgical therapies, some children with congenital      heart disease (chd) are not able to be adequately treated or palliated, leading      them to develop progressive heart failure. as these patients progress to      end-stage heart failure they pose a unique set of challenges. heart transplant      remains the standard of care; the donor pool, however, remains limited. following      the experience from the adult realm, the pediatric ventricular assist device      (vad) has emerged as a valid treatment option as a bridge to transplant. due to      the infrequent necessity and the uniqueness of each case, the pediatric vad in      the chd population remains a topic with limited information. given the experience      in the adult realm, we were tasked with reviewing pediatric vads and their use in      patients with chd and comparing this therapy to heart transplantation when      possible.fau - miller, jacob rau  - miller jrad  - section of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery, washington university school of      medicine, st louis children's hospital, st louis, mo 63110, usa.fau - eghtesady, piroozau  - eghtesady pla  - enggr  - r01 hl098634/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - t32 hl007776/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - t32 hl007776/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statespt  - journal articlept  - research support, n.i.h., extramuralpl  - englandta  - j comp eff resjt  - journal of comparative effectiveness researchjid - 101577308sb  - impmc - pmc4231823mid - nihms639353oid - nlm: nihms639353 [available on 07/01/15]oid - nlm: pmc4231823 [available on 07/01/15]oto - notnlmot  - congenital heart diseaseot  - heart failureot  - heart transplantot  - pediatricot  - single ventricleot  - ventricular assist deviceedat- 2014/10/29 06:00mhda- 2014/10/29 06:00crdt- 2014/10/29 06:00pmcr- 2015/07/01 00:00aid - 10.2217/cer.14.42 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - j comp eff res. 2014 sep;3(5):533-46. doi: 10.2217/cer.14.42.
