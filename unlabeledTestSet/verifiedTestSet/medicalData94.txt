As HIV has become a      chronic illness with the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART),      cardiac transplantation has been used for selected HIV patients with end-stage      heart failure. We present a case series describing the clinical outcomes with      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) use in 4 patients with HIV. Three of the      patients are alive: 1 after a successful bridge to transplant and the other 2 on       continued device support at 18 and 13 months after implantation. No infectious      complications occurred in 3 patients, and no opportunistic infections occurred in      the fourth patient. De novo allosensitization did not occur in our patients after      LVAD implantation. With the ongoing donor shortage, implantation of an LVAD in      advanced heart failure patients with HIV with controlled viremia on HAART      represents a viable option.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
