We hypothesized that hemodynamics and organ recovery would improve after      biventricular, apical cannulation compared with right atrial cannulation.      METHODS: Between 2003 and 2009, we treated 31 patients (21 men, 10 women; mean      age, of 43 +/- 15 years) with a paracorporeal BiVAD (Thoratec BVAD, Pleasanton,      CA). In 15 of 31 patients, the inflow cannula of the right VAD (RVAD) was      positioned inside the right ventricle (RV) through the RV apex (biapical) instead      of the right atrium (conventional). We analyzed pump flow, driving pressure, and       vacuum of the Thoratec driving console and recovery of kidney (creatinine, blood       urea nitrogen) and liver function (bilirubin). RESULTS: Mean duration of BiVAD      support was 84 +/- 72 days. BiVAD weaning was successful in 4 of 31 patients      (13%), 12 underwent cardiac transplantation (39%), and 15 (48%) died. We observed      significantly higher pump flow of the LVAD and RVAD in patients after biapical      cannulation compared with those with conventional cannulation (LVAD, 5.6 +/- 0.4       vs 5.1 +/- 0.3 liters/min, p = 0.002; and RVAD: 4.9 +/- 0.3 vs 4.2 +/- 0.3      liters/min, p < 0.001). This superior circulatory support correlated with faster       recovery of kidney function. CONCLUSION: Cardiac support with a BiVAD is      hemodynamically more effective after biventricular apical cannulation compared      with conventional right atrial cannulation. Consequently, higher pump flow      results in better end-organ recovery using biapical cannulation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
