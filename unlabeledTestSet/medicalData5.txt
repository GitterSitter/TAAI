Antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation are needed to      control these arrhythmias. Dofetilide has only been approved for the treatment of      atrial fibrillation. The role of dofetilide in the control of ventricular      arrhythmias in patients with an ICD has not been established. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate      the safety and efficacy of dofetilide in a consecutive group of patients with an       ICD and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/ or ventricular fibrillation      (VF) after other antiarrhythmic drugs have failed to suppress these arrhythmias.       METHODS: We studied 30 patients (age 59 +/- 11; 5 women) with symptomatic VT or      VF and ICDs for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. These patients had       an average of 1.8 +/- 4.5 episodes of VT/VF per month despite antiarrhymic      therapy. Twenty-one patients (70%) had recurrent appropriate ICD therapies prior       to initiation of dofetilide, and 9 (30%) VTs below the programmed detection rate       of the ICD. Twenty-three patients (77%) had coronary artery disease. Mean      ejection fraction was 30 +/- 14% and 26/30 (87%) had congestive heart failure.      All patients had previously failed 2 +/- 1 antiarrhythmic drugs including      amiodarone (n = 19) and sotalol (n = 10). RESULTS: During the first month of      treatment, 25 patients (83%) had complete suppression of VT/VF and of the 21      patients with ICD therapies 16 (76%) had no therapies during the first month of      treatment. During a follow-up period of 32 +/- 32 months, dofetilide reduced the       monthly episodes of VT/VF from 1.8 +/- 4.5 to 1.0 +/- 3.5 (P = 0.006). Monthly      ICD therapies decreased from 0.9 +/- 1.4 to 0.4 +/- 1.7 (P = 0.037). In 9      patients that presented with slow VTs under the ICD detection zone, dofetilide      reduced monthly VT/VF episodes from 0.7 +/- 0.6 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 (P = 0.01) and 6      (67%) had no further ICD therapies. Dofetilide was discontinued in 13 patients      (43%) after 24 +/- 30 months due to failure to control VT/VF (n = 7), placement      of a left ventricular assist device (n = 3), catheter ablation (n = 1), heart      transplantation (n = 1), and left ventricular restoration surgery (n = 1). There       were 7 documented deaths (2 patients died suddenly; 3 patients of progressive      heart failure; and 2 of non-cardiac causes). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an ICD      and ventricular arrhythmias, dofetilide decreases the frequency of VT/VF and ICD       therapies even when other antiarrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, have      previously been ineffective. Recurrences still occur in some patients requiring      catheter ablation, mechanical support, or heart transplantation.CI  - (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Baquero, Giselle AAU  - Baquero GAAD  - Heart & Vascular Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey,      Pennsylvania, USA.FAU - Banchs, Javier EAU  - Banchs JEFAU - Depalma, SondraAU  - Depalma SFAU - Young, Sallie KAU  - Young SKFAU - Penny-Peterson, Erica DAU  - Penny-Peterson EDFAU - Samii, Soraya MAU  - Samii SMFAU - Wolbrette, Deborah LAU  - Wolbrette DLFAU - Naccarelli, Gerald VAU  - Naccarelli GVFAU - Gonzalez, Mario DAU  - Gonzalez MDLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110928PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc ElectrophysiolJT  - Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiologyJID - 9010756RN  - 0 (Anti-Arrhythmia Agents)RN  - 0 (Phenethylamines)RN  - 0 (Sulfonamides)RN  - 115256-11-6 (dofetilide)SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic useMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/complicationsMH  - Coronary Artery Disease/complicationsMH  - Death, Sudden, Cardiac/prevention & controlMH  - *Defibrillators, ImplantableMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - Electric CountershockMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/complicationsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Phenethylamines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic useMH  - RecurrenceMH  - Stroke Volume/drug effects/physiologyMH  - Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic useMH  - Tachycardia, Ventricular/*drug therapy/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Fibrillation/*drug therapy/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects/physiologyEDAT- 2011/10/01 06:00MHDA- 2012/07/12 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/30 06:00PHST- 2011/09/28 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2011.02183.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol. 2012 Mar;23(3):296-301. doi:      10.1111/j.1540-8167.2011.02183.x.
