We compared the      prevalence of aortic insufficiency (AI) after HeartMate II (HMII) vs HeartMate      XVE (HMI) support and assessed the role of aortic root diameter and aortic valve       opening in the development of AI. METHOD: Pre-operative and post-operative      echocardiograms of 93 HMI and 73 HMII patients who received implants at our      center between January 2004 and September 2009 were retrospectively reviewed.      After excluding patients with prior or concurrent surgical manipulation of the      aortic valve, with baseline AI, or without baseline echoes, 67 HMI and 63 HMII      patients were studied. AI was deemed significant if mild to moderate or greater.       Pathology reports were reviewed for 77 patients who underwent heart transplant.      RESULTS: AI developed in 4 of 67 HMI (6.0%) and in 9 of 63 HMII patients (14.3%).      The median times to AI development were 48 days for HMI patients and 90 days for       HMII patients. For patients who remained on device support at 6 and 12 months,      freedom from AI was 94.5% and 88.9% in HMI patients and 83.6% and 75.2% in HMII      patients (log rank p = 0.194). Aortic root diameters, as determined by      echocardiography for the patients with AI, trended to be larger at baseline (3.43      +/- 0.43 vs 3.15 +/- 0.40; p = 0.067) and follow-up (3.58 +/- 0.54 vs 3.29 +/-      0.50; p = 0.130) compared with those who did not have AI. Aortic root      circumferences were assessed directly by a pathologist in those patients who      underwent transplant and were significantly larger in HMII patients who had      developed AI compared with those patients who did not (8.44 +/- 0.89 vs 7.36 +/-       1.02 cm; p = 0.034). Lastly, AI was more common in patients whose aortic valve      did not open (11 of 26 vs 1 of 14; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Aortic insufficiency      occurs frequently in patients who receive continuous-flow support with a HMII      LVAD, and may be associated with aortic root diameter enlargement and aortic      valve opening. These findings warrant a more thorough preoperative patient      evaluation and additional studies to investigate the factors, that may be      associated with AI development.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
