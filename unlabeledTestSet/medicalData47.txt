Part I: Exercise therapy.PG  - 27-32AB  - In the present context of an aging population, limited donor heart availability,       improved reliability of mechanical cardiac support and improved patient outcomes,      ventricular assist device (VAD) options to support end-stage heart failure      patients are rapidly expanding. In addition, both the smaller size and lighter      weight of the pumps now produced and early evidence that these third generation      devices may be associated with lower risk of infection and right ventricular      failure will probably lead to greater physician and patient acceptability. This      is the first of a two-part review on the role of cardiovascular prevention and      rehabilitation in patients with VAD. In this first part, we will discuss the role      of exercise therapy in VAD patients, while the second will focus on long-term      management. One of the prerequisites for use of a VAD--whether permanent (as      destination therapy) or semi-permanent (as an alternative to heart      transplantation)--is that exercise capacity, although not normal, must be      adequate for daily life activities. An intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation      program has the potential to increase exercise performance and improve the      quality of life of VAD patients. Both early progressive mobilization and exercise      training may improve the overall condition of VAD patients, and favorably impact       their clinical course.FAU - Corra, UgoAU  - Corra UAD  - Division of Cardiology, Salvatore Maugeri Foundation, IRCCS, Veruno (NO), Italy.       ugo.corra@fsmFAU - Pistono, MassimoAU  - Pistono MFAU - Mezzani, AlessandroAU  - Mezzani AFAU - Gnemmi, MarcoAU  - Gnemmi MFAU - Tarro Genta, FrancoAU  - Tarro Genta FFAU - Caruso, RobertoAU  - Caruso RFAU - Giannuzzi, PantaleoAU  - Giannuzzi PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ItalyTA  - Monaldi Arch Chest DisJT  - Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace       / Fondazione clinica del lavoro, IRCCS [and] Istituto di clinica tisiologica e      malattie apparato respiratorio, Universita di Napoli, Secondo ateneoJID - 9307314SB  - IMMH  - Cardiovascular Diseases/physiopathology/prevention & control/*rehabilitationMH  - *Exercise TherapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansEDAT- 2011/07/15 06:00MHDA- 2011/07/27 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/15 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Monaldi Arch Chest Dis. 2011 Mar;76(1):27-32.
