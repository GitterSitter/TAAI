Left ventricular assist device support may lower it and bridge      patients to heart transplantation. The aim of the study was to investigate the      optimal parameters for treatment decisions and the time course of their potential      reversal to normal values during preoperative inotropic support. METHODS: Mean      pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary      gradient were retrospectively analysed in 120 heart failure patients with severe       pulmonary hypertension (mean age 51.7 +/- 1.1 years, 93.3% males) treated between      2000 and 2009 with inotropes before left ventricular assist device implantation.       The population was divided into three groups: patients with mean pulmonary      arterial pressure > 25 mm Hg (group A, n = 113), patients with pulmonary vascular      resistance > 2.5 Wood units (WU) (group B, n = 75) and patients with      transpulmonary gradient > 12 mm Hg (group C, n = 55). Patients could be assigned       to more than one group. RESULTS: After 24h of inotropic support, pulmonary      vascular resistance decreased (4.1 +/- 0.2 to 3 +/- 0.1, -25%, p<0.001), as did      the transpulmonary gradient (17 +/- 0.5 to 14 +/- 0.7, -18%, p < 0.001). There      was no significant decrease of mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Fifty percent of      patients presented transpulmonary gradient < 12 mmHg on the 3rd day and pulmonary      vascular resistance < 2.5 WU on the 4th day. No further changes were observed in       the following days. Left ventricular assist device support allowed 63 patients to      be listed for heart transplantation and 40 received transplantation. A 30-day      mortality after heart transplantation was higher in patients with fixed pulmonary      hypertension, despite inotropes, than in those with reversible hypertension in      groups B and C (12.5% and 11.1% vs 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Transpulmonary      gradient and pulmonary vascular resistance, but not mean pulmonary arterial      pressure, are predictive parameters for successful heart transplantation in cases      of severe postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. When no significant decrease in      pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient after 3-4 days of      pharmacological therapy is observed, mechanical circulatory support is the only      option to bridge end-stage heart failure patients to heart transplantation.      Survival after heart transplantation is strictly related to the reversibility of       pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient before assist      implantation, but not related to mean pulmonary artery pressure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
