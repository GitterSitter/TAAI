Medical and interventional modalities are      widely used to treat this condition, although the ultimate therapy remains heart       transplantation. Herein we present our clinical experience with 140 patients who       underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. METHODS: Between February 1998 and      September 2010, we transplanted 140 patients with a mean age of 40 +/- 13 years,       including 109 men (77.8%) and 31 women (22%). There were 101 patients (73%) with       dilated cardiomyopathy and 39 (27%) with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two patients      were retransplanted owing to graft failure. Sixteen patients on assist device      support were successfully bridged to transplantation. RESULTS: Eighteen patients       (12.8%) died within 30 days with the most common causes being right ventricular      failure (8/18, 44%) and infection (4/18, 22%). Overall mortality of 39% (55/140)       was most commonly caused by infection (29%, 16/55) or right ventricular failure      (20%, 11/55). Nine patients (16%) died suddenly outside of the hospital. Three      patients died of rejection; 4 of graft failure, and 4 of malignant disease.      CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation remains the standard treatment modality for      end-stage cardiac failure. But significant waiting list mortality rates are due      to the worldwide shortage of donors. Heart transplantation in Turkey is feasible       for a small and strictly selected number of patients with nonreversible      congestive heart failure. In recent years, ventricular assist device applications      have successful bridged subjects to transplantation, saving many patients on      active waiting lists.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
