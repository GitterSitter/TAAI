Mechanical circulatory support frequently improves renal function, but the      impact of pre-MCS renal dysfunction on renal function after cardiac      transplantation (CTX) is unknown. METHODS: Patients with MCS from January 1995      until April 2008 at a single center were included if their MCS duration was at      least 60 days and they underwent successful CTX. Patients were followed for 1      year after CTX. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were included in the study.      Mechanical circulatory support was biventricular assist device in 28% and left      ventricular assist device in 72% (continuous flow left ventricular assist device,      14%). Mean duration of MCS was 124 days. Patients were grouped according to      tertiles of pre-MCS creatinine clearance (CrCl): group 1, CrCl less than 45      mL/min; group 2, CrCl between 45 and 65 mL/min inclusive; and group 3, CrCl more       than 65 mL/min. Group 3 had the best renal outcomes both after MCS and 1 year      after CTX. Regardless of group, patients who had a CrCl of at least 60 mL/min      before CTX had similar 1-year posttransplant CrCl (55 versus 53 versus 56 mL/min       for groups 1 through 3, respectively; not significantly different). However, the       ability to achieve this level of renal function after MCS was less likely in      those with the worst renal function before the initiation of MCS (53% versus 74%       versus 90% for groups 1 through 3, respectively; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use      of MCS leads to improvements in renal function in patients after MCS. However,      the renal outcomes after CTX seem to be more dependent on the level of renal      function achieved during MCS than on the level of renal function before MCS.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
