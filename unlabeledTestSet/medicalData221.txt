METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated model discrimination and      calibration in 215 consecutive ambulatory patients who were presented to the      Cleveland Clinic advanced HF therapeutics committee between 2004 to 2007 for      evaluation for advanced options including transplantation and ventricular assist       device (VAD). Analyses were stratified by committee decision (not listed versus      listed United Network of Organ Sharing [UNOS] Status 2). Eighty-five percent had       1 or no missing SHFM variables. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause       mortality, VAD, or urgent (UNOS Status 1) transplantation. During a median      follow-up of 24 months, 68 died, 18 received VAD support, and 81 underwent heart       transplantation. Discrimination was modest both for those not listed (c-index,      0.683 at 1 year and 0.648 at 2 years), and for those listed UNOS status 2      (c-index, 0.629 at 1 year and 0.628 at 2 years). Calibration was acceptable among      those patients not listed for heart transplantation but with substantial      underestimation of risk (ie, overestimation of survival free of VAD or urgent      transplantation) among UNOS status 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory      patients presented to an advanced HF therapeutics committee for evaluation for      heart transplantation, the SHFM offers modest discrimination of risk for the      primary composite outcome of mortality, VAD, or urgent transplantation, with      underestimation of risk in those patients listed for nonurgent transplantation.      Interpretation of risk prediction by the SHFM in this patient population must be       done with caution.FAU - Gorodeski, Eiran ZAU  - Gorodeski EZAD  - Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant Medicine, Kaufman Center for      Heart Failure, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Ave.,       Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.FAU - Chu, Eric CAU  - Chu ECFAU - Chow, Chen HAU  - Chow CHFAU - Levy, Wayne CAU  - Levy WCFAU - Hsich, EileenAU  - Hsich EFAU - Starling, Randall CAU  - Starling RCLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100826PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
