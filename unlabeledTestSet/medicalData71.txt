Although several risk scores have been proposed, the      relevance and superiority of these predictive models have not been fully      validated in an independent and nonclinical trial-based population. We studied      2,472 consecutive patients initially hospitalized in our institution from April      2004 to December 2009. Risk scores were calculated for each patient using 4 risk       score models, including the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), Acute      Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry regression model, the American      Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure score, and the      Association of Health Aging and Body Composition Heart Failure score. The      predictive ability for the composite end point, including total death, heart      transplantation, and left ventricle assist device implantation, was assessed by      calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for each      model. During the follow-up period after admission (median 924.5 days), the      combined end point occurred in 295 patients (11.8%), including 27 in-hospital      deaths (1.1%). Compared with the other 3 risk score models, the SHFM risk score      demonstrated a greater area under the curve for the combined end point at the      overall, in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up point (0.741 to      0.890). The survival rate predicted by SHFM demonstrated an excellent correlation      with the actual survival rate (R(2) = 0.990). In conclusion, these results      suggest that the SHFM risk score is the most suitable for the discrimination and       calibration of mortality risk stratification in patients with cardiovascular      disease.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
