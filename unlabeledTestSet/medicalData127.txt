However, current technology for controllers and alarm      systems for left ventricular assist devices does not permit their implantation in      eligible patients with visual impairment. We report two patients in whom the      decrease in visual acuity was a significant factor in determining eligibility for      long-term mechanical circulatory support.CI  - (c) 2011 Expert Reviews LtdFAU - Ravi, YazhiniAU  - Ravi YAD  - The Ohio State University Medical Center, N816 North Doan Hall, 410 W 10th      Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.FAU - Firstenberg, MichaelAU  - Firstenberg MFAU - Crestanello, JuanAU  - Crestanello JFAU - Sudhakar, Chittoor B SaiAU  - Sudhakar CBLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Med DevicesJT  - Expert review of medical devicesJID - 101230445SB  - IMMH  - Fatal OutcomeMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Visually Impaired PersonsEDAT- 2011/03/09 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/17 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/09 06:00AID - 10.1586/erd.10.85 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2011 Mar;8(2):155-7. doi: 10.1586/erd.10.85.
