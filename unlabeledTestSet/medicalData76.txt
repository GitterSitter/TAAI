Our aim was to determine the impact       of the type of LVAD and implant era on post-transplant survival. METHODS: In this      study we included 8,557 patients from the registry of the International Society      for Heart and Lung Transplantation. We examined post-transplant outcomes in 1,100      patients bridged to transplant with pulsatile-flow LVADs between January 2000 and      June 2004 (first era), 880 patients bridged with pulsatile-flow LVADs between      July 2004 and May 2008 (second era), and 417 patients bridged with      continuous-flow LVADs in the second era. Patients who required intravenous      inotropes but not LVAD support (n = 2,728) and patients who did not require      either LVAD or inotropes (n = 3,432) served as controls. RESULTS: Post-transplant      survival of patients bridged with pulsatile LVADs improved significantly between       the first and the second era (p = 0.03). In the second era, there was no      significant difference in post-transplant survival of patients bridged with      pulsatile- vs continuous-flow LVADs (p = 0.26), and survival rates in the 2      groups were not statistically different from that of the non-LVAD group. Graft      rejection was similar in patients bridged with LVADs compared to those without      LVADs. CONCLUSIONS: In the most recent era, the use of either pulsatile- or      continuous-flow LVADs did not result in increased post-transplant mortality. This      finding is important as the proportion of patients with LVADs at the time of      transplant has been rising.CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Nativi, Jose NAU  - Nativi JNAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake      City, Utah 84132, USA.FAU - Drakos, Stavros GAU  - Drakos SGFAU - Kucheryavaya, Anna YAU  - Kucheryavaya AYFAU - Edwards, Leah BAU  - Edwards LBFAU - Selzman, Craig HAU  - Selzman CHFAU - Taylor, David OAU  - Taylor DOFAU - Hertz, Marshall IAU  - Hertz MIFAU - Kfoury, Abdallah GAU  - Kfoury AGFAU - Stehlik, JosefAU  - Stehlik JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110514PL  - United StatesTA  - J Heart Lung TransplantJT  - The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the      International Society for Heart TransplantationJID - 9102703SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Graft Rejection/epidemiologyMH  - Heart Failure/*mortality/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*classification/trendsMH  - HumansMH  - International CooperationMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - PrevalenceMH  - Pulsatile FlowMH  - *RegistriesMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/05/17 06:00MHDA- 2011/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/17 06:00PHST- 2011/02/09 [received]PHST- 2011/03/22 [revised]PHST- 2011/03/29 [accepted]PHST- 2011/05/14 [aheadofprint]AID - S1053-2498(11)00907-7 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.03.019 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Heart Lung Transplant. 2011 Aug;30(8):854-61. doi:      10.1016/j.healun.2011.03.019.
