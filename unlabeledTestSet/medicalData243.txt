Although early, non-fatal AEs may increase the      risk of later death during VAD support, this relationship has not been      established. Therefore, we sought to determine the impact on 1-year mortality of       AEs occurring during the first 60 days of VAD support. METHODS: A retrospective      analysis was performed using prospectively collected data from a single-site      database for patients aged > or =18 years receiving left ventricular or      biventricular support during 1996 to 2008 and who survived >60 days on VAD      support. Fourteen major classes of AEs occurring during this 60-day period were      examined. One-year survival rates of patients with and without each major AE were      compared. RESULTS: The study included 163 patients (80% men; mean age, 49.5      years), of whom 87% were European American, 72% had left ventricular support, and      83% were bridge to transplant. The occurrence of renal failure, respiratory      failure, bleeding events, and reoperations during the first 60 days after      implantation significantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality. After      controlling for gender, age, VAD type, and intention to treat, renal failure was       the only major AE significantly associated with later mortality (hazard ratio,      2.96; p = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Specific AEs, including renal failure, respiratory       and bleeding events, and reoperations, significantly decrease longer-term      survival. Renal failure conferred a 3-fold increased risk of 1-year mortality.      Peri-operative management should focus on strategies to mitigate risk for renal      failure in order to maximize later outcomes.CI  - Copyright 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
