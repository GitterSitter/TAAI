We evaluated the blood pressure (BP) response to exercise and       exercise performance in patients with a TAH compared to those with a with a      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS: We conducted a      single-center, retrospective study of 37 patients who received a TAH and 12      patients implanted with an LVAD. We measured the BP response during exercise,      exercise duration and change in tolerated exercise workload over an 8-week      period. RESULTS: In patients with a TAH, baseline BP was 120/69 +/- 13/13,      exercise BP was 118/72 +/- 15/10 and post-exercise BP was 120/72 +/- 14/12. Mean       arterial BP did not change with exercise in patients with a TAH (88 +/- 10 vs 88       +/- 11; p = 0.8), but increased in those with an LVAD (87 +/- 8 vs 95 +/- 13; p <      0.001). Although the mean arterial BP (MAP) was negatively correlated with      metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved during exercise, the association was not      statistically significant (beta = -0.1, p = 0.4). MAP correlated positively with       METs achieved in patients with LVADs (MAP: beta = 0.26, p = 0.04). Despite the      abnormal response to exercise, patients with a TAH participated in physical      therapy (median: 5 days; interquartile range [IQR] 4 to 7 days) and treadmill      exercise (19 days; IQR: 13 to 35 days) early after device implantation, with      increased exercise intensity and duration over time. CONCLUSIONS: During      circulatory support with a TAH, the BP response to exercise was blunted. However,      aerobic exercise training early after device implantation was found to be safe      and feasible in a supervised setting.CI  - 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
