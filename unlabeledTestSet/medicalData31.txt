The aim of the present study was to      investigate the effects of myocardial redox state on the activities of MMP-2 and       -9 implicated in cardiac remodeling in end-stage heart failure patients supported      by left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: During heart      transplant (HT) surgery, myocardial specimens (MS) from right ventricular walls      and LV walls were obtained from 7 LVAD recipients (LVAD group, MS n=35) and from       7 stable HT candidates on medical therapy (MT group, MS n=35). Myocardial MMP-2      and -9 activities and expression, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and -4,      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and aminothiol concentrations were      measured. MMP-2 and -9 activities were evaluated also by incubating MS with      different amounts of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH). MMP-2 and -9      activities and expression were lower in the LVAD group, whereas myocardial TIMP-1      and -4 concentrations were comparable to those of MT patients. Higher GSH and      TGF-beta1 concentrations were found in LVAD-recipients. Only GSH concentrations      were inversely related to MMP-2 and -9 activities. In vitro, GSH had an      inhibitory effect on MMP-2 and -9 activities. CONCLUSIONS: LVAD recipients show      reduced myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression when compared to      medically treated patients. Changes of myocardial redox state, predominantly      GSH-dependent, appear to modulate MMP-2 and -9 activities by an inhibitory effect      dependent on thiol content. These data support a role of GSH cycle in modulating       the extracellular matrix in end-stage heart failure patients supported by LVAD.FAU - Caruso, RaffaeleAU  - Caruso RAD  - CNR Clinical Physiology Institute, Cardiovascular Department, Niguarda Ca Granda       Hospital Milan, Milan, Italy.FAU - Caselli, ChiaraAU  - Caselli CFAU - Boroni, ChiaraAU  - Boroni CFAU - Campolo, JonicaAU  - Campolo JFAU - Milazzo, FilippoAU  - Milazzo FFAU - Cabiati, ManuelaAU  - Cabiati MFAU - Russo, ClaudioAU  - Russo CFAU - Parolini, MarinaAU  - Parolini MFAU - Giannessi, DanielaAU  - Giannessi DFAU - Frigerio, MariaAU  - Frigerio MFAU - Parodi, OberdanAU  - Parodi OLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110804PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683RN  - 0 (TIMP2 protein, human)RN  - 0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)RN  - 127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)RN  - EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)RN  - EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)RN  - EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)RN  - GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Glutathione/metabolismMH  - Heart VentriclesMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolismMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolismMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolismMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardium/*metabolismMH  - Oxidation-ReductionMH  - Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/metabolismMH  - Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/metabolismMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*therapyEDAT- 2011/08/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/14 06:00CRDT- 2011/08/06 06:00PHST- 2011/08/04 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-11-0118 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2011;75(10):2387-96.
