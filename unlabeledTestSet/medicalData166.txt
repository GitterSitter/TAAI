Because all of these devices      require anticoagulation treatment of various intensities, management of major      bleeding can be critical for the overall outcome of the therapy. In this regard,       the newest generation of magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow pumps affords      several potential advantages in terms of thrombogenicity and eventual      discontinuation of anticoagulation treatment. We report the use of a short-term      biventricular assist device (Levitronix CentriMag) for 94 days in a 55-year-old      man with refractory ventricular arrhythmias after combined heart surgery. Despite      serious complications while the patient was on the assist device, including      severe intestinal bleeding with the necessity of discontinuing anticoagulation      for 10 days and, ultimately, hemicolectomy, the circulatory support was completed      with successful heart transplantation.FAU - Netuka, IvanAU  - Netuka IAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine,       Prague, Czech Republic.FAU - Szarszoi, OndrejAU  - Szarszoi OFAU - Maly, JiriAU  - Maly JFAU - Adamira, MarekAU  - Adamira MFAU - Turek, DanielAU  - Turek DFAU - Besik, JosefAU  - Besik JFAU - Urban, MarianAU  - Urban MFAU - Riha, HynekAU  - Riha HFAU - Kotulak, TomasAU  - Kotulak TFAU - Pirk, JanAU  - Pirk JLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Surg ForumJT  - The heart surgery forumJID - 100891112RN  - 0 (Anticoagulants)SB  - IMMH  - Anticoagulants/*therapeutic useMH  - Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/complications/*drug therapyMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Intestinal Diseases/complications/*drug therapyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedEDAT- 2010/12/21 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/19 06:00CRDT- 2010/12/21 06:00AID - P6NU743T7868VL51 [pii]AID - 10.1532/HSF98.20101068 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Surg Forum. 2010 Dec;13(6):E409-10. doi: 10.1532/HSF98.20101068.
