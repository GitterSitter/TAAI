We sought to determine the      pretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital mortality in transplanted       infants in the current era. METHODS: All infants under 12 months of age who      underwent primary heart transplantation during a recent 10-year period      (1999-2009) in the United States were identified using the Organ Procurement and       Transplant Network database. Multivariable logistic regression was used to      identify independent pretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital      mortality. RESULTS: Of 730 infants in the study (median age 3.8 months), 462      (63%) had congenital heart disease, 282 (39%) were supported by a ventilator, 94       (13%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 22 (3%) with a ventricular      assist device at the time of transplantation. Overall, 82 (11.2%) infants died      before their initial hospital discharge. In adjusted analysis, in-hospital      mortality was associated with repaired congenital heart disease (odds ratio [OR],      3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8, 7.2), unrepaired congenital heart disease      not on prostaglandin E (OR, 2.8; CI, 1.3, 6.1), extracorporeal membrane      oxygenator support (OR, 6.1; CI, 2.8, 13.4), ventilator support (OR, 4.4; CI,      2.3, 8.3), creatinine clearance less than 40 mL.min(-1).1.73 m(-2) (OR, 3.1; CI,       1.7, 5.3), and dialysis (OR, 6.2; CI, 2.1, 18.3) at transplantation. CONCLUSIONS:      One in 9 infants undergoing heart transplantation dies before hospital discharge.      Pretranplantation factors associated with early mortality include congenital      heart disease, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support, mechanical      ventilation, and renal failure. Risk stratification for early posttransplant      mortality among infants listed for heart transplantation may improve      decision-making for transplant eligibility, organ allocation, and posttransplant       interventions to reduce mortality.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
