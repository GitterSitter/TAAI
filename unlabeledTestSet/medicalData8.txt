METHODS: We studied myostatin and      IGF-1 expression via Western blot in cardiac tissue at varying degrees of      myocardial dysfunction and after biventricular support in CHD by collecting      myocardial biopsies from four patient cohorts: A) adult subjects with no known      cardiopulmonary disease (left ventricle, LV), (Adult Normal), (n = 5); B)      pediatric subjects undergoing congenital cardiac surgery with normal RV size and       function (right ventricular outflow tract, RVOT), (n = 3); C) pediatric subjects       with worsening but hemodynamically stable LV failure [LV and right ventricle (LV,      RV,)] with biopsy collected at the time of orthotopic heart transplant (OHT), (n       = 7); and D) pediatric subjects with decompensated bi-ventricular failure on      BiVAD support with biopsy collected at OHT (LV, RV, BiVAD), (n = 3). RESULTS: The      duration of HF was longest in OHT patients compared to BIVAD. The duration of      BiVAD support was 4.3+/-1.9 days. Myostatin expression was significantly      increased in LV-OHT compared to RV-OHT and RVOT, and was increased more than      double in decompensated biventricular HF (BiVAD) compared to both OHT and RVOT.      An increased myostatin/IGF-1 ratio was associated with ventricular dysfunction.      CONCLUSIONS: Myostatin expression in increased in CHD, and the myostatin/IGF-1      ratio increases as ventricular function deteriorates. Future investigation is      necessary to determine if restoration of the physiologic myostatin/IGF-1 ratio      has therapeutic potential in HF.FAU - Bish, Lawrence TAU  - Bish LTAD  - Department of Physiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America. bish@mail.med.upenn.eduFAU - George, IsaacAU  - George IFAU - Maybaum, SimonAU  - Maybaum SFAU - Yang, JonathanAU  - Yang JFAU - Chen, Jonathan MAU  - Chen JMFAU - Sweeney, H LeeAU  - Sweeney HLLA  - engGR  - P01-HL059407/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32-HL-007748/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - U54-AR052646/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110913PL  - United StatesTA  - PLoS OneJT  - PloS oneJID - 101285081RN  - 0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)RN  - 0 (Myostatin)RN  - 67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Gene Expression RegulationMH  - Heart Diseases/complications/*congenital/*metabolism/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolismMH  - MaleMH  - *Mechanical ProcessesMH  - Myogenic Regulatory Factors/metabolismMH  - Myostatin/*metabolismMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/complicationsPMC - PMC3172210OID - NLM: PMC3172210EDAT- 2011/09/21 06:00MHDA- 2012/02/04 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/21 06:00PHST- 2011/04/22 [received]PHST- 2011/07/26 [accepted]PHST- 2011/09/13 [epublish]AID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0023818 [doi]AID - PONE-D-11-07106 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e23818. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023818.
