Among patients selected with New York Heart Association functional      class III or IV symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction </= 35% and      electrocardiographic QRS widening of at least 120-130 ms, approximately 60-80% of      patients improved depending on the definition of response used. Although a      reasonable assumption is that electrocardiographic QRS widening is a surrogate      for delays in regional ventricular mechanical activation, a large volume of data       has demonstrated that there is a subset of patients with widened QRS complexes      who have no significant mechanical dyssynchrony. The reason for dissociation of      electrical dispersion and mechanical dyssynchrony is unknown presently, but many       studies have demonstrated the association of dyssynchrony with favorable outcome       following CRT. Perhaps more importantly, several imaging studies (principally by       echocardiography) have shown the lack of baseline mechanical dyssynchrony to be      as a marker for a less favorable outcome after CRT. Recently, the lack of      dyssynchrony before CRT has been shown to be associated with a significantly      lower long-term probability of freedom from death, heart transplantation, or left      ventricular assist device placement. As further mechanistic evidence for the      relationship of mechanical dyssynchrony and LV functional response to CRT, it has      been suggested that patients who failed to improve their tissue Doppler measures       of dyssynchrony after CRT have a lower chance of reverse remodeling. This topic      has been muddled by technical difficulties in measurement of mechanical      dyssynchrony by all imaging approaches, the confounding variable of scar in      ischemic disease, and the widely variable definitions of response used by      different investigators. However, the weight of evidence from a      pathophysiological basis to the recent long-term patient outcome data strongly      support the notion that resynchronization is the principle mechanism of benefit      from CRT.FAU - Gorcsan, John 3rdAU  - Gorcsan J 3rdAD  - University of Pittsburgh, Scaife 564, 200 Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA      15213-2582, USA. gorcsanj@upmc.eduFAU - Yu, Cheuk-ManAU  - Yu CMFAU - Sanderson, John EAU  - Sanderson JELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Fail RevJT  - Heart failure reviewsJID - 9612481SB  - IMMH  - *Cardiac Resynchronization TherapyMH  - Echocardiography, Doppler/methodsMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapy/ultrasonographyMH  - HumansMH  - Ventricular Function, Left/*physiologyEDAT- 2011/07/26 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/24 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/26 06:00AID - 10.1007/s10741-011-9274-y [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2012 Nov;17(6):737-46. doi: 10.1007/s10741-011-9274-y.
