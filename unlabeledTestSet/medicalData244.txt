Implantation of ventricular assist devices (VADs) for circulatory support is      indicated in selected patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart       transplantation, however seldom; improvement of ventricular contractility has      been well documented with prolonged cardiac unloading. The current review      summarizes recent findings from in vitro and in vivo studies, focusing on the      biological features and the possible role of progenitor cells in the transient      myocardial recovery, occasionally seen after VAD implantation, and speculates on       their clinical utilities for the treatment of the failing human heart.FAU - Tsiavou, AnastasiaAU  - Tsiavou AAD  - A' Department Cardiology, Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, 356 Syngrou Ave,      Athens, Kallithea, 17674, Greece.FAU - Manginas, AthanassiosAU  - Manginas ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20091022PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Transl ResJT  - Journal of cardiovascular translational researchJID - 101468585SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cell MovementMH  - Endothelial Cells/immunology/*pathologyMH  - Heart Failure/pathology/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Myocardial ContractionMH  - Myocardium/immunology/*pathologyMH  - PhenotypeMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - RegenerationMH  - Stem Cells/immunology/*pathologyMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeRF  - 64EDAT- 2010/06/19 06:00MHDA- 2010/10/05 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/19 06:00PHST- 2009/08/25 [received]PHST- 2009/10/05 [accepted]PHST- 2009/10/22 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12265-009-9141-6 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2010 Apr;3(2):147-52. doi: 10.1007/s12265-009-9141-6.
