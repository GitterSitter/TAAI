The adult VAD      literature demonstrates that comprehensive programs optimize transplantation      outcomes. The goal of this intervention was to create an interdisciplinary      program to optimize care coordination and delivery in young children requiring a       VAD. METHOD: This study was a case review. RESULTS: We have supported 8 infants      and young children with Berlin Heart VAD. These children's hospitalizations have       been more complex than those of our older VAD patients, and they have required      intensive care for prolonged periods. An interdisciplinary group evaluated our      practices and identified areas for potential improvement. The focus group from      our intensive care unit introduced multiple interventions to optimize      interdisciplinary care coordination and consistency of practice. These included      (1) interdisciplinary care guidelines for chronically, critically ill patients;      (2) institution of a primary cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) physician      and nurse practitioner system; (3) introduction of a psychological intervention      for families to minimize the impact of their extended CVICU stay; (4)      implementation of early jejunal feeds; (5) a focused developmental and      rehabilitation protocol, 6) implementation of a structured approach to minimizing      blood transfusions; (7) increased structure for our interdisciplinary rounds to      optimize team communication; (8) comprehensive nursing education including wound       care, anticoagulation management, and laboratory draws; and (9) a protocol for      off-unit rehabilitative/developmental interventions. These changes in both      practice and approach for young VAD patients have also been of benefit to other      chronically, critically ill children in the CVICU, as well as to our CVICU team.       CONCLUSION: Comprehensive interdisciplinary care coordination and standardized      practice can be achieved in the critical care setting for complex pediatric heart      failure patients who require long-term VAD support.FAU - Staveski, Sandra LAU  - Staveski SLAD  - Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, Palo Alto, California, USA.      sstaveski@lpch.orgFAU - Avery, SonjaAU  - Avery SFAU - Rosenthal, David NAU  - Rosenthal DNFAU - Roth, Stephen JAU  - Roth SJFAU - Wright, Gail EAU  - Wright GELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc NursJT  - The Journal of cardiovascular nursingJID - 8703516SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Comprehensive Health Care/*organization & administration/standardsMH  - Continuity of Patient Care/*organization & administrationMH  - Health Plan ImplementationMH  - *Heart Transplantation/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Intensive Care UnitsMH  - Patient Care Team/*organization & administrationMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Reference StandardsEDAT- 2010/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2011/08/24 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/25 06:00AID - 10.1097/JCN.0b013e3181f29a2e [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2011 May-Jun;26(3):231-8. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0b013e3181f29a2e.
