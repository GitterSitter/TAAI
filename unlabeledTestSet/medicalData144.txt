More patients with mechanical       circulatory support are being discharged from the implanting institution and will      be seen by clinicians outside the immediate surgical or heart-failure team. This       review provides a practical understanding of device design and physiology,      general troubleshooting, and limitations and complications for implantable left      ventricular assist devices (pulsatile-flow and continuous-flow pumps) and the      total artificial heart.CI  - (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Shah, Keyur BAU  - Shah KBAD  - Division of Cardiology, The Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation Program of      Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298-0204, USA.      kshah@mcvh-vcu.eduFAU - Tang, Daniel GAU  - Tang DGFAU - Cooke, Richard HAU  - Cooke RHFAU - Harton, SuzanneAU  - Harton SFAU - Flattery, MaureenAU  - Flattery MFAU - Katlaps, Gundars JAU  - Katlaps GJFAU - Kasirajan, VigneshwarAU  - Kasirajan VFAU - Hess, Michael LAU  - Hess MLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20110209PL  - United StatesTA  - Clin CardiolJT  - Clinical cardiologyJID - 7903272SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/*rehabilitationMH  - *Heart, ArtificialMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansEDAT- 2011/02/11 06:00MHDA- 2011/07/16 06:00CRDT- 2011/02/11 06:00PHST- 2010/03/23 [received]PHST- 2010/07/07 [accepted]PHST- 2011/02/09 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1002/clc.20825 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Cardiol. 2011 Mar;34(3):147-52. doi: 10.1002/clc.20825.
