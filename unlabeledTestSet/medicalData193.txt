We adopted      veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation using the Levitronix      centrifugal pump (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, Massachusetts) as a first-line      treatment of cardiogenic shock in a "bridge to decision" strategy. This article      provides our experience of this clinical approach. METHODS: Since 1988, 160      ventricular assist devices have been implanted at our hospital for heart failure.      Since 2005, 15 consecutive patients have been treated with veno-arterial      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory cardiogenic shock.      Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been implanted either      centrally or peripherally. RESULTS: Mean age was 44.7 +/- 20.0 years (2-78      years). There were 5 women. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was      implanted peripherally in 8 cases (53.4%) and centrally in the remaining 7      (46.6%). Mean veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration was 11.5      +/- 8.1 days (range, 1-30). No patient experienced any neurologic event or      vascular complication at the cannulation site. Twelve patients (80%) were weaned       from veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or bridged to either a      long-term left ventricular assist device or heart transplantation. Three patients      died during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support secondary      to multi-organ failure. Seven patients (46.6%) were discharged from the hospital,      with a 100% survival at follow-up. The survivors include 2 patients affected by      fulminant myocarditis, who were bridged to recovery, and 5 patients who were      bridged to heart transplantation. Survivors were younger than nonsurvivors (mean       age, 28.5 vs 58.8 years, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the use      of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as bridge to decision has      been effective to promptly restore adequate systemic perfusion, allowing further       time to evaluate myocardial recovery or candidacy for ventricular assist device      or heart transplantation. Younger patients, with no or mild end-organ injury, had      the best outcomes. Peripheral cannulation decreases the surgical trauma and makes      emergency implantation possible, even in the intensive care unit.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
