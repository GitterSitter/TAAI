Left ventricular assist devices       (LVADs), by providing significant volume and pressure unloading, allow a reversal      of stress-related compensatory responses of the overloaded myocardium. Herein, we      summarize and integrate insights from studies which investigated how LVAD      unloading influences the structure and function of the failing human heart.      RECENT FINDINGS: Recent investigations have described the impact of LVAD      unloading on key structural features of cardiac remodeling - cardiomyocyte      hypertrophy, fibrosis, microvasculature changes, adrenergic pathways and      sympathetic innervation. The effects of LVAD unloading on myocardial function,      electrophysiologic properties and arrhythmias have also been generating      significant interest. We also review information describing the extent and      sustainability of the LVAD-induced myocardial recovery, the important advances in      understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure derived from such studies,       and the implications of these findings for the development of new therapeutic      strategies. Special emphasis is given to the great variety of fundamental      questions at the basic, translational and clinical levels that remain unanswered       and to specific investigational strategies aimed at advancing the field. SUMMARY:      Structural and functional reverse remodeling associated with LVADs continues to      inspire innovative research. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to      achieve sustained recovery of the failing human heart.FAU - Drakos, Stavros GAU  - Drakos SGAD  - UTAH Cardiac Transplant Program, Division of Cardiology, University of Utah      School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA. stavros.drakos@u2m2.utah.eduFAU - Kfoury, Abdallah GAU  - Kfoury AGFAU - Selzman, Craig HAU  - Selzman CHFAU - Verma, Divya RatanAU  - Verma DRFAU - Nanas, John NAU  - Nanas JNFAU - Li, Dean YAU  - Li DYFAU - Stehlik, JosefAU  - Stehlik JLA  - engGR  - 5R01HL089592-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - C06-RR11234/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL089592/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1-RR025764/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin CardiolJT  - Current opinion in cardiologyJID - 8608087SB  - IMMH  - CardiomegalyMH  - Endothelium, VascularMH  - Extracellular MatrixMH  - FibrosisMH  - Heart Failure/*pathologyMH  - Heart Ventricles/*pathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Microvessels/pathologyMH  - Myocardium/*pathologyMH  - Myocytes, CardiacMH  - Sympathetic Nervous SystemMH  - Ventricular RemodelingPMC - PMC3714229MID - NIHMS480917OID - NLM: NIHMS480917OID - NLM: PMC3714229EDAT- 2011/04/01 06:00MHDA- 2011/08/06 06:00CRDT- 2011/04/01 06:00AID - 10.1097/HCO.0b013e328345af13 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Cardiol. 2011 May;26(3):245-55. doi: 10.1097/HCO.0b013e328345af13.
