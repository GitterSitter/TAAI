Patients (>1 month of age) admitted from 2005      to 2007 with ADHF requiring intravenous vasoactive/diuretic therapy for ADHF were      eligible. Serum NT-pro-BNP levels were obtained within 24 hours of admission and       at prespecified intervals, and clinical caregivers were blinded to these levels.       End points included hospital discharge, death or cardiac transplantation, and      care escalation including the need for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was      noted. Twenty-four patients were enrolled: 22 survived to hospital discharge and       2 died. Ten required MCS (of which 6 underwent cardiac transplantation). Two      patients underwent transplantation without MCS. For the entire cohort, NT-pro-BNP      levels peaked at days 2 to 3 after admission, with a subsequent gradual decrease       until discharge. However, for those who did require MCS, NT-pro-BNP failed to      decrease consistently until after MCS initiation. At discharge, NT-pro-BNP levels      were significantly decreased from admission levels but remained well above normal      for all patients. Single-point NT-pro-BNP levels on admission did not correlate      with independently assessed clinical scores of heart failure severity or predict       the need for MCS in this cohort. In conclusion, serial NT-pro-BNP levels      demonstrated an incremental trend after 48 hours in patients who went on to      require MCS but decreased in all other patients and may therefore assist the      decision to initiate or avoid MCS after admission for pediatric ADHF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
