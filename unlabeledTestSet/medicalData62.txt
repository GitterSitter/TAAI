Concerns include      the patient's adaptation to life on a device and the ethical, clinical, and      practical issues associated with living on mechanical support. On the basis of      our experience treating 175 consecutive VAD patients, we have developed a model      to address the ethical and psychosocial needs of patients undergoing VAD      implantation. Patient preparation for VAD implantation encompasses three phases:       1) initial information regarding the physical events involved in implantation,      risks and benefits of current device technology, and the use of VAD as a rescue      device; 2) preimplant preparation including completion of advance directives      specific to BTT/DT, competency determination, and identifying a patient      spokesperson, multidisciplinary consultants, and cultural preferences regarding      device withdrawal; and 3) VAD-specific end-of-life issues including plans for      device replacement and palliative care with hospice or device withdrawal. This      three-phase 10-point model addresses the ethical and psychosocial issues that      should be discussed with patients undergoing VAD support.FAU - Petrucci, Ralph JAU  - Petrucci RJAD  - Department of Psychiatry, Drexel University College of Medicine/Hahnemann      University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, USA.
