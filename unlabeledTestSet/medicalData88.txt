Accurate       evaluation of RV function in patients with LVAD remains challenging. We      hypothesized that, after LVAD implantation, electrocardiographic-gated cardiac      computed tomography (CCT) allows RV evaluation with higher feasibility and      reproducibility compared with echocardiography. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with      an implanted LVAD who had 2-dimensional echocardiography and CCT evaluation were       studied. RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction were      quantified using CCT. RV fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic      excursion and RV end-diastolic short-to-long axis ratio were calculated by      echocardiography. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman      analysis were used to assess intra- and interobserver reproducibility for all      measurements. RESULTS: The quality of CCT studies was good in all cases except      for one. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility for all CCT measurements was      high (interobserver ICC for RV ejection fraction = 0.89, 95% confidence interval       0.74 to 0.95). Echocardiographic indices of RV function and geometry had lower      reproducibility. The echocardiographic index that best correlated with the      CCT-determined RV ejection fraction was RV fractional area change (r = 0.80, p <       0.001). In addition, CCT detected relevant post-operative findings in 50% of the       patients. CONCLUSIONS: CCT is highly effective and reproducible compared with      echocardiography for the evaluation of RV function in patients with LVAD support       and provides relevant information on post-operative findings. Our results suggest      that CCT should be considered as a useful imaging modality in this clinical      setting.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
