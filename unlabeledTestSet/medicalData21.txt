In      recent years, the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD)      has emerged as a potential treatment option. Systematic data on the safety and      efficacy of the EXCOR are limited. METHODS: The Investigational Device Exemption       (IDE) clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and probable benefit of      the EXCOR to support regulatory review of the device under the Humanitarian      Device Exemption regulation. The study design and rationale are reviewed in light      of the well-described challenges inherent in small population studies. RESULTS:      The Berlin Heart EXCOR IDE clinical study is a prospective, multicenter,      single-arm, clinical cohort study. Children aged 0 to 16 years with severe heart       failure (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support      profile 1 or 2) due to 2-ventricle heart disease and actively listed for HT      comprise the primary study cohort. The control population is a propensity-matched      retrospective cohort of children supported with extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation, the only bridge device available to smaller children before the      EXCOR. The primary efficacy end point is survival to heart transplantation or      recovery. The primary safety end point is the incidence of serious adverse events      as defined by pediatric Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support criteria. The study will enroll a total of 48 subjects in 2      cohorts based on body surface area (cohort 1 <0.7 m(2), cohort 2 0.7-1.5 m(2))      and is powered to show safety superiority to a prespecified performance goal of      0.25 serious adverse events per day of support. Children ineligible for the      primary cohort will still have access to the device in a third compassionate-use       cohort where adverse event data will be collected for additional safety      characterization of the device. CONCLUSION: The Berlin Heart IDE clinical study      will be the first bridge-to-HT VAD study designed exclusively for children. It is      anticipated that the study will provide important information on the safety and      efficacy of the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric in children while providing valuable      lessons into the design and conduct of future VAD studies in children.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Mosby, Inc.
