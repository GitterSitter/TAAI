We present our nearly 20-year experience with      pediatric ventricular assist devices. METHODS: Between 1990 and April 2009,      Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) was implanted in 94      children. Patients were compared according to period of treatment: group I,      implantation between 1990 and 2001 (n = 45), and group II, implantation since      2002 (n = 49). RESULTS: Preoperative serum creatinine (1.2 vs 0.7 mg/dL, P =      .002) and bilirubin (1.5 vs 1 mg/dL, P = .002) were lower in period II, and fewer      patients were artificially ventilated before surgery (26 vs 13, P = .002). In      period I, more patients were supported with biventricular assist devices (64% vs       22.5%, P < .001). Median time on support was shorter in period I (10 vs 40 days,       P < .001). Success (weaning from system or heart transplant) was achieved in 49%       and 69%, respectively (P = .043). Whereas in period I 17% of children younger      than 1 year were discharged home after transplant or weaning, rate during period       II was 93% (P < .001), in particular because of improvement in discharge rate of       patients with postcardiotomy heart failure (13% vs 50%). Rates of pump exchange      for thrombus formation were 0.029/d in period I and 0.014/d in period II (P =      0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Recent results show significant improvements in survival and      discharge rate, especially for children younger than 1 year. Pediatric Berlin      Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device may provide a safe mechanical support      strategy in children with cardiogenic shock.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011.
