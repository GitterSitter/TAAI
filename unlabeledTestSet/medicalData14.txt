Few studies have examined the effect of LVAD therapy on      patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as health status, quality of life, and      anxiety/depression, despite poor PROs predicting mortality and rehospitalization       in patients with heart failure. In this systematic review, we provide an overview      of available evidence on the impact of LVAD therapy on PROs and discuss      recommendations for clinical research and practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: A      systematic literature search identified 16 quantitative studies with a sample      size >/=10 (mean+/-SD age=50.1+/-12.6 years) that examined the impact of LVAD      therapy on PROs using a quantitative approach. Initial evidence suggests an      improvement in health status, anxiety, and depression in the first few months      after LVAD implantation. However, PRO scores of patients receiving LVAD therapy      are still lower for physical, social, and emotional functioning compared with      transplant recipients. These studies had several methodological shortcomings,      including the use of relatively small sample sizes, and only a paucity of studies      focused on anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of studies on       the patient perspective of LVAD therapy. To advance the field of LVAD research      and to optimize the care of an increasingly growing population of patients      receiving LVAD therapy, more well-designed large-scale studies are needed to      further elucidate the impact of LVAD therapy on PROs.FAU - Brouwers, CorlineAU  - Brouwers CAD  - Department of Medical Psychology and Neuropsychology, CoRPS, Tilburg University,       Tilburg, The Netherlands.FAU - Denollet, JohanAU  - Denollet JFAU - de Jonge, NicolaasAU  - de Jonge NFAU - Caliskan, KadirAU  - Caliskan KFAU - Kealy, JenniferAU  - Kealy JFAU - Pedersen, Susanne SAU  - Pedersen SSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20110909PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
