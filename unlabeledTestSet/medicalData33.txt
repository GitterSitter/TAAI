A 2006 report of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood      Institute identified a gap between RV research efforts and its clinical      importance compared with that of the left ventricle. This recent shift in      paradigm is fueled by the prognostic value ascribed to RV failure in HF and      morbidity/mortality after myocardial infarction and surgery. In this review, we      examine the significance of RV failure in the HF setting, its clinical      presentation and pathophysiology, and ways to evaluate RV function using      echocardiographic measurements. Furthermore, we discuss the medical management of      RV failure including traditional therapies like beta-blockers and newer options      like nitric oxide, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and calcium sensitizers.      Mechanical support is also examined. Finally, this review places an emphasis on      RV failure in the setting of left ventricular assist devices and heart      transplantation.FAU - Guglin, MayaAU  - Guglin MAD  - University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA. mguglin@gmail.comFAU - Verma, SameerAU  - Verma SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Fail RevJT  - Heart failure reviewsJID - 9612481SB  - IMMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - Heart Failure/*physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart Ventricles/*physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/physiopathology/surgeryEDAT- 2011/07/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/06 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/29 06:00AID - 10.1007/s10741-011-9272-0 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2012 May;17(3):511-27. doi: 10.1007/s10741-011-9272-0.
