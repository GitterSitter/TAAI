The versatility of the      device makes it ideal for pediatric patients because it can be tailored to the      size and needs of the patient. In this review, we will explore the broad range of      clinical applications of this device including bridge to cardiac transplantation,      bridge to recovery, and bridge to bridge implantation where the need for cardiac       transplantation may be unclear but long-term mechanical support may be required.FAU - Bryant, Roosevelt 3rdAU  - Bryant R 3rdAD  - Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Section, The University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's      Hospital, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. rbryanti@umn.eduFAU - Steiner, MarieAU  - Steiner MFAU - St Louis, James DAU  - St Louis JDLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100904PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Transl ResJT  - Journal of cardiovascular translational researchJID - 101468585SB  - IMMH  - Body SizeMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Infant, NewbornMH  - MiniaturizationMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2010/09/08 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/22 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/08 06:00PHST- 2010/05/10 [received]PHST- 2010/08/18 [accepted]PHST- 2010/09/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12265-010-9218-2 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2010 Dec;3(6):612-7. doi: 10.1007/s12265-010-9218-2.
