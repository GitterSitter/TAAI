Implantation of temporary right ventricular assist      device may be life-saving procedure in various situations of right heart failure       as: heart transplantation, LVAD therapy and post-cardiotomy failure. The aim of      the study is an introduction of the implantation technique and retrospective      review of current experience with the method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since January      2007 isolated right ventricular assist device Levitronix CentriMag has been      implanted in 16 patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups: post      transplantation (post-Tx), post LVAD implantation (post-LVAD) and other cardiac      procedures (OCP). Success rate of weaning from RVAD, 30-days mortality and major       complications has been assessed. OUTCOMES: Distribution of implants in groups      was: post-Tx 5 pts (31%), post-LVAD 6 pts (38%) and 5 in OCP group (31%). The      mean support time was 12 days. Off-pump implantation was achieved in 9 pts. The      device was successfully weaned in 13 (81%) patients. 30-days mortality occurred      in 1 case only. CONCLUSION: Presented outcomes are encouraging for broader      acceptance of the therapy. Excellent success rate has been reached in post-Tx and      post-LVAD. This study emphasises decesive role of proactive approach in early      indication of RVAD implantation for achieving satisfactory results.FAU - Netuka, IAU  - Netuka IAD  - Klinika kardiovaskularni chirurgie, Institut klinicke a experimentalni mediciny,       Praha a Centrum vyzkumu chorob srdce a cev 4, Praha, Ceska republika.      ivne@ikem.czFAU - Maly, JAU  - Maly JFAU - Szarszoi, OAU  - Szarszoi OFAU - Riha, HAU  - Riha HFAU - Turek, DAU  - Turek DFAU - Urban, MAU  - Urban MFAU - Skalsky, IAU  - Skalsky IFAU - Kotulak, TAU  - Kotulak TFAU - Dorazilova, ZAU  - Dorazilova ZFAU - Pirk, JAU  - Pirk JLA  - czePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Technika implantace a zkusenosti s docasnou mechanickou srdecni podporou pri      selhani prave komory.PL  - Czech RepublicTA  - Rozhl ChirJT  - Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnostiJID - 9815441SB  - IMMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/adverse effectsMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/etiology/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/adverse effectsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative CareMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/etiology/therapyEDAT- 2011/06/07 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/23 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/07 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Rozhl Chir. 2011 Feb;90(2):88-94.
