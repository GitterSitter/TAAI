DESIGN:      Among numerous biochemical parameters, we measured serum levels of sodium and      magnesium, the calciotropic hormones parathyroid hormone and      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D as well as fibroblast growth factor-23 (a phosphaturic      hormone) in 305 cardiac transplant candidates. Primary endpoint was a composite      of the need of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), transplantation, or death.      RESULTS: Of the study cohort, 33.4% reached the primary endpoint. In detail, 19%       were transplanted (the vast majority was listed "high urgent"), 8.8% died and      5.6% received MCS implants. As determined by logistic regression analysis, all      aforementioned biochemical parameters were independently related to the primary      endpoint. Results did not change substantially when transplanted patients were      censored. A risk score (0-5 points) was developed. Of the patients who scored 5      points 89.5% reached the primary endpoint whereas of the patients with a zero      score only 3.8% reached the primary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate      that in addition to the well-known predictive value of disturbed sodium      metabolism, derangements in calcium, phosphate, and magnesium metabolism also      predict midterm clinical outcome in end-stage heart failure patients.FAU - Zittermann, ArminAU  - Zittermann AAD  - Clinic for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center North      Rhine-Westphalia, Ruhr University Bochum, Georgstrasse 11, Bad Oeynhausen,      Germany. azittermann@hdz-nrw.deFAU - Fuchs, UweAU  - Fuchs UFAU - Kuhn, JoachimAU  - Kuhn JFAU - Dreier, JensAU  - Dreier JFAU - Schulz, UweAU  - Schulz UFAU - Gummert, Jan FAU  - Gummert JFFAU - Borgermann, JochenAU  - Borgermann JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110912PL  - EnglandTA  - Scand Cardiovasc JJT  - Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJJID - 9708377RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 0 (PTH protein, human)RN  - 0 (Parathyroid Hormone)RN  - 0 (fibroblast growth factor 23)RN  - 1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)RN  - 62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)RN  - 66772-14-3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)RN  - 9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)RN  - I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)SB  - IMMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - Disease-Free SurvivalMH  - FemaleMH  - Fibroblast Growth Factors/bloodMH  - GermanyMH  - Heart Failure/*blood/mortality/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - Logistic ModelsMH  - Magnesium/bloodMH  - MaleMH  - Metabolic Diseases/*blood/mortality/therapyMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Parathyroid Hormone/bloodMH  - Pilot ProjectsMH  - PrognosisMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sodium/bloodMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/bloodEDAT- 2011/09/13 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/07 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/13 06:00PHST- 2011/09/12 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.3109/14017431.2011.611250 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand Cardiovasc J. 2011 Dec;45(6):342-8. doi: 10.3109/14017431.2011.611250.
