Continuous-flow LVADs are      smaller, have a better long-term durability and are associated with better      outcomes. Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used as a temporary       support in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. The aim of this study was       to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mechanical support in acute and critically      ill PPCM patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective search of the patient      database of the Ghent University hospital (2000 to 2010). RESULTS: Six      PPCM-patients were treated with mechanical support. Three patients presented in      the postpartum period and three patients at the end of pregnancy. All were      treated with IABP, the duration of IABP support ranged from 1 to 13 days. An ECMO      was inserted in one patient who presented with cardiogenic shock, multiple organ       dysfunction syndrome and a stillborn baby. Two patients showed partial recovery      and could be weaned off the IABP. Four patients were implanted with a      continuous-flow LVAD (HeartMate II, Thoratec Inc.), including the ECMO-patient.      Three LVAD patients were successfully transplanted 78, 126 and 360 days after      LVAD implant; one patient is still on the transplant waiting list. We observed      one peripheral thrombotic complication due to IABP and five early bleeding      complications in three LVAD patients. One patient died suddenly two years after      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: In PPCM with refractory heart failure IABP was safe      and efficient as a bridge to recovery or as a bridge to LVAD. ECMO provided      temporary support as a bridge to LVAD, while the newer continuous-flow LVADs      offered a safe bridge to transplant.FAU - Gevaert, SofieAU  - Gevaert SAD  - Department of Cardiology, Heart Center, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan      185, 9000 Ghent, Belgium. sofie.gevaert@ugent.beFAU - Van Belleghem, YvesAU  - Van Belleghem YFAU - Bouchez, StefaanAU  - Bouchez SFAU - Herck, IngridAU  - Herck IFAU - De Somer, FilipAU  - De Somer FFAU - De Block, YasminaAU  - De Block YFAU - Tromp, FionaAU  - Tromp FFAU - Vandecasteele, ElsAU  - Vandecasteele EFAU - Martens, FloorAU  - Martens FFAU - De Pauw, MichelAU  - De Pauw MLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110310PL  - EnglandTA  - Crit CareJT  - Critical care (London, England)JID - 9801902SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiomyopathies/*therapyMH  - Critical Care/*methodsMH  - Critical IllnessMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/adverse effectsMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - *Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping/adverse effectsMH  - Peripartum PeriodMH  - PregnancyMH  - Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*therapyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC3219357OID - NLM: PMC3219357EDAT- 2011/03/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2011/03/12 06:00PHST- 2010/12/06 [received]PHST- 2011/02/01 [revised]PHST- 2011/03/10 [accepted]PHST- 2011/03/10 [aheadofprint]AID - cc10098 [pii]AID - 10.1186/cc10098 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Crit Care. 2011;15(2):R93. doi: 10.1186/cc10098.
