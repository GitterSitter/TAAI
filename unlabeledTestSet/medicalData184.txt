Nevertheless, problems of embolic and      bleeding complication, infections, and technical failure still inhibit successful      permanent support. We analyzed the courses of 198 patients who were supported for      >1 year by 12 different MCS devices. Of the 198 patients, 87 had first-generation      MCS devices (pulsatile), 43 second-generation devices (nonpulsatile with standard      bearings), and 68 third-generation devices (nonpulsatile with magnetic bearings),      implanted between July 1994 and March 2009. The mean time on support of the total      group was approximately 2 years (690 +/- 321 [366-1,875] days). Of the first      generation, 83 patients (95%) could be discharged; in the second and third group,      all patients could be discharged. Rehospitalizations were observed in all      patients. Reasons for readmission were coagulation disorders, wound infections,      stroke, and technical failure. Seventy-seven patients received heart      transplantation, 66 are still receiving support, 53 died, and two patients have      been weaned from the device. All types of devices can be used for extended      periods of time. Device- and nondevice-related rehospitalizations were observed      in all three groups of patients. Close outpatient monitoring and support are      crucial to ensure good long-term results.FAU - Drews, ThorstenAU  - Drews TAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin,       Berlin, Germany. drews@dhzb.deFAU - Dandel, MichaelAU  - Dandel MFAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TFAU - Potapov, EvgenijAU  - Potapov EFAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Hennig, EwaldAU  - Hennig EFAU - Lehmkuhl, Hans BrendanAU  - Lehmkuhl HBFAU - Pasic, MiralemAU  - Pasic MFAU - Weng, YuguoAU  - Weng YFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - Embolism/etiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - GermanyMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - Hemorrhage/etiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis FailureMH  - Stroke/etiologyMH  - Surgical Wound Infection/etiologyMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/11/03 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/13 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/03 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181fe2187 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2011 Jan-Feb;57(1):9-16. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181fe2187.
