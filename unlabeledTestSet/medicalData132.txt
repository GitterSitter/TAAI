The increased applicability and excellent       results with LVADs have revolutionized the treatment options available for such      patients. Success with LVADs as bridge-to-transplant therapy has led to their      successful use as an alternate to a transplant (ie, as destination therapy [DT]).      The use of these devices as DT represents a relatively newer but growing      indication. Until recently, most patients who have undergone LVAD implantation      have been supported by pulsatile devices. Newer continuous-flow (CF) pumps have      resulted in superior outcomes, including significantly reduced complication rates      with improved durability over first-generation pulsatile design pumps. However,      as with all new technology, the newer LVADs have introduced management challenges      that were either unimportant or absent with pulsatile LVADs. This article reviews      the current state of left ventricular devices, focusing on the CF pumps that      currently dominate the field, including clinical outcomes, the physiologic and      pathologic effects that are associated with CF pumps, and their unique management      issues and complications.FAU - Caccamo, MarcoAU  - Caccamo MAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of      Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.FAU - Eckman, PeterAU  - Eckman PFAU - John, RanjitAU  - John RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Heart Fail RepJT  - Current heart failure reportsJID - 101196487SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftEDAT- 2011/02/22 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/02 06:00CRDT- 2011/02/22 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11897-011-0050-z [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2011 Jun;8(2):91-8. doi: 10.1007/s11897-011-0050-z.
