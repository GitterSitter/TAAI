The purpose of this      analysis was to determine changes in posttrial outcomes in widespread commercial       use since the clinical trial. METHODS: We compared outcomes of 486 patients who      received a continuous flow LVAD as a bridge to transplantation at 36 centers      during the clinical trial (March 2005 to April 2008) with outcomes of 1,496      posttrial patients who received a continuous flow LVAD at 83 centers (April 2008       to September 2010 as reported to the Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support). RESULTS: Baseline data were comparable between      groups. Cumulative follow-up was 511 and 1,082 patient-years for trial and      posttrial patients, respectively, and average support duration was 12.6 +/- 14.0       and 8.7 +/- 7.1 months. Kaplan-Meier survival improved at 1 year from 76% (trial)      to 85% (posttrial). The percentage of patients undergoing transplantation in the       first year decreased from 48% in the trial period to 39% in the posttrial period.      Quality of life metrics improved by 3 months in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The      survival rate of a large group of continuous flow LVAD patients in a real-world      setting after Food and Drug Administration market approval for bridge to      transplantation has improved since the clinical trial. These data show that      excellent outcomes have been maintained with dissemination of new LVAD technology      from a clinical trial phase to more broad based use in the period after market      approval.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
