We conducted a      randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to determine the effect of iNO on      post-operative outcomes in the setting of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      placement. METHODS: Included were 150 patients undergoing LVAD placement with      pulmonary vascular resistance >/= 200 dyne/sec/cm(-5). Patients received iNO (40       ppm) or placebo (an equivalent concentration of nitrogen) until 48 hours after      separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, extubation, or upon meeting study-defined      RVD. For ethical reasons, crossover to open-label iNO was allowed during the      48-hour treatment period if RVD criteria were met. RESULTS: RVD criteria were met      by 7 of 73 patients (9.6%; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-16.3) in the iNO group      compared with 12 of 77 (15.6%; 95% confidence interval, 7.5-23.7) who received      placebo (p = 0.330). Time on mechanical ventilation decreased in the iNO group      (median days, 2.0 vs 3.0; p = 0.077), and fewer patients in the iNO group      required an RVAD (5.6% vs 10%; p = 0.468); however, these trends did not meet      statistical boundaries of significance. Hospital stay, intensive care unit stay,       and 28-day mortality rates were similar between groups, as were adverse events.      Thirty-five patients crossed over to open-label iNO (iNO, n = 15; placebo, n =      20). Eighteen patients (iNO, n = 9; placebo, n = 9) crossed over before RVD      criteria were met. CONCLUSIONS: Use of iNO at 40 ppm in the perioperative phase      of LVAD implantation did not achieve significance for the primary end point of      reduction in RVD. Similarly, secondary end points of time on mechanical      ventilation, hospital or intensive care unit stay, and the need for RVAD support       after LVAD placement were not significantly improved.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
