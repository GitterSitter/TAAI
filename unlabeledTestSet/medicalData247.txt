Prioritizing recovery may decrease this      trend. Patients were treated with LVAD ventricular decompression, medical heart      failure therapy, and bolus therapy with a beta-agonist before weaning trials.      Devices were removed if adequate function was observed. Eleven patients with a      mean age of 1.7 years presented for LVAD implantation. The mean Z score for left       ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was +5.5 (+1.6 to +7.3), and the mean       fractional shortening was 9% (5%-14%). They were on maximal medical therapy and      inotropic support. Duration of device support ranged from 6 to 22 days (mean: 13       days). There were three deaths, one from preimplant anoxic brain damage and two      from thromboembolism. Eight patients (73%) recovered, were explanted, and are      alive 0.6-6 years with hearts that have a mean Z score for LVEDD of 1.0      (0.09-3.7) and fractional shortening of 23%-36%. Left ventricular assist device      decompression of dilated left ventricles in infants and children led to long-term      survival in 73%. Ventricular size was significantly reduced and contractility      significantly increased. None of these patients required transplantation.FAU - Zimmerman, HannahAU  - Zimmerman HAD  - Marshall Foundation Artificial Heart Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson,      Arizona, USA.FAU - Covington, DianeAU  - Covington DFAU - Smith, RichardAU  - Smith RFAU - Ihnat, ChelseaAU  - Ihnat CFAU - Barber, BrentAU  - Barber BFAU - Copeland, JackAU  - Copeland JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMEIN - ASAIO J. 2010 Sep-Oct;56(5):402.
