MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively       reviewed 3-year surgical data from a large heart transplant facility and      identified obese patients with advanced heart failure who underwent successful      implantation of either the HeartMate XVE((R)) or the HeartMate II((R)) VAD. For      each patient weight and BMI at time of VAD implantation and at 6 months      post-operatively were documented. Between group comparison was achieved with      Student's T tests. RESULTS: We identified 14 patients who had received the      HeartMate XVE and 8 who had received the HeartMate II. At 6 months, patients who       received a HeartMate XVE demonstrated a significant reduction in mean body weight      (249.6 +/- 35.4lbs vs. 217.4 +/- 20.5 lbs; P<0.05), while patients who received      the HeartMate II demonstrated no significant change in weight (234.5 +/- 41.7 lbs      vs. 234.7 +/- 43.0lbs; P=0.3). CONCLUSIONS: The HeartMate XVE results in      significant reductions in weight at 6 months in obese patients with heart failure      while the HeartMate II does not. Further research is necessary to better      understand the effects of VADs on weight loss in obese HF patients.FAU - Thompson, KeithAU  - Thompson KAD  - Cedars Sinai Heart Institute, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.FAU - Dhesi, PavittarpaulAU  - Dhesi PFAU - Nguyen, DavidAU  - Nguyen DFAU - Czer, LawrenceAU  - Czer LFAU - Moriguchi, JamieAU  - Moriguchi JFAU - Schwarz, ErnstAU  - Schwarz ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - PolandTA  - Ann TransplantJT  - Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation SocietyJID - 9802544SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/complications/*surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Obesity/*complications/surgeryMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Weight LossEDAT- 2011/07/01 06:00MHDA- 2011/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/01 06:00AID - 881867 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Transplant. 2011 Apr-Jun;16(2):63-7.
