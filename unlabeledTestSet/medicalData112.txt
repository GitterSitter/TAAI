In end-of-life situations,      decisions must be made about when to deactivate LVAD support. Previous studies      have demonstrated that end-of-life planning, particularly with the use of advance      directives (ADs), can clarify patients' end-of-life preferences when they are      unable to speak for themselves. However, many patients do not have ADs, and among      patients who do, the ADs may lack useful information on how to guide care      surrogates and clinicians regarding patients' preferences on life-sustaining      treatments. The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 68 patients with      advanced heart failure (56 men [82%]; mean [standard deviation] age, 59.0 +/-      12.2 years) who underwent LVAD implantation between March 2003 and January 2009.       The indication for the LVAD was destination therapy in 36 (53%) patients and      bridge to heart transplant in 32 (47%) patients. Overall, 32 (47%) patients had      ADs of varying types; 25 (78%) ADs were completed before LVAD implantation.      Although life-sustaining treatments (eg, tube feeding, cardiopulmonary      resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis) were mentioned, none      explicitly mentioned the LVAD or withdrawal of LVAD support at the end of life.      We hypothesize that if instructions regarding LVAD management in ADs are      explicit, surrogate and clinician distress may decrease, and ethical dilemmas may      be avoided.FAU - Swetz, Keith MAU  - Swetz KMAD  - Division of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.      swetz.keith@mayo.eduFAU - Mueller, Paul SAU  - Mueller PSFAU - Ottenberg, Abigale LAU  - Ottenberg ALFAU - Dib, ChadiAU  - Dib CFAU - Freeman, Monica RAU  - Freeman MRFAU - Sulmasy, Daniel PAU  - Sulmasy DPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Hosp Pract (1995)JT  - Hospital practice (1995)JID - 101268948SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - *Advance DirectivesMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Life ExpectancyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Statistics, NonparametricMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*therapyEDAT- 2011/03/29 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/03 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/29 06:00AID - 10.3810/hp.2011.02.377 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Hosp Pract (1995). 2011 Feb;39(1):78-84. doi: 10.3810/hp.2011.02.377.
