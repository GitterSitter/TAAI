The      goal of this survey was to understand the current staffing environment of HF,      transplant, and mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) programs in the      United States and abroad. This report identifies current staffing patterns but      does not endorse a particular staffing model. METHODS: An online survey, jointly       sponsored by the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), American Heart      Association (AHA), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), was sent to      the members of all 3 organizations who had identified themselves as interested in      HF, heart transplant, or both, between March 12, 2009, and May 12, 2009. RESULTS:      The overall response rate to the 1,823 e-mail surveys was 23%. There were 257      unique practices in the United States (81% of total sites) and 58 international      sites (19%); approximately 30% of centers were in a cardiovascular group practice      and 30% in a medical school hospital setting. The large majority of practices      delivered HF care in both an inpatient and outpatient environment, and slightly      more centers were implanting MCSDs (47%) than performing cardiac transplantation       (39%). Most practices (43%) were small, with <4 staff members, or small- to      medium-sized (34%), with 4 to 10 staff members, with only 23% being medium (11-20      staff) or large programs (>20 staff). On average, a U.S. HF practice cared for      1,641 outpatients annually. An average HF program with transplant performed 10      transplants. Although larger programs were able to perform more transplants and      see more outpatient HF visits, their clinician staffing volume tended to double      for approximately every 500 to 700 additional HF visits annually. The average      staffing utilization was 2.65 physician full-time equivalents (FTEs), 2.21      nonphysician practitioner (nurse practitioner or physician assistant) FTEs, and      2.61 nurse coordinator FTEs annually. CONCLUSIONS: The HF patient population is      growing in number in the United States and internationally, and the clinicians      who provide the highly skilled and time-consuming care to this population are      under intense scrutiny as a result of focused quality improvement initiatives and      reduced financial resources. Staffing guidelines should be developed to ensure      that an adequate number of qualified professionals are hired for a given practice      volume. These survey results are an initial step in developing such standards.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011.
