Twenty      LVAD patients were evaluated prospectively (Jarvik 2000: n = 9, HeartMate II: n =      11). The mean age was 57.7 +/- 14.9 years, and 14 were male. B-type natriuretic      peptide levels were drawn while the patients were supported on LVADs at variable       RPM settings. The RPM settings were correlated with the changes in BNP levels.      Eleven patients underwent LVAD implantation for a lifelong support while the rest      were as a bridge therapy to transplantation. Four patients required LVAD change      out for various causes of pump failure. Postoperative BNP levels decreased      dramatically with the initiation of LVAD support. The levels correlated inversely      with the degree of hemodynamic support rendered at various RPM settings of the      HeartMate II (p < 0.001). Overall, BNP levels decreased significantly in 2 days      after RPM increase. We observed a significant inverse correlation between the      postoperative BNP levels and the degree of LVAD support. The effective LVAD      support seems to result in a marked reduction in BNP levels, and monitoring      serial BNP levels may be helpful in managing patients supported on continuous      LVAD.FAU - Sareyyupoglu, BasarAU  - Sareyyupoglu BAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55205, USA.FAU - Boilson, Barry AAU  - Boilson BAFAU - Durham, Lucian AAU  - Durham LAFAU - McGregor, Christopher G AAU  - McGregor CGFAU - Daly, Richard CAU  - Daly RCFAU - Redfield, Margaret MAU  - Redfield MMFAU - Edwards, Brooks SAU  - Edwards BSFAU - Frantz, Robert PAU  - Frantz RPFAU - Pereira, Naveen LAU  - Pereira NLFAU - Park, Soon JAU  - Park SJLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/blood/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*bloodMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Prosthesis FailureEDAT- 2011/01/20 06:00MHDA- 2011/05/05 06:00CRDT- 2011/01/20 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181f127a7 [doi]AID - 00002480-201011000-00008 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2010 Nov-Dec;56(6):527-31. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181f127a7.
