In addition, all pre-clinical, long-term implantations      performed so far have been carried out in healthy animals, but this does not      reflect the eventual clinical setting. In this study we established a new      technique using a miniaturized axial flow pump in sheep with chronically ischemic      myocardium. METHODS: Sheep (n = 15) underwent intracoronary sphere injection to      create chronic ischemic heart failure. Reduced EF was assessed using      transesophageal echocardiography. All animals underwent implantation of a new      miniaturized axial flow pump via an extraperitoneal, subcostal surgical approach.      RESULTS: Our technique allows easy exposure of the diaphragmatic surface of the      heart and the descending aorta. Ten animals (range 65 to 78 kg) underwent      off-pump implantation 30 (range 25 to 33) days after intracoronary sphere      injection. All animals had significantly reduced EF (25 +/- 4.8%) and were      receiving high doses of inotropic agents to maintain cardiac function. Nine      animals survived the surgical procedure. The average 12-hour blood loss was 435      ml. Cardiac index improved significantly in all animals. The procedure time was      not extended by any adverse events (60 to 145 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: The      extraperitoneal, subcostal surgical approach is less invasive than a median      sternotomy and allows centrifugal or axial to be implanted quickly and without      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Avoiding CPB and an extensive mediastinal      dissection can help to decrease significantly the number of complications in      patients with end-stage organ failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
