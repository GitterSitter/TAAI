We      analyzed whether lower body surface area (BSA) of adult patients affects their      prognosis after listing for heart transplantation (HTx). METHODS: Adult      candidates (>/= 18 and <65 years) for de novo HTx in our center, who were newly      listed as T (transplantable) by Eurotransplant without ventricular assist device       (VAD) support between 2000 and 2009 (n = 545), were studied. The patients were      divided into two groups: group S (n = 272): BSA<1.9563 m(2) (median value of      total patients) and group L (n = 273): BSA >/= 1.9563 m(2). Most female patients       (82/84, 97.6%) belong to group S. Among all these patients, 286 progressed to      critically ill status, that is, they were listed in urgent status or received a      VAD. Actuarial survival rates were studied in each group. RESULTS: Overall      survival rates after listing for HTx in group S were comparable to those in group      L (43.0% vs 43.7% for 7-year survival, p=0.95). However, 1-year survival rate on       waiting list after progression to critically ill status in group S (58.0%, n =      135) and that of female patients in group S (55.8%, n = 33) were significantly      lower than those in group L (67.3%, n = 151, all were men; p = 0.042 and p =      0.044, respectively). After multivariate Cox analysis, BSA<1.9563 m(2) (hazard      ratio 2.120, p = 0.0019), serum creatinine (hazard ratio 1.202, p = 0.033),      obesity defined as body mass index >/= 30 kg m(-2) (hazard ratio 2.043, p =      0.0096) and primary use of VAD (hazard ratio 3.243, p < 0.0001) were identified      as independent risk factors for mortality on waiting list after progression to      critically ill status. One-year survival rate on waiting list after VAD      implantation in group S (44.4%, n = 65) and that of female patients in group S      (38.1%, n = 14) were significantly lower than those in group L (63.0%, n = 78,      all were men; p = 0.020 and p = 0.012, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adult HTx      candidates with lower BSA, including most women, had worse prognosis on waiting      list after progression to critically ill status, especially after VAD      implantation. As almost all HTx are nowadays performed in critical status, this      problem has emerged as important.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
