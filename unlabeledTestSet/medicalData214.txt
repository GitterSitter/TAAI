However, unloading of the heart with a left ventricular assist device      (LVAD) can lead to reversal of many of the remodelling changes even in patients      with advanced heart failure. LVAD unloading can also lead to improved myocardial       function and this improvement can be sufficient to allow removal of the device      leaving the patient to lead a normal life. We review the molecular changes that      have been demonstrated with LVAD unloading in patients bridged to transplantation      and also those that have occurred in the myocardium of patients that have      recovered their myocardial function enough to have the device removed. Changes in      both the myocyte and the matrix are reviewed.FAU - Birks, Emma JAU  - Birks EJAD  - Transplantation and Mechanical Support, University of Louisville, 201 Abraham      Flexner Way, Louisville, KY 40222, USA. e.birks@imperial.ac.ukFAU - George, Robert SAU  - George RSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20100904PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Transl ResJT  - Journal of cardiovascular translational researchJID - 101468585SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Device RemovalMH  - Extracellular Matrix/*metabolismMH  - Heart Failure/metabolism/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolismMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular RemodelingEDAT- 2010/09/08 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/22 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/08 06:00PHST- 2010/06/07 [received]PHST- 2010/08/20 [accepted]PHST- 2010/09/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12265-010-9220-8 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2010 Dec;3(6):635-42. doi: 10.1007/s12265-010-9220-8.
