However, ECLS is      typically not used as a bridge to heart transplantation because of the limited      duration of ECLS. In France, high-urgency priority heart transplantation remains       a possibility for transplant patients who are on ECLS. In this article, we      present our experience with high-urgency priority heart transplantation after      ECLS. From July 2004 to December 2009, 242 patients underwent emergent ECLS.      Heart transplantation was performed in eight of these patients. Time of ECLS was       6.3 +/- 4.6 d. Before heart transplantation, all patients on ECLS had decreased      organ dysfunctions and four were conscious. Despite frequent post-operative      complications, no death occurred during the first year after transplantation. In       our experience, ECLS is a valid method of supporting patients awaiting      high-urgency heart transplantation and can be used as a short-term bridge to      heart transplantation.CI  - (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Barth, EmelineAU  - Barth EAD  - Pole Cardiovasculaire et Thoracique, Clinique de Cardiologie, Hopital A.
