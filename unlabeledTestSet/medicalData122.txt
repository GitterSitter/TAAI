We describe a 36-year-old man with no significant medical       history who presented with flu-like symptoms of 3-week duration. When he sought      medical attention, he was already manifesting heart failure secondary to      fulminant myocarditis, along with multiorgan failure. Despite aggressive      management, including circulatory support with a catheter-based mechanical      cardiac assist device (Impella 2.5 Cardiac Assist Device, Abiomed, Danvers, MA)      as a bridge to cardiac transplant, and aggressive antiviral and antibacterial      therapy, the patient died of cardiac arrest. An H1N1 polymerase chain reaction      postmortem assay produced positive results, and a diagnosis of fulminant viral      myocarditis and multiorgan system failure was established.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
