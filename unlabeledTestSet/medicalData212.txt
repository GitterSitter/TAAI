To address this growing      need, we are developing a collapsible, percutaneously-inserted, axial flow blood       pump to support the cavopulmonary circulation in Fontan patients. During the      first phase of development, the design and experimental evaluation of an axial      flow blood pump was performed. We completed numerical modeling of the pump using       computational fluid dynamics analysis, hydraulic testing of a plastic pump      prototype, and blood bag experiments (n=7) to measure the levels of hemolysis      produced by the pump. Statistical analyses using regression were performed. The      prototype with a 4-bladed impeller generated a pressure rise of 2-30 mmHg with a       flow rate of 0.5-4 L/min for 3000-6000 RPM. A comparison of the experimental      performance data to the numerical predictions demonstrated an excellent agreement      with a maximum deviation being less than 6%. A linear increase in the plasma-free      hemoglobin (pfHb) levels during the 6-h experiments was found, as desired. The      maximum pfHb level was measured to be 21 mg/dL, and the average normalized index       of hemolysis was determined to be 0.0097 g/100 L for all experiments. The      hydraulic performance of the prototype and level of hemolysis are indicative of      significant progress in the design of this blood pump. These results support the       continued development of this intravascular pump as a bridge-to-transplant,      bridge-to-recovery, bridge-to-hemodynamic stability, or bridge-to-surgical      reconstruction for Fontan patients.FAU - Throckmorton, Amy LAU  - Throckmorton ALAD  - Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Engineering, Virginia      Commonwealth University, 401 West Main Street, Rm.
