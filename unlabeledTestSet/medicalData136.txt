Circulatory mechanical support is sometimes required for this      devastating condition. We analyzed our experience in managing AFM with mechanical      circulatory support. METHODS: We applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation      (ECMO) as a first-line rescue for AFM. The diagnosis was mainly derived from      clinical results and biopsy. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled in the       age range of 29.6 +/- 18.6 years and the pediatric group (< 18 years) comprised      32% (n = 24) of our patient group. Thirty-five patients (47%) underwent      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before ECMO. The indication for ECMO included      high inotropic support 69% (n = 54) and continuous CPR at ECMO setup 31% (n =      23). The ECMO duration was 171 +/- 121 h. Survival to discharge was 64% (n = 48),      61% in adult group, and 70.8% in pediatric group. Six patients were later bridged      to ventricular assist device use (5 left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 1      bi-ventricular assist device (BVAD)) but three died of multiple-organ failure.      Three patients (4%) underwent heart transplantation and all of them survived to      discharge. Resuscitation did not have a significant factor for survival. Only two      patients (3%) developed late mortality due to a cardiac event. CONCLUSIONS: AFM      still carries high mortality rates in spite of advanced mechanical support. Most       of the survivors did not require transplantation and could return to good      lifestyle. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, ECMO can be a first-line tool      to rescue this group of patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
