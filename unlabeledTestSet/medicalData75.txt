We analyzed our center's results      following implantation of a biventricular assist device (BVAD). METHODS: We      implanted 39 BVADs between September 2001 and January 2009. All patients were      qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organ available at      time of BVAD implantation. Fifteen patients without a history of chronic      cardiomyopathy suffered from acute BV failure (group 1), whereas the other 24      suffered from severe chronic cardiomyopathy (group 2). The indication for BVAD      implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degree of      end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was      a candidate for bridge to recovery. RESULTS: Both groups were similar regarding      their preoperative hemodynamics, intraoperative and early postoperative findings,      and adverse events. Patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37+/-17 years)      than those in group 2 (51+/-12 years). Mean duration of support in group 1 was      137+/-109 days, and 65+/-61 days in group 2. In group 1, 33% (5/15) were weaned      off the device and 53% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24      patients (42%) in the chronic group were transplanted. Group 1's mortality on the      device was lower than that of group 2 (13% vs 67%). Furthermore, 11 patients of      group 1 survived for 1 year compared with four in group 2 (73% vs 17%).      CONCLUSION: Implantation of a BVAD in patients with chronic heart failure and      acute decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. By      contrast, BVAD implantation can achieve excellent results in patients with acute       BV failure without a history of chronic cardiomyopathy, even if they are in      cardiogenic shock upon admission.FAU - Brehm, KerstinAU  - Brehm KAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, University Heart Center Freiburg-Bad      Krozingen, Freiburg, Germany. kerstin.brehm@uniklinik-freiburg.deFAU - Heilmann, ClaudiaAU  - Heilmann CFAU - Siepe, MatthiasAU  - Siepe MFAU - Benk, ChristophAU  - Benk CFAU - Beyersdorf, FriedhelmAU  - Beyersdorf FFAU - Schlensak, ChristianAU  - Schlensak CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Bilirubin/bloodMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - ChildMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Intraoperative Care/methodsMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative Hemorrhage/etiologyMH  - Preoperative PeriodMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC3241088OID - NLM: PMC3241088EDAT- 2011/05/20 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/02 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/20 06:00AID - j.ejcts.2011.04.002 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.04.002 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jan;41(1):207-12; discussion 212. doi:      10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.04.002.
