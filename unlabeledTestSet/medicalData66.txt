Patient-specific risk factors have yet to      be consistently identified in a large, multicenter registry, which may underlie      the poorer outcomes for BiVAD patients. The Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) is a registry of U.S. Food and Drug      Administration-approved durable MCS devices used for bridge-to-transplantation,      destination therapy, or recovery. The purposes of this study were to 1) identify       the underlying pre-implant characteristics of the population requiring BiVAD      support that contribute to reduced survival, and 2) identify differences in      postoperative outcomes with respect to adverse events compared with patients      supported with LVAD alone. METHODS: From June 2006 to September 2009, 1,646      patients were entered into the INTERMACS database in which adverse events and      outcomes were recorded for primary implants with LVAD or BiVAD. Competing      outcomes methodology was used to estimate the time-related probability of death,       transplant, or recovery. Overall survival for all groups was analyzed with      Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional regression analysis. RESULTS: The      distribution of primary device implants included 1,440 LVADs and 206 BiVADs.      BiVAD patients presented with a lower INTERMACS profile 93% in INTERMACS 1 or 2,       compared with 73% for LVAD patients (p < 0.001). Survival at 6 months was 86% for      LVADs and 56% for BiVADs (p < .0001). Adverse event rates, expressed as      episodes/100 patient-months for the BiVAD group compared with LVAD, were      significantly higher for infection (33.2 vs 14.3), bleeding (71.6 vs 15.5),      neurologic events (7.9 vs 2.6), and for device failure (4.9 vs 2.0). CONCLUSIONS:      Patients requiring BiVAD support at the time of durable MCS implant are more      critically ill at the time of MCS implant. BiVAD patients experience worse      survival than patients supported with LVAD alone and higher rates of serious      adverse events. Characteristics of the population present at the time of BiVAD      implant likely influence post-implant MCS outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
