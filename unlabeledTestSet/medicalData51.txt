The success of the      pulsatile 70 cc stroke volume left ventricular assist device (LVAD) developed by       Penn State has led to the development of a 50 cc stroke volume pump for use in      patients with smaller chest cavities to benefit a larger patient population. The       initial 50 cc pump shows regions of in vivo thrombus formation, which correlate      to low wall shear rates within the device. In an in vitro evaluation of three new      designs (V-2, V-3, and V-4) of the 50 cc LVAD, identical except for the location       and orientation of their outlet ports, particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used      to capture planar flow field data within the pumps. V-2 has an outlet port that      is located parallel to the inlet. In V-3, the outlet port is rotated away from      the inlet port, with the intention of minimizing the amount of fluid turning      needed to exit the device. With V-4 the outlet port is moved to the center of the      pump to prolong the desirable rotational flow. PIV data were taken at six planar       locations within the pump. Although the modifications to the outlet port      locations serve their intended purpose, they also introduce unwanted changes in      the flow. Poorer wall washing and weaker rotational flow are observed with V-3      and V-4. Although the differences between the devices are subtle, the device that      has the most desirable flow characteristics is V-2.FAU - Nanna, Jason CAU  - Nanna JCAD  - Department of Bioengineering, the Pennsylvania State University, University Park,      Pennsylvania 16802, USA.FAU - Wivholm, Jennifer AAU  - Wivholm JAFAU - Deutsch, StevenAU  - Deutsch SFAU - Manning, Keefe BAU  - Manning KBLA  - engGR  - HL60276/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL060276/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL060276-08A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - Biomedical Engineering/methodsMH  - Blood Flow VelocityMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Materials TestingMH  - Pulsatile FlowMH  - Rheology/methodsMH  - Shear StrengthMH  - Stress, MechanicalPMC - PMC3163059MID - NIHMS305188OID - NLM: NIHMS305188OID - NLM: PMC3163059EDAT- 2011/07/08 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/24 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/08 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318224e20b [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2011 Sep-Oct;57(5):349-57. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318224e20b.
