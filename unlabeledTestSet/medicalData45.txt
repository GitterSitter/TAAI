BACKGROUND: Vascular remodeling is a crucial compensatory mechanism      in chronic HF. The angiogenic ligand PlGF and its target receptor fms-like      tyrosine kinase 1 modulate vascular growth and function, but their relevance in      human HF is undefined. METHODS: We measured plasma PlGF and sFlt-1 in 1,403      patients from the Penn Heart Failure Study, a multicenter cohort of chronic      systolic HF. Subjects were followed for death, cardiac transplantation, or      ventricular assist device placement over a median follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS:       The sFlt-1 was independently associated with measures of HF severity, including      New York Heart Association functional class (p < 0.01) and B-type natriuretic      peptide (p < 0.01). Patients in the 4th quartile of sFlt-1 (>379 pg/ml) had a      6.17-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes (p < 0.01). This association was      robust, even after adjustment for the Seattle Failure Model (hazard ratio: 2.54,       95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76 to 2.27, p < 0.01) and clinical confounders      including HF etiology (hazard ratio: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.63, p = 0.03).      Combined assessment of sFlt-1 and B-type natriuretic peptide exhibited high      predictive accuracy at 1 year (area under the receiver-operator characteristic      curve: 0.791, 95% CI: 0.752 to 0.831) that was greater than either marker alone      (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). In contrast, PlGF was not an independent      marker of disease severity or outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a role       for sFlt-1 in the biology of human HF. With additional study, circulating sFlt-1       might emerge as a clinically useful biomarker to assess the influence of vascular      remodeling on clinical outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
