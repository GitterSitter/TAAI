Connecting these cannulae to either atria or       ventricles induces major changes in flow dynamics; however, there are little data      available on precise quantification of these changes. The objective of this      investigation was to quantify the difference in ventricular/vascular hemodynamics      during a range of left heart failure conditions with either atrial (AC) or      ventricular (VC) inflow cannulation in a mock circulation loop with a rotary left      VAD. Ventricular ejection fraction (EF), stroke work, and pump flow rates were      found to be consistently lower with AC compared with VC over all simulated heart       failure conditions. Adequate ventricular ejection remained with AC under low      levels of mechanical support; however, the reduced EF in cases of severe heart      failure may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. AC is therefore more      suitable for class III, bridge to recovery patients, while VC is appropriate for       class IV, bridge to transplant/destination patients.CI  - (c) 2010, Copyright the Authors.
