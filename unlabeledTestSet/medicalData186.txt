In      acute situation, ECMO allows stabilization of unstable hemodynamic situation      related to cardiogenic shock. In patients who require longer term support, the      use of continuous flow pumps is associated with better survival and better      quality of life. Those pumps can be used either as a bridge to transplantation or      as a bridge to recovery but also as destination therapy. Early implantation      before occurrence of severe right heart failure allows preferential use of LVAD.       Approximately 350 cardiac transplantations are performed every year in France.      Indication in based on several criteria appreciating the severity of functional      impairment. Contra-indications have to be discussed case by case, and chronologic      age should not be a too rigid limit. High urgency list allows transplanting the      sickest patients in priority. Conditional half-life in patients surviving the      first year post transplantation is 12 years. Mechanical circulatory support and      cardiac transplantation should be used as complementary treatment of severe heart      failure in order to avoid progressive but sometime irreversible deterioration of       patients with chronic heart failure.FAU - Leprince, PascalAU  - Leprince PAD  - Service de chirurgie thoracique et cardiovasculaire, Groupe hospitalier La      Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, 75013 Paris. pascal.leprince@psl.aphp.frLA  - frePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Traitements non medicamenteux de l'insuffisance cardiaque: assistance      circulatoire et transplantation cardiaque.PL  - FranceTA  - Rev PratJT  - La Revue du praticienJID - 0404334SB  - IMMH  - Disease ProgressionMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/mortality/surgery/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2010/11/03 06:00MHDA- 2010/12/14 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/02 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Rev Prat. 2010 Sep 20;60(7):951-4.
