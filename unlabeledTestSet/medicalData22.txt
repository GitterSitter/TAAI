Our decision to offer MCS for      nontransplant candidates has led to their reevaluation after a period of left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. METHODS: From 2001 to September 2009,      we had 37 patients who received an implantable LVAD, 22 (59%) were not deemed to       be transplant eligible at the time of LVAD insertion (bridge to candidacy, BTC      group). RESULTS: Fifteen (41%) patients were considered transplant eligible      (bridge to transplant, BTT group) at the time of device insertion and received a       HeartMate XVE (n = 7), HeartMate 2 (n = 7), or a Novacor LVAS (n = 1). In the BTC      group, patients received the HeartMate XVE device (n = 11), HeartMate 2 (n = 5),       or the Novacor LVAS (n = 6). The primary criterion for transplant ineligibility      was refractory pulmonary hypertension (PH) in 18 patients, 3 patients did not      meet our body mass index criteria (>35 kg/m(2)), and 2 patients were      dialysis-dependent. Six (27%) BTC patients died on support. Overall, 16/22      patients (73%) were subsequently listed for transplantation, with one listed for       combined heart-lung due to refractory PH. Twelve patients (75%) underwent      successful heart transplantation. Three patients died during their transplant.      Overall posttransplant survival at one year shows lower survival in the BTC group      compared to the BTT group (67% vs. 100%, p = 0.05). At two years and three years       the survival was lower, but not statistically different (BTC vs. BTT: 67% vs. 90%      and 64% vs. 87%, respectively, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: MCS can successfully convert      a large proportion of transplant-ineligible patients into acceptable candidates.CI  - (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Elhenawy, Abdelsalam MAU  - Elhenawy AMAD  - Heart Transplant Program, Peter Munk Cardiac Center, Toronto General Hospital,      University Health Network, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.FAU - Algarni, Khaled DAU  - Algarni KDFAU - Rodger, MarnieAU  - Rodger MFAU - Maciver, JaneAU  - Maciver JFAU - Maganti, ManjulaAU  - Maganti MFAU - Cusimano, Robert JAU  - Cusimano RJFAU - Yau, Terrence MAU  - Yau TMFAU - Delgado, Diego HAU  - Delgado DHFAU - Ross, Heather JAU  - Ross HJFAU - Rao, VivekAU  - Rao VLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110828PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methods/mortalityMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Ontario/epidemiologyMH  - *Patient SelectionMH  - Preoperative Care/*methodsMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Survival Rate/trendsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/09/03 06:00MHDA- 2012/02/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/03 06:00PHST- 2011/08/28 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2011.01310.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2011 Sep;26(5):542-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2011.01310.x.
