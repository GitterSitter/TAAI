With decreasing heart transplant rates worldwide organ preserving      therapies become, again, of interest. The purpose of the present review is to      examine the potential challenges of surgical therapies in patients with end-stage      heart failure. RECENT FINDINGS: The gold-standard for end-stage heart failure is       and will be cardiac transplantation. However, due to organ shortage this therapy       is limited to a few patients. Therefore implantation of ventricular assist      devices (VADs) or long-term minimal-invasive partial support devices will      increase. Improvements in device design with smaller devices, easier implantation      techniques, and modified anticoagulation outcome and long-term success will      likely improve. In addition, good quality of life as destination therapy is      almost available. Organ conservation surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting and      surgical ventricular restoration or surgical repair of mitral valve      regurgitation) in end-stage heart failure patients could not prove the expected      results. Transcatheter or minimal-invasive approaches of these therapies might      become routine in the near future. SUMMARY: Due to the overwhelming outcome      rates, cardiac transplantation is the most established surgical therapy for      end-stage heart failure. VAD therapy is increasing and minimized VADs might      further open the market for destination therapy/permanent support.FAU - Klotz, StefanAU  - Klotz SAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital Muenster,       Muenster, Germany. stefan.klotz@ukmuenster.deFAU - Scheld, Hans HAU  - Scheld HHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin AnaesthesiolJT  - Current opinion in anaesthesiologyJID - 8813436SB  - IMMH  - Coronary Artery BypassMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Mitral Valve/surgeryEDAT- 2010/11/19 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/17 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/19 06:00AID - 10.1097/ACO.0b013e328340ff64 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Anaesthesiol. 2011 Feb;24(1):86-91. doi: 10.1097/ACO.0b013e328340ff64.
