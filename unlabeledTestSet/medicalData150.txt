METHODS: We compared       the survival outcomes, quality of life, and adverse events in 465 patients (104      women, 361 men) with advanced systolic heart failure in their first 18 months of       support with the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) continuous-flow      LVAD for bridge to transplantation. RESULTS: During the first 18 months, there      were no differences in survival between women and men while on LVAD support (73%       +/- 3% vs 73% +/- 5%, p = 0.855) but fewer women (40%) underwent heart      transplantation than did men (55%; p = 0.001). More women continued on support      after 18 months (p = 0.007). Median duration of support was 238 days for women      and 184 days for men (p = 0.003). Mortality was 20% for women and 19% for men (p       = 0.89). Adverse events were similar, with the exception of hemorrhagic stroke,      which occurred more frequently in women (0.10 vs 0.04 events/patient-year, p =      0.02), and device-related infections, which occurred less frequently in women      (0.23 vs 0.44, p = 0.006). Functional capacity and quality of life at 6 months      improved significantly in women and men. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous-flow left      ventricular assistance as a bridge to transplantation is associated with similar       survival rates in women and men. Differences observed in higher stroke rates and       fewer infections among women require further study.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
