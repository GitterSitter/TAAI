The number of VAD implantations is growing      worldwide. Between July 1987 and July 2010, we implanted 1,598 VADs in 1,455      patients. The majority were male (81.0%), and their mean age was 49.4 years      (range 0.3-82 years). Indications for implantation were: cardiomyopathy (n =      1,074), post-cardiotomy heart failure (n = 282), acute myocardial infarction (n =      83), graft failure after heart transplantation (n = 64), and others (n = 61). In       55.5%, the VAD implanted was left ventricular, in 39.5% biventricular, and in      4.8% right ventricular. Until 1995, the implanted pumps were mostly pulsatile.      Today, however, more than 95% of the implanted VADs are continuous-flow rotary      pumps. The average support time was 148.6 days (range 0-1,836 days). The      percentage of biventricular VADs has dropped over the years to 20% in 2009. Three      hundred forty-seven patients could be successfully bridged to heart      transplantation. In 122 patients (8.3%), the device could be explanted after      myocardial recovery. In 2009, 31.4% of the patients were implanted for permanent       support. During the study period, 521 patients could be discharged home or to a      rehabilitation center. Implantation of ventricular assist devices is now an      established treatment for patients with both acute and chronic end-stage heart      failure. Small implantable left ventricular assist devices of the second and      third generation are now broadly employed worldwide, with growing acceptance and       decreasing complications. The percentage of biventricular support has dropped      over the years to 20%.FAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TAD  - Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery,       Germany. krabatsch@dhzb.deFAU - Schweiger, MartinAU  - Schweiger MFAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Kukucka, MarianAU  - Kukucka MFAU - Vierecke, JulianeAU  - Vierecke JFAU - Lehmkuhl, Hans BAU  - Lehmkuhl HBFAU - Huebler, MichaelAU  - Huebler MFAU - Hennig, EwaldAU  - Hennig EFAU - Potapov, EvgenijAU  - Potapov EFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110311PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc Transl ResJT  - Journal of cardiovascular translational researchJID - 101468585SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Germany/epidemiologyMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/*trendsMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - MiniaturizationMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/03/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/17 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/12 06:00PHST- 2010/09/10 [received]PHST- 2011/02/24 [accepted]PHST- 2011/03/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12265-011-9268-0 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2011 Jun;4(3):332-9. doi: 10.1007/s12265-011-9268-0.
