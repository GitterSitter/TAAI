AIM: To      assess the effect of VAD on outcomes of heart transplantation in children.      METHODS: Between October 1988 and June 2009, a consecutive series of 95 children       (mean age 8.6 + or - 6.7 years, range 5 days-17.9 years) underwent heart      transplantation: patients in group 1 (n = 11) received VAD as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation (left ventricular VAD in 4, biventricular VAD in 7), and patients      in group 2 (n = 84) underwent heart transplantation without previous cardiac      support using VAD. The indication for heart transplantation was      cardiomyopathy/myocarditis in 66 (69.5%) of children and congenital heart disease      in 29 (30.5%) patients. RESULTS: Congenital heart disease was diagnosed more      often in group 2 than in group 1 (p = 0.047). The two groups did not differ      significantly with respect to age, weight and parameters of preoperative liver      and kidney function (except for aspartate aminotransferase activity, p = 0.020).       The mean waiting time for transplantation was 64.2 + or - 87.4 days (range 1-443       days) and did not differ between the groups. The mean follow-up was 6.8 + or -      5.4 years (range 1 day-17.6 years). Mortality during long-term follow-up was 9.1%      (n = 1) in group 1 and 20.2% (n=17) in group 2 (p = 0.632). We found no      significant differences in postoperative ventilatory support time (p = 0.773),      duration of hospital stay (p = 0.853), and incidence of acute rejection episodes       (p = 0.575). CONCLUSIONS: The use of VAD as a bridge to heart transplantation in       children with severe heart failure had no negative effect on treatment outcomes.FAU - Januszewska, KatarzynaAU  - Januszewska KAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munchen, Germany.      mijanusz@cyf-kr.edu.plFAU - Malec, EdwardAU  - Malec EFAU - Birnbaum, JuliaAU  - Birnbaum JFAU - Loeff, MarkusAU  - Loeff MFAU - Sodian, RalfAU  - Sodian RFAU - Schmitz, ChristophAU  - Schmitz CFAU - Netz, HeinrichAU  - Netz HFAU - Reichart, BrunoAU  - Reichart BLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - PolandTA  - Kardiol PolJT  - Kardiologia polskaJID - 0376352SB  - IMCIN - Kardiol Pol. 2010 Jun;68(6):670-1.
