In the case of      refractory LCO, extra corporeal life support (ECLS) extra corporeal membrane      oxygenation (ECMO) or ventricle assist devices (VAD) is the final therapeutic      option. In the present study we have reviewed the outcomes of pediatric patients       after corrective surgery necessitating ECLS and compared outcomes with pediatric       patients necessitating ECLS because of dilatated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS: A      retrospective single-centre cohort study was evaluated in pediatric patients,      between 1991 and 2008, that required ECLS. A total of 48 patients received ECLS,       of which 23 were male and 25 female. The indications for ECLS included CHD in 32       patients and DCM in 16 patients. RESULTS: The mean age was 1.2 +/- 3.9 years for       CHD patients and 10.4 +/- 5.8 years for DCM patients. Twenty-six patients      received ECMO and 22 patients received VAD. A total of 15 patients out of 48      survived, 8 were discharged after myocardial recovery and 7 were discharged after      successful heart transplantation. The overall mortality in patients with      extracorporeal life support was 68%. CONCLUSION: Although the use of ECLS shows a      significantly high mortality rate it remains the ultimate chance for children.      For better results, ECLS should be initiated in the operating room or shortly      thereafter. Bridge to heart transplantation should be considered if there is no      improvement in cardiac function to avoid irreversible multiorgan failure (MFO).FAU - Coskun, Kasim OAU  - Coskun KOAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Gottingen,      Gottingen, Germany.FAU - Coskun, Sinan TAU  - Coskun STFAU - Popov, Aron FAU  - Popov AFFAU - Hinz, JoseAU  - Hinz JFAU - El-Arousy, MahmoudAU  - El-Arousy MFAU - Schmitto, Jan DAU  - Schmitto JDFAU - Kececioglu, DenizAU  - Kececioglu DFAU - Koerfer, ReinerAU  - Koerfer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20101117PL  - EnglandTA  - J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Journal of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101265113SB  - IMMH  - Cardiac Output, Low/etiology/*therapyMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*adverse effectsMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/therapyMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/adverse effects/mortalityMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Defects, Congenital/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - *Life Support CareMH  - MalePMC - PMC2993705OID - NLM: PMC2993705EDAT- 2010/11/19 06:00MHDA- 2011/01/21 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/19 06:00PHST- 2010/06/29 [received]PHST- 2010/11/17 [accepted]PHST- 2010/11/17 [aheadofprint]AID - 1749-8090-5-112 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1749-8090-5-112 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Cardiothorac Surg. 2010 Nov 17;5:112. doi: 10.1186/1749-8090-5-112.
