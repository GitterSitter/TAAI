BACKGROUND: Candidate selection is of critical importance for improved outcomes      in patients supported with VAD. However, risk factors for post-VAD survival in      children are still not clearly understood. METHODS: From June 1996 to December      2009, 92 children underwent implantation of a long-term VAD at Germany Heart      Institute Berlin. Data on all these patients were retrospectively analyzed, and      pre-operative risk factors for in-hospital survival after VAD implantation were      identified by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 92 subjects, the       median age at implantation was 7 years (range 12 days to 18 years), and the      median support time was 35 days (range 1 to 591 days). The overall survival rate       to transplantation or recovery of ventricular function was 63%. Independent      predictors of in-hospital mortality in children included congenital etiology      (odds ratio [OR]: 11.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 to 47.5),      norepinephrine requirement (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 1.4 to 31), C-reactive protein level      >6.3 mg/dl (OR: 4.9; 95% CI: 1.1 to 22.1), and central venous pressure >17 mm Hg       (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 20). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital etiology, pre-operative      norepinephrine requirement, higher serum C-reactive protein, and central venous      pressure were associated with increased in-hospital mortality in children with      VAD support. Optimal candidate selection and timing of VAD insertion may be of      great importance for improved outcomes in children with advanced heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
