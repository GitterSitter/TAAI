For both patient groups, the importance of      screening for and treatment of psychosocial problems and mental disorders to      optimize compliance and survival has been acknowledged. We compared the use of      psychotherapeutic support by patients with primary HTX, on VAD support, either on      destination therapy or to be transplanted, and successfully bridged to      transplant. In addition, we evaluated the use for supportive psychotherapy for      the families of our patients and present two typical cases. METHODS: Patients      with primary HTX (HTX(prim), n=16), with VAD on destination therapy (VAD(dest),      n=15), with VAD waiting for transplant (VAD(htx), n=9), and patients who have      been successfully bridged on VAD to transplant (HTX(vad), n=11) were analyzed      during the preoperative and the in-hospital postoperative period. International      Classification of Diseases (ICD 10) diagnoses, number of contacts with the      psychologist, time expenses for individual interventions, family interventions,      and concomitant communication were assessed. RESULTS: Adjustment disorders were      the most prevalent disturbances. HTX(vad) patients needed more psychotherapeutic       interventions and required more time for individual support than HTX(prim)      patients. Partners and families of almost one-half of all patients made use of      supportive psychotherapy; there were no differences between the groups with      regard to the needed time. Further, the groups did not differ in the time      expenses for concomitant communication with the psychologist. At the latest      contact with the psychologist, three VAD(dest) patients did not need further      psychotherapy at this time; also, one VAD patient waiting for transplant and two       after primary HTX were psychosocially stable. CONCLUSION: Our data reflect the      high emotional distress, especially of HTX(vad) patients. Our data suggest      further that patients on VAD support experience psychosocial and emotional stress      as severe as HTX candidates and recipients do. Patients on destination therapy      and those who are waiting for transplantation do not differ in this regard. The      high complexity of the psychosocial problems of VAD and HTX patients warrants      professional psychotherapeutic support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
