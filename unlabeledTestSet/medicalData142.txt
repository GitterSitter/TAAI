We evaluated a new miniaturized left      ventricular assist device that requires minimal surgery for implantation,      potentially allowing implantation in earlier stage heart failure. METHODS:      HeartWare (Miami Lakes, Fla) developed transapical miniaturized ventricular      assist device. Acute (n = 4), 1-week (n = 2), and 30-day (n = 4) bovine model      experiments evaluated hemodynamic efficacy and biocompatibility of the device,      which was implanted through small left thoracotomy with single insertion at apex       of left ventricle without cardiopulmonary bypass. The device outflow cannula was       positioned across the aortic valve. The international normalized ratio was      maintained between 2.0 and 2.5 with warfarin. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic,      fluoroscopic, hematologic, and blood chemistry measurements were evaluated.      RESULTS: The device was successfully implanted through the left ventricular apex       in all 10 animals. The device was operated at 15,000 +/- 1000 rpm (power      consumption, 3.5-6.0 W). The device maintained normal end-organ perfusion with no      significant hemolysis (0-30 mg/dL). There were no pump failures or device-related      complications. At autopsy, no abnormalities were seen in endocardium, aortic      valve leaflets, or aortic root. There was no evidence of thromboembolism or      abnormalities in any peripheral end organs. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully      demonstrated feasibility of a novel intraventricular assist device that can be      completely implanted through left ventricular apex. This transapical surgical      approach eliminates needs for sternotomy, device pocket, cardiopulmonary bypass,       ventricular coring, and construction of an outflow graft anastomosis.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
