My first goal is to prove intolerance of traditional therapies for heart failure       by challenging patients with various medication combinations, including staggered      dosing regimens and alternatives to angiotensin-converting enzyme      inhibitors/beta-blockers, and by considering cardiac resynchronization therapy if      they meet criteria. As patients develop progressive hypotension and side effects       from medicines, I often will discontinue these medicines after careful      communication. For patients with refractory heart failure, I consider cardiac      transplantation for those who are candidates and left ventricular assist device      as destination therapy for those who are not transplant candidates, both of which      require multidisciplinary input from psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, and      cardiac surgeons. If patients are not candidates for these advanced therapies, I       try to delineate their goals for living and discuss strategies to maximize their       survival (however limited) and increase my focus on their quality of life by      minimizing unnecessary testing. For the select patient, I use continuous inotrope      support only if this improves their quality of life and possibility of having a      meaningful existence outside of the hospital. Palliative care consultants are      often involved at this stage. For the patient who is clearly at the end of life,       I refer to hospice and focus on comfort. Return ambulatory visits and extent of      the care received are guided by the preferences of the patient and their family.       When there are disparate views of family members, especially when the patient is       not cognitively able to participate in the discussion, I tend to be more      paternalistic in my approach to therapeutic options in an attempt to possibly      dissipate family dynamic problems occurring after the patient dies.FAU - Lewis, Eldrin FAU  - Lewis EFAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis Street, Boston,      MA, 02115, USA, eflewis@partners.org.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc MedJT  - Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicineJID - 9815942EDAT- 2011/01/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/01/12 06:01CRDT- 2011/01/12 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11936-010-0100-y [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2011 Feb;13(1):79-89. doi:      10.1007/s11936-010-0100-y.
