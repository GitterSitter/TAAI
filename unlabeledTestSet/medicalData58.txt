These policies have been based on      algorithms that allocate a higher priority status to those patients who are the      most infirm, and would thereby benefit patients in the most dire of      circumstances. Over the last 2 decades, the increased use of LVADs as a bridge to      transplantation has had a major impact on lowering the mortality among those on      the heart transplant waiting list. Given the constant risk of potential      complications related to these devices, early UNOS policies were implemented to      specifically allocate higher priority status to patients on LVADs. However,      recent advances in LVAD technology coupled with refinements in patient selection       and management have dramatically improved patient survival and led to a reduction      in complications. It is inevitable that favorable experiences with the current      generation of LVADs coupled with continued improvements in technology will lead      to increased use of these devices as a bridge to transplantation or to candidacy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
