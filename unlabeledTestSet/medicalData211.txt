Survivin initiates cell cycle      progression by increased cyclinD1/cdk4 complexes by abrogation of the inhibitory       effect of p16(INK4a) on cdk4. Accordingly, the role of survivin in CHF and after       unloading was explored. METHODS: In 20 myocardial samples from patients with      terminal CHF (before and after LVAD), the protein expression of survivin, cyclin       D1, cdk4, p16(INK4a), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was      immunohistochemically investigated and morphometrically quantified by calculating      the percentage of positive cardiomyocytes per visual field. These data were      correlated with cardiomyocyte size and DNA content. RESULTS: The mean percentage       of cardiomyocytes immunoreactive against survivin, cyclin D1, cdk4, p16(INK4a),      and PCNA was significantly increased in CHF compared with controls and      significantly decreased after unloading (57.6% to 26.6%, 42% to 18.3%, 45.4% to      15.3%, 73.0% to 60.5%, and 43.5% to 25.2%, respectively; p < 0.05). All      investigated parameters, in particular survivin and cyclin D1, significantly      correlated with cardiomyocyte diameters (r = 0.405; r = 0.563) and DNA content (r      = 0.430; r = 0.480), both in CHF (cardiac remodelling) and after unloading (p <      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that survivin is reversibly regulated by       ventricular unloading and might be involved in cell size/DNA content regulation      and cardiomyocyte proliferation in cardiac remodelling during CHF. It is      suggested that after ventricular unloading, decreased survivin protein expression      might contribute to cardiac hypertrophy decrease by lowering the number of cyclin      D1/cdk4 complexes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
