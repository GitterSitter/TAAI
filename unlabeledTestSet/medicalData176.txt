AIM: We examined the outcome of HTx with current      immunosuppressive and adjunctive therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analysed the      outcome of 399 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation at our centre      (1995-2007). Prior to HTx 23% (98) required inotropic support, 8.5% (34) an      intra-aortic balloon pump and 11% (43) a ventricular assist device. RESULTS:      Actuarial patient survival was 86% at 30 days, 79% at 1 year and 62% at 10 years.      Survival was similar regardless of the heart failure severity, P=0.22. The      cumulative incidence of allograft vasculopathy, Costanzo grade>/=2, was 7% at 5      years and 23% by 10 years with an 11% cumulative probability of requiring a      percutaneous coronary intervention by 10 years. Allograft function was preserved       with a mean+/-SD left ventricular ejection fraction of 73+/-7% at 1 year and      74+/-8% at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of malignancy by 10 years was 27%      (skin malignancy 13% and post transplant lymphoproliferative diseases 10%). The      cumulative incidence of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated      glomerular filtration rate</=45 ml/min/1.73 m2 was 42% at 1 year, 62% at 5 years       and 72% at 10 years and of requiring long-term renal replacement therapy was      10.6% at 10 years. CONCLUSION: HTx provided good medium-term survival for      patients with advanced heart failure, independent of its severity. The incidence       of allograft vasculopathy was lower than reported previously but malignancy and      CKD remain cause for concern.FAU - Hamour, I MAU  - Hamour IMAD  - The Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, Harefield Hospital, Hill End Road,      Harefield, Middlesex, UB9 6JH, UK.FAU - Khaghani, AAU  - Khaghani AFAU - Kanagala, P KAU  - Kanagala PKFAU - Mitchell, A GAU  - Mitchell AGFAU - Banner, N RAU  - Banner NRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20101123PL  - EnglandTA  - QJMJT  - QJM : monthly journal of the Association of PhysiciansJID - 9438285SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AgedMH  - FemaleMH  - Great Britain/epidemiologyMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/*mortalityMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - PrognosisMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Tissue and Organ Procurement/methodsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/18 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/26 06:00PHST- 2010/11/23 [aheadofprint]AID - hcq205 [pii]AID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcq205 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - QJM. 2011 Apr;104(4):335-43. doi: 10.1093/qjmed/hcq205.
