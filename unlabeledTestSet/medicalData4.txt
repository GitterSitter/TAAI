Incidence of right       ventricular failure while on LVAD support requires a second device be implanted      to support the failing right ventricle. Without a commercially available      implantable rotary right ventricular assist device, rotary LVADs are cannulated      into the right heart and operation modified to provide suitable support for the      pulmonary system. While this approach can alleviate the demand for transplant      through long-term biventricular support, it uncovers a new challenge with respect      to controller strategies for these dual device support systems. This study      compares the preload sensitivity of rotary, dual device biventricular assistance       controllers in light of their ability to adjust the flow rate according to      physiological demand. A Frank-Starling-like flow controller which requires both      inlet pressure and flow sensors is compared to pressure controllers which      maintain atrial or inlet cannula pressures through the use of a single pressure      sensor. It was found that cannula selection and the location of a pressure      controller's single pressure sensor can be tailored to adjust the preload      sensitivity. When located within the atria, this sensitivity is effectively      infinite. Moving the sensor to the base of a 450-mm cannula, however, decreased      the sensitivity to 0.22 (L/min)/mm Hg. This indicates the potential for simple      and reliable VAD controllers with increased preload sensitivity without the need       for complex controllers requiring an array of hemodynamic sensors.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.
