However, it remains to be established whether       pulsatile and non-pulsatile systems can ensure a similarly low rate of      complications for extended periods of time in elderly patients. METHODS AND      RESULTS: Of 174 patients implanted between June 1991 and January 2009 [mean age:       65 +/- 3.7 (60-80) years], 64 were on pulsatile (39 Berlin Heart EXCOR, 18      Novacor, 4 LionHeart, and 3 HeartMate I) and 110 on non-pulsatile assist devices       (65 Berlin Heart INCOR, 18 DeBakey, 14 HeartMate II, 7 DuraHeart, and 6      Jarvik2000). In the pulsatile group, the mean support time was 157 +/- 343      (1-1836) days, and in the non-pulsatile group 281 +/- 336 (1-1619) days (P <      0.05). The 1-year survival was 15% in the pulsatile group and 36% in the      non-pulsatile group, and 2-year survival was 12 and 26%, respectively (P < 0.05).      In the pulsatile group, 11 patients (17%) were supported for >6 months, 7      patients (11%) for >1 year, and 3 patients (5%) for >2 years, and 3 patients      underwent heart transplantation, 3 were weaned, and 3 still have a device. In the      non-pulsatile group, 46 patients (42%) were supported for >6 months, 34 (28%) for      >1 year, and 14 (13%) for >2 years, and 17 patients are still on support, 9      underwent transplantation, and 3 were weaned. CONCLUSION: Although both types of       device can be used for extended periods of time, non-pulsatile systems have a      significantly higher survival rate in elderly patients. They allow elderly      patients additional years of life in their familiar environment.FAU - Drews, ThorstenAU  - Drews TAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin,       Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.FAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Dandel, MichaelAU  - Dandel MFAU - Buz, SemihAU  - Buz SFAU - Lehmkuhl, Hans BrendanAU  - Lehmkuhl HBFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20100522PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595SB  - IMMH  - Age FactorsMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - *AgingMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Length of Stay/statistics & numerical dataMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2010/05/25 06:00MHDA- 2011/01/12 06:00CRDT- 2010/05/25 06:00PHST- 2010/05/22 [aheadofprint]AID - hfq076 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfq076 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2010 Sep;12(9):990-4. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hfq076.
