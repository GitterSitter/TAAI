We report the deployment and successful weaning from LVAD      in young children with severe heart failure (HF). DESIGN: From 2004--2009, 13      children suffering from HF were placed on LVAD. All presented with a dilated left      ventricle (LV) with severely reduced contractility, secondary to myocarditis,      atrial arrhythmia or idiopathic HF. This study reports their outcomes and      longitudinal follow-up. RESULTS: Of 13 young children with HF (ages 1 month--6      years; mean 19.2 months) placed on LVAD: eight weaned to recovery and successful       hospital discharge, one was transplanted and four died. Echo follow-up in the      weaned patients (mean age 22.1 months) revealed significant improvements from      pre-LVAD measurements: LV end-diastolic dimension (LVED) mean z-score decreased      from +4.8 to +0.95 (P < .001); fractional shortening (FS %) improved from a mean       of 9.3% to 33% (P < .001); and the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR)      significantly improved (P < .05). Time to LVAD deployment from HF diagnosis was      more likely to be less than 30 days in the successfully weaned patients (100%)      than patients who died or were transplanted (20%); P = .007. CONCLUSIONS: LVAD      support can be utilized as a bridge to recovery in young children with HF.      Following LVAD weaning, children sustain improvements in LV size, function and      degree of MR. LVAD deployment less than 30 days from HF diagnosis improves the      likelihood of successful weaning and illustrates that children with acute      etiologies of HF are more likely to achieve recovery.CI  - (c) 2011 Copyright the Authors.
