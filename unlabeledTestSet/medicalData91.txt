METHODS: Pre-operative and latest follow-up data were analyzed for      40 consecutive patients who received third-generation centrifugal-flow LVADs. RHF      was defined using previously described criteria, including post-operative      inotropes, pulmonary vasodilator use, or right-sided mechanical support. Patients      were also categorized according to clinical outcomes after LVAD insertion.      RESULTS: LVADs were implanted as a bridge to transplantation (BTT) in 33 patients      and as destination therapy in 7. Before LVAD implant, 22 patients were      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)      level 1, and 17 were at level 2. Temporary mechanical assistance was present in      50% of the cohort at LVAD implantation. The 6-month survival/progression to      transplant was 92.5%. Average LVAD support time was 385 days (range, 21-1,011      days). RHF developed postoperatively in 13 of 40 patients (32.5%). RHF patients      had more severe pre-operative tricuspid incompetence than non-RHF patients. The      BTT patients with evidence of RHF had poorer survival to transplant (6 of 11      [54.5%]) than those without RHF (20 of 22 [90.9%]), p = 0.027). There were no      other hemodynamic or echocardiographic predictors of short-term RHF. After LVAD,       22 of the 40 patients (55%) thrived clinically. For BTT patients, 20 of 21 (95%)       of those who thrived progressed to transplant or were alive at latest follow-up      vs 6 of 12 (50%) of those who failed to thrive (FTT; p < 0.005). The thrivers had      lower New York Heart Association class (1.5 vs 2.9, p < 0.001), spent less time      in the hospital, and had less ventricular tachycardia than the FTT patients.      However, no differences were noted in pre-operative INTERMACS level,      echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and biochemical indices, or in early      post-operative RHF. Age was the only significant predictor: the thrivers were      significantly younger (43.7 +/- 15.9 vs 60.3 +/- 12.6 years; p < 0.001). This age      difference was unchanged after exclusion of destination strategy patients. RV      function deteriorated in the FTT patients and remained stable in those who      thrived. CONCLUSIONS: Early post-operative RHF results in poorer      survival/progression to transplantation for BTT patients and is predicted by      greater pre-operative tricuspid incompetence. The most important predictor for      those who will clinically thrive longer-term after LVAD insertion is younger age.CI  - Crown Copyright (c) 2011. Published by Elsevier Inc.
