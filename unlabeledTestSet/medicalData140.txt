Whether patients with non-coronary reasons for circulatory      arrest benefit of percutaneous emergency circulatory support (PECS) in the same      way is still unclear. METHODS: We included 22 consecutive patients who were      treated by PECS during a registry period of two years. Primary study endpoint was      30-day mortality rate. RESULTS: Circulatory arrest was caused by AMI in 14      patients (64%). The remaining 8 patients suffered from      cardiomyopathy/myocarditis, 4; pulmonary embolism, 2; acute pulmonary failure, 1;      and tumor lysis syndrome, 1. Revascularization rate was 93% in the AMI group      under PECS support. Overall survival rate was 36.4% at one month: it reached      62.5% among non-coronary patients, but only 21.4% in the AMI group (P = 0.02).      Weaning was possible by direct heart transplantation in two patients. Additional       two patients required implantation of a left ventricular assist device. Pumpless       extracorporeal lung assist was used in one case. CONCLUSION: In this small      retrospective study percutaneous emergency circulatory support provided      sufficient hemodynamic stabilization in emergency situations. One fifth of AMI      patients were saved by immediate restoration of circulation and causal treatment       when other means of resuscitation failed. Higher survival rates were noted in      non-coronary patients.FAU - Ferrari, MarkusAU  - Ferrari MAD  - Friedrich-Schiller-University, Clinic of Internal Medicine, Jena, Germany.      markus.ferrari@med.uni-jena.deFAU - Hekmat, KhosroAU  - Hekmat KFAU - Jung, ChristianAU  - Jung CFAU - Ferrari-Kuehne, KatharinaAU  - Ferrari-Kuehne KFAU - Pfeifer, RuedigerAU  - Pfeifer RFAU - Schlosser, Markus HAU  - Schlosser MHFAU - Werner, Gerald SAU  - Werner GSFAU - Figulla, Hans RAU  - Figulla HRLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110216PL  - EnglandTA  - Acute Card CareJT  - Acute cardiac careJID - 101276603SB  - IMMH  - *Cardiopulmonary ResuscitationMH  - CatheterizationMH  - Emergency Medical ServicesMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Arrest/mortality/*therapyMH  - Heart-Lung MachineMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardial Infarction/mortality/*therapyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/02/18 06:00MHDA- 2011/07/16 06:00CRDT- 2011/02/18 06:00PHST- 2011/02/16 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.3109/17482941.2010.542466 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Acute Card Care. 2011 Mar;13(1):30-4. doi: 10.3109/17482941.2010.542466.
