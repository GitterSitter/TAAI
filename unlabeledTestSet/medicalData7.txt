We report our      experience with the short-term left ventricular axial pump Impella LP5.0 in nine       patients with severe ischaemic heart failure. METHODS: Six patients (group 1)      presented with cardiogenic shock at the acute phase of an ST elevation myocardial      infarction. Three patients (group 2) had severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy with      temporary contra-indication to LVAD or transplantation. We measured haemodynamic       and metabolic variables up to 96hours and recorded morbidity, mechanical pump      failures, and mortality up to one year postimplantation. RESULTS: In all patients      the Impella LP5.0 was safely placed through the right subclavian artery. Cardiac       power output increased from 0.64 (0.07) W to 0.94 (0.44) W and 1.02 (0.30) W at      24 and 72hours, respectively. The Impella LP5.0 remained in place for 12 (7.2)      days. In group 1, five patients were in INTERMACS Profile 3 at the time of pump      insertion. Three could be weaned and survived. One patient in INTERMACS Profile 1      died of intractable heart failure within hours. In group 2, two of three patients      underwent heart transplantation. Haemorrhage requiring transfusions was observed       in four patients but only one case was directly related to the Impella LP5.0.      CONCLUSION: Left ventricular assistance with the Impella LP5.0 appears to be well      tolerated. It may be especially useful in patients with acute myocardial      infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock who achieve INTERMACS Profile 3 with       initial treatment.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.
