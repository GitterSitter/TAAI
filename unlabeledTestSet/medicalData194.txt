However,      because few patients with chronic cardiomyopathy (CCM) were weaned from VADs (the      majority only recently), the reliability of criteria used for weaning decisions      to predict long-term post-weaning success is barely known. After 15 years of      weaning experience, we assessed this issue. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 47 patients      with CCM as the underlying cause for HF, who were part of a total of 90 patients       weaned from bridge-to-transplant-designed VADs since 1995, we analysed data on      cardiac morphology and function collected before VAD implantation,      echocardiographic parameters recorded during 'off-pump' trials, duration of HF      before implantation, and stability of recovery before and early after VAD      removal. Post-weaning 5 year freedom from HF recurrence reached 66%. Only five      patients (10.6%) died due to HF recurrence or weaning-related complications.      Pre-explantation off-pump left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >/=50 and       >/=45% revealed predictive values for cardiac stability lasting >/=5 years after       VAD removal of 91.7 and 79.1%, respectively. With each unit of LVEF reduction,      the risk of HF recurrence became 1.5 times higher. The predictive value of LVEF      >/=45% also became >90% if additional parameters like pre-explantation LV size      and geometry, stability of unloading-induced cardiac improvement before VAD      removal, and HF duration before VAD implantation were also considered. Definite      cut-off values for certain parameters (including tissue-Doppler-derived LV wall      motion velocity) allowed formulation of weaning criteria with high predictability      for post-weaning stability, also in patients with incomplete cardiac recovery.      CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular assist device removal in CCM patients is feasible and      can be successful even after incomplete cardiac recovery. Parameters of      pre-explantation cardiac function, LV size and geometry, their stability during      final off-pump trials, and HF duration allow detection of patients with the      potential to remain stable for >5 post-weaning years.FAU - Dandel, MichaelAU  - Dandel MAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin,       Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin, Germany. dandel@dhzb.deFAU - Weng, YuguoAU  - Weng YFAU - Siniawski, HenrykAU  - Siniawski HFAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TFAU - Potapov, EvgenijAU  - Potapov EFAU - Lehmkuhl, Hans BAU  - Lehmkuhl HBFAU - Knosalla, ChristophAU  - Knosalla CFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20101007PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263SB  - IMCIN - Eur Heart J. 2011 May;32(9):1052-4.
