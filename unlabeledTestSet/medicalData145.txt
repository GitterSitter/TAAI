The patient had been stable for 6 months, until she started to develop      heart failure symptoms due to severe pulmonary insufficiency. Pulmonary valve      closure and BiVAD conversion to implantable rotary pumps was performed. A      DuraHeart centrifugal pump (Terumo Heart Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) was used for left      ventricular assist, and a Jarvik 2000 axial-flow pump (Jarvik Heart Inc., New      York, NY) was used for right ventricular assist. Although strict management was      required to balance the flow rates of the two different types of devices, her      postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged home.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
