For the pediatric      population, options are often limited by a small body habitus. Even when an      adolescent's weight may suggest adequate space for device implant, most      intracorporeal adult devices remain too large for adolescents. The Thoratec      HeartMate II (HM II) (approved by the FDA in April of 2008) is a small, noiseless      device that is easily operated and monitored. By having an uncomplicated      operating system and small percutaneous drive line, the HM II provides an      opportunity for these patients to aggressively rehabilitate to become a better      transplant candidate and also provides the potential to be discharged home. The      two youngest patients ever to utilize the HM II are also the first two cases of      using the HM II at a freestanding pediatric hospital. A 12-year-old, 53 kg, girl       with dilated cardiomyopathy was supported for 85 days before receiving her heart       transplant. The second patient, a 13-year-old, 149 kg, Hispanic male suffering      from morbid obesity and dilated cardiomyopathy, was supported for 128 days. The      HM II allowed for rehabilitation and nutritional education, resulting in this      patient losing 50 kg before heart transplant. Despite both of these patients'      size, their thoracic cavities were that of a preadolescent and thus techniques      were developed to avoid morbidities like chest wall abrasion and bleeding.      Because of differences between adult and pediatric patients and institutions,      these cases provided unique challenges. However, as pediatric device therapy is      now maturing, pediatric programs such as Texas Children's Hospital have begun to       develop strategies for mechanical support that factor in patient's size and need       for long-term or temporary support, utilizing the growing number of devices      (i.e., Jostra Rotoflow, Tandem Heart PTVA, Thoratec CentriMag, Berlin Heart      EXCOR, etc.) that are now available to children.FAU - Owens, William RAU  - Owens WRAD  - Division of Congenital Heart Surgery, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX      77030-2399, USA. wrowens@texaschildrenshospital.orgFAU - Bryant, Roosevelt 3rdAU  - Bryant R 3rdFAU - Dreyer, William JAU  - Dreyer WJFAU - Price, Jack FAU  - Price JFFAU - Morales, David L SAU  - Morales DLLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100610PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*surgery/therapyMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgery/therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleEDAT- 2010/06/16 06:00MHDA- 2010/11/09 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/16 06:00PHST- 2010/06/10 [aheadofprint]AID - AOR970 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2009.00970.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2010 Jul;34(7):600-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2009.00970.x.
