We report our clinical experience of VAD      implantation in patients with prosthetic heart valves, including both mechanical       and bioprosthetic valves. The clinical records of 133 consecutive patients who      underwent VAD implantation at a single institution from January 2002 through June      2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Six of these patients had a prosthetic valve       in place at the time of device implantation. Patient demographics,operative      characteristics, and postoperative complications were reviewed.Of the six      patients,four were male.The mean age was 57.8 years (range 35-66 years). The      various prosthetic cardiac valves included a mechanical aortic valve (n = 2), a      bioprosthetic aortic valve (n = 3), and a mechanical mitral valve (n = 1).The      indications for VAD support included bridge to transplantation (n = 2), bridge to      recovery (n = 1), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure(n = 3). Three patients      underwent left ventricular assist device placement and three received a right      ventricular assist device. Postoperatively, standard anticoagulation management      began with a heparin infusion (if possible)followed by oral anticoagulation.The      30-day mortality was50% (3/6). The mean duration of support among survivors was      194.3 days (range 7-369 days) compared with 16.0 days(range 4-29 days) for      nonsurvivors. Of the three survivors,two were successfully bridged to heart      transplantation and one recovered native ventricular function.Among the three      nonsurvivors,acute renal failure developed in each case, and two developed      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This study suggests that VAD placement in      patients with a prosthethic heart valve, either mechanical or      bioprosthetic,appears to be a reasonable option.FAU - Mokashi, Suyog AAU  - Mokashi SAAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical      School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.FAU - Schmitto, Jan DAU  - Schmitto JDFAU - Lee, Lawrence SAU  - Lee LSFAU - Rawn, James DAU  - Rawn JDFAU - Bolman, R Morton 3rdAU  - Bolman RM 3rdFAU - Shekar, Prem SAU  - Shekar PSFAU - Couper, Gregory SAU  - Couper GSFAU - Chen, Frederick YAU  - Chen FYLA  - engGR  - F32HL095275-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778RN  - 0 (Anticoagulants)RN  - 9005-49-6 (Heparin)SB  - IMMH  - Acute Kidney Injury/etiologyMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Anticoagulants/therapeutic useMH  - BioprosthesisMH  - BostonMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart Valve Prosthesis/adverse effectsMH  - Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/*instrumentationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - Heparin/therapeutic useMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - RegistriesMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Thrombocytopenia/chemically inducedMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2010/12/09 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/05 06:00CRDT- 2010/12/08 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2010.01102.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2010 Nov;34(11):1030-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2010.01102.x.
