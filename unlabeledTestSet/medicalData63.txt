Although implantation of a left ventricular assist device alone       is often the preferred configuration, patients with biventricular failure and      significant end-organ dysfunction often require biventricular assistance.      METHODS: Between January 2000 and September 2008, 80 patients with severe      biventricular failure were accepted for heart transplantation and received a      pneumatic biventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplant. Patients were      retrospectively divided into 2 groups: those successfully bridged to transplant      (Group A) and those who died (Group B). Patients were also divided into 2 periods      of implantation: Group X (2000-2005) and Group Y (2006-2008, which used a      multidiscipline selection process). RESULTS: Overall success rate to      transplantation was 71.3%, with Group Y demonstrating an 82% success to      transplant rate vs 63% in Group X. One-year actuarial survival after transplant      was 89% compared with 92% in patients without a ventricular assist device. There       were no statistically significant laboratory parameters between Groups A and B      identifying potential risk factors for poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Biventricular      assist device therapy represents an effective and reliable means of supporting      selected Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support      profile 1 patients as a bridge to transplantation, with excellent success to      transplant rates and post-transplant survival.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
