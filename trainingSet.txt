TI  - Management of Advanced Heart Failure due to Cancer Therapy: the Present Role of
      Mechanical Circulatory Support and Cardiac Transplantation.

AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Rapid improvement in antineoplastic therapy is increasing not 
      only cancer survivorship but also the incidence of end-stage heart failure among 
      breast and childhood cancer survivors. Anthracyclines and newer targeted
      therapies, including trastuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are important
      agents implemented in clinical practice that carry cardiotoxic risk. While acute 
      heart failure is often self-limited and reversible, delayed-onset heart failure
      significantly reduces survival. Extremes of age, renal dysfunction, pre-existing 
      coronary artery disease, HER2 positivity, and multi-drug therapy are predictors
      of irreversible heart failure after chemotherapy. Left ventricular assist device 
      (LVAD) implantation and cardiac transplantation can be performed safely in
      patients with end-stage heart failure (HF) from chemotherapy. However,
      co-existing right ventricular dysfunction, hepatic congestion, and increased risk
      of bleeding make LVAD therapy challenging and dependent on careful patient
      selection. Cardiac transplantation in patients with chemotherapy-induced heart
      failure can be performed with good 10-year survival, but requires 5 years of
      cancer freedom and post-transplant infections remain a problem. Improvements in
      LVAD therapy and the expanding role of the total artificial heart and other
      durable biventricular support devices will likely provide more reliable surgical 
      options for the management of end-stage HF after chemotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) patients have poor prognosis due to 
      progressive heart failure characterized by impaired ventricular filling of either
      or both ventricles. The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome of
      end-stage RCM patients after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation
      and to determine factors that may be associated with improved survival. METHODS: 
      This investigation is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data that 
      include 28 consecutive patients with end-stage RCM who received continuous-flow
      LVADs at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Outcome was assessed by survival 
      with LVAD support until heart transplantation or all-cause mortality. RESULTS:
      The mean follow-up time post-LVAD implantation was 448 +/- 425 days. The mean
      hospitalization time was 29 +/- 19 days and was complicated mainly by
      post-operative right ventricular (RV) failure requiring short-term medical
      support. The short-term in-hospital mortality was 14%. Ten patients underwent
      heart transplantation with 100% survival post-transplant during the follow-up
      period. One-year survival for patients with LVADs without transplantation was
      64%, and was not significantly different between amyloidosis and non-amyloidosis 
      patients. Larger left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions
      were significantly associated with improved survival rates (RR = 0.94 and 0.95, p
      < 0.05, respectively), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) </=46 
      mm was associated with increased mortality post-LVAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS:
      LVAD is a feasible, life-saving therapy for end-stage heart failure related to
      RCM, especially as a bridge to transplant and in patients with larger LV
      dimensions.

LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2015.03.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Right heart failure (RHF) is an unresolved issue during
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. Little is known
      about the incidence and clinical significance of late RHF during LVAD support.
      METHODS: Between May 2004 and December 2013, 336 patients underwent
      continuous-flow LVAD implantation. Of these, 293 patients (87%) discharged with
      isolated LVAD support were included in this study. Late RHF was defined as HF
      requiring re-admission and medical or surgical intervention after initial
      surgery. RESULTS: Late RHF occurred in 33 patients (11%) at a median of 99 days
      after discharge (range 19 to 1,357 days). Freedom from late RHF rates were 87%,
      84% and 79% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. RHF recurred in 15 patients. Three
      patients required right ventricular assist device insertion. Univariable Cox
      proportional hazards regression model showed diabetes mellitus (HR 2.05, 95% CI
      1.03 to 4.06, p = 0.04), body mass index >29 (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.94, p =
      0.01) and blood urea nitrogen level >41 mg/dl (HR 2.19; 95% CI 1.10 to 4.36; p = 
      0.025) as significant predictors for late RHF. Estimated on-device survival rates
      at 2 years were 73% in the RHF group and 82% in the non-RHF group (p = 0.20).
      However, overall survival at 2 years was significantly worse in patients who
      developed late RHF (60% vs 85%, p = 0.016). This reduction was mostly attributed 
      to worse overall outcomes in the bridge-to-transplant (BTT) population.
      CONCLUSIONS: Late RHF is common after continuous-flow LVAD implantation, but does
      not affect survival during LVAD support. However, it is associated with worse
      overall outcomes in the BTT population.

TI  - Incidence and Predictors of Cognitive Decline in Patients with Left Ventricular
      Assist Devices.
LID - CIRCOUTCOMES.115.001856 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement for advanced
      heart failure, increased cerebral perfusion should result in improved cognitive
      function. However, stroke (a well-known LVAD complication) and subclinical
      cerebral ischemia may result in transient or permanent cognitive decline. We
      sought to describe the incidence and predictors of cognitive decline after LVAD
      using a valid, sensitive assessment tool. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 4419
      patients in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
      Support who underwent LVAD implantation between May 2012 and December 2013,
      cognitive function was assessed in 1173 patients with the Trail Making B Test
      before LVAD and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The test detects several forms of
      cognitive impairment, including subclinical stroke. Cognitive decline was defined
      as a clinically important increase during follow-up using a moderate Cohen d
      effect size of 0.5xbaseline SD (32 s). The cumulative incidence of cognitive
      decline in the year after LVAD implantation, treating death and transplantation
      as competing risks, was 29.2%. In adjusted analysis, older age (>/=70 versus <50 
      years; hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.46-3.44; Ptrend<0.001) and
      destination therapy (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.92) were
      significantly associated with greater risk of cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cognitive decline occurs commonly in patients in the year after LVAD and is
      associated with older age and destination therapy. These results could have
      important implications for patient selection and improved communication of risks 
      before LVAD implantation. Additional studies are needed to explore the
      association between cognitive decline and subsequent stroke, health status, and
      mortality in patients after LVAD.

AB  - Heart transplantation keeps its leading position in the treatment of end-stage
      heart failure (HF). Survival rates and functional status following heart
      transplantation are excellent, particularly if compared to medical therapy. The
      process of acute and chronic transplant rejection, however, and the sequelae of
      immunosuppression, such as infection, malignancy and renal insufficiency,
      prevents even better results. Therapy with current mechanical circulatory support
      devices is associated with improving outcome and may become competitive to heart 
      transplantation, at least in selected patients. But long-term results are not yet
      available.

AB  - Heart transplantation (HTx) is the treatment of choice for end-stage heart
      failure but the limited availability of heart's donors still represents a major
      issue. So long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been proposed as an 
      alternative treatment option to assist patients scheduled on HTx waiting list
      bridging them for a variable time period to cardiac transplantation-the so-called
      bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) strategy. Nowadays approximately 90% of patients 
      being considered for MCS receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). In
      fact, LVAD experienced several improvements in the last decade and the
      predominance of continuous-flow over pulsatile-flow technology has been evident
      since 2008. The aim of the present report is to give an overview of
      continuous-flow LVAD utilization in the specific setting of the BTT strategy
      taking into consideration the most representative articles of the scientific
      literature and focusing the attention on the evolution, clinical outcomes,
      relevant implications on the HTx strategy and future perspectives of the
      continuous-flow LVAD technology.

TI  - Manipulation of SR Ca -release in heart failure through mechanical intervention.
LID - 10.1113/JP270446 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) were developed as a means of temporary
      circulatory support, but the mechanical unloading they offer also results in
      significant reverse remodeling. In selected patients, these improvements are
      sufficient to allow ultimate device explantation without requiring
      transplantation; this represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of
      heart failure. Like heart failure itself, LVADs influence multiple biological
      systems. The transverse tubules are a system of membrane invaginations in
      ventricular cardiomyocytes which allow rapid propagation of the action potential 
      throughout the cell. Through their dense concentration of L-type Ca2+ channels in
      close proximity with intracellular Ryanodine receptors, the t-tubules enable
      synchronous Ca2+ release throughout the cell. The t-tubules' structure appears to
      be specifically regulated by mechanical load, such that either the overload of
      heart failure (or the spontaneously hypertensive rat model (Song et al., 2006))
      or the profound unloading in a chronically unloaded heart result in impaired
      t-tubule structure, with ineffective Ca2+ release. While there are multiple
      molecular pathways which underpin t-tubule regulation, Tcap appears to be
      important in regulating the effect of altered loading on the t-tubule system.

TI  - Serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide Concentration 60 Days after Surgery as a
      Predictor of Long-term Prognosis in Patients Implanted with a Left Ventricular
      Assist Device.
AB  - Mechanical circulatory support by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is used
      to bridge patients with advanced heart failure to transplant or as a definitive
      treatment. We retrospectively sought predictors of long-term outcome in a cohort 
      of 83 patients who had undergone LVAD treatment. We subjected patients'
      perioperative clinical data to statistical analysis to establish parameters
      associated with all-cause mortality, and the cut-off values, sensitivity and
      specificity of those that had a statistically significant relationship with
      survival. Mean follow up was 717 days (standard deviation 334 days, range 17-1592
      days). Fourteen patients (16.8%) died, but nine (10.8%) were weaned from support.
      Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration measured 60 days after
      implantation was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The optimal
      BNP cut-off value to predict death during LVAD support was 322 pg/ml, with a
      sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 79.8%. Two-year survival was 92.0% in
      those with 60-day serum BNP concentration <322 pg/ml compared with 70.5% in those
      in whom it was >==322 pg/ml (p = 0.003). The relationship between BNP and
      survival likely reflects recovery of native myocardial function and improvements 
      in global health, and should assist clinicians in the on-going management of
      long-term LVAD therapy.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Miniaturization and surgical progress in the field of ventricular
      assist device (VAD) therapy will lead to an increasing use in grown-up patients
      with congenital heart disease (GUCH). VAD implantation in such patients,
      especially biventricular VAD (BVAD) placement, can be very challenging,
      potentially associated with high morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      report on a 47-year-old male patient in terminal biventricular failure with
      pulmonary hypertension 40 years after a Mustard procedure. The patient was
      successfully provided with a HVAD (HeartWare; HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA,
      USA) into the systemic ventricle as bridge to transplantation, with the
      sub-pulmonary ventricle left unsupported. DISCUSSION: We present our
      institutional strategy for VAD selection in these patients and highlight
      intra-corporeal VAD implantation technique.

TI  - Advanced Strategies for End-Stage Heart Failure: Combining Regenerative
      Approaches with LVAD, a New Horizon?
PG  - 10
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010 [doi]
AB  - Despite the improved treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the population with
      end-stage heart failure (HF) is progressively growing. The scarcity of the gold
      standard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.
      For patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been of
      great benefit on survival. To allow explantation of the assist device and obviate
      heart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.
      However, explant rates so far are low. Combining mechanical circulatory support
      with regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might 
      give rise to improved long-term results. Although synergistic effects are
      suggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in both
      preclinical and clinical setting is lacking. This review focuses on advanced and 
      innovative strategies for the treatment of end-stage HF and furthermore appraises
      clinical experience with combined strategies.

TI  - The Perceptions of Important Elements of Caregiving for a Left Ventricular Assist
      Device Patient: A Qualitative Meta-Synthesis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is becoming
      increasingly common in patients with end-stage heart failure. Many LVAD programs 
      require patients to have a caregiver before receiving a device. There are few
      studies exploring the experience, burden, and impacts on caregivers of patients
      with LVADs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to synthesize the qualitative
      literature regarding caregiver's perceptions about caring for an adult LVAD
      patient. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Web of Science to
      find English articles on the topic of LVAD caregiver's perceptions. The articles 
      were then synthesized using a formal process of qualitative meta-synthesis.
      RESULTS: Eight articles met criteria for inclusion. The meta-synthesis across the
      articles resulted in 8 themes categorized under 3 domains. Many of the articles
      suggested a longitudinal process of caregiving with perceptions largely dependent
      upon the time of interview in relation to the LVAD. The first domain of
      caregiving is the "early" stage, covering the life before the LVAD through the
      procedure. This phase is characterized by the pre-LVAD "emotional rollercoaster,"
      the decision seen as "no option," and the thought of "leave it [the LVAD] at the 
      hospital." The second domain is the "middle" stage, covering the time frame after
      discharge from the hospital. This phase is characterized by fragility of the
      patient, recognition of a need to adapt, and a transformed life. The final domain
      is "late LVAD" and describes how late in the LVAD process the LVAD indication
      (bridge to transplant or destination therapy) brings in to focus what is
      important to caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Existing literature indicates that the LVAD
      caregiver experience is intense as well as burdensome and entails the need to
      adapt to a new life. Given the burdens caregivers experience, clinicians and
      future research should explore strategies to support these important individuals.

LID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509 [doi]
AB  - Nonischemic cardiomyopathy can complicate antineoplastic therapy and lead to
      irreversible heart failure. We evaluated structural changes at the time of left
      ventricular assist device implantation in heart failure patients who had been
      exposed to anthracycline, and we correlated those changes with clinical
      presentation. We retrospectively studied left ventricular core samples taken at
      implantation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device in 12 heart
      failure patients (mean age, 46 +/- 16 yr) who had histories of anthracycline
      exposure. We evaluated those samples for hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and fibrosis.
      Histopathologic findings showed moderate-to-severe myocyte hypertrophy, moderate 
      myocytolysis, and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis with areas of
      replacement fibrosis. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked decreases in
      myofibrils, diffuse mitochondrial swelling, and disorganization of the
      sarcoplasmic reticulum. The interval between anthracycline therapy and heart
      failure was a mean of 6.8 +/- 5.7 years; duration of heart failure symptoms, 38
      +/- 47 months; and duration of device support, 414 +/- 266 days. Four patients
      are continuing on device support, 3 have undergone transplantation, 3 have
      undergone device explantation, and 2 have died. The time of heart failure onset
      and the duration of symptoms did not correlate with the severity and extent of
      the histopathologic changes. The histopathologic findings and the clinical course
      varied in heart failure patients with anthracycline exposure. No correlation was 
      observed between anthracycline therapy and the development or duration of heart
      failure symptoms, severity of histopathologic changes, or outcomes.

TI  - Use of HeartWare Ventricular Assist System for Systemic Ventricular Support of a 
      Pediatric Patient After Mustard Procedure.
PG  - 339-41
LID - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System is indicated to provide
      mechanical circulatory support of patients with intractable heart failure as a
      bridge to cardiac transplantation. We describe the use of this device to support 
      the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York Heart
      Association class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustard
      procedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. CASE REPORT: A
      HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a
      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema
      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and
      pulmonary edema. RESULTS: The patient's edema and acute kidney injury resolved
      after device placement. She was discharged home and successfully underwent device
      removal with heart transplant five months later. CONCLUSION: The HeartWare device
      may be used for extended support as a systemic RV in a pediatric patient. It is
      feasible to consider using the device in this patient population.

TI  - Extracorporeal life support in cardiogenic shock: Impact of acute versus chronic 
      etiology on outcome.
LID - S0022-5223(15)00286-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.02.043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in primary cardiogenic
      shock (PCS) is well established. In this study, we evaluated the impact of
      etiology on outcomes. METHODS: Between January 2009 and March 2013, we implanted 
      a total of 249 patients with ECLS; we focused on 64 patients for whom peripheral 
      ECLS was the treatment for PCS. Of these, 37 cases (58%) were "acute" (mostly
      acute myocardial infarction: 39%); 27 (42%) had an exacerbation of "chronic"
      heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy: 30%; post-ischemic cardiomyopathy: 9%; and
      congenital: 3%). RESULTS: In the group with chronic etiology, 23 patients were
      bridged to a left ventricular assist device (52%) or heart transplantation (33%).
      In the group with acute etiology, ECLS was used as a bridge-to-transplantation in
      3 patients (8%), a bridge-to-bridge in 9 (24%), and a bridge-to-recovery in 18
      (49%). One patient in each group was bridged to conventional surgery. Recovery of
      cardiac function was achieved in only the group with acute primary cardiogenic
      shock (18 vs 0 patients, P = .0001). A mean flow during support of </=60% of the 
      theoretic flow (body surface area x 2.4) was a predictor of successful weaning (P
      = .02). Median duration of ECLS support was 7 days (range: 2-11.5 days). Nine
      patients (14%) died during support; 30-day overall survival was 80% (51 of 64
      patients); and 59% of patients were discharged, in whom survival at 48 months was
      90%. Thirty-day survival was correlated with duration of ECLS support.
      CONCLUSIONS: In "chronic" heart failure, ECLS represents a bridge to a
      ventricular assist device or heart transplantation, whereas in "acute" settings, 
      it offers a considerable chance of recovery, and is often the only required
      therapy.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Comparison of Pediatric and Adult Reverse Remodeling With 
      Ventricular Assist Devices.
LID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist device (VAD) support induces reverse remodeling of failing
      myocardium that leads to occasional functional recovery of the adult heart. While
      there have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage
      cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has
      increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the 
      setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardium
      also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to
      its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets 
      of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to
      summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery
      following VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric
      myocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients.
      Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions of
      their cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of information
      about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to
      determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or
      just recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult gene
      expression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40% of genes to be
      oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.
      These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling 
      specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical
      strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.

TI  - Pediatric Quality of Life while Supported with a Ventricular Assist Device.
LID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have emerged as an important
      treatment option for bridging pediatric patients with heart failure to
      transplant. VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of 
      life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of our
      pediatric patients while supported with a VAD. DESIGN: In this prospective study,
      pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement, and their parents, were
      administered a generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD
      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then
      periodically until heart transplant or death. Their final scores while on support
      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,
      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.
      RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VAD
      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was 
      10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.
      Eleven (85%) patients survived to transplant with one (8%) patient remaining
      alive on support. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was 
      1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total
      and physical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups.
      Self-reported psychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy
      controls only. Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all
      three comparison groups for all three categories (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A large 
      deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patients supported by a VAD compared
      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant
      patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group with more severe heart
      failure. Improvements in QoL must be made, as time spent with a VAD will likely
      continue to increase.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.03.283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our 8-year experience with ECMO support as a bridge to decision was
      reviewed. METHODS: A cohort of 124 consecutive patients received ECMO for
      refractory cardiogenic shock in our institution. Twenty-six of these were out of 
      hospital cardiac arrests and were excluded from this analysis. The median age was
      43years, in the range of 11 to 73years. RESULTS: The median duration of ECMO
      support was 4.5days. Mortality while supported by ECMO was 50% with a median
      support time of 2days. Weaning from ECMO was achieved for 49 patients with the
      following outcomes: cardiac recovery (60%), heart transplantation (26%), and VAD 
      implantation (14%). Median duration of support before weaning was 8days. Hospital
      survival was 83%, 61.5% and 71% for cardiac recovery, heart transplantation and
      VAD implantation, respectively. ECMO weaning was significantly improved in all
      patients who had normalized their renal function, and when duration of
      support>6days (HR: 4.255 [1.255-14.493], p=0.02 and HR: 2.164 [1.152-4.082],
      p=0.02, respectively). A creatinine level>14mg/l the day of weaning was a
      significant predictor of death (HR: 5.807 [1.089-30.953]; p=0.04). Median follow 
      up was 2.4years; one-year survival rate was 78%, 51% and 75% for cardiac
      recovery, heart transplantation and VAD implantation, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      With at least 6days of support, ECMO allowed a better patient selection for
      myocardial recovery, VAD implantation or heart transplantation. Whether VAD
      implantation or heart transplant in those patients is a better indication remains
      to be evaluated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials report improvements in function and perfusion with
      direct injection of bone marrow cells into the hearts of patients with ischemic
      cardiomyopathy. Preclinical data suggest these cells improve vascular density,
      which would be expected to decrease fibrosis and inflammation. OBJECTIVES: The
      goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that bone marrow stem cells (CD34+)
      will improve histological measurements of vascularity, fibrosis, and inflammation
      in human subjects undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement as a
      bridge to cardiac transplantation. METHODS: Subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy
      who were scheduled for placement of an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation
      underwent bone marrow aspiration the day before surgery; the bone marrow was
      processed into cell fractions (bone marrow mononuclear cells, CD34+, and CD34-). 
      At LVAD implantation, all fractions and a saline control were injected
      epicardially into predetermined areas and each injection site marked. At the time
      of transplantation, injected areas were collected. Data were analyzed by paired
      Student t test comparing the effect of cell fractions injected within each
      subject. RESULTS: Six subjects completed the study. There were no statistically
      significant differences in complications with the procedure versus control
      subjects. Histological analysis indicated that myocardium injected with CD34+
      cells had decreased density of endothelial cells compared to saline-injected
      myocardium. There were no significant differences in fibrosis or inflammation
      between groups; however, density of activated fibroblasts was decreased in both
      CD34+ and CD34- injected areas. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue analysis does not support the
      hypothesis that bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells promote increased vascular tissue
      in humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy via direct injection.

TI  - A single German center experience with intermittent inotropes for patients on the
      high-urgent heart transplant waiting list.
AB  - AIM: Currently, more than 900 patients with end-stage heart failure are listed
      for heart transplantation in Germany. All patients on the Eurotransplant
      high-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be
      relisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated with
      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospective
      analysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated with
      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 117
      consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure 
      unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 %) were stabilized and
      delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),
      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,
      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient's specific characteristics. 
      After initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as
      possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a
      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 %
      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary
      due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 %) needed a left- or
      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 %) died while waiting and 87 (84 %) 
      received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. Cumulative 3 and 12 months
      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 %, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to
      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These data provide the
      basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropes in patients
      on the HU waiting list.

TI  - Building a bridge to recovery: the pathophysiology of LVAD-induced reverse
      modeling in heart failure.
AB  - Heart failure mainly caused by ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy is a
      life-threatening disorder worldwide. The previous work in cardiac surgery has led
      to many excellent surgical techniques for treating cardiac diseases, and these
      procedures are now able to prolong the human lifespan. However, surgical
      treatment for end-stage heart failure has been under-explored, although left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and heart transplantation are
      options to treat the condition. LVAD can provide powerful circulatory support for
      end-stage heart failure patients and improve the survival and quality of life
      after implantation compared with the existing medical counterparts. Moreover,
      LVADs play a crucial role in the "bridge to transplantation", "bridge to
      recovery" and recently have served as "destination therapy". The structural and
      molecular changes that improve the cardiac function after LVAD implantation are
      called "reverse remodeling", which means that patients who have received a LVAD
      can be weaned from the LVAD with restoration of their cardiac function. This
      strategy is a desirable alternative to heart transplantation in terms of both the
      patient quality of life and due to the organ shortage. The mechanism of this
      bridge to recovery is interesting, and is different from other treatments for
      heart failure. Bridge to recovery therapy is one of the options in regenerative
      therapy which only a surgeon can provide. In this review, we pathophysiologically
      analyze the reverse remodeling phenomenon induced by LVAD and comment about the
      clinical evidence with regard to its impact on the bridge to recovery.

TI  - Timing and Strategy for Weaning From Venoarterial ECMO are Complex Issues.
LID - S1053-0770(14)00647-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.jvca.2014.12.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA
      ECMO) usually is performed without clear guidelines; yet, patients still die
      after removal of extracorporeal circulation because of inadequate heart or
      end-organ recovery. The aim of the study was to address the weaning procedure,
      analyzing the hemodynamic and echocardiographic picture of patients weaned and to
      identify predictors of poor outcome among this population. DESIGN: Observational 
      study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-nine VA
      ECMO cases. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-nine
      patients (38%) were weaned, 7 (5.4%) were bridged to a ventricular assist device,
      and 6 (5.2%) were listed for heart transplantation. Weaned patients showed a
      significant increase of pulse pressure (35 [0-50] mmHg before ECMO, 59 [53-67]
      mmHg at weaning, 61 [51-76] mmHg after ECMO (p<0.001]) and reduction of dose of
      inotropes (inotropic score [as defined in the text] 20 [14-40] before ECMO, 10
      [3-15] at weaning, and 10 [5-15] after ECMO, p<0.001). Left ventricular ejection 
      fraction (LVEF) increased from 19 (0-22.5)% before ECMO to 35 (22-55)% after ECMO
      (p<0.001). A significant improvement of right ventricular (RV) function was
      observed in weaned patients (RV dysfunction from 52% to 21%, p<0.001). Among
      weaned patients, 15 (31%) died. Patients who died after weaning had longer ECMO
      duration compared to discharged patients (8 [5-11] v 4 [2-6] days, p = 0.01) and 
      more transfusions (22 [10-37] v 7 [0.5-15] units, p = 0.02); survival was lower
      in patients with central ECMO (postcardiotomy) compared to peripheral ECMO (p =
      0.045). Mortality was higher in those with persistence of RV failure, continuous 
      venovenous hemofiltration, higher inotropic score, lower systolic pressure, or
      higher leucocyte count at weaning. CONCLUSIONS: Successful weaning from ECMO is a
      multifaceted process, which encompasses consistent recovery of myocardial and
      end-organ function; LVEF, though improved, is still low at weaning. Hospital
      survival is correlated significantly to the duration of ECMO support and to
      bleeding complications.

      Support Registry.
LID - S1053-2498(15)00009-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2015.01.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined whether characteristics, implant strategy, and outcomes
      in patients who receive continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD)
      differ across geographic regions in the United States. METHODS: A total of 7,404 
      CF-LVAD patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) from 134 participating institutions were analyzed
      from 4 distinct regions: Northeast, 2,605 (35%); Midwest, 2,210 (30%); West, 973 
      (13%); and South, 1,616 (22%). RESULTS: At baseline, patients in the Northeast
      and South were more likely to have INTERMACS risk profiles 1 and 2. A
      bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy was more common in the Northeast (31.7%;
      West, 18.5%; South, 26.9%; Midwest, 25.5%; p < 0.0001). In contrast, destination 
      therapy (DT) was more likely in the South (40.6%; Northeast, 32.3%; Midwest,
      27.3%; West, 27.3%; p < 0.0001). Although all regions showed a high 1-year
      survival rate, some regional differences in long-term mortality were observed.
      Notably, survival beyond 1 year after LVAD implant was significantly lower in the
      South. However, when stratified by device strategy, no significant differences in
      survival for BTT or DT patients were found among the regions. Finally, with the
      exception of right ventricular failure, which was more common in the South, no
      other significant differences in causes of death were observed among the regions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in clinical profile and LVAD strategy exist in 
      the United States. Despite an overall high survival rate at 1 year, differences
      in mortality among the regions were noted. The lower survival rate in the South
      may be attributed to patient characteristics and higher use of LVAD as DT.

TI  - The European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support
      (EUROMACS): first annual reportdagger.
PG  - 770-7
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezv096 [doi]
AB  - The European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support (EUROMACS)
      was founded on 10 December 2009 with the initiative of Roland Hetzer (Deutsches
      Herzzentrum Berlin, Berlin, Germany) and Jan Gummert (Herz- und Diabeteszentrum
      Nordrhein-Westfalen, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany) with 15 other founding
      international members. It aims to promote scientific research to improve care of 
      end-stage heart failure patients with ventricular assist device or a total
      artificial heart as long-term mechanical circulatory support. Likewise, the
      organization aims to provide and maintain a registry of device implantation data 
      and long-term follow-up of patients with mechanical circulatory support. Hence,
      EUROMACS affiliated itself with Dendrite Clinical Systems Ltd to offer its
      members a software tool that allows input and analysis of patient clinical data
      on a daily basis. EUROMACS facilitates further scientific studies by offering
      research groups access to any available data wherein patients and centres are
      anonymized. Furthermore, EUROMACS aims to stimulate cooperation with clinical and
      research institutions and with peer associations involved to further its aims.
      EUROMACS is the only European-based Registry for Patients with Mechanical
      Circulatory Support with rapid increase in institutional and individual
      membership. Because of the expeditious data input, the European Association for
      Cardiothoracic Surgeons saw the need to optimize the data availability and the
      significance of the registry to improve care of patients with mechanical
      circulatory support and its potential contribution to scientific intents; hence, 
      the beginning of their alliance in 2012. This first annual report is designed to 
      provide an overview of EUROMACS' structure, its activities, a first data
      collection and an insight to its scientific contributions.

AB  - Commissural fusion of the native aortic valve in a patient with a continuous flow
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a known phenomenon. This may result in
      aortic insufficiency (AI) leading to symptomatic heart failure. In patients with 
      AI at the time of LVAD implantation, repairing, or replacing the aortic valve is 
      advisable. We describe a patient who had a severe dilated cardiomyopathy and
      moderate AI who underwent implantation of an LVAD and aortic valve replacement
      with a bioprosthesis that subsequently developed commissural fusion which was
      found at the time of heart transplantation. This case highlights the conundrum of
      the management of AI in patients requiring LVAD support. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12541

TI  - [Mechanical circulatory support saves lives - three years' experience of the
      newly established assist device program at Semmelweis University].
PG  - 521-7
LID - 10.1556/OH.2015.30115 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the first heart
      transplantation in Hungary in 2012 the emerging need for modern heart failure
      management via mechanical circulatory support has evolved. In May 2012 the
      opening of a new heart failure and transplant unit with 9 beds together with the 
      procurement of necessary devices at Semmelweis University accomplished this need.
      AIM: The aim of the authors was to report their initial experience obtained in
      this new cardiac assist device program. METHOD: Since May, 2012, mechanical
      circulatory support system was applied in 89 cases in 72 patients. Indication for
      support were end stage heart failure refractory to medical treatment and acute
      left or right heart failure. RESULTS: Treatment was initiated for acute graft
      failure after heart transplantation in 27 cases, for end stage heart failure in
      24 cases, for acute myocardial infarction in 21 cases, for acute postcardiotomy
      heart failure in 14 cases, for severe respiratory insufficiency in 2 cases and
      for drug intoxication in one case. Among the 30 survivor of the whole program 13 
      patients were successfully transplanted. CONCLUSIONS: The available devices can
      cover all modalities of current bridge therapy from short term support through
      medium support to heart transplantation or long term support and destination
      therapy. These conditions made possible the successful start of a new cardiac
      assist device program.

TI  - Clinical outcomes in sensitized heart transplant patients bridged with
      ventricular assist devices.
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to transplant
      (BTT) have been known to cause allosensitization, as measured by panel-reactive
      antibody (PRA) levels. The goal of this study was to measure the impact of this
      allosensitization on outcomes. METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed
      in BTT patients, with sensitization defined as peak PRAs >/= 10%. Baseline
      characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using
      descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. RESULTS:
      Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21
      non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47% vs. 10%, p = 
      0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular
      rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).
      Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection
      (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier
      log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of 
      infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION:
      Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. This mortality
      appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the
      development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.

TI  - Colo-colonic anastomosis in a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device
      patient.
LID - S1015-9584(15)00004-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.asjsur.2015.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Noncardiac operations are being increasingly performed on patients with left
      ventricular assist devices (LVADs). However, little is known on the impact of
      continuous-flow LVADs on the vascular supply of the colon for anastomoses. In
      this case, a 67-year-old male supported on an LVAD underwent four successful
      noncardiac operations including two intestinal anastomoses; left colon and small 
      bowel anastomosis. To the best of our knowledge, no existing literature has
      reported successful colonic anastomosis on a continuous-flow LVAD. This case
      illustrates the plausibility of performing colonic anastomoses with appropriately
      selected patients supported on an LVAD. A 67-year-old male with congestive heart 
      failure underwent LVAD placement for decompensated heart failure while awaiting
      orthotopic transplantation. During his recovery, he developed a stage IV sacral
      decubitus ulcer which required a sigmoid loop colostomy placement and a
      rotational flap. Subsequent stoma closure with partial sigmoid colectomy and
      stapled anastomosis was performed, and healed without evidence of anastomotic
      leak. This case illustrates the potential for colonic anastomoses for patients on
      continuous-flow LVAD support. Although oxygenation is known to be an important
      aspect of healing, this patient's outcome suggests that intestinal anastomoses
      can be performed on the induced pulseless environment of an LVAD. Further studies
      will be needed to further elucidate the success of longer segment resections and 
      appropriate surgical candidates.

AB  - The goal of this study was to assess outcomes of patients who underwent
      implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) at nontransplantation
      mechanical circulatory support centers. As the availability of LVADs for advanced
      heart failure has expanded to nontransplantation mechanical circulatory support
      centers, concerns have been expressed about maintaining good outcomes.
      Demographics and outcomes were evaluated in 276 patients with advanced heart
      failure who underwent implantation of LVADs as bridge to transplantation or
      destination therapy at 27 open-heart centers. Baseline characteristics, operative
      mortality, length of stay, readmission rate, adverse events, quality of life, and
      survival were analyzed. The overall 30-day mortality was 3% (8 of 276), and
      survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were 92 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 3%, 
      and 84 +/- 4% for the bridge-to-transplantation group and 81 +/- 3%, 70 +/- 5%,
      and 63 +/- 6% for the destination therapy group, comparable with results
      published by the national Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS). The median length of stay for all patients was
      21 days. Bleeding was the most frequent adverse event. Stroke occurred in 4%
      (bridge to transplantation) and 6% (destination therapy) of patients.
      Quality-of-life measures and 6-minute walk distances showed sustained
      improvements throughout support. In conclusion, outcomes with LVAD support at
      open-heart centers are acceptable and comparable with results from the INTERMACS 
      registry. With appropriate teams, training, center commitment, and certification,
      LVAD therapy is being disseminated in a responsible way to open-heart centers.

      correlate with mortality in the cohort of patients enrolled in the Heartmate II
      trials, but its validity in unselected, "real world" populations remains unclear.
      METHODS: This study identified a cohort of 269 consecutive patients who received 
      a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device at our institution, the
      Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, between June 2005 and June 2013.
      Ninety-day and 2-year mortality rates, as well as frequency of several morbid
      events, were compared by retrospectively assigned HMRS category groups. The
      analysis was repeated within the subgroup of INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for 
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) class 1 patients. RESULTS: Receiver
      operating curve analysis showed that the HMRS correlated with 90-day mortality
      with an area under the curve of 0.70. Stratification in low, mid, and high HMRS
      groups identified patients with increasing hazard of 90-day mortality, increasing
      long-term mortality, increasing rate of gastrointestinal bleeding events, and
      increasing median number of days spent in the hospital in the first year post
      implant. Within INTERMACS class 1 patients, those in the highest HMRS group were 
      found to have a relative risk of 90-day mortality 5.7 times higher than those in 
      the lowest HMRS group (39.1% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: HMRS is a valid
      clinical tool to stratify risk of morbidity and mortality after implant of
      Heartmate II devices in unselected patients and can be used to predict short-term
      mortality risk in INTERMACS class 1 patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the relationship between anti-factor Xa
      (anti-FXa) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) for monitoring
      intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV-UFH) in patients with continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs). BACKGROUND: CF-LVADs have become
      mainstream therapy for patients with advanced heart failure. Thromboembolic
      events, device thrombosis, and bleeding continue to be a challenge with this
      technology. Adequate anticoagulation is required to prevent these adverse events.
      METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive patients implanted with a CF-LVAD was
      conducted. Paired samples were considered concordant if aPTT values fell into
      expected ranges for subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic anti-FXa
      levels. Heparin dosing was on the basis of anti-Xa levels. RESULTS: A total of
      340 paired values from 38 patients were evaluated. Anti-FXa and aPTT were
      discordant in 253 samples (74.4%), with a high degree of variability in aPTT for 
      any given anti-FXa level (r(2) = 0.57). Results were discordant in 104 samples
      (63.8%) from patients undergoing bridging therapy with warfarin and in 149
      samples (84.2%) from patients with device obstruction and/or hemolysis (p <
      0.001). The most common pattern of discordance was a supratherapeutic aPTT value 
      despite a therapeutic anti-FXa level (49.1% for bridging vs. 75.8% for device
      obstruction and/or hemolysis; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of aPTT were
      disproportionately prolonged relative to the corresponding anti-FXa levels in
      CF-LVAD patients, particularly those with device obstruction. Hemolysis and
      warfarin administration may falsely elevate aPTT, resulting in overestimation of 
      heparin concentration and under-anticoagulation. Use of aPTT and anti-FXa to
      guide heparin therapy may lead to different estimates of heparin concentration in
      the same patient.

TI  - Impact of age on outcomes following continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      device implantation.
LID - ivv051 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of our study was to analyse the impact of age on outcomes in
      patients who underwent continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD)
      placement at our institution. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were
      implanted with a CF-LVAD between January 2008 and June 2014. Eighty-five patients
      were implanted with the device as a bridge to transplant (BTT); the remaining (n 
      = 43) were on destination therapy (DT). Each group was divided into patients <65 
      years old and >/=65 years old at device implantation. Patients were followed up
      for at least 24 months or until transplant or death. RESULTS: Eighty-five
      patients (66%) received a CF-LVAD as BTT. Patients >/=65 years old (n = 8) had a 
      lower preoperative cardiac index and prothrombin time-international normalized
      ratio (P = 0.009), and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (P = 0.008).
      Adverse events including infections, re-exploration for bleeding, ischaemic and
      haemorrhagic stroke, renal failure and right heart failure were comparable in
      both age groups. Eighty-two percent (n = 63) of the young patients and 75% (n =
      6) of the older patients, who were on LVAD as BTT, underwent heart transplant
      within the first 24 months of LVAD implantation. Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and
      24 months were 95, 95, 77 and 70%, respectively, post-CF-LVAD implantation as BTT
      for the younger group and 73% for the older group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P =
      0.35). Forty-three patients (34%) received a CF-LVAD as DT. Patients >/=65 years 
      old (n = 14) on DT had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular disease (P =
      0.048), higher serum sodium (P = 0.004) and serum creatinine values (P = 0.002), 
      preoperatively. There were more strokes in the older patients post-LAVD
      implantation (14 vs 0%; P = 0.048). Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
      were 85, 79, 75 and 62%, respectively, for the younger group and 93, 77, 67 and
      34% for the older group, respectively (P = 0.26). CONCLUSION: This study
      demonstrates that LVAD therapy can be used in the older patients with acceptable 
      mortality and morbidity, and age alone should not be used as the sole criterion
      for exclusion from LVAD implantation.

TI  - Building a bridge to save a failing ventricle: radiologic evaluation of short-
      and long-term cardiac assist devices.
PG  - 327-56
LID - 10.1148/rg.352140149 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure is recognized with increasing frequency worldwide and often
      progresses to an advanced refractory state. Although the reference standard for
      treatment of advanced heart failure remains cardiac transplantation, the
      increasing shortage of donor organs and the unsuitability of many patients for
      transplantation surgery has led to a search for alternative therapies. One such
      therapy is mechanical circulatory support, which helps relieve the load on the
      ventricle and thereby allows it to recover function. In addition, there is
      increasing evidence supporting the use of mechanical devices as a bridge to
      recovery in patients with acute refractory heart failure. In this article, the
      imaging evaluation of various commonly used short- and long-term cardiac assist
      devices is discussed, and their relevant mechanisms of action and physiology are 
      described. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), plays a crucial role
      in preoperative evaluation for assessment of candidacy for implantation of a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH). Also,
      echocardiography and CT are indispensable in assessment of complications
      associated with cardiac devices. Complications commonly associated with
      short-term assist devices include bleeding and malpositioning, whereas long-term 
      devices such as LVADs may be associated with infection, pump thrombosis, and
      cannula malfunction, as well as bleeding. CT is also commonly performed for
      preoperative planning before LVAD or TAH explantation, replacement of a device or
      one of its components, and cardiac transplantation. Online supplemental material 
      is available for this article.

TI  - Kidney dysfunction and left ventricular assist device support: a comprehensive
      perioperative review.
PG  - 48-60
LID - 10.1159/000369589 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used increasingly as a bridge to
      transplantation or as destination therapy in end-stage heart failure patients who
      do not respond to optimal medical therapy. Many of these patients have end-organ 
      dysfunction, including advanced kidney dysfunction, before and after LVAD
      implantation. Kidney dysfunction is a marker of adverse outcomes, such as
      increased morbidity and mortality. This review discusses kidney dysfunction and
      associated management strategies during the dynamic perioperative time period of 
      LVAD implantation. Furthermore, we suggest potential future research directions
      to better understand the complex relationship between renal pathophysiology and
      mechanical circulatory support.

TI  - Decision-making for destination therapy left ventricular assist devices:
      implications for caregivers.
PG  - 172-8
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.114.001276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implanting centers often require the identification of a dedicated
      caregiver before destination therapy left ventricular assist device (DT LVAD)
      implantation; however, the caregiver experience surrounding this difficult
      decision is relatively unexplored. METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2012 through
      July 2013, we conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews with caregivers of
      patients considering DT LVAD. Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and
      deductive approach. We interviewed 17 caregivers: 10 caregivers of patients
      living with DT LVAD, 6 caregivers of patients who had died with DT LVAD, and 1
      caregiver of a patient who had declined DT LVAD. The themes identified, which
      could also be considered dialectical tensions, are broadly interpreted under 3
      domains mapping to decision context, process, and outcome: (1) the stark decision
      context, with tension between hope and reality; (2) the challenging decision
      process, with tension between wanting loved ones to live and wanting to respect
      loved ones' wishes; and (3) the downstream decision outcome, with tension between
      gratitude and burden. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making surrounding DT LVAD should
      incorporate decision support for patients and caregivers. This should include a
      focus on caregiver burden and the predictable tensions that caregivers
      experience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage heart failure possess many attributes that
      place them at risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV). However, there are 
      only limited data on MV support among children after ventricular assist device
      (VAD) implantation. We report the duration of MV after VAD placement, indications
      for respiratory support in the postimplantation period, and associated patient
      factors. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 43 consecutive 
      children (aged <18 years) with end-stage heart failure who were supported with a 
      VAD as a bridge to transplantation from January 2005 to December 2011.
      Multivariable analysis was performed using the multiple Poisson regression model 
      for the duration of MV. RESULTS: Overall, 33% (n = 14) remained on MV until heart
      transplant or death. Of those requiring pre-VAD extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) support, 63% (n = 12 of 19) remained on MV until heart
      transplant or death compared with 8% (n = 2 of 24) among those not on ECMO before
      VAD (p < 0.001). Patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation while on
      VAD support had 1.7-times more MV days compared with those with none or trivial
      on-VAD mitral regurgitation. In addition, previous support on ECMO, those with
      moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants
      had an increased risk of prolonged MV. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VAD 
      recipients previously supported on ECMO, those with moderate or severe mitral
      regurgitation, moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, and those with only
      left VAD implants had an increased risk of prolonged MV. Future studies in larger
      cohorts are necessary to confirm the findings from this single-institutional
      experience.

TI  - Reduction in driveline infection rates: Results from the HeartMate II Multicenter
      Driveline Silicone Skin Interface (SSI) Registry.
LID - S1053-2498(14)01486-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.11.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During left ventricular assist device implantation, a surgical
      tunneling technique to keep the entire driveline (DL) velour portion in the
      subcutaneous tunnel, resulting in a silicone-skin interface (SSI) at the exit
      site, has been adopted by many centers. To assess long-term freedom from DL
      infection associated with this technique, a multicenter SSI registry was
      initiated. It was hypothesized that the modified tunneling technique is
      associated with at least 50% reduction in DL infection at 1 year post-implant
      compared with the velour-to-skin method used in the HeartMate II (HMII)
      Destination Therapy (DT) trial. METHODS: SSI is a retrospective and prospective
      registry of patients who have received the HMII device. Results are reported from
      the retrospective cohort, which consists of 200 patients who were implanted
      during the period 2009-2012 with the SSI tunneling method and on HMII support for
      at least 10 months at the time of enrollment. The prevalence and incidence of DL 
      infection after left ventricular assist device implantation in the SSI
      retrospective cohort were determined and compared with a control group of 201
      patients also on HMII support for at least 10 months from the HMII DT clinical
      trial who were implanted during the period 2007-2009 using the traditional method
      in which a small section of the velour portion of the DL was externalized.
      RESULTS: The 1-year and 2-year prevalence rates of DL infection were 9% and 19%
      in the SSI patient group compared with 23% and 35% in the control group (hazard
      ratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.73, p < 0.001). The event-per-patient 
      year was 0.11 and 0.22 for the SSI and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). 
      Based on a multivariate analysis, age and DL exit side were the only independent 
      variables associated with DL infection. Effects of management changes over the
      eras were not studied and could have contributed to the findings. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results suggest that leaving the entire DL velour portion below the skin is
      associated with 50% reduction in DL infection compared with results from the HMII
      DT trial.

TI  - Minimally Invasive Ventricular Assist Device Surgery.
LID - 10.1111/aor.12422 [doi]
AB  - The use of mechanical circulatory support to treat patients with congestive heart
      failure has grown enormously, recently surpassing the number of annual heart
      transplants worldwide. The current generation of left ventricular assist devices 
      (LVADs), as compared with older devices, is characterized by improved
      technologies and reduced size. The result is that minimally invasive surgery is
      now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange of LVADs. Minimally
      invasive procedures improve surgical outcome; for example, they lower the rates
      of operative complications (such as bleeding or wound infection). The
      miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive techniques
      will be used for most implantations in the future. In this article, we summarize 
      and describe minimally invasive state-of-the-art implantation techniques, with a 
      focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.

AB  - The pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) has recently shown substantial
      improvements in survival as a bridge to heart transplant for patients with
      end-stage heart failure. Since that time, its use has become much more frequent. 
      With increasing utilization, additional questions have arisen including patient
      selection, timing of VAD implantation and device selection. These challenges are 
      amplified by the uniqueness of each patient, the recent abundance of literature
      surrounding VAD use as well as the technological advancements in the devices
      themselves. Ideal strategies for device placement must be sought, for not only
      improved patient care, but also for optimal resource utilization. Here, we review
      the most relevant literature to highlight some of the challenges facing the heart
      failure specialist, and any physician, who will care for a child with a VAD.

LID - 10.1155/2015/592512 [doi]
AB  - Mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) in advanced heart
      failure (HF), in addition to improving symptoms and end-organ perfusion, is
      supposed to stimulate cellular and molecular responses which can reverse
      maladaptive cardiac remodeling. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in
      remodeling processes, a comparative miRNA profiling in transplanted hearts of HF 
      patients with/without LVAD assistance could aid to comprehend underlying
      molecular mechanisms. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze miRNA 
      differential expression in left ventricles of HF patients who underwent heart
      transplantation directly (n = 9) or following a period of LVAD support (n = 8).
      After data validation by quantitative real-time PCR, association with functional 
      clinical parameters was investigated. Bioinformatics' tools were then used for
      prediction of putative targets of modulated miRNAs and relative pathway
      enrichment. The analysis revealed 13 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs in
      failing hearts subjected to LVAD assistance. In particular, the expression level 
      of some of them (miR-338-3p, miR-142-5p and -3p, miR-216a-5p, miR-223-3p,
      miR-27a-5p, and miR-378g) showed correlation with off-pump cardiac index values. 
      Predicted targets of these miRNAs were involved in focal adhesion/integrin
      pathway and in actin cytoskeleton regulation. The identified miRNAs might
      contribute to molecular regulation of reverse remodeling and heart recovery
      mechanisms.

      adverse outcomes after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device
      implantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is prevalent in patients with heart
      failure. Because very few data exist examining the influence of significant
      pre-operative MR on outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      implantation, we evaluate our experience. METHODS: Between October 1996 and
      August 2013, 756 patients underwent primary LVAD implantation at our
      institutions. Of these, 508 patients received a continuous-flow LVAD and
      represent the contemporary cohort for this analysis. Devices implanted included
      the HeartMate II in 410 patients (81%) and HeartWare HVAD in 98 patients (19%).
      Based on availability of pre-operative echocardiography, 491 patients were
      divided into 2 study groups according to degree of pre-operative MR; 189 patients
      (39%) had moderate to severe or greater MR (MR group), and 302 (61%) had less
      than moderate to severe MR (less MR group). Median age at operation (60 years in 
      MR group vs 58 years in less MR group, p = 0.19), male sex (78% in MR group vs
      81% in less MR group, p = 0.42), and ischemic etiology (46% in MR group vs 51% in
      less MR group, p = 0.35) were similar between groups. RESULTS: There were 40
      early deaths (7.9%), and follow-up was available in all 468 early survivors for
      641 patient-years of support. Patients in the MR group had higher late survival
      (2 years, 75%; 4 years, 65%) compared with patients in the less MR group (2
      years, 66%; 4 years, 48%; p < 0.04). Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the
      independent interaction between MR and late survival (hazard ratio 0.62, p =
      0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was improved survival in patients with severe
      pre-operative MR after continuous-flow LVAD implantation in our cohort. These
      findings may lend insight into the possible lack of value of addressing
      significant MR at the time of LVAD implantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report the successful transplantation of a heart following an
      out-of-body time of 611minutes into a recipient with dilated cardiomyopathy and
      left ventricular assist device implant. PATIENTS: Our patient was urgently
      waiting for a cardiac transplant whilst receiving LVAD support. Recurrent VF and 
      repeated AICD shocks necessitated this action. RESULTS: Although requiring ECMO
      and inotropic support in the first 17hours post-transplant, the patient was
      discharged from hospital on day 15 post-transplant with normal cardiac function. 
      CONCLUSION: We report some of the salient points of the process and discuss the
      utility of this technology to an Australian transplant unit.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support in the Dutch National Paediatric Heart
      Transplantation Programmedagger
LID - ezv011 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with a ventricular assist device
      (VAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx) or recovery may improve outcome 
      in children with terminal heart failure. We report our experience with MCS in
      children eligible for HTx and its effect on waiting list mortality. METHODS:
      Retrospective single-centre cohort study, National Paediatric HTx Programme
      including all children eligible for HTx, since the introduction of MCS-VAD in
      2006. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were eligible for HTx, median age 11.7
      years [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 3.0-14.7]. In 18 patients, (42%) a VAD was
      implanted, 11 (61%) survived to HTx (n = 9) or recovery (n = 2). Techniques and
      devices used were left ventricular assist device (n = 16, 89%), in 4 cases
      preceded by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and biventricular assist 
      device (n = 2, 11%), both preceded by ECMO. In the VAD group, median time to
      death (n = 7) was 18 days (IQR 7-75), median time to HTx (n = 9) 66 days (IQR
      33-223) and 2 patients recovered after 30 and 308 days. The main cause of death
      on MCS was neurological injury in 4 patients (22%) and systemic thrombo-embolic
      events in 2 (11%). The most common serious adverse events included confirmed
      thrombus requiring pump replacement (in 11 patients, 61%) and pericardial
      effusion leading to rethoracotomy (in 5 patients, 28%). Compared with the era
      before MCS (1998-2006), waiting list mortality decreased from 44 to 21%, and is
      now mainly related to complications of VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Since the
      introduction of MCS-VAD, waiting list mortality halved and more children with
      end-stage heart failure survived to heart transplantation, thus improving
      outcome. Although there is substantial mortality and morbidity, overall mortality
      decreases, making MCS-VAD an essential therapeutic tool. The need for donor
      organs remains critically urgent.

PG  - 255-60
LID - 10.1017/S1047951113002126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with decompensated heart failure are at high risk for
      arrhythmias, and ventricular assist device placement is becoming a more common
      treatment strategy. The impact of ventricular assist devices on arrhythmias and
      how arrhythmias affect the clinical course of this population are not well
      described. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-centre retrospective analysis of
      children receiving a ventricular assist device between 1998 and 2011 was
      performed. In all, 45 patients received 56 ventricular assist devices. The median
      age at initial placement was 13 years (interquartile range 6-15). The median
      duration of support was 10 days (range 2-260). The aetiology of heart failure
      included cardiomyopathy, transplant rejection, myocarditis, and congenital heart 
      disease. In all, 32 patients (71%) had an arrhythmia; 19 patients (42%) had an
      arrhythmia before ventricular assist device and eight patients (18%) developed
      new arrhythmias on ventricular assist device. Ventricular tachycardia was most
      common (25/32, 78%). There was no correlation between arrhythmia and risk of
      death or transplantation (p=0.14). Of the 15 patients who weaned from ventricular
      assist device, post-ventricular assist device arrhythmias occurred in nine (60%),
      with five (33%) having their first arrhythmia after weaning. Patients with
      ventricular dysfunction after ventricular assist device were more likely to have 
      arrhythmias (p<0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Arrhythmias, especially ventricular, are
      common in children requiring ventricular assist device. They frequently persist
      for those able to wean from ventricular assist device.

TI  - Factors associated with anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies in patients
      supported with continuous-flow devices and effect on probability of transplant

AB  - BACKGROUND: One major disadvantage of ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy is 
      the development of human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. We aimed to identify
      factors associated with HLA antibodies during continuous flow (CF)-VAD support
      and assess the effect on transplant probability and outcomes. METHODS: We
      included 143 consecutive heart failure patients who received a CF-VAD as a
      bridge-to-transplant at 3 institutions. Factors associated with post-VAD peak
      panel reactive antibodies (PRA) among several measurements were identified using 
      multivariable linear regression. A parametric survival model was used to assess
      transplant waiting time and probability, risk of rejection, and a composite
      outcome of rejection, graft failure, and death. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients
      (25%) were female; mean age was 47 +/- 13 years. Eighty-one patients (57%) had a 
      pre-VAD PRA of 0%, and 16 were highly sensitized (PRA > 80%). Age, female sex,
      and pre-VAD PRA were independently associated with post-VAD PRA. A 10-year
      increase in age was associated with a 5% decrease in post-VAD PRA (p = 0.03).
      Post-VAD PRA was 19% higher in women vs men (p < 0.01). A 10%-increase in pre-VAD
      PRA was associated with a 4.7% higher post-VAD PRA (p < 0.01). During a mean
      follow-up of 12 +/- 11 months, 90 patients underwent cardiac transplantation. A
      20% increase in post-VAD PRA was associated with 13% lower probability of
      transplant (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.99). A high PRA
      was not associated with adverse post-transplant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Younger
      age, female sex, and pre-VAD PRA were independent predictors of elevated PRA
      post-VAD. Higher PRA was significantly associated with lower transplant
      probability but not increased rejection, graft failure, or death after
      transplant.

AB  - The number of heart transplants performed annually continues to increase
      gradually, and the number of adult candidates on the waiting list increased by
      34.2% from 2003 to 2013. The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates 
      peaked at 149.0 per 100 waitlist years in 2007 and has been declining since then;
      in 2013, the rate was 87.4 heart transplants per 100 active waitlist years.
      Increased waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase
      in waitlist mortality. Since 2008, the proportion of patients on life support
      before transplant increased from 53.4% to 65.8% in 2013. Medical urgency
      categories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgency
      categories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list 
      each year; the number of pediatric transplants performed each year increased from
      293 in 2003 to 411 in 2013. Patient survival among pediatric recipients continues
      to improve; 5-year patient survival for transplants performed from 2001 through
      2008 was 70% to 80%. Medicare paid for some or all of the care for 42.2% of all
      heart transplant recipients in 2012.

TI  - A new era of ventricular assist device surgery: less invasive procedures.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - As the number of patients suffering of congestive heart failure is rising
      worldwide, the use of mechanical circulatory support to treat these patients has 
      also grown enormously, surpassing the number of annual heart transplants.
      Moreover latest generation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is
      characterized by improved technologies. Moreover the size of new LVAD systems is 
      considerably reduced when compared to older generation devices. Therefore, less
      invasive surgery is now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange
      of LVADs. Although experience with these new techniques is still limited,
      minimally invasive procedures are thought to improve surgical outcomes by
      declining the rates of operative complications such as bleeding or wound
      infection. The miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive
      techniques will be used for most LVAD-related procedures in the future. In this
      article, we summarize and describe minimally invasive surgical techniques, with a
      focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) ventricular assist device has been
      approved for use in the United States as a bridge to heart transplantation in
      children. We sought to characterize neurological events in children supported
      with the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device. METHODS AND RESULTS: The multicenter
      prospective cohort consisted of all 204 children implanted with the Berlin Heart 
      EXCOR((R)) device at 47 centers in North America between May 2007 and December
      2010. There were 73 neurological events in 59 patients, with 29% of the cohort
      experiencing >/=1 neurological event. Events included 52 strokes in 43 patients
      (21% of the cohort). The neurological event rate was 0.51 events per 100
      patient-days. Many of the neurological events occurred early in the course of
      support, with 30 events recorded during the first 14 days of support. The
      mortality rate in participants with at least 1 neurological event was 42% (25 of 
      59), significantly higher than the 18% mortality rate (26 of 145) for those who
      did not have a neurological event (P=0.0006). Risk-factor analysis did not
      identify significant preimplantation predictors of neurological injury.
      CONCLUSIONS: Of children treated with the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device as a
      bridge to transplant, 29% experienced at least 1 neurological event. The majority
      of neurological events were ischemic strokes, and many of those occurred early in
      the course of support. Neurological injury was the leading cause of death after
      implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device. Risk stratification for
      stroke or neurological injury is not possible based on baseline preimplantation
      characteristics. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique

TI  - Outcome of mechanical cardiac support in children using more than one modality as
      a bridge to heart transplantationdagger
LID - ezu544 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanical cardiac support (MCS) can successfully be applied as a
      bridging strategy for heart transplantation (OHTx) in children with
      life-threatening heart failure. Emergent use of MCS is often required before
      establishing the likelihood of OHTx. This can require bridge-to-bridge strategies
      to increase survival on the waiting list. We compared the outcome of children
      with heart failure who underwent single MCS with those who required multiple MCS 
      as a bridge to OHTx. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients aged less than 16
      years was conducted. From March 1998 to October 2005, we used either a
      veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VA-ECMO), or the Medos(R)
      para-corporeal ventricular assist device (VAD). From November 2005 onwards, the
      Berlin Heart EXCOR(R) (BHE) device was implanted in the majority of cases.
      Several combinations of bridge-to-bridge strategies have been used: VA-ECMO and
      then conversion to BHE; BHE and then conversion to VA-ECMO; left VAD and then
      upgraded to biventricular support (BIVAD); conversion from pulsatile to
      continuous-flow pumps. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients received MCS with the
      intent to bridge to OHTx, including 21 (23%) supported with more than one
      modality. The mean age and weight at support was similar in both groups, but
      multimodality MCS was used more often in infancy (P = 0.008) and in children less
      than 10 kg in weight (P = 0.02). The mean duration of support was longer in the
      multiple MCS group: 40 +/- 48 vs 84 +/- 43 days (P = 0.0003). Usage of
      multimodality MCS in dilated cardiomyopathy (19%) and in other diagnoses (29%)
      was comparable. Incidence of major morbidity (haematological sequelae,
      cerebrovascular events and sepsis) was similar in both groups. Survival to
      OHTx/explantation of the device (recovery) and survival to discharge did not
      differ between single MCS and multiple MCS groups (78 vs 81% and 72 vs 76%,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Bridge to OHTx with multiple MCS does not seem to
      influence the outcome in our population. Infancy and body weight less than 10 kg 
      do not tend to produce higher mortality in the multiple MCS group. However,
      children receiving more than one modality are supported for longer durations.

TI  - HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device Placement in a Patient With Corrected
      Dextro-Transposition of Great Arteries: A Case Report and Its Clinical
      Challenges.
LID - 1089253214566886 [pii]
AB  - Given the improved survival in patients with corrected dextro-transposition of
      great arteries (D-TGA), it has evolved into an adult congenital heart defect. It 
      is important to understand the management and complications observed in this
      population that eventually progresses to systemic ventricular failure requiring
      cardiac transplantation. Our case focuses on the rapid right ventricle (RV)
      deterioration of a patient with corrected D-TGA following a surgical procedure
      requiring systemic support. With such patients awaiting heart transplantation,
      there are limited assist devices available for RV support and no right
      ventricular assist device is approved for destination therapy yet. Current
      indications for implantation of the HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD)
      are limited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the left ventricle
      support as a bridge to transplantation. However, its use in the United States for
      right-sided support has rarely been described for adult congenital defects. In
      this case, a HeartWare assist device was used to provide systemic support as a
      bridge to cardiac transplant. The size and implantation design of the HVAD makes 
      it a promising option for patients with this challenging patient population and
      RV failure as a late complication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Right heart failure (RHF) is an unresolved issue during
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. Little is known
      about post-transplant outcomes in patients complicated by late RHF during LVAD
      support. METHODS: Between May 2004 and December 2013, 141 patients underwent
      cardiac transplantation after isolated LVAD bridging at our center. Late RHF was 
      defined as heart failure requiring medical intervention >4 weeks after LVAD
      implantation. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 53 +/- 13 years, 82% were men, 
      and 36% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of LVAD support before
      transplantation was 0.75 years. Late RHF developed in 21 patients (15%) during
      LVAD support. Of these patients, 11 were supported with inotropic agents at the
      time of transplantation. Patients with RHF had higher creatinine (1.6 +/- 0.88
      mg/dL vs 1.3 +/- 0.67 mg/dL, p = 0.07), higher blood urea nitrogen (32 +/- 17
      mg/dL vs 24 +/- 10 mg/dL, p = 0.0013), higher total bilirubin (0.96 +/- 0.46
      mg/dL vs 0.78 +/- 0.42 mg/dL, p = 0.07), and lower albumin (3.8 +/- 0.60 g/dL vs 
      4.1 +/- 0.46 g/dL, p = 0.0019) at the time of transplantation compared with
      patients who did not develop RHF. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher 
      in patients with late RHF during LVAD support (29% vs 6.7%, p = 0.002). Overall
      post-transplant survival rates were 87% at 1 year, 83% at 3 years, and 77% at 5
      years. The 5-year post-transplant survival was significantly worse in patients
      who developed late RHF during LVAD support compared with survival in patients who
      did not develop RHF (26% vs 87%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Late RHF during LVAD
      support adversely affects post-transplant survival.

AB  - After implantation of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD),
      exercise capacity in heart failure patients remains reduced with peak oxygen
      uptake (peak VO2) values averaging from 11 to 20 ml/kg/min. Total cardiac output 
      in CF-LVAD patients during exercise is predominantly determined by pump speed,
      the pressure difference across the pump, and in some cases ejection through the
      aortic valve. Fixed pump speed utilized in CF-LVADs may provide insufficient
      support, resulting in a moderate cardiac output increase during increased
      physical strain. Ongoing studies are evaluating whether pump speed changes in
      response to varied loading conditions may enable LVADs to provide sufficient
      support even during strenuous exercise. In the currently used devices, evidence
      suggests that focus on optimizing non-cardiac peripheral parameters is vital.
      Extra-cardiac potentially reversible factors are anemia with low oxygen-carrying 
      capacity, obesity and general deconditioning with low muscle mass. In addition,
      exercise training in CF-LVAD patients can improve peak VO2. To design
      interventions to improve functional capacity in patients treated with modern
      durable LVADs, a detailed understanding of exercise physiology in a
      continuous-flow circulatory system is necessary. In this review we address the
      different components of exercise physiology in LVAD patients and point out
      potential solutions or areas of future research.

TI  - Application of a search algorithm using stochastic behaviors to autonomous
      control of a ventricular assist device.
PG  - 290-3
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943586 [doi]
AB  - A ventricular assist device (VAD) is a device with mechanical pumps implanted
      adjacent to the patient's native heart to support the blood flow. Mechanical
      circulatory support using VADs has been an essential therapeutic tool for
      patients with severe heart failure waiting for a heart transplant in clinical
      site. Adaptive control of VADs that automatically adjust the pump output with
      changes in a patient state is one of the important approaches for enhanced
      therapeutic efficacy, prevention of complications and quality of life
      improvement. However adaptively controlling a VAD in the realistic situation
      would be difficult because it is necessary to model the whole including the VAD
      and the cardiovascular dynamics. To solve this problem, we propose an application
      of attractor selection algorithm using stochastic behavior to a VAD control
      system. In this study, we sought to investigate whether this proposed method can 
      be used to adaptively control of a VAD in the simple case of a continuous flow
      VAD. The flow rate control algorithm was constructed on the basis of a
      stochastically searching algorithm as one example of application. The validity of
      the constructed control algorithm was examined in a mock circuit. As a result, in
      response to a low-flow state with the different causes, the flow rate of the pump
      reached a target value with self adaptive behavior without designing the detailed
      control rule based on the experience or the model of the control target.

TI  - Extracorporeal life support as a bridge to bridge: a strategy to optimize
      ventricular assist device results.
LID - ezu516 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) devices provide temporary
      mechanical circulatory assistance and are usually implanted under emergency
      conditions in critical patients. If weaning off ECLS is not possible, heart
      transplantation or implantation of long-term mechanical circulatory support
      (LTMCS) is required. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the
      bridge-to-bridge (BTB) concept. METHODS: Between 1 January 2004 and 1 August
      2010, 97 patients were assisted by LTMCS. The implantation was the first-line
      intervention in 48 patients (the bridge group), and was performed after a period 
      of ECLS support in 49 others (the BTB group). RESULTS: The long-term survival
      rate was 51.6%, with a mean follow-up of 30.7 months, and there were no
      differences for biological parameters between the two groups. Patients in the BTB
      group whose condition was initially more severe, improved under ECLS support, and
      those in whom biological parameters did not revert to normal died after LTMCS.
      Risk factors for mortality in the BTB group were total bilirubin and lactate
      before LTMCS, and alkaline phosphatase before ECLS support. CONCLUSIONS: The BTB 
      concept allows the implementation of LTMCS in severe patients, for whom it was
      not originally envisaged, with the same long-term survival as in first-line
      settings. ECLS in the evolution of patients is predictive of survival after
      LTMCS.

TI  - Why pulsatility still matters: a review of current knowledge.
PG  - 609-20
AB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become standard
      therapy option for patients with advanced heart failure. They offer several
      advantages over previously used pulsatile-flow LVADs, including improved
      durability, less surgical trauma, higher energy efficiency, and lower
      thrombogenicity. These benefits translate into better survival, lower frequency
      of adverse events, improved quality of life, and higher functional capacity of
      patients. However, mounting evidence shows unanticipated consequences of
      continuous-flow support, such as acquired aortic valve insufficiency and acquired
      von Willebrand syndrome. In this review article we discuss current evidence on
      differences between continuous and pulsatile mechanical circulatory support, with
      a focus on clinical implications and potential benefits of pulsatile flow.

TI  - Ventricular assist device selection: which one and when?
PG  - 596-9
AB  - Advances in mechanical circulatory support have significantly expanded the
      treatment options for patients with heart failure, whether acute or chronic.
      There are numerous devices available that offer patients short-, intermediate-,
      and long-term duration of support depending on their clinical needs and cardiac
      recovery. Each device has its own technical considerations and the decision which
      device to use depends on several factors, including what is available, the degree
      of support required, and expected duration of support. Additional issues that
      need to be considered in choosing level of support include right heart function, 
      respiratory failure, and multi-organ derangements. A widespread availability of
      short-term ventricular assist devices and timely institution for effective
      hemodynamic support will translate into improved patient outcomes whether that is
      successful transfer to a tertiary care facility or recovery of inherent cardiac
      function. Implantable ventricular assist devices have and will continue to evolve
      into smaller and more durable devices, and the future for patients with advanced 
      heart failure looks ever-more promising.

TI  - Around and around the merry-go-round: multiple implantations of short- and
      long-term ventricular assist devices in a patient with severe heart failure.
AB  - Multiple implantations of left ventricular assist devices over a period of three 
      years were performed in a 17-year-old gentleman with non-ischaemic dilated
      cardiomyopathy and congestive cardiac failure. The first device (HeartMate II)
      was implanted as a bridge to transplantation. However, after few months of
      support the patient showed signs of myocardial recovery and the device was
      successfully explanted. After 2 years of uneventful follow-up, the patient's
      condition deteriorated requiring further mechanical support. Due to the elevated 
      risk associated with a redo full-support LVAD implantation, we decided to implant
      a partial support device (Synergy(R) CircuLite). Because of recurrent pump
      thrombosis requiring device exchange, the final weeks to transplantation were
      bridged with CentriMag(R) short-term LVAD. After successful cardiac
      transplantation the patient required further temporary extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation support which was weaned off and explanted on the fourth
      postoperative day. After further uncomplicated postoperative recovery the patient
      was discharged and has been doing well for 1 year of follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The evolution of pharmacologic therapies and mechanical support
      including ventricular assist devices (VADs) has broadened the scope of care
      available to children with advanced heart failure. At the present time, there are
      only limited means of quantifying disease severity or the concomitant morbidity
      for this population. This study describes the development of a novel pediatric
      treatment intensity score (TIS), designed to quantify the burden of illness and
      clinical trajectory in children on VAD support. METHODS: There were 5 clinical
      domains assessed: nutrition, respiratory support, activity level, cardiovascular 
      medications, and care environment. A scale was developed through expert
      consensus. Higher scores indicate greater morbidity as reflected by intensity of 
      medical management. To evaluate feasibility and face validity, the TIS was
      applied retrospectively to a subset of pediatric inpatients with VADs. The
      Bland-Altman method was used to assess limits of agreement. RESULTS: The study
      comprised 39 patients with 42 implantations. Bland-Altman interobserver and
      intraobserver comparisons showed good agreement (mean differences in scores of
      0.02, limits of agreement +/-0.12). Trends in TIS were concordant with the
      overall clinical impression of improvement. Scores remained >/=0.6 preceding VAD 
      implantation and peaked at 0.71 3 days after VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: We
      describe a pediatric VAD scoring tool, to assess global patient morbidity and
      clinical recovery. We demonstrate feasibility of using this TIS in a test
      population of inpatients on VAD support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular failure (RVF) is associated with significant
      morbidity after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) surgery. Hemodynamic,
      clinical, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic variables poorly discriminate
      patients at risk of RVF. We examined the utility of 3-dimensional
      echocardiography (3DE) right ventricular (RV) volumetric assessment to identify
      patients at risk for RVF. METHODS AND RESULTS: RVF was defined as the need for
      inotropic infusion for >14 days after LVAD surgery or the need for biventricular 
      assist device support. Preoperative RV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were
      measured, blinded to clinical data, from transthoracic 3DE full volume data sets 
      in 26 patients. Baseline variables and 3DE RV indices were compared between
      patients with and without RVF. Twenty-four patients received continuous-flow
      LVADs, and 2 required biventricular support devices. Ten patients required
      prolonged inotropes after LVAD placement. Baseline characteristics associated
      with RVF included higher right atrial pressure, higher right atrial pressure to
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio, and lower cardiac index and RV stroke
      work index (RVSWI). Echocardiographic indices associated with RVF included 3DE
      indexed RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDVI and RVESVI) and RV
      ejection fraction (RVEF). The relationship between 3DE quantification of RV
      volumes and the development of RVF was independent from RVSWI: RVEDVI: odds ratio
      (OR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.33 (P = .04); RVESVI: OR 1.14, 95%
      CI 1.01-1.28 (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 3DE is a promising method for
      pre-LVAD RV assessment. RV volumes assessed by 3DE are predictive of RVF in LVAD 
      recipients independently from hemodynamic correlates of RV function.

PG  - 323-35
LID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9468-1 [doi]
AB  - Although heart transplantation remains the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart
      failure, its epidemiological impact is limited by donor organ availability.
      Surgical and device-based approaches have been introduced with the aim of
      increasing systemic perfusion and in some circumstances promoting left
      ventricular recovery by inducing reverse remodelling. Innovative counterpulsation
      devices based on the established principle of the intra-aortic balloon pump have 
      been developed, and of these, the CardioVad and the C-Pulse System have been
      introduced in clinical practice with convincing evidence of haemodynamic
      efficacy. The evolution from pulsatile to continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      devices has been associated with improved survival rates during the first 2 years
      of support with the potential of matching heart transplantation outcomes.
      However, blood contact with the device remains a significant challenge despite
      the highly sophisticated technology currently available. Innovative
      extra-vascular counterpulsation devices have been shown to overcome the
      limitations of the intra-aortic balloon pump and rend the device suitable for
      prolonged support. Monitoring of the performance of these novel devices is
      essential, and carotid Doppler ultrasonography is of utility in assessing the
      haemodynamic performance of the devices in a clinical setting. Computational
      modelling has played a role in the simulation of these devices and should
      continue to assist with their optimisation and implementation in clinical
      practice.

AB  - Due to shortages in donor organ availability, advanced heart-failure patients are
      at high risk of further decompensation and often death while awaiting
      transplantation. This shortage has led to the development of effective mechanical
      circulatory support (MCS). Currently, various implantable ventricular-assist
      devices (VADs) are able to provide temporary or long-term circulatory support for
      many end-stage heart-failure patients. Implantation of a total artificial heart
      (TAH) currently represents the surgical treatment option for patients requiring
      biventricular MCS as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT).
      However, the clinical applicability of available versions of positive
      displacement pumps is limited by their size and associated complications.
      Application of advanced technology is aimed at solving some of these issues,
      attempting to develop a new generation of smaller and more effective TAHs to suit
      a wider patient population. Particular targets for improvement include
      modifications to the biocompatibility of device designs and materials in order to
      decrease hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. Meanwhile, new systems to 
      power implanted driving units which are fully operational without interruption of
      skin barriers represent a potential means of decreasing the risk of infections.
      In this review, we will discuss the history of the TAH, its development and
      clinical application, the implications of the existing technological solutions,
      published outcomes and the future outlook for TAHs.

TI  - Comparison of continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow left ventricular assist devices:
      is there an advantage to pulsatility?
PG  - 573-81
LID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CFVAD) are currently
      the most widely used type of mechanical circulatory support as
      bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy for end-stage congestive heart
      failure (HF). Compared to the first generation pulsatile-flow left ventricular
      assist devices (PFVADs), CFVADs have demonstrated improved reliability and
      durability. However, CFVADs have also been associated with certain complications 
      thought to be linked with decreased arterial pulsatility. Previous studies
      comparing CFVADs and PFVADs have presented conflicting results. It is important
      to understand the outcome differences between CFVAD and PFVAD in order to further
      advance the current VAD technology. METHODS: In this review, we compared the
      outcomes of CFVADs and PFVADs and examined the need for arterial pulsatility for 
      the future generation of mechanical circulatory support. RESULTS: CVADs offer
      advantages of smaller size, increased reliability and durability, and subsequent 
      improvements in survival. However, with the increasing duration of long-term
      support, it appears that CFVADs may have specific complications and a lower rate 
      of left ventricular recovery associated with diminished pulsatility, increased
      pressure gradients on the aortic valve and decreased compliance in smaller
      arterial vessels. PFVAD support or pulsatility control algorithms in CFVADs could
      be beneficial and potentially necessary for long term support. CONCLUSIONS: Given
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of CFVADs and PFVADs, the ultimate
      solution may lie in incorporating pulsatility into current and emerging CFVADs
      whilst retaining their existing benefits. Future studies examining physiologic
      responses, end-organ function and LV remodeling at varying degrees of pulsatility
      and device support levels are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are becoming an increasingly 
      viable alternative therapy for heart failure, either as a bridge to heart
      transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy (DT). The latter has become
      increasingly popular in recent years, in the face of a donor organ shortage and a
      rise in elderly patients ineligible for heart transplants. For these patients in 
      particular, device durability is a key contributor to survival, morbidity, and
      quality of life. This systematic review aimed to assess the long-term durability 
      of current continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched
      from their dates of inception to August 2014 for original studies reporting on
      patients receiving continuous-flow LVADs. LVAD failure was defined as device
      malfunction necessitating exchange or explantation, or causing patient mortality.
      Pooled averages were calculated for outcomes and rates of device failure were
      reconstructed from digitized graph curves using the software, WebPlotDigitizer
      v3.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective observational studies with a total of 5,471
      patients were included for analysis. The mean duration of LVAD support was 504.7 
      (range, 303-568) days, and the overall weighted incidence of device failure was
      3.9% (range, 1-11.3%). On average, pump thrombosis was the most common cause of
      device failure (50.5%), followed by lead or cable damage (21.7%), mechanical pump
      failure (11.6%), device-related infection (11.1%), and surgical complications
      from implantation (2.5%). Long-term device failure rates at 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 
      24-months post-implantation were 0.5%, 1.8%, 2.9%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: With the expected rise in LVAD usage for end-stage heart failure,
      particularly as a DT, the steady minority of patients experiencing device failure
      is likely to increase. Further investigation is required into the incidence and
      mechanism of major causes of failure, as well as design improvements that may
      address these complications. There is currently a lack of guidelines and large
      randomized studies reporting on the etiology and outcomes of LVAD failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are currently no well-defined, evidence-based guidelines for
      management of end-stage heart failure in patients over 65, and the decisions to
      use mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist device (LVAD),
      either as a bridge to transplantation or destination therapy, or isolated heart
      transplantation (HTx) remain controversial. We aimed to compare the outcomes
      after the implementation of three heart replacement strategies in this high-risk 
      population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients
      between the ages of 65 and 72 receiving a continuous-flow LVAD as bridge to
      transplantation or destination therapy or isolated HTx at our center between 2005
      and 2012. The patients were stratified according to treatment strategy into three
      groups: group D (destination LVAD, n = 23), group B (bridge to transplantation
      LVAD, n = 43), and group H (HTx alone, n = 47). The primary outcomes of interest 
      were survival to discharge and 2-year overall survival. RESULTS: The patients in 
      group D were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of ischemic
      cardiomyopathy, and had a higher pulmonary vascular resistance than did patients 
      in groups B or H. There were no significant differences between groups in
      survival to discharge (87% D vs 83.7% B vs 87.2% H, p = 0.88) or 2-year overall
      survival (75.7% D vs 68.7% B vs 80.9% H, log-rank p = 0.47). The incidence rates 
      of readmission were 1.1 events/patient.year in group D and 0.5
      events/patient.year in group H. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference 
      in perioperative, short-term, and medium-term survival between the treatment
      groups. However, the LVAD patients had a higher incidence of readmission. Larger 
      trials are needed to refine differences in long-term survival, quality of life,
      and resource utilization for elderly patients requiring heart replacement
      therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In obese patients with heart failure, weight reduction may be
      difficult due to physical restrictions, but may be necessary to achieve heart
      transplant candidacy. We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwent
      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile
      (HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and the
      effect on body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) who
      underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for
      weight change. In the 30-day survivors, end points of the study were continued
      LVAD support, heart transplant, or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass
      surgery and was excluded. RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria,
      BMI was 35.6 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 +/- 5.5
      kg/m(2) (mean BMI change -2.5 kg/m(2); P = .063), with a mean follow-up time of
      301.6 +/- 255.5 days. The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9
      kg/m(2) (P = .016 vs baseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1 kg/m(2)
      increase in BMI. BMI <30 kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21%), 5
      of 19 (26%) in XVE group, and 1 of 9 (11%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 
      XVE, 2 HMII) or 50% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was
      4.6 kg/m(2) (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30
      kg/m(2) provided significant weight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in
      recipients of the continuous flow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a
      heart transplant after LVAD insertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6 kg/m(2) (P =
      .003). LVAD implantation provides a period of hemodynamic support for obese
      patients with advanced heart failure, during which time opportunity may be
      available for weight loss. Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater
      weight loss than nonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may
      be necessary to achieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous
      flow LVAD.

TI  - Uncovering the cathepsin system in heart failure patients submitted to Left
      Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implantation.
PG  - 350
LID - 10.1186/s12967-014-0350-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In end-stage heart failure (HF), the implantation of a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) is able to induce reverse remodeling. Cellular
      proteases, such as cathepsins, are involved in the progression of HF. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the role of cathepsin system in HF patients supported 
      by LVAD, in order to determine their involvement in cardiac remodeling. METHODS: 
      The expression of cysteine (CatB, CatK, CatL, CatS) and serine cathepsin (CatG), 
      and relative inhibitors (Cystatin B, C and SerpinA3, respectively) was determined
      in cardiac biopsies of 22 patients submitted to LVAD (pre-LVAD) and compared
      with: 1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at the moment of
      heart transplantation without prior LVAD (HT, n = 7); 2) patients supported by
      LVAD at the moment of transplantation (post-LVAD, n = 6). RESULTS: The expression
      of cathepsins and their inhibitors was significantly higher in pre-LVAD compared 
      to the HT group and LVAD induced a further increase in the cathepsin system.
      Significant positive correlations were observed between cardiac expression of
      cathepsins and their inhibitors as well as inflammatory cytokines. In the
      pre-LVAD group, a relationship of cathepsins with dilatative etiology and length 
      of hospitalization was found. CONCLUSIONS: A parallel activation of cathepsins
      and their inhibitors was observed after LVAD support. The possible clinical
      importance of these modifications is confirmed by their relation with patients'
      outcome. A better discovery of these pathways could add more insights into the
      cardiac remodeling during HF.

AB  - Patients with ambulatory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure
      were significantly underrepresented in clinical trials of cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT). The natural long-term trajectory of survival
      free of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant in patients
      with ambulatory class IV symptoms who underwent CRT has not been established. We 
      extracted clinical data on 723 consecutive patients with NYHA class III or
      ambulatory class IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction </=35%, and
      a QRS duration >/=120 ms who underwent CRT from September 30, 2003, to August 6, 
      2007. Chart notes immediately before CRT were reviewed to confirm NYHA class
      status before CRT. Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox proportional
      hazards model were constructed to determine long-term survival free of heart
      transplant and LVAD based on NYHA class status. Of the 723 patients, 52 had
      ambulatory class IV symptoms. Over a mean follow-up of 5.0 +/- 2.5 years
      controlling for many possible confounders, ambulatory NYHA class IV status was
      independently associated with poor long-term outcomes. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and
      5-year survival free of LVAD or heart transplant for class III versus ambulatory 
      class IV patients was 92.0%, 84.0%, 75.0%, 68.1%, and 63.2% versus 75.0%, 61.5%, 
      52.0%, 45%, and 40.4%, respectively. Although patients with ambulatory class IV
      heart failure receiving CRT have inferior long-term outcomes compared with those 
      with class III symptoms, survival in class IV patients continues to parallel
      class III patients over an extended follow-up. At 5 years, survival free of LVAD 
      or heart transplant in ambulatory class IV patients receiving CRT is 40%.

AB  - CONTEXT: Understanding the experience of caring for an adult with a
      left-ventricular assist device as a destination therapy (LVAD-DT) remains in its 
      infancy. OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: A hermeneutic-phenomenological inquiry guided by van
      Manen's methods was used to explore the LVAD-DT family caregiving
      experience.Participants/Setting-Seven family caregivers (1 man and 6 women) 50 to
      74 years old who cared for an adult with an LVAD-DT in home settings. Recruitment
      and data collection occurred in an outpatient mechanical circulatory support
      center in the Midwest. METHODS: Data were collected by means of face-to-face
      interviews using open-ended questions and 1 follow-up interview. Interviews were 
      audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis consisted of writing, 
      rewriting, and reflecting across participants' data, which produced themes
      illustrating the experience and meaning of caring for an adult with an LVAD-DT.
      Themes were consensually validated. Procedures for trustworthiness are described.
      RESULTS: Five main themes were identified from participants' experiences: (1)
      advanced heart failure is a life-changing event, (2) self-doubt about LVAD
      caregiving improves over time, (3) lifestyle adjustments come with time, (4)
      persistent worry and stress, and (5) caregiving is not a burden-it's a part of
      life. These main themes were elucidated by 8 subthemes in which participants
      described a process of adjustment despite persistent worry and stress and
      eventually accepted caregiving as part of their lives. Future studies are needed 
      to explore caregiver burden, adaptation, and the effects of caregiving outcomes, 
      such as emotional and physical health and overall quality of life.

TI  - Post-heart transplantation outcome of HeartMate II-bridged recipients requiring
      unplanned concomitant temporary right ventricular mechanical support.
PG  - 372-8
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivu408 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Second-generation axial-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) 
      have become an established therapy in bridging end-stage heart failure patients
      to cardiac transplantation. Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,
      some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We 
      sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II
      (HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure 
      and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD. METHODS:
      This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patients transplanted during 
      2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were divided into two groups
      according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) or required
      additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were compared for
      early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major early
      post-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival. RESULTS: Early graft
      loss was 10.7% in isolated HMII and 25% in HMII + RVAD patients (P = 0.26). There
      were no observed differences in the rates of primary graft dysfunction (7.3 vs
      0%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25%, P =
      0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary artery resistance (odds ratio: 3.286,
      95% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant
      predictor for adverse outcome of mechanically-bridged heart transplant
      recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 +/- 5% in isolated HMII and 75 
      +/- 15% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate
      that heart transplant recipients who required unplanned RV mechanical support
      after LVAD implantation achieved comparable rates of early graft loss,
      post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged
      with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-year graft survival was
      equivalent between those two groups. Given the small sample size, further studies
      involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare left ventricular assist device (HVAD; HeartWare Inc,
      Framingham, MA) was first implanted in Canada in 2010. We performed a multicentre
      analysis of the real world outcomes associated with its use. METHODS: Between May
      2010 and January 2013, 4 Canadian centres inserted a total of 72 HVADs in 71
      patients. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively for the 
      1-year estimate of the principal outcome of transplant, explant for recovery, or 
      death in patients who had a bridge to transplantation indication. Adverse event
      rates were estimated as events per patient-year (PPY). RESULTS: In the 67
      patients who received the HVAD with the indication of bridge to transplant, 26
      (38.8%) received a successful transplant, 2 (3%) received an explant for
      recovery, and 10 (14.9%) patients died during support. Median follow-up time with
      the HVAD was 6.9 months (range, 2 days to 30.4 months). Despite having 74% of the
      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 
      (INTERMACS) scores of level 1 and 2 at the time of implantation, the rate
      estimate for survival at 1 year was 86.3% (95% confidence interval, 76.7-93.3).
      With 48.2 total patient years of support, the rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic
      strokes were 0.21 and 0.19 events PPY, respectively. Women made up 40% of the
      cohort and an adverse neurologic event occurred with an event rate of 0.38 PPY in
      women. CONCLUSIONS: The HVAD adequately supports acutely ill heart failure
      patients until the time of transplant or recovery. A high incidence of adverse
      neurologic outcomes might be related to the large percentage of female patients, 
      the high INTERMACS levels, or unknown factors; further surveillance is required.

AB  - Although high body mass index (BMI) is associated with improved outcomes in
      established heart failure (HF), the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness on this
      obesity paradox is less clear. We studied 1,675 patients with systolic HF who
      underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at a single university center (77.4%
      men, mean age 52.2 +/- 11.6 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 23.2
      +/- 7.1% and New York Heart Association class III or IV in 79.1%). We evaluated
      2-year survival in patients stratified by both BMI (normal 18.5 to 24.9
      kg/m(2)[reference], overweight 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2), obese >/=30.0 kg/m(2)) and by 
      peak oxygen uptake (PKVO2; high >14 ml/kg/minute, low </=14 ml/kg/minute). At 2
      years, BMI category was significantly associated with outcomes for the low PKVO2 
      group (p <0.001) but not the high PKVO2 group (p = 0.1). In the low PKVO2 group, 
      obese patients had decreased risk of death free from urgent status 1A heart
      transplant or ventricular assist device placement after multivariate adjustment
      compared with normal BMI (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      0.44 to 0.91, p = 0.01); no significant difference was observed for overweight
      patients (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.25, p = 0.5). In the high PKVO2 group, no
      relation was seen (overweight BMI HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32, p = 0.3; obese HR
      0.87, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.75, p = 0.7). In conclusion, the obesity paradox was only 
      observed in patients with lower cardiorespiratory fitness in this advanced
      systolic HF cohort, indicating that improved functional capacity may attenuate
      the obesity paradox.

TI  - Does CircuLite Synergy assist device as partial ventricular support have a place 
      in modern management of advanced heart failure?
PG  - 49-60
LID - 10.1586/17434440.2015.985208 [doi]
AB  - The discrepancy between the number of patients on the waiting list and available 
      donor hearts has led to the successful development of left ventricular assist
      devices (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation. The conventional LVADs are
      designed to provide full hemodynamic support for the end-stage failing heart.
      However, full-support LVAD implantation requires major surgery, sternotomy and
      cardiopulmonary bypass in majority of cases. The Synergy Micro-pump is the
      smallest implantable LVAD and provides partial flow support up to 3 l/min. It was
      shown that early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits
      to patients with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support
      LVAD. Due the small dimensions it can be implanted without cardiopulmonary bypass
      or a sternotomy. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical use of the
      Synergy Micro-pump as partial hemodynamic support.

AB  - The Jarvik-2000 is a non-pulsatile axial-flow left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) that is largely used in patients who present in end-stage heart failure,
      as a bridge to transplant support or destination therapy. From its first
      utilization, several implantation techniques have been elaborated, starting from 
      a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support and moving towards 
      a minimally invasive access with an off-pump strategy. Here we present the
      favored surgical technique used in our department to implant the Jarvik-2000, in 
      a step-by-step fashion.

AB  - Advanced heart failure is an increasing problem worldwide. Nowadays, mechanical
      circulatory support devices (MSCD) are an established therapeutic option for
      terminal heart failure after exhaustion of medical and conventional surgical
      treatment, and are becoming a realistic alternative to heart transplantation
      (HTX). There are a number of different treatment options for these patients, such
      as bridge to transplantation (BTT), bridge to candidacy (BTC), bridge to recovery
      (BTR) and the destination therapy (DT) option. The latter option has become more 
      frequent throughout the last years, due to a donor organ shortage and an
      increasing number of older patients with terminal heart failure who are not
      eligible for HTX. These factors have led to a rapidly increasing number of LVAD
      implantations as well as centers which perform these procedures. This has also
      been due to improved LVAD survival rates and quality of life following the
      introduction of smaller, intrapericardial and more durable continuous flow left
      ventricular devices. The most common complications for these patients are
      device-related problems, such as coagulation disorders, gastrointestinal
      bleeding, device related infection, pump thrombosis or cerebrovascular accidents.
      However, some questions still remain unanswered or under debate, such as the
      exact time-point for LVAD implantation. In addition, aspects such as better
      biocompatibility for LVADs remain a major challenge. This review will concentrate
      on DT for terminal heart failure and provide an overview of the current evidence 
      for LVAD implantation in this patient group, with particular emphasis on
      indication and time-point of implantation, choice of LVADs, and long term
      outcomes and quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly being used
      to treat patients in end-stage heart failure (HF) as bridge-to-transplantation,
      lifetime support or destination therapy. However, the importance of this newer
      technique for chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still 
      open to discussion. To date, there are few studies that extensively explore the
      psychological and cognitive profiles of patient with ventricular assist devices
      (VADs). METHODS: We studied the psychological aspects, quality of life (QOL) and 
      cognitive profiles of 19 patients with HF before VAD implantation and then at
      two, five and 16 months post-implantation. RESULTS: Our results showed that after
      VAD implantation, patients did not show any psychopathological problems such as
      anxiety and/or depression. More interestingly, despite the constant risk of
      neurological events determined by the continuous-blood-flow pump (CBFP),
      patients' cognitive functioning did not worsen. In fact, significant enhancements
      were observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and cognitive deficits are
      common in advanced HF and often worsen over time. Appropriately designed and
      randomized studies are needed to demonstrate whether earlier VAD implantation is 
      warranted to arrest cognitive decline and encourage better post-implantation
      adaptation.

TI  - Rotary pump speed modulation for generating pulsatile flow and phasic left
      ventricular volume unloading in a bovine model of chronic ischemic heart failure.

LID - S1053-2498(14)01352-7 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotary blood pumps operate at a constant speed (rpm) that diminishes 
      vascular pulsatility and variation in ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic 
      volumes, which may contribute to adverse events, including aortic insufficiency
      and gastrointestinal bleeding. In this study, pump speed modulation algorithms
      for generating pulsatility and variation in ventricular end-systolic and
      end-diastolic volumes were investigated in an ischemic heart failure (IHF) bovine
      model (n = 10) using a clinically implanted centrifugal-flow left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD). METHODS: Hemodynamic and hematologic measurements were
      recorded during IHF baseline, constant pumps speeds, and asynchronous (19-60
      cycles/min) and synchronous (copulse and counterpulse) pump speed modulation
      profiles using low relative pulse speed (+/-25%) of 3,200 +/- 800 rpm and high
      relative pulse speed (+/-38%) of 2,900 +/- 1,100 rpm. End-organ perfusion,
      hemodynamics, and pump parameters were measured to characterize pulsatility,
      myocardial workload, and LVAD performance for each speed modulation profile.
      RESULTS: Speed modulation profiles augmented aortic pulse pressure, surplus
      hemodynamic energy, and end-organ perfusion (p < 0.01) compared with operation at
      constant speed. Left ventricular external work and myocardial oxygen consumption 
      were significantly reduced compared with IHF baseline (p < 0.01) but at the
      expense of higher LVAD power consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Pump speed modulation
      increases pulsatility and improves cardiac function and end-organ perfusion, but 
      the asynchronous mode provides the technologic advantage of sensorless control.
      Investigation of asynchronous pump speed modulation during long-term support is
      warranted to test the hypothesis that operating an LVAD with speed modulation
      will minimize adverse events in patients supported by an LVAD that may be
      associated with long-term operation at a constant pump speed.

LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.09.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential for myocardial reconditioning and device explantation
      after long-term continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support
      presents an opportunity to delay or avoid transplantation in select patients.
      METHODS: Thirty of 657 patients with end-stage heart failure supported with
      continuous-flow LVADs were assessed for device explantation. Each patient
      underwent an individualized process of weaning focused on principles of
      ventricular unloading, gradual reconditioning, and transition to medical therapy.
      RESULTS: After varying reconditioning periods, 27 patients (16 men, 11 women;
      age, 39 +/- 12 years) underwent LVAD explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman;
      age, 22 +/- 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. The
      duration of LVAD support was 533 +/- 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for the
      explant cohort and 1,097 +/- 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explant
      cohort. The LV end-diastolic dimension, LV ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary 
      artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort were
      significantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). Two late deaths occurred 
      after LVAD explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1
      patient required resumption of LVAD support 2.7 years after device removal. The
      remaining explant patients remain in New York Heart Association classes I to II
      with medical management alone (mean survival post-explant, 1,172 +/- 948 days).
      The 3 candidates who could not be weaned ultimately underwent transplantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: The potential for recovery of native LV function after long-term
      continuous-flow LVAD support should encourage a more aggressive approach to
      ventricular reconditioning with the goal of device explantation and a return to
      medical management, particularly in young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the early and late outcomes after cardiac
      transplantation in patients receiving long-term continuous-flow left ventricular 
      assist device (CF-LVAD) support. METHODS: Between April 2004 and September 2013, 
      192 patients underwent HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) CF-LVAD placement 
      as a bridge to transplant at our center. Of these, 122 (63%) successfully bridged
      patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups
      according to their waiting time with CF-LVAD support of <1 year or >/=1 year.
      RESULTS: The study cohort was a mean age of 54 +/- 13 years, 79% were male, and
      35% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of CF-LVAD support before
      transplantation was 296 days (range, 27-1,413 days). The overall 30-day mortality
      was 4.1%. Overall post-transplant survival was 88%, 84%, 78% at 1, 3, and 5
      years, respectively. The 32 patients (26%) with >/=1 year of CF-LVAD support
      (mean, 635 days) were more likely to have blood type O, a larger body size, and
      to have been readmitted due to recurrent heart failure and device failure
      requiring exchange than those with <1 year of CF-LVAD support. Patients who
      required prolonged support time also had worse in-hospital mortality (16% vs
      6.7%, p = 0.12) and significantly lower survival at 3 years after transplantation
      (68% vs 88%, p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: The overall short-term and long-term
      cardiac transplant outcomes of patients supported with CF-LVAD are satisfactory. 
      However, patients who require prolonged CF-LVAD support may have diminished
      post-transplant survival due to adverse events occurring during device support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with the HeartMate II 
      (HMII) left ventricular assist device (LVAD), but the impact of AF on clinical
      outcomes is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of
      AF on outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD. METHODS: Records of 106 patients
      who underwent HMII implantation at a single center were reviewed. The
      associations of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and persistent atrial
      fibrillation (PeAF) with survival, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, bleeding, 
      and thromboembolism were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox
      proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 56.6 +/- 11.4 years, 87.7%
      of the implants were intended as a bridge to transplantation, and median length
      of support was 217 days (range: 1 to 952 days). AF was present in 55 patients
      (51.9%); 36 patients (34.0%) had PAF and 19 (17.9%) had PeAF. Twenty-one patients
      (19.8%) died, and 18 (17.0%) were hospitalized for HF. There were 0.75 major
      bleeding events and 0.28 thromboembolic events per patient year of follow-up. PAF
      was not associated with increased mortality, HF hospitalization, bleeding, or
      thromboembolism. PeAF, however, was an independent predictor of the composite
      endpoint of death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 3.54; 95% confidence
      interval: 1.52 to 8.25; p < 0.01). Although there was no increase in bleeding or 
      thromboembolism, patients with AF had thromboembolic events at higher
      international normalized ratios (INRs). CONCLUSIONS: Although PAF is not
      associated with worse outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD, PeAF may be
      associated with increased mortality and HF hospitalization. Patients with AF also
      may have thromboembolic events at higher INR levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The systemic morphologic right ventricle (RV) in congenitally
      corrected transposition of the great arteries or after atrial switch for
      transposition of the great arteries is associated with late ventricular failure. 
      Although the role of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in supporting the 
      failing LV is established, the indications and outcomes of using LVAD in a
      systemic RV remain unclear. We assessed the role of a third-generation LVAD for
      systemic RV support. METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 36 years) received the
      HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) VAD for systemic RV
      failure (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries in 1 and
      after atrial switch in 6). Four patients (57%) had severe subpulmonic LV failure,
      and aggressive perioperative diuresis with or without hemofiltration was used to 
      offload the subpulmonic LV. The indications of VAD were (1) bridge to transplant 
      in 3 and (2) bridge to decision for a high transpulmonary gradient in 4.
      Transplantation outcome was compared with systemic RV failure without VAD bridge 
      in 19 patients (years 1989 to 2013). RESULTS: Systemic RV support alone was
      achieved in all patients, with no early deaths (</=30 days). Overall, 6 (86%)
      returned home, 3 (44%) received a transplant, 2 (28%) died of noncardiac causes, 
      and 2 (28%) continue on VAD support (median support, 232 days). Repeat
      catheterization (n = 4) showed an improved median transpulmonary gradient in 3
      patients (median 18.5 mm Hg pre-VAD vs 8.0 mm Hg post-VAD). Two
      bridge-to-decision patients received transplants at 640 and 685 days. The stroke 
      rate on VAD support was 43% (2 thromboembolic and 1 hemorrhagic; 3 with
      satisfactory recovery). De novo aortic regurgitation was 29% (n = 2; 1 valve
      replacement). All patients (n = 3) survived transplantation (vs 10.5% early
      mortality without VAD bridge; p = 1.00) and were well at follow-up (range, 53 to 
      700 days). CONCLUSIONS: The third-generation VAD provides durable support for
      systemic RV failure as a bridge to transplant and as a strategy to reduce
      pulmonary vascular resistance. Although concomitant subpulmonic LV failure is
      common, systemic RV support alone was achieved in all patients.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices have become standard therapy for patients with
      advanced heart failure either as a bridge to transplantation or destination
      therapy. Despite the functional and biologic evidence of reverse cardiac
      remodeling, few patients actually proceed to myocardial recovery, and even fewer 
      to the point of having their device explanted. An enhanced understanding of the
      biology and care of the mechanically supported patient has redirected focus on
      the possibility of using ventricular assist devices as a bridge to myocardial
      recovery and removal. Herein, we review the current issues and approaches to
      transforming myocardial recovery to a practical reality.

AB  - The use of mechanical circulatory support devices to keep patients alive until
      transplantation has become essential in the face of an increasing organ shortage.
      We report successful heart transplantations after 841 days of left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) support in a child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and
      after 547 days of biventricular assist device (BVAD) support in another child
      with cardiomyopathy. To our knowledge, this report is the first on the
      longest-term (841 days) LVAD and the longest-term (547 days) BVAD support in
      children who were mobile and awake during the support, as a most effective bridge
      to heart transplantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Temporary right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) may be required to
      support patients with perioperative refractory right ventricular failure (RVF).
      We report on our experience using a different technique of RVAD implantation that
      does not necessitate resternotomy at the time of RVAD removal. METHODS: Patients 
      with perioperative RVF who underwent temporary RVAD implantation between January 
      2010 and February 2014 were reviewed. A dacron graft was attached to the
      pulmonary artery and passed through a subxiphoid exit, where the RVAD outflow
      cannula was inserted. The inflow cannula was percutaneously cannulated in the
      femoral vein, and the sternum was primarily closed. On the day of RVAD
      explantation, the outflow graft of the RVAD was pulled and ligated, and the
      insertion site was secondarily closed. The RVAD inflow cannula was removed, and
      direct pressure was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (age 58 +/- 14 years)
      were supported. Seventeen patients (81%) had RVF after left ventricular assist
      device implantation, and 4 patients developed postcardiotomy RVF. The median
      duration of RVAD support was 9 days (range: 2-88 days). Eleven patients (52%)
      were successfully weaned from the RVAD. Two patients were bridged to
      transplantation. Eight patients died on left ventricular assist device and/or
      RVAD support. The survival rates to discharge or heart transplantation, and to
      1-year, were 62% and 52%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No technical issues were
      encountered in this large series of RVAD implantations using the described
      technique for various forms of postoperative RVF. Extended support duration and

AB  - Increased hepatic iron load in extrahepatic organs of cirrhotic patients with and
      without hereditary hemochromatosis portends a poorer long term prognosis after
      liver transplant. Hepatic as well as nonhepatic iron overload is associated with 
      increased infectious and postoperative complications, including cardiac
      dysfunction. In this case report, we describe a cirrhotic patient with alpha 1
      antitrypsin deficiency and nonhereditary hemochromatosis (non-HFE) that developed
      cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support for twenty days after 
      liver transplant. Upon further investigation, she was found to have significant
      iron deposition in both the liver and heart biopsies. Her heart regained complete
      and sustained recovery following ten days of mechanical biventricular support.
      This case highlights the importance of preoperatively recognizing extrahepatic
      iron deposition in patients referred for liver transplantation irrespective of
      etiology of liver disease as this may prevent postoperative complications.

TI  - A pilot study to assess benefit of atrial rhythm control after cardiac
      resynchronization therapy and atrioventricular node ablation.
PG  - 275-81
LID - 10.1111/pace.12535 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequently comorbid in patients receiving
      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and suppression is typically difficult. 
      Herein, we sought to understand the benefit of atrial rhythm control in the
      setting of ventricular rate and regularity control induced by atrioventricular
      node (AVN) ablation. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with heart failure, persistent
      AF, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <35%, and left bundle branch block
      underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) + AVN ablation, and were
      randomized to one of the following groups: (1) Atrial Rhythm Control (ARC); (2)
      AF. Patients were subsequently followed for up to 1 year. RESULTS: Similar
      numbers of patients in each group were lost to follow-up or have withdrawn (ARC
      two; AF three). Rhythm control in four patients in the ARC group was inadequate. 
      Among the remaining patients, the incidence of death (ARC=1, AF=2) or left
      ventricular assist device +/- transplantation (ARC=2, AF=1) were similar. Among
      the remaining patients (ARC 16, AF 19), at 1 year, there were no significant
      differences in CRT response rate, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure survey
      score, 6-minute hall walk distance, ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurrence, or LV
      dimensions. A significantly higher hospital encounter rate among ARC patients was
      attributable to efforts to maintain uniform atrial rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      pilot study, no incremental benefit for ARC was apparent. A larger study will be 
      necessary to adequately examine these issues.

TI  - Machines versus medication for biventricular heart failure: focus on the total
      artificial heart.
PG  - 593-609
LID - 10.2217/fca.14.47 [doi]
AB  - The medical/surgical management of advanced heart failure has evolved rapidly
      over the last few decades. With better understanding of heart failure
      pathophysiology, new pharmacological agents have been introduced that have
      resulted in improvements in survival. For those patients that fail to improve,
      mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices and total
      artificial hearts (TAHs) have served as a beneficial bridge to transplantation.
      The TAH has continued to play a significant role as a bridge to transplantation
      in patients with biventricular failure and more selected indications that could
      not be completely helped with left ventricular assist devices. Improved survival 
      with the TAH has resulted in more patients benefiting from this technology.
      Improvements will eventually lead to a totally implantable device that will
      permanently replace the failing human heart.

TI  - Ventricular assist device use in congenital heart disease with a comparison to
      heart transplant.
PG  - 533-46
LID - 10.2217/cer.14.42 [doi]
AB  - Despite advances in medical and surgical therapies, some children with congenital
      heart disease (CHD) are not able to be adequately treated or palliated, leading
      them to develop progressive heart failure. As these patients progress to
      end-stage heart failure they pose a unique set of challenges. Heart transplant
      remains the standard of care; the donor pool, however, remains limited. Following
      the experience from the adult realm, the pediatric ventricular assist device
      (VAD) has emerged as a valid treatment option as a bridge to transplant. Due to
      the infrequent necessity and the uniqueness of each case, the pediatric VAD in
      the CHD population remains a topic with limited information. Given the experience
      in the adult realm, we were tasked with reviewing pediatric VADs and their use in
      patients with CHD and comparing this therapy to heart transplantation when
      possible.

TI  - A promoter polymorphism -945C>G in the connective tissue growth factor in heart
      failure patients with mechanical circulatory support: a new marker for bridge to 
      recovery?
PG  - e29-33
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezu402 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) creates improvement of cardiac
      function in a small portion of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
      (iDCM). Among other factors, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy seems to represent an
      important prerequisite for MCS-related cardiac recovery. We have previously shown
      that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) leads to adaptive cardiomyocyte
      hypertrophy associated with a protective cardiac function in transgenic mice. To 
      test whether a functional genetic variant in the CTGF promoter impacts
      MCS-related cardiac recovery, three groups of iDCM patients with and without
      cardiac recovery on MCS were genotyped. METHODS: The CTGF promoter variant
      (c.-945C>G) was analysed in 314 patients with iDCM receiving medical treatment
      only (Group I). Forty-nine iDCM patients who were either weaned from MCS for more
      than 6 months (Group II; n=20) or bridged to cardiac transplantation (Group III: 
      n=29) were also genotyped. Patients on MCS were followed up for at least 12
      months. Clinical characteristics and outcome on MCS were correlated with the
      respective genotypes. RESULTS: The c.-945C>G allele frequencies in 314 iDCM
      patients (Group I) were similar to controls deposited in the HapMap database or
      those published in a recent study. There were no differences in allele prevalence
      between patients with mild to moderate iDCM (Group I) compared with patients with
      severe iDCM requiring MCS (Groups II and III). Intriguingly, 50% of patients who 
      were weaned from MCS (Group II) were homozygous for the G allele compared with
      only 17.2% of patients included in Group III, which is a significant difference
      (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Homozygosity of the promoter-activating G allele in the
      CTGF_c.-945C>G variant is overrepresented in patients with cardiac recovery on
      MCS when compared with iDCM patients without cardiac recovery. Further studies
      are needed to evaluate c.-945C>G as a genetic predictor for clinical outcome on
      MCS.

      challenge with high mortality rates, despite ongoing advances in surgical

      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain a major tool of acute care in
      patients with cardiogenic shock, both before and after surgical or percutaneous
      intervention, the development of devices such as the Impella or the Tandemheart
      allows less invasive forms of temporary support. On the other hand, concerning
      mid-, or long-term support, left ventricular assist devices have evolved from a
      last resort life-saving therapy to a well-established viable alternative for
      thousands of heart failure patients caused by the shortage of donor organs
      available for transplantation. The optimal selection of the assist device is
      based on the initial consideration according to hemodynamic situation,
      comorbidities, intended time of use and therapeutic options. The present article 
      offers an update on currently available mechanical circulatory support systems
      (MCSS) for short and long-term use as well as an insight into future
      perspectives.

TI  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist device therapy in patients with
      preoperative hepatic failure: are we pushing the limits too far?
PG  - 336-42
LID - 10.1111/aor.12375 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects and outcome of
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cf-LVAD) therapy in patients with
      preoperative acute hepatic failure. The study design was a retrospective review
      of prospectively collected data. Included were 42 patients who underwent cf-LVAD 
      implantation (64.3% HeartMate II, 35.7% HeartWare) between July 2007 and May 2013
      with preoperative hepatic failure defined as elevation of greater than or equal
      to two liver function parameters above twice the upper normal range. Mean patient
      age was 35 +/- 12.5 years, comprising 23.8% females. Dilated cardiomyopathy was
      present in 92.9% of patients (left ventricular ejection fraction 17.3 +/- 5.9%). 
      Mean support duration was 511 +/- 512 days (range: 2-1996 days). Mean
      preoperative laboratory parameters for blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine,
      total bilirubin, and alanine aminotransferase were 9.5 +/- 5.4 mg/dL, 110.3 +/-
      42.8 mumol/L, 51.7 +/- 38.3 mmol/L, and 242.1 +/- 268.6 U/L, respectively. All
      parameters decreased significantly 1 month postoperatively. The mean preoperative
      modified Model for Endstage Liver Disease excluding international normalized
      ratio score was 16.03 +/- 5.57, which improved significantly after cf-LVAD
      implantation to 10.62 +/- 5.66 (P < 0.001) at 7 days and 5.83 +/- 4.98 (P <
      0.001) at 30 days postoperatively. One-year and 5-year survival was 75.9 and
      48.1%, respectively. 21.4% of the patients underwent LVAD explantation for
      myocardial recovery, 16.7% were successfully transplanted, and 7.1% underwent
      LVAD exchange for device failure over the follow-up period. Patients with
      preexisting acute hepatic failure are reasonable candidates for cf-LVAD
      implantation, with excellent rates of recovery and survival, suggesting that
      cf-LVAD therapy should not be denied to patients merely on grounds of
      "preoperative elevated liver enzymes/hepatopathy."

TI  - Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during implantation of left
      ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are non-specific: 13-year-experience at a
      German Heart Center.
PG  - 5549-56
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have become an established
      therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. The two main reasons for this 
      development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing
      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTX). Furthermore, the
      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience
      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term
      patient outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) implantation at our Erlangen Heart Center during January 2000-July 
      2013. The main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the
      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. From all patients, we created a
      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and
      described the overall outcome. RESULTS: VAD implantation was performed in 266
      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2% of the total of 12254 cardiac
      surgical operations in that period). From these patients, 223 underwent LVAD or
      biventricular (BVAD) implantation; the remaining received a right (RVAD)
      implantation. The most frequent underlying clinical diagnoses were dilated (n =
      84, 37.7%, DCM) or ischemic (n = 61, 27.4%, ICM) cardiomyopathy. The pathological
      findings in the apex biopsy were generally non-specific and showed variable
      interstitial myocardial fibrosis with evidence of fibre loss, fatty degeneration 
      and variable irregular atrophy of muscle fibres, consistent with dilated and
      ischemic cardiomyopathies as the most frequent causes of heart failure in these
      patients. Only a few cases showed other specific features such as myocarditis and
      AL-amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during
      LVAD implantation are rather non-specific and they generally reflect the late
      stage or consequences of chronic myocardial damage in cases of dilated or
      ischemic cardiomyopathies. Variable patchy chronic inflammatory changes may be
      observed in cardiomyopathies as a non-specific reaction caused by myocardial
      fiber damage and should not lead to misinterpretation as evidence of myocarditis 
      or revision of original diagnosis.

TI  - Double organ transplantation in cardiac amyloidosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac amyloidosis, particularly primary or AL amyloidosis, is the
      most common infiltrative cardiomyopathy and is associated with a poor prognosis. 
      The outcome of cardiac transplantation is generally poor, and almost half of
      patients die while waiting for the procedure to be done. PATIENT: We report here 
      the remarkable case of a 63-year-old man with heart failure caused by AL
      amyloidosis. After a long course, which included rapid deterioration of
      preexisting heart failure, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, biventricular
      assist device support, heart transplantation, renal failure, kidney
      transplantation and finally a life-threatening H1N1 virus pneumonia, the patient 
      managed not only to survive but also to return fully to his previous demanding
      duties and lifestyle. DISCUSSION: Early use of left ventricular or biventricular 
      mechanical circulatory support may be beneficial as a bridge to transplantation
      in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis.

TI  - The effect of the sequential therapy in end-stage heart failure (ESHF)--from
      ECMO, through the use of implantable pump for a pneumatic heart assist system,
      Religa Heart EXT, as a bridge for orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). Case study.
PG  - 537-40
LID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments for
      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right time
      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for
      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and
      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient
      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood
      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),
      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa
      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant
      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function 
      of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,
      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.
      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the
      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular
      afterload. The experimental implantation of an innovative Religa Heart EXT
      prosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. Too short time
      of Religa Heart EXT implantation in the discussed patient prevented the
      possibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications and
      infections compared to the documented complications of POLVAD implanted until
      now. OHT is a safe and efficacious method of treatment of patients previously
      supported by ECMO and Religa Heart EXT.

TI  - Thrombosis in continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices: pathophysiology,
      prevention, and pharmacologic management.
PG  - 79-98
LID - 10.1002/phar.1501 [doi]
AB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices reduce short-term mortality and
      improve quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Unfortunately, 
      device-related complications remain common, with many patients experiencing
      adverse events within the first year. New literature suggests that rates of
      device-related thrombosis may be increasing since 2011, which is particularly
      troublesome given that this pathology can result in a disabling stroke, organ
      damage, and death. In 2013, a group of practitioners in the field of mechanical
      circulatory support published a treatment algorithm based on their expert
      opinion. However, a comprehensive review of the pharmacotherapy of this condition
      is lacking. A search of the literature revealed 20 separate publications of case 
      reports or case series describing outcomes associated with the use of drug
      therapy for suspected pump thrombosis. Each of these experiences was limited by
      small sample size, nonrandomized treatment allocation, and nonstandardized
      medication dosing. Data describing the outcomes of surgical versus medical
      management of device thrombosis are also sparse, with only three published
      reports identified. Based on the review of this limited literature, surgical
      management appears to be the preferred treatment modality, especially in those
      with organ hypoperfusion or hemodynamic instability. In patients ineligible for
      surgery, pharmacotherapy options remain limited. Use of all drug classes
      described in the literature for the HeartMate II device-fibrinolytics,
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors-was hindered by 
      either marginal efficacy or bleeding. Based on historical experience with
      unfractionated heparin in patients under HeartMate II support, we recommend this 
      agent as a possible option for those with suspected pump thrombosis in lieu of
      surgical device exchange. For the HeartWare HVAD, limited data suggest that
      direct intraventricular administration of alteplase may be an acceptable
      treatment alternative. Additional research is clearly needed to further delineate
      the role of pharmacotherapy and to identify the optimal agent for managing this
      potentially life-threatening condition.

TI  - Educational resources for patients considering a left ventricular assist device: 
      a cross-sectional review of internet, print, and multimedia materials.
PG  - 905-11
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.114.000892 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are being used with
      increasing frequency to treat severe heart failure. Patients seek out
      informational resources when considering implantation. The primary study
      objective was to characterize the scope and quality of available LVAD educational
      materials. METHODS AND RESULTS: In July 2013, we performed a cross-sectional
      search of Internet, print, and multimedia resources available to patients
      considering LVAD. Written materials <10 sentences, videos <2 minutes, and
      materials clearly directed to healthcare professionals were excluded.
      Seventy-seven materials met inclusion criteria. Potential benefits of LVAD
      therapy were discussed in all (n=77), whereas less often mentioned were risks
      (n=43), lifestyle considerations (n=29), surgical details (n=26), caregiver
      information (n=9), and hospice or palliative care (n=2). Of the 14 materials that
      recognized a decision or alternate treatment option, 7 used outdated statistics, 
      12 scored above an eighth grade reading comprehension level, and 12 met <50% of
      International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. In the survey participants
      rated all but one as biased toward accepting LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      many resources exist for patients considering an LVAD, the content is suboptimal.
      Benefits of LVADs are often presented in the absence of risks, alternative
      options, and caregiver considerations. Most materials use outdated statistics,
      are above the reading level of average Americans, and are biased toward accepting
      LVAD therapy. There is no tool that would qualify as a formal decision aid.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the development of continuous-flow ventricular assist devices
      (CF-VAD) has improved the reliability of these devices, VAD exchange is still
      occasionally necessary. The focus of this study was to analyze our institution's 
      entire experience with primary CF-VAD implants, evaluate the baseline variables, 
      determine which factors predict the need for exchange, and evaluate the impact of
      exchange on survival and event-free survival. METHODS: We retrospectively
      reviewed the data of all patients in a single center who received a primary
      CF-VAD implant between December 1999 and December 2013. All CF-VAD exchanges were
      reviewed; demographics, indications, preoperative and operative data, and
      clinical outcomes were summarized. Univariate and multivariable regression
      analyses were performed to ascertain predictors for exchange. Time-to-event and
      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: We identified 469 patients who
      underwent 546 CF-VAD implantations. Of these patients, 66 (14%) underwent 77
      exchanges from one CF-VAD to another. The primary indications included hemolysis 
      or thrombosis (n = 49; 63.6%), infection (n = 9; 11.7%), or other causes (n = 19;
      24.7%). Survival was not significantly different between the exchange and
      nonexchange groups. Multivariable regression analysis identified a history of
      cerebrovascular events as a significant predictor for exchange. Among exchange
      patients, 11 underwent heart transplantation, 3 had their CF-VADs explanted, 26
      had ongoing support, and 26 died during device support. CONCLUSIONS: In our
      series of contemporary CF-VAD exchanges, a history of previous cerebrovascular
      events was a significant predictor for exchange. Exchange did not affect early or
      late survival. Our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment of
      pump-related complications with exchange is safe and justified.

TI  - Myocardial atrophy and chronic mechanical unloading of the failing human heart:
      implications for cardiac assist device-induced myocardial recovery.
PG  - 1602-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2014.05.073 [doi]
LID - S0735-1097(14)05775-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In animal models of heterotopic transplantation, mechanical unloading
      of the normal, nonhypertrophic heart results in atrophy. Primarily on the basis
      of these animal data, the notion that chronic left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD)-induced unloading will result in atrophy has dominated the clinical heart 
      failure field, and anti-atrophic drugs have been used to enhance the cardiac
      recovery potential observed in some LVAD patients. However, whether
      unloading-induced atrophy in experimental normal heart models applies to failing 
      and hypertrophic myocardium in heart failure patients unloaded by continuous-flow
      LVADs has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: The study examined whether mechanical
      unloading by continuous-flow LVAD leads to myocardial atrophy. METHODS: We
      prospectively examined myocardial tissue and hemodynamic and echocardiographic
      data from 44 LVAD patients and 18 untransplanted normal donors. RESULTS:
      Cardiomyocyte size (cross-sectional area) decreased after LVAD unloading from
      1,238 +/- 81 mum(2) to 1,011 +/- 68 mum(2) (p = 0.001), but not beyond that of
      normal donor hearts (682 +/- 56 mum(2)). Electron microscopy ultrastructural
      evaluation, cardiomyocyte glycogen content, and echocardiographic assessment of
      myocardial mass and left ventricular function also did not suggest myocardial
      atrophy. Consistent with these findings, t-tubule morphology, cytoplasmic
      penetration, and distance from the ryanodine receptor were not indicative of
      ongoing atrophic remodeling during LVAD unloading. Molecular analysis revealed no
      up-regulation of proatrophic genes and proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome
      system. CONCLUSIONS: Structural, ultrastructural, microstructural, metabolic,
      molecular, and clinical functional data indicated that prolonged continuous-flow 
      LVAD unloading does not induce hypertrophy regression to the point of atrophy and
      degeneration. These findings may be useful in designing future investigations
      that combine LVAD unloading and pharmaceutical therapies as a bridge to recovery 
      of the failing heart.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study sought to assess feasibility, safety, and potential
      efficacy of a novel implantable extra-aortic counterpulsation system (C-Pulse) in
      functional class III and ambulatory functional class IV heart failure (HF)
      patients. BACKGROUND: 30% to 40% of HF patients suffer from poor functional
      status and quality of life (QoL) but are not in need of end-stage treatments. We 
      undertook a multicenter single-arm study to assess the C-Pulse System in such
      patients. METHODS: New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or
      ambulatory functional class IV HF patients were eligible. Safety was assessed
      continuously through 12 months. Efficacy measurements included changes from
      baseline to 6 and 12 months in NYHA functional class, Minnesota Living with Heart
      Failure (MLWHF) and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, 6-min
      walk distance (6MWD), and exercise peak oxygen consumption (pVO2; 6 months only).
      RESULTS: Twelve men and 8 women (56.7 +/- 7 years, 34 to 71 years of age) with
      ischemic (n = 7) or nonischemic (n = 13) cardiomyopathy were implanted. There was
      no 30-day mortality and no neurological events or myocardial infarctions through 
      12 months. At 6 months, there were 3 deaths (1 device-related). One-year survival
      was 85%. At 6 months, C-Pulse produced improvements in NYHA functional class (3.1
      +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.7, p = 0.0005), MLWHF (63.6 +/- 19.9 to 40.2 +/- 23.2, p =
      0.0005), and KCCQ scores (43.6 +/- 21.1 to 65.6 +/- 21.5, p = 0.0002), but not
      6MWD (275.5 +/- 64.0 to 296.4 +/- 104.9, p = NS) or pVO2 (14.5 +/- 3.6 to 13.1
      +/- 4.4, p = NS). Improvements continued at 12 months, with 6MWD change becoming 
      statistically significant (336.5 +/- 91.8, p = 0.0425). CONCLUSIONS: Use of
      C-Pulse in this population is feasible, appears safe, and improves functional
      status and QoL. A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial is
      underway. (C-Pulse IDE Feasability Study-A Heart Assist System; NCT00815880).

AB  - AIMS: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly being used as
      life-saving therapy for end-stage advanced heart failure. Diabetes is prevalent
      in advanced heart failure patients. In this study, we sought to investigate the
      effects of mechanical circulatory support on diabetic parameters with LVAD
      implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, data on 244 LVAD 
      recipients between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Patients without history of
      diabetes, death within the first 3 months after LVAD implantation, heart
      transplantation after LVAD, or LVAD explantation were excluded from the study.
      Baseline demographic, laboratory, and echocardiographic information prior to LVAD
      placement and 6-month follow-up were obtained. Laboratory values indicative of
      diabetic control were found to improve significantly at 6 months post-LVAD
      implantation (glycated haemoglobin, 7.2 vs. 6.1%, P < 0.0001; serum fasting
      glucose, 141 vs. 122 mg/dL, P = 0.003; mean daily insulin dose, 30 vs. 24 IU/day,
      P = 0.02). Additionally, the use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was
      successfully discontinued in six patients at 6 months post-LVAD implantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term LVAD therapy is associated with improvement in diabetic
      control which is probabvly due to improvements in cardiac output and
      normalization of biochemical derangements resulting from diabetes.

TI  - Clinical outcomes after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 1003-13
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conveying the complex trade-offs of continuous-flow left ventricular 
      assist devices is challenging and made more difficult by absence of an evidence
      summary for the full range of possible outcomes. We aimed to summarize the
      current evidence on outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007 
      to December 2013, supplemented with manual review. Three reviewers independently 
      assessed each study for saliency on patient-centered outcomes. Data were
      summarized in tabular form. Overall study characteristics encouraged inclusion of
      all indications (destination therapy and bridge to transplant) and prevented
      meta-analysis. The electronic search identified 465 abstracts, of which 50 met
      inclusion criteria; manual review added 2 articles in press. The articles
      included 10 industry-funded trials and registries, 10 multicenter reports, and
      the remainder single-center observational experiences. Estimated actuarial
      survival after continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ranged from 56% to
      87% at 1 year, 43% to 84% at 2 years, and 47% at 4 years. Improvements in
      functional class and quality of life were reported, but missing data complicated 
      interpretation. Adverse events were experienced by the majority of patients, but 
      estimates for bleeding, stroke, infection, right heart failure, arrhythmias, and 
      rehospitalizations varied greatly. CONCLUSIONS: The totality of data for
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices show consistent improvements in
      survival and quality of life counterbalanced by a range of common complications. 
      Although this summary should provide a practical resource for healthcare
      provider-led discussions with patients, it highlights the critical need for
      high-quality patient-centered data collected with standard definitions.

AB  - Heart transplantation remains the gold standard treatment for patients with
      terminal end-stage heart failure. Although results reported have been excellent, 
      older recipients and donors associated with significant comorbidities are now the
      rule rather than the exception. Moreover, heart failure has become a significant 
      public health problem with a growing population of patients in countries unable
      to answer the demand for transplantation. An emerging answer to this dilemma
      comes from results reported with the use of continuous flow pumps where patient
      survival approaches 80% one and 2 years after implantation in selected patients. 
      Is it time to triage patients to continuous flow pumps? Should we recommend
      continuous flow pump implantations in patients with various comorbidities, and
      offer transplantation to a selected group of patients who will reach the
      long-term benefit of the procedure?

TI  - Hypertension: an unstudied potential risk factor for adverse outcomes during
      continuous flow ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 317-22
LID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]
AB  - In end-stage heart failure, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) represent an 
      exciting new frontier in which post-device implantation survival approaches that 
      of heart transplant. However, expansion of this technology is still limited by
      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential to
      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor 
      may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditional
      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may 
      also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.
      Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to 
      outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base to
      support these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not
      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potential
      predictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely a
      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive
      techniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,
      recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements and
      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting of
      CF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) consider
      potential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTN
      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new
      reliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research and
      management possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the 
      CF-LVAD patient population move forward.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of alternatives to intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation
      in the treatment of anticipated and established acute circulatory failure is
      growing. Despite the clinical importance and significant cost of short-term
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, the state of their present use has 
      not been analyzed on a national scale. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was 
      to characterize the demographics, treatment practices, survival rates, and cost
      of short-term MCS. METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed all
      adult patients receiving short-term MCS in the United States from 2004 to 2011 by
      using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
      Project. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, use of percutaneous devices for short-term
      MCS increased by 1,511% compared with a 101% increase in nonpercutaneous devices.
      Mortality rates declined over this period (p for trend = 0.027) from 41.1% in
      2004 to 2007 to 33.4% in 2008 to 2011. A similar trend was observed for the
      subset of patients with cardiogenic shock, decreasing from 51.6% to 43.1% (p for 
      trend = 0.012). Hospital costs also declined over this period (p for trend =
      0.011). Multivariable analysis revealed balloon pumps (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 2.52), coagulopathy (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.88 to 
      2.94), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR: 3.50; 95% CI: 2.20 to 5.57) before 
      short-term MCS were among the most significant predictors of mortality.
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-term MCS in the United States has increased rapidly,
      whereas rates of in-hospital mortality have decreased. These changes have taken
      place in the context of declining hospital costs associated with short-term MCS.

TI  - Left ventricular assist device for end-stage heart failure: results of the first 
      LVAD destination program in the Netherlands.
PG  - 102-8
LID - 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mechanical circulatory support with a continuous-flow left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) may be a valuable treatment in end-stage heart failure
      patients for an extended period of time. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD in
      end-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in the
      Netherlands. METHODS: A third-generation LVAD was implanted in 16 heart failure
      patients (age 61 +/- 8; 81 % male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20 +/- 6 %)
      as destination therapy. All patients were ineligible for heart transplant. At
      baseline, 3 and 6 months, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class,
      quality-of-life and exercise capacity were assessed. Clinical adverse events were
      registered. RESULTS: Survival at 30 days and 6 months was 88 and 75 %,
      respectively. In the postoperative phase, 6 (38 %) patients required continuous
      veno-venous haemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13 %) patients required
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure. 
      During follow-up, NYHA functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7 +/-
      0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 57 +/- 5 to 23 +/- 3 at 6 months (P < 0.001),
      respectively. The 6 min walking distance improved from 168 +/- 42 m to 291 +/- 29
      m at 6 months (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD therapy is a
      promising treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for
      heart transplant.

TI  - Impact of combined clenbuterol and metoprolol therapy on reverse remodelling
      during mechanical unloading.
PG  - e92909
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0092909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clenbuterol (Cl), a beta2 agonist, is associated with enhanced
      myocardial recovery during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support, and
      exerts beneficial remodelling effects during mechanical unloading (MU) in rodent 
      heart failure (HF). However, the specific effects of combined Cl+beta1 blockade
      during MU are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the chronic effects (4
      weeks) of beta2-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation via Cl (2 mg/kg/day) alone, and in 
      combination with beta1-AR blockade using metoprolol ((Met), 250 mg/kg/day), on
      whole heart/cell structure, function and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in 
      failing (induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation), and unloaded (induced
      by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)) failing rat hearts.
      Combined Cl+Met therapy displayed favourable effects in HF: Met enhanced Cl's
      improvement in ejection fraction (EF) whilst preventing Cl-induced hypertrophy
      and tachycardia. During MU combined therapy was less beneficial than either
      mono-therapy. Met, not Cl, prevented MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with
      increased atrophy occurring during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+ 
      transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+
      content was enhanced equally by Cl or Met mono-therapy, but these benefits,
      together with Cl's enhancement of sarcomeric contraction speed, and MU-induced
      recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency, disappeared during combined therapy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Combined Cl+Met therapy shows superior functional effects to
      mono-therapy in rodent HF, but appears inferior to either mono-therapy in
      enhancing MU-induced recovery of EC coupling. These results suggest that combined
      beta2-AR simulation +beta1-AR blockade therapy is likely to be a safe and
      beneficial therapeutic HF strategy, but is not as effective as mono-therapy in
      enhancing myocardial recovery during LVAD support.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent advances in technology and improved patient management have
      enabled the use of mechanical circulatory support for unexpected long-term
      periods. Improved long-term outcomes may facilitate the use of device therapy as 
      an alternative to heart transplantation. However, there are scarce data about the
      long-term outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. This study
      sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients receiving continuous-flow
      left ventricular assist devices. METHODS: Between March 2004 and June 2010, 140
      patients underwent continuous-flow left ventricular assist device insertion as a 
      bridge to transplantation or a destination therapy. These patients' charts were
      retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The initial strategy for continuous-flow left 
      ventricular assist device therapy was bridge to transplantation in 115 patients
      (82%) and destination therapy in 25 patients (18%). Of those, 24 (17%) died on
      left ventricular assist device support, 94 (67%) were successfully bridged to
      transplantation, and 1 (0.71%) showed native heart recovery. Twenty-four patients
      (17%) had been on continuous-flow left ventricular assist device support for more
      than 3 years (mean, 3.9 years; range, 3.0-7.5 years). Estimated on-device
      survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 83%, 75%, and 61%, respectively.
      Rehospitalizations due to bleeding, cardiac events, and device-related issues
      were common. The freedom from rehospitalization rates at 1 and 3 years was 31%
      and 6.9%, respectively. A total of 14 patients (10%) required device exchange.
      CONCLUSIONS: Current continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices can provide 
      satisfactory long-term survival. However, rehospitalization is frequently
      required.

      dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 687-92
LID - 10.1002/clc.22331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may
      occur in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). HYPOTHESIS: There are
      different implications of persistent versus transient improvement in LVEF among
      DCM patients receiving contemporary therapy. METHODS: We studied 188 patients
      with nonischemic DCM. Persistent improvement in LVEF (PIEF) was defined as LVEF
      increase by at least 10% compared to baseline, and found in 2 separate
      echo-Doppler exams performed at least 12 months apart. Increased LVEF in echo 2, 
      which was not sustained in echo 3, was defined as transient improvement in LVEF
      (TIEF). RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 6.8 years, PIEF occurred in 61
      (33%) patients, predicting a better long-term outcome (P < 0.001) in a combined
      end-point comprising death, heart transplantation, or the need for a ventricular 
      assist device. The TIEF group had an intermediate course and were closer to
      nonimprovers (P = 0.003 vs PIEF). Multivariate logistic regression identified the
      following independent predictors of PIEF: shorter disease duration,
      pregnancy-associated disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baseline LVEF </=
      25%. A score to predict PIEF assigned 1 point to each of the following: disease
      duration < 3 years and no familial cardiomyopathy; pregnancy-associated
      presentation; basal LVEF </= 25%; and left ventricular wall thickness >/= 12. A
      score of >/= 3 was present in 44% of the patients, reliably predicting PIEF in
      91% (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent improvement in LVEF is associated with
      improved long-term prognosis. Baseline clinical parameters can be used to
      identify patients likely to demonstrate PIEF, thereby allowing tailored
      management in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodynamics assessment is important for detecting and treating
      post-implant residual heart failure, but its accuracy is unverified in patients
      with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs). OBJECTIVES: We
      determined whether Doppler and 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography
      reliably assess hemodynamics in patients supported with CF-LVADs. METHODS:
      Simultaneous echocardiography and right heart catheterization were prospectively 
      performed in 50 consecutive patients supported by using the HeartMate II CF-LVAD 
      at baseline pump speeds. The first 40 patients were assessed to determine the
      accuracy of Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiography parameters to estimate
      hemodynamics and to derive a diagnostic algorithm for discrimination between mean
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure </=15 versus >15 mm Hg. Ten patients served as
      a validation cohort. RESULTS: Doppler echocardiographic and invasive measures of 
      mean right atrial pressure (RAP) (r = 0.863; p < 0.0001), systolic pulmonary
      artery pressure (sPAP) (r = 0.880; p < 0.0001), right ventricular outflow tract
      stroke volume (r = 0.660; p < 0.0001), and pulmonary vascular resistance (r =
      0.643; p = 0.001) correlated significantly. Several parameters, including mitral 
      ratio of the early to late ventricular filling velocities >2, RAP >10 mm Hg, sPAP
      >40 mm Hg, left atrial volume index >33 ml/m(2), ratio of mitral inflow early
      diastolic filling peak velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity >14,
      and pulmonary vascular resistance >2.5 Wood units, accurately identified patients
      with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >15 mm Hg (area under the curve: 0.73 to 
      0.98). An algorithm integrating mitral inflow velocities, RAP, sPAP, and left
      atrial volume index was 90% accurate in distinguishing normal from elevated left 
      ventricular filling pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler echocardiography accurately
      estimated intracardiac hemodynamics in these patients supported with CF-LVAD. Our
      algorithm reliably distinguished normal from elevated left ventricular filling
      pressures.

TI  - Implanting a Nonpulsatile Axial Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device as a Bridge
      to Transplant for Systemic Ventricular Failure After A Mustard Procedure.
LID - 10.6002/ect.2014.0043 [doi]
AB  - Right (systemic) ventricular failure is well described after a Mustard procedure 
      for transposition of the great arteries. Sixty-one percent of patients have been 
      reported to show moderate-to-severe dysfunction of the systemic ventricle, 25
      years after repair of transposition of the great arteries by a Mustard procedure.
      In such cases, heart transplant often seems to be the only option. When severe
      heart failure with hemodynamic instability develops, the only way to bridge these
      patients to a transplant is implantation of a mechanical circulatory support
      system. Because of the special anatomic features of the right ventricle, the
      implantation procedure can be challenging. Here, we report the case of a patient 
      who underwent a left ventricular assist device implant owing to severe heart
      failure, 36 years after undergoing a Mustard procedure.

AB  - We report the successful longest biventricular support using dual Jarvik 2000
      biventricular assist device (BVAD; Jarvik Heart, Inc., New York, NY, USA) as a
      bridge to transplant. A 27-year old woman with arrhythmogenic right ventricular
      cardiomyopathy underwent implantation of two Jarvik 2000s as a left ventricular
      assist device and right ventricular assist device. Although several BVAD-related 
      complications including haemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, heart failure and
      pulmonary valve insufficiency developed at a very late stage, she was
      successfully bridged to heart transplantation after 1245 days of biventricular
      support, which is the longest in the literature. Despite advances in
      continuous-flow ventricular assist devices, their long-term use for biventricular
      support remains limited. We report a successful case of 1245 days of
      biventricular support with dual Jarvik 2000 axial flow pumps in a patient with a 
      small body surface area.

AB  - Heart failure is a complex multifaceted syndrome occurring as a result of
      impaired cardiac function. Understanding the neurohormonal, inflammatory and
      molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology of this syndrome has led to
      the development of effective and widely used pharmacological treatments. Despite 
      this, mortality and hospitalization rates associated with this condition remain
      high. The natural course of this illness is usually progressive, often leading
      inexorably to end stage heart failure, for which orthotopic heart transplant is a
      treatment option but one with limited resource. In the past decade, mechanical
      circulatory support has emerged as a potential therapy for certain patients with 
      advanced heart failure. This article reviews the published data regarding
      biomarkers in the setting of mechanical circulatory support, and highlights areas
      of ongoing work and potential future areas of interest.

AB  - There are limited data integrating findings on right-sided cardiac
      catheterization and cardiopulmonary exercise testing in ambulatory patients with 
      heart failure. In this study, 187 outpatients with HF referred to the Duke
      Medical Center for consideration of advanced HF therapies were retrospectively
      evaluated. All patients had undergone right-sided cardiac catheterization and
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing; the median cardiac index (CI) was 2.0 L/min/m2 
      (interquartile range 1.7 to 2.3), and the median peak oxygen consumption was 11.3
      ml/kg/min (interquartile range 9.2 to 13.8). Despite aggressive medical therapy, 
      medical management had failed in 97 patients (52%) at 18 months, defined as left 
      ventricular assist device implantation, cardiac transplantation, or death. After 
      multivariate adjustment, factors associated with failure of optimal medical
      management included percentage achieved of predicted peak oxygen consumption, low
      CI (i.e., <2 L/min/m2), left ventricular size, and exercise time. Patients with
      discordant findings on right-sided cardiac catheterization and cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing were common, occurring in 88 patients (47%). The most common
      profile was preserved CI but reduced functional capacity, and these patients
      remained at high risk for requiring advanced therapies, whereas patients with
      reduced CIs but preserved exercise capacity were uncommon. In conclusion, low CI 
      was independently associated with higher rates of death, transplantation, and
      left ventricular assist device implantation in this study. Also, patients with
      preserved CIs at rest but poor functional capacity, so-called cardiac
      insufficiency, were commonly encountered and had poor outcomes with medical
      management.

LID - 10.1111/aor.12362 [doi]
AB  - Patients who temporarily or permanently rely on left ventricular assist devices
      (LVADs) for end-stage heart failure face complex psychological, emotional, and
      relational problems. We conducted a mixed-method study to investigate quality of 
      life, psychological symptoms, and emotional and cognitive reactions after LVAD
      implant. Twenty-six patients admitted to cardiac rehabilitation were administered
      quality of life questionnaires (Short Form 36 of the Medical Outcomes Study and
      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire), the Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale, and the Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences inventory,
      and underwent three in-depth unstructured interviews within 2 months after LVAD
      implant. Quality of life assessment (Short Form 36) documented persistently low
      physical scores whereas mental component scores almost achieved normative values.
      Clinically relevant depression and anxiety were observed in 18 and 18% of
      patients, respectively; avoidant coping scores correlated significantly with both
      depression and anxiety (Pearson correlation coefficients 0.732, P < 0.001 and
      0.764, P < 0.001, respectively). From qualitative interviews, factors that
      impacted on LVAD acceptance included: device type, disease experience during
      transplant waiting, nature of the assisted organ, quality of patient-doctor
      communication, the opportunity of sharing the experience, and recipient's
      psychological characteristics. Quality of life improves early after LVAD implant,
      but emotional distress may remain high. A multidimensional approach that takes
      into account patients' psychological characteristics should be pursued to enhance
      LVAD acceptance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caspase (Casp)-1 has been indicated as a molecular target capable of 
      preventing the progression of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure
      (HF), due to its central role in promoting inflammation and cardiomyocyte loss.
      The aim of this study was to assess whether Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)
      implantation modifies the inflammatory and apoptotic profile in the heart through
      the modulation of Casp-1 expression level. METHODS: Cardiac tissue was collected 
      from end-stage HF patients before LVAD implant (pre-LVAD group, n=22) and at LVAD
      removal (post-LVAD, n=6), and from stable HF patients on medical therapy without 
      prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at heart transplantation, as control. The
      cardiac expression of Casp-1, of its inhibitors caspase recruitment domain (CARD)
      only protein (COP) and CARD family, member 18 (ICEBERG), was evaluated by
      real-time PCR in the three groups of patients. RESULTS: Casp-1 was increased in
      the pre-LVAD group compared to HTx (p=0.006), while on the contrary the ICEBERG
      level was significantly decreased in pre-LVAD with respect to HTx patients
      (p<0.001); no difference in COP expression level was found. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study describes a specific pattern of the Casp-1 system associated with
      inflammation and apoptosis markers in patients who require LVAD insertion. The
      inflammation could be the key process regulating, in a negative loop, Casp-1
      signaling and its down-stream effects, apoptosis included.

TI  - Clinical outcomes after implantation of a centrifugal flow left ventricular
      assist device and concurrent cardiac valve procedures.
PG  - S3-11
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007911 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve procedures are commonly performed concurrently during
      implantation of left ventricular assist devices, but the added procedural risk
      has not been studied in detail. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from patients receiving
      the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device in the ADVANCE bridge to transplant (BTT)
      trial and continued access protocol were reviewed. Of 382 consecutive patients
      who completed follow-up between August 2008 and June 2013 (mean time on support
      389 days, median 271 days), 262 (68.6%) underwent isolated HeartWare Ventricular 
      Assist Device implantation, 75 (19.6%) a concurrent valve procedure, and 45
      (11.8%) concurrent nonvalvular procedures. Of the concurrent valve procedures, 56
      were tricuspid, 13 aortic, and 6 mitral. Survival was similar between groups (79%
      for concurrent valve procedures and 85% for HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device
      only at 1 year; P=0.33). Concurrent valve procedures were also associated with
      increased unadjusted early right heart failure (RHF). A multivariable analysis
      for death and RHF (121 total events) identified female sex (odds ratio=2.0 [95%
      confidence interval, 1.2-3.3; P=0.0053]) and preimplant tricuspid regurgitation
      severity (odds ratio=2.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.8, P<0.0001]) as
      independent predictors while concurrent tricuspid valve procedures (TVP) were not
      predictors. Furthermore, patients with significant preimplant tricuspid
      regurgitation who did not receive a TVP experienced an increased rate of late RHF
      compared with those who received TVP (0.19 versus 0.05 events per patient-year,
      respectively; P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HeartWare Ventricular Assist
      Device alone, survival was equivalent for the concurrent valve procedure group.
      Tricuspid regurgitation severity was the most important predictor of increased
      postoperative RHF, and concurrent TVP was not an independent predictor of RHF
      overall. Concurrent TVP may reduce the rate of late RHF for patients with
      significant preimplant tricuspid insufficiency. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL:

TI  - Application of intra-aortic balloon pump in resection and anastomosis of trachea.
PG  - 48-51
AB  - The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical device used to assist
      cardiac circulatory function in patients suffering from cardiogenic shock,
      congestive heart failure, refractory angina and complications of myocardial
      infarction. While using IABP in cardiac surgery is well established, there are
      few studies on the utility of IABP support in high-risk cardiac patients
      undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Major non-cardiac surgeries are associated with
      high rates of cardiac complications in patients with advanced coronary disease.
      Recent case studies have reported favorable outcomes with the use of IABP support
      in non-cardiac surgery in patients with severe cardiac compromise. Using IABP may
      reduce cardiac complications by providing hemodynamic stability. Here, we present
      five cases of IABP use in high-risk cardiac patients undergoing resection and
      anastomosis of the trachea. IABP was inserted prior to induction of anesthesia in
      four of the cases, while IABP insertion was withheld in one case. In the four
      cases where IABP support was utilized, the IABP was removed between 6-48 hours
      postoperatively with no complications. The patient who did not undergo IABP
      insertion died on the 8th postoperative day due to uncontrollable pulmonary edema
      and progressive myocardial infarction. We also review the literature and discuss 
      the role of IABP use in non-cardiac surgery.

TI  - Outcomes after implantation of 139 full-support continuous-flow left ventricular 
      assist devices as a bridge to transplantation.
PG  - e59-66
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezu325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are a routine treatment for
      patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge to transplantation. The aim of
      this study was to present our institutional experience and mid-term outcomes
      after implantation of 139 continuous-flow (cf) LVADs as a bridge to
      transplantation. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-nine consecutive LVAD
      implantations were performed in our institution between July 2007 and August
      2013. The mean age of the population was 44.0 +/- 13.7 years and 24 (17%) of the 
      patients were female. A substantial number of the patients were on preoperative
      mechanical support: 35 (25%) with an intra-aortic balloon pump, 9 (6.5%) with an 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and 25 (18%) with previous LVAD, for LVAD
      exchange. RESULTS: The mean support duration was 514 +/- 481 days, whereas the
      longest support duration was 2493 days (>6 years). The overall cumulative
      survival rate following cfLVAD implantation was 89% at 30 days, 76% at 1 year and
      66% at 2 years (Fig. 1). There was a statistically significant difference in
      survival in favour of first LVAD implantation compared with VAD exchange: 91 vs
      80% at 30 days, 79 vs 57% at 1 year and 70 vs 43% at 2 years (log-rank P =
      0.010). Postoperatively, patients had a significant improvement in end-organ
      function 1 month after LVAD implantation. In addition, comparison of two
      different devices [HeartMate II (HM II) and HeartWare] using propensity score
      matching showed no significant differences in survival and most postoperative
      adverse events. However, patients supported with HM II required significantly
      more units of fresh frozen plasma (P = 0.020) with a trend towards a higher use
      of red blood cells (P = 0.094), and were also more likely to develop percutaneous
      site infections (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: HM II and HeartWare cfLVADs have
      excellent early postoperative outcomes and good mid-term survival, despite a
      considerable number of patients needing VAD exchange.

TI  - Gender differences in continuous-flow left ventricular assist device therapy as a
      bridge to transplantation: a risk-adjusted comparison using a propensity
      score-matching analysis.
PG  - 212-9
LID - 10.1111/aor.12361 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate gender differences regarding outcome
      after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cfLVAD) implantation. The
      study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Included were
      24 consecutive female cfLVAD recipients and 24 male recipients (62.5% HeartMate
      II, 37.5% HeartWare) who received their devices between July 2007 and May 2013.
      Subjects were matched using propensity score analysis based on age, diagnosis,
      body surface area, preoperative mechanical circulatory support, heart failure
      severity score (INTERMACS class), and comorbidities. Female patients were
      significantly sicker before operation. After propensity score matching, there
      were no statistically significant differences in demographics or clinical
      baseline characteristics between male and female LVAD recipients. Also, there was
      a trend towards a longer postoperative intensive care unit stay in the female
      group (median 9 days [interquartile range 5-17] versus 15 days [interquartile
      range 8-33]; P < 0.061) and higher postoperative bilirubin values (median 14
      mmol/L [interquartile range 10-17] versus 21 mmol/L [interquartile range 13-30]).
      However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of
      outcome (P < 0.569). The overall survival was comparable between the two groups
      (log rank P < 0.389). Half (50%) of female patients required inotropic support
      for more than 7 days compared with 21.7% in the male group (P < 0.048). Half
      (50%) of female recipients required short-term postoperative right ventricular
      assist device implantation compared with 16.7% in the male group (P < 0.014). In 
      conclusion, cfLVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation is associated with
      longer duration of inotropic support and higher requirement for postoperative
      mechanical right ventricular support in women with similar survival rates.
      Further studies are required to identify additional demographic and clinical
      factors that modulate outcomes and will enhance the ability to risk-stratify
      cfLVAD recipients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently available ventricular assist devices are designed primarily
      for use in patients with left sided heart failure. This study evaluated the
      efficacy of the Jarvik 2000 ventricular assist device (VAD) as a pulmonary pump
      to power a Fontan circuit in a large animal model. METHODS: Without the use of
      cardiopulmonary bypass, Fontan circulations were surgically created in 4 pigs (50
      kg) using synthetic grafts from the inferior and superior vena cavas to the main 
      pulmonary artery. Subsequently, the VAD was implanted within the common Fontan
      graft to provide a pulmonary pump. Direct chamber pressures and epicardial
      Doppler images were taken during the various phases of the experiment. Heart
      rate, femoral artery blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and aortic flow rate were
      continuously recorded. The outflow cannula of the VAD was then partially banded
      by 50% and then 75% to mimic increased afterload. RESULTS: Fontan and VAD
      implantation was successfully performed in all 4 animals. Arterial pressure and
      aortic flow decreased dramatically with institution of the Fontan but were
      restored to baseline upon activation of the VAD. The pressure within the systemic
      venous circulation rose precipitously with institution of the Fontan circulation 
      and improved appropriately with activation of the VAD. Adequate perfusion was
      maintained during increased afterload. CONCLUSIONS: An axial flow VAD can restore
      normal hemodynamics and cardiac output when used as a pulmonary pump in a Fontan 
      circulation. A VAD can rescue a failing Fontan as a bridge to transplant or
      recovery, even in the setting of high pulmonary resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) predicts survival in heart
      failure but may underestimate risk in severe heart failure, and the performance
      has not been evaluated explicitly in patients with cardiac resynchronization
      therapy (CRT) and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) referred for
      heart transplantation. We aimed to assess the utility of the SHFM by validation
      in patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for heart transplantation. METHODS: We
      assessed the SHFM performance in 382 patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for
      heart transplantation. Outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or
      left ventricular assist device. Model discrimination and calibration were
      assessed graphically and by formal tests. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 2.3
      years, 195 events occurred. One-, 2-, and 3-year observed event-free survival was
      77%, 62%, and 52%, and the observed to predicted event-free survival ratio was
      0.89, 0.80, and 0.76. Calibration plots demonstrated results deviating from the
      ideal calibration line at 1, 2, and 3 years. The SHFM score adequately assigned
      patients in discrete risk strata, according to Kaplan-Meier estimated survival.
      Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good
      discrimination overall, which was slightly better for 1-year (area under the
      curve [AUC] 0.774) compared with 2-year (AUC 0.742) and 3-year (AUC 0.728)
      event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The SHFM has good discrimination but
      underestimates risk of adverse outcomes in patients with CRT and/or ICD referred 
      for heart transplantation. The SHFM may be used to assess relative risk and
      changes over time, but when assessing absolute percentage of event-free survival,
      the overestimation of event-free survival should be accounted for.

AB  - Heart failure remains a major global problem with approximately 6 million
      individuals suffering from heart failure in the United States alone. The surgical
      technique of heart transplantation, popularized by Dr. Norman Shumway, has led to
      its success and currently remains the best treatment options for patients with
      end-stage. However, with the continued limitation of donor organs and the rapid
      development of ventricular assist device technology, the number of patients
      bridged to transplant with mechanical circulatory support has increased
      significantly. This has created some new technical challenges for heart
      transplantation. Therefore, it is now important to be familiar with multiple new 
      technical challenges associated with the surgical techniques of heart
      transplantation with an ultimate goal in reducing donor heart ischemic time,
      recipient cardiopulmonary bypass time and post-operative complications. In this
      review, we described our technique of heart transplantation including the timing 
      of the operation, recipient cardiectomy and donor heart implantation.

TI  - Outcomes after implantation of partial-support left ventricular assist devices in
      inotropic-dependent patients: Do we still need full-support assist devices?
PG  - 1115-21; discussion 1021-2

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Partial-support left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) represent a
      novel strategy for heart failure treatment. The Synergy Pocket Micro-pump
      (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, Mass), the smallest surgically implanted long-term
      LVAD, provides partial flow up to 4.25 L/min and was primarily designed for "less
      sick" patients with severe heart failure. This device is implanted minimally
      invasively without sternotomy or cardiopulmonary bypass. Early implantation in
      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 
      class 4 and higher was shown to be feasible and associated with significantly
      improved hemodynamics and quality of life. The aim of this study was to present
      our experience with implementation of long-term partial circulatory support as a 
      bridge to transplantation in patients with more advanced heart failure who were
      dependent preoperatively on inotropic support or intra-aortic balloon pump.
      METHODS: In this observational study, only inotropic or intra-aortic balloon
      pump-dependent patients with end-stage heart failure were included (n = 12).
      These patients underwent Synergy device implantation between February 2012 and
      August 2013. RESULTS: The mean preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support class was 2.17 +/- 0.84 (class 1, 25%; class 2, 33%;
      class 3, 42%). The mean age was 46 +/- 15 years, and 33% were female.
      Preoperatively, 4 patients (33%) had at least 1 previous sternotomy, 3 patients
      (25%) were supported with a balloon pump, 1 patient (8%) had a previous
      full-support LVAD, and 4 patients (33%) had cerebrovascular events in the past.
      After device implantation, there were no right ventricular failures,
      device-related infections, hemorrhagic strokes, arterial or venous
      thromboembolisms, or worsenings of aortic and mitral regurgitation observed over 
      the follow-up. The mean follow up was 174 +/- 171 days (range, 5-764 days;
      cumulative, 3199 days). One patient (8%) died, 3 patients (25%) successfully
      underwent transplantation, 1 device (8%) was explanted after myocardial recovery,
      and 5 patients (42%) are still on ongoing support. Two patients (17%) were
      upgraded to a full-support LVAD after 65 days of mean support. A total of 11 of
      12 patients (92%) were discharged from the hospital and are presently alive. Left
      ventricular end-diastolic diameter was significantly reduced 3 months after
      device implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Partial LVAD support may be clinically
      efficacious in inotropic and intra-aortic balloon pump-dependent patients. On the
      basis of our experience and evidence of previous research, such patients may
      benefit from minimally invasive access, no need for sternotomy and
      cardiopulmonary bypass, a short implantation time, an easy exchange if necessary,
      and a lower risk of subsequent heart transplantation. Because the implantation is
      performed without sternotomy, device upgrade is feasible with a comparatively low
      operative risk and good clinical outcome. Our preliminary results show that
      partial-support devices may have the potential to replace full-support LVADs in
      the near future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Morbid obesity precludes patients with end-stage heart failure from
      becoming cardiac transplant candidates. This study evaluates the safety and
      efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a means to transplant
      candidacy in such patients. METHODS: Morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart
      failure, who were ineligible for cardiac transplantation and underwent LSG
      between 2008 and 2013, were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic
      characteristics, perioperative details, percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), 
      and status of transplant candidacy were analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients (3 men)
      with end-stage heart failure and morbid obesity underwent LSG. Three patients
      (50%) had a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in place at the time of
      surgery. Median age was 34 (31-66) years and mean preoperative body mass index
      (BMI) was 47.6+/-3.0 kg/m2. Median operative time was 90 (66-141) minutes, with a
      median length of stay of 7 (4-16) days. There were no perioperative deaths. One
      patient suffered a spontaneous flank hematoma. The same patient also had
      thrombosis of the LVAD pump at 3 weeks postoperatively, requiring an uneventful
      device exchange. At median follow-up of 22 (12-70) months, the mean %EWL was
      51.4+/-10.3% with a decrease in BMI to 34.3+/-2.4 kg/m2 (P<.05). All patients had
      lost sufficient weight to become transplant eligible within 12 months of surgery.
      Two patients had undergone successful transplantation and another 2 were on the
      transplant list. CONCLUSION: LSG appears to be a safe, technically feasible, and 
      effective method for obtaining adequate weight loss in morbidly obese patients
      with end-stage heart failure and mechanical circulatory support, subsequently
      improving their access to cardiac transplantation. This is the largest case
      series to date of this high-risk group of patients undergoing LSG.

AB  - Mechanical cardiac unloading with use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) 
      is associated with substantial improvements in left ventricular function and
      enables subsequent LVAD explantation in some patients. We describe the case of a 
      35-year-old man with dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy who was supported with an
      LVAD for 9 months. After the device was removed, he led a normal life for 13
      years and 4 months. However, at 49 years of age, he presented with new signs and 
      symptoms of heart failure, necessitating implantation of a 2nd LVAD. Afterwards, 
      he has remained asymptomatic. This case is unique in that the patient lived a
      normal life for longer than a decade before renewed left ventricular
      decompensation necessitated repeat LVAD therapy. Histologic examination revealed 
      few changes between the first device's removal in 1999 and the 2nd device's
      implantation in 2012.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced heart failure teams are often faced with the decision of
      whether or not to offer a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to patients who
      have end-stage heart failure and recent or ongoing substance abuse. The outcomes 
      of these patients after LVAD implantation are unknown. METHODS: Baseline
      predictors and outcomes were collected and analyzed from patients with active
      substance abuse and a cohort of patients without active substance abuse matched
      for age, INTERMACS profile and year of implantation. The primary outcome was
      all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included rates of listing for cardiac
      transplantation, transplantation and chronic drive-line infection. RESULTS: The
      cohort consisted of 20 consecutive LVAD recipients with active substance abuse
      and 40 recipients without active substance abuse. During a median follow-up
      period of 2.3 years (IQR 1.4 to 3.6), the substance abuse group had 3.2 times the
      rate (hazard) of death compared with a matched cohort (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.0,
      p < 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of listing for transplant was 69% lower (rate
      ratio 0.31, p < 0.0005), rate of cardiac transplant was 89% lower (rate ratio
      0.11, p < 0.0005), and risk of chronic drive-line infection was 5.4 times higher 
      (rate ratio 5.4, p < 0.0005) in the substance abuse group. CONCLUSIONS: Active
      substance abuse in patients who received an LVAD was associated with increased
      mortality and overall poor outcomes. Larger scale data will be needed to confirm 
      these findings and to inform decision-making in this population.

TI  - Progressive ventricular dysfunction among nonresponders to cardiac
      resynchronization therapy: baseline predictors and associated clinical outcomes.

LID - S1547-5271(14)00859-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) nonresponders have poor
      outcomes. The significance of progressive ventricular dysfunction among
      nonresponders remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define predictors of and
      clinical outcomes associated with progressive ventricular dysfunction despite
      CRT. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 328 patients undergoing CRT with
      defibrillator for standard indications. On the basis of 6-month echocardiograms, 
      we classified patients as responders (those with a >/=5% increase in ejection
      fraction) and progressors (those with a >/=5% decrease in ejection fraction), and
      all others were defined as nonprogressors. Coprimary end points were 3-year (1)
      heart failure, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transplantation, or death
      and (2) ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). RESULTS:
      Multivariable predictors of progressive ventricular dysfunction were aldosterone 
      antagonist use (hazard ratio [HR] 0.23; P = .008), prior valve surgery (HR 3.3; P
      = .005), and QRS duration (HR 0.98; P = .02). More favorable changes in
      ventricular function were associated with lower incidences of heart failure,
      LVAD, transplantation, or death (70% vs 54% vs 33%; P < .0001) and VT or VF (66% 
      vs 38% vs 28%; P = .001) for progressors, nonprogressors, and responders,
      respectively. After multivariable adjustment, progressors remained at increased
      risk of heart failure, LVAD, transplantation, or death (HR 2.14; P = .0029) and
      VT or VF (HR 2.03; P = .046) as compared with nonprogressors. Responders were at 
      decreased risk of heart failure, LVAD, transplantation, or death (HR 0.44; P <
      .0001) and VT or VF (0.51; P = .015) as compared with nonprogressors. CONCLUSION:
      Patients with progressive deterioration in ventricular function despite CRT
      represent a high-risk group of nonresponders at increased risk of worsened
      clinical outcomes.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to chemotherapy in an Orthodox
      Jewish patient.
PG  - 985-9
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for
      cardiopulmonary support offers survival possibilities to patients who otherwise
      would succumb to cardiac failure. Often referred to as "a bridge to recovery,"
      involving a ventricular assist device or cardiac transplantation, this technology
      only affords temporary cardiopulmonary support. Physicians may have concerns
      about initiating VA-ECMO in patients who, in the absence of recovery or transfer 
      to longer-term therapies, might assert religious or cultural objections to the
      terminal discontinuation of life-sustaining therapy (LST). We present a novel
      case of VA-ECMO use in an Orthodox Jewish woman with potentially curable lymphoma
      encasing her heart to demonstrate the value of anticipating and preemptively
      resolving foreseeable disputes. PATIENT: A 40-year-old Hasidic Orthodox Jewish
      woman with lymphoma encasing her right and left ventricles decompensated from
      heart failure before chemotherapy induction. The medical team, at an academic
      medical center in New York City, proposed VA-ECMO as a means for providing
      cardiopulmonary support to enable receipt of chemotherapy. Owing to the patient's
      religious tradition, which customarily prohibits terminal discontinuation of LST,
      clinical staff asked for an ethics consultation to plan for initiation and
      discontinuation of VA-ECMO. INTERVENTIONS: Meetings were held with the treating
      clinicians, clinical ethics consultants, family, religious leaders, and cultural 
      liaisons. Through a deliberative process, VA-ECMO was reconceptualized as a
      bridge to treatment and not as an LST, a designation assigned to the chemotherapy
      on this occasion, given the mortal threat posed by the encasing tumor.
      CONCLUSION: Traditional religious objections to the terminal discontinuation of
      LST need not preclude initiation of VA-ECMO. The potential for disputes should be
      anticipated and steps taken to preemptively address such conflicts. The
      reconceptualization of VA-ECMO as a bridge to treatment, rather than as an LST,
      can allow patients with objections to the terminal discontinuation of LST to
      receive interventions, such as chemotherapy, that might otherwise be precluded by
      critical physiology.

AB  - We report a 40-year-old man who presented with irreversible cardiogenic shock.
      The patient was treated with three consecutive stages of mechanical circulatory
      support as a triple bridge to cardiac transplantation. Extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation support was used for 5 days, followed by Levitronix CentriMag
      biventricular assist devices for 39 days. This was escalated to implantation of
      the CardioWest temporary total artificial heart for 107 days. The patient
      experienced concurrent end-stage renal disease and subsequently underwent both
      heart and kidney transplantation. On postoperative day 18 the patient was
      discharged with good cardiac and renal function.

TI  - Drive-line infections and sepsis in patients receiving the HVAD system as a left 
      ventricular assist device.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drive-line infections and sepsis lead to significant morbidity and
      even mortality in patients with ventricular assist devices (VADs). The HeartWare 
      HVAD system is unique compared with other VAD systems in that it has a thin,
      flexible drive-line and is implanted directly into the pericardial space without 
      the need for a pump pocket. We reviewed 332 patients receiving the HVAD in the
      pivotal ADVANCE Bridge to Transplant (BTT) trial and Continued Access Protocol
      (CAP) to determine the incidence of drive-line infections and sepsis. METHODS:
      Summary statistics of outcomes and Kaplan-Meier freedom-from-event analyses were 
      performed. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for homogeneity was used to determine
      whether there was any site effect on rates of either drive-line exit-site or
      sepsis infections. RESULTS: Drive-line exit-site infections occurred in 16.9% (56
      of 332) of patients (0.25 event per patient-year [EPPY]). These infections were
      primarily treated with antibiotics and most occurred >30 days post-implant (88%, 
      or 66 of 75 drive-line infections). Sepsis occurred in 17.2% (57 of 332) of
      patients (0.23 EPPY), and sepsis events occurred more frequently >30 days
      post-implant (86%, or 60 of 70 sepsis events). Of patients with sepsis, 17.5% (10
      of 57) died due to sepsis-related neurologic events (7 of 10) and multisystem
      organ failure (2 of 10) and cardiopulmonary failure (1 of 10), whereas there were
      no deaths related to drive-line infections. In addition, 17.5% (10 of 57) of
      patients had a stroke event while under treatment for sepsis (7 hemorrhagic and 3
      ischemic strokes), and 3.5% (2 of 57 patients with sepsis) had a device exchange 
      for VAD thrombus (4 days before and 1 day after sepsis diagnosis). Patients with 
      drive-line infections or sepsis had a larger body mass index compared to those
      without infection (29.4 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), p = 0.015), and were more frequently
      diabetic (43.7% vs 31.2%, p = 0.034). Although there was no negative impact on
      survival in patients with drive-line exit-site infections, there was a trend for 
      reduced survival in patients with sepsis events when compared to those patients
      without sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of drive-line infection and sepsis was
      low in patients receiving the HVAD pump. Despite a trend toward reduced survival 
      in patients with sepsis events, the overall survival of patients with either
      drive-line infections or sepsis was excellent.

TI  - Simple and non-invasive techniques to evaluate the function of CircuLite Synergy.
PG  - 738-42
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivu236 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Synergy CircuLite micropump is a novel partial-support miniature 
      left ventricular assist device that propels 2-3 l/min blood from the left atrium 
      into the right subclavian artery. The ability of currently available
      investigative modalities to confirm Synergy pump malfunction is limited. The
      Synergy speed fluctuates periodically (at 10-s intervals) from the baseline to a 
      transient decrease followed by a transient increase (alternating speed algorithm,
      ASA) with the purpose of changing the blood flow behaviour, thereby reducing
      thrombogenicity. The aim of this study was to develop a simple non-invasive
      monitoring technique to assess pump function based on the detection of the ASA in
      the peripheral microcirculation. METHODS: Between February 2012 and July 2013, 10
      patients with advanced chronic heart failure underwent Synergy implantation at
      our institution. The pump function was assessed by echocardiography and invasive 
      monitoring according to standard protocols; additionally, the pump speed and
      power consumption were monitored. During the pump function assessment, the pulse 
      oximeter waveform was recorded from the index fingers of the left and right hand 
      with simultaneous pump auscultation using a stethoscope positioned on the pump
      (right infra-clavicular pocket). RESULTS: The pulse oximeter waveform was readily
      detectable from the right and left hand of all study patients. If the Synergy
      function was normal, there was a significant difference in the morphology of the 
      pulse oximeter waveform from each hand: the ASA algorithm produced a more
      pronounced variation (giant wave) in the trace from the right hand than from the 
      left. The giant waves invariably coincided with the sound variation associated
      with the ASA algorithms, which were detected regularly at 10-s intervals.
      CONCLUSIONS: We describe a simple, readily applicable, inexpensive, non-invasive 
      technique that allows evaluation of Synergy pump function and may have diagnostic
      utility under conditions of suspected pump thrombus/malfunction. This technique
      is readily applicable from the early post-implant period throughout support and
      allows clinical personnel to verify blood flow variation through the Synergy,
      thereby providing a novel method of assessing device function.

LID - 10.1007/s00101-014-2362-3 [doi]
AB  - Due to the technical advances in pumps, oxygenators and cannulas, veno-arterial
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) or extracorporeal life support
      (ECLS) has been widely used in emergency medicine and intensive care medicine for
      several years. An accepted indication is peri-interventional cardiac failure in
      cardiac surgery (postcardiotomy low cardiac output syndrome). Furthermore,
      especially the use of va-ECMO for other indications in critical care medicine,
      such as in patients with severe sepsis with septic cardiomyopathy or in
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation has tremendously increased. The basic indications
      for va-ECMO are therapy refractory cardiac or cardiopulmonary failure. The
      fundamental purpose of va-ECMO is bridging the function of the lungs and/or the
      heart. Consequently, this support system does not represent a causal therapy by
      itself; however, it provides enough time for the affected organ to recover
      (bridge to recovery) or for the decision for a long-lasting organ substitution by
      a ventricular assist device or by transplantation (bridge to decision). Although 
      the outcome for bridged patients seems to be favorable, it should not be
      forgotten that the support system represents an invasive procedure with
      potentially far-reaching complications. Therefore, the initiation of these
      systems needs a professional and experienced (interdisciplinary) team, sufficient
      resources and an individual approach balancing the risks and benefits. This
      review gives an overview of the indications, complications and contraindications 
      for va-ECMO. It discusses its advantages in organ transplantation and transport

TI  - Does renal dysfunction and method of bridging support influence heart transplant

AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal insufficiency is common in status 1B patients supported with
      inotropes or a continuous flow left ventricular device (CF-LVAD) as a bridge to
      heart transplantation. We evaluated the association of renal function and
      inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on posttransplant graft survival in status 1B
      patients. METHODS: The Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients database was
      analyzed for posttransplant survival in status 1B patients bridged with inotropes
      or CF-LVAD who underwent transplantation between 2003 and 2012. Pretransplant
      renal function was measured by estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
      was stratified as less than 45 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2), 45 to 59, and 60 or
      greater. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used
      to evaluate the main effects of GFR strata and inotropes versus CF-LVAD, and the 
      interaction effect of GFR strata by CF-LVAD, on graft survival. RESULTS: This
      study included 4,158 status 1B patients (74% male, aged 53 +/- 12 years). Of
      those, 659 patients had a CF-LVAD (HeartMate-II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], n =
      638; HVAD [HeartWare, Framingham, MA], n = 21), and 3,530 were receiving
      inotropes (31 CF-LVAD patients were also receiving inotropes). Kaplan-Meier
      analyses demonstrated reduced graft survival (p = 0.022) in patients with
      pretransplant GFR less than 45 versus GFR 45 to 59 (p = 0.062) and versus GFR 60 
      or greater (p = 0.007), and no effect of inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on graft
      survival (p = 0.402). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, after adjusting
      for the main effects of GFR stratum, CF-LVAD, and inotropes, status 1B patients
      bridged with a CF-LVAD and GFR in the lowest stratum had reduced graft survival
      (interaction effect p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant renal insufficiency
      was associated with reduced posttransplant graft survival in status 1B patients. 
      This risk is increased for patients bridged with a CF-LVAD (versus inotropes) who
      have GFR in the lowest stratum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Significant aortic regurgitation (AR) after continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist device (cf-LVAD) placement affects device performance and
      patient outcomes. This study examined the development of AR and long-term results
      after implantation of cf-LVADs. METHODS: The study included all patients with no 
      or less than mild AR who underwent HeartMate II (58 [62%]; Thoratec Corp,
      Pleasanton, CA) or HeartWare (35 [38%]; HeartWare International, Framingham, MA) 
      implantation at our institute from July 2006 to July 2012. Serial echocardiograms
      were obtained preoperatively, at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively, and then at a
      minimum of 4-month intervals in patients with longer-term support. Kaplan-Meier
      estimates for freedom from moderate or greater AR were generated. Logistic
      regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of AR after cf-LVAD
      implantation. RESULTS: Median duration of LVAD support was 527 days (25(th),
      75(th): 289, 907; range, 60 to 2,433 days). Mild AR developed in 48 patients
      (51.6%) over a median duration of 126 days, with progression to moderate AR in 13
      (14%) over 493 days and to severe AR in 2 (2.1%) over 1,231 days. The incidence
      of mild or greater AR was 43.1% in HeartMate II vs 65.7% in HeartWare recipients 
      (p = 0.035). Overall freedom from moderate or greater AR was 94.7% +/- 2.6% at 1 
      year, 86.9% +/- 4.5% at 2 years, 82.8% +/- 5.9% at 3 years, and 31% +/- 16.9% at 
      4 years. Independent predictors of AR were duration of support (odds ratio,
      1.002; 95% confidence interval, 1.000 to 1.004; p = 0.017) and a persistently
      closed aortic valve (odds ratio, 0.193; 95% confidence interval, 0.097 to 0.382; 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AR is associated with longer cf-LVAD support duration
      and persistent aortic valve closure. Incidence of moderate or greater AR after
      cf-LVAD implantation increases significantly after 3 years. The clinical
      implications of these data may warrant consideration of prophylactic aortic valve
      replacement at the time of cf-LVAD implantation, particularly with expected
      longer duration of support and in patients with preexisting AR that is more than 
      mild.

PG  - 594-6
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000111 [doi]
AB  - The total artificial heart (TAH) is effective for bridging patients with
      biventricular heart failure (BiVHF) to transplantation. It consists of two
      pneumatic pumps with four mechanical valves that replace nearly the entire
      myocardium, thus also making it effective therapy for heart failure from
      alternative (ALT) anatomical and pathophysiological causes that preclude left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD). This report reviews the clinical indications
      and outcomes for TAH implantation at our institution from 2006 to 2012. We sought
      to characterize and compare survival to transplant for patients with BiVHF to
      those with ALT indications. The overall survival to transplant for all patients
      was 86% (57/66). There was a trend towards decreased survival to transplantation 
      in the ALT group compared with the BiVHF group (77% vs. 93%, HR 0.42 [95%
      confidence interval 0.1, 1.7], log-rank test: p = 0.2). This was likely driven by
      certain high risk subgroups of allograft failure, LVAD failure, and acute
      postinfarct shock.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare (HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA)
      ventricular assist device (HVAD) is approved for implantation through a
      sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. We report on our initial experience with 
      this device implanted off-pump via thoracotomy. METHODS: A total of 26 patients
      were included in this review. All patients were Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support categories 2 or 3 and underwent
      implantation of an HVAD as an elective procedure via thoracotomy and mini
      sternotomy approach. Three-dimensional echocardiography was used to assess the
      ventricle and was also used to facilitate proper pump positioning. Patients were 
      managed during follow-up using anti-coagulants at a target international
      normalized ratio 2.0 to 2.5 as well as anti-platelet agents. RESULTS:
      Implantation was performed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, but 1
      patient did require conversion to on-pump surgery. There were no perioperative
      deaths or right heart failure events. The mean intensive care unit stay was 1.5
      days. Transfusions of 1 to 3 units of packed red blood cells were required in 16 
      patients, whereas 10 patients maintained a stable perioperative hematocrit of at 
      least 30% and did not require transfusion. Survival through 90 days was 100%, and
      survival through 180 days was 87%. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience was favorable in
      respect to outcome, safety, and use of blood products. Our technique can be used 
      as an alternative approach for left ventricular assist device implantation using 
      the HVAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are the most common noncardiac complication after cardiac 
      surgery, but their incidence across a broad range of operations, as well as the
      management factors that shape infection risk, remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: This
      study sought to prospectively examine the frequency of post-operative infections 
      and associated mortality, and modifiable management practices predictive of
      infections within 65 days from cardiac surgery. METHODS: This study enrolled
      5,158 patients and analyzed independently adjudicated infections using a
      competing risk model (with death as the competing event). RESULTS: Nearly 5% of
      patients experienced major infections. Baseline characteristics associated with
      increased infection risk included chronic lung disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.66; 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 2.26), heart failure (HR: 1.47; 95% CI:
      1.11 to 1.95), and longer surgery (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.41). Practices
      associated with reduced infection risk included prophylaxis with
      second-generation cephalosporins (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.94), whereas
      post-operative antibiotic duration >48 h (HR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.88), stress
      hyperglycemia (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.73); intubation time of 24 to 48 h
      (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.14); and ventilation >48 h (HR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.66
      to 3.63) were associated with increased risk. HRs for infection were similar with
      either <24 h or <48 h of antibiotic prophylaxis. There was a significant but
      differential effect of transfusion by surgery type (excluding left ventricular
      assist device procedures/transplant) (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.20). Major
      infections substantially increased mortality (HR: 10.02; 95% CI: 6.12 to 16.39). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Major infections dramatically affect survival and readmissions.
      Second-generation cephalosporins were strongly associated with reduced major
      infection risk, but optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis requires further
      study. Given practice variations, considerable opportunities exist for improving 
      outcomes and preventing readmissions. (Management Practices and Risk of Infection

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive renal dysfunction develops in patients with advanced HF. 
      We evaluated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C
      compared with established markers of renal function in patients with heart
      failure (HF) because they might improve prognostic assessment of patients with
      HF. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 40 patients with stable HF (age:
      58 +/- 8 years, body mass index [BMI]: 28.4 +/- 6.4 kg/m(2)), 40 HF patients
      undergoing ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation (age: 53 +/- 11 years,
      BMI: 26.8 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2)), 40 patients undergoing VAD removal at cardiac
      transplantation, and 24 controls (age: 48 +/- 7 years, BMI: 29.4 +/- 4.2
      kg/m(2)). Clinical data were collected from institutional medical records. NGAL
      and cystatin C levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the Modification of 
      Diet in Renal Disease formula. RESULTS: Patients with stable HF showed elevated
      NGAL and cystatin C levels compared with controls (NGAL: 114.9 +/- 48.3 ng/mL vs 
      72.0 +/- 36.6 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; cystatin C: 1490.4 +/- 576.1 ng/mL vs 954.7 +/- 
      414.2 ng/mL, p = 0.0026). Unlike cystatin C, NGAL increased in advanced HF
      patients requiring VAD implantation (158.7 +/- 74.8 ng/mL, p < 0.001). On VAD
      support, NGAL levels decreased (127.1 +/- 80.4 ng/mL, p = 0.034). NGAL was higher
      in patients who developed right ventricular failure (187.8 +/- 66.0 vs 130.9 +/- 
      67.0 ng/mL, p = 0.03) and irreversible renal dysfunction (190.0 +/- 73.8 ng/mL vs
      133.8 +/- 54.2 ng/mL, p < 0.05), whereas cystatin C, creatinine, and eGFR were
      not different. NGAL correlated with eGFR (r = -0.2188, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      NGAL levels correlate with HF severity and hemodynamic improvement after VAD
      placement. Our findings suggest a role of this novel biomarker as a marker of
      severity and prognosis in patients with HF.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate our clinical experience with the Jarvik
      2000 axial flow pump (Jarvik Heart, Inc, New York, NY, USA), a miniature axial
      flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The clinical results of eight
      patients, who underwent LVAD implantation with the Jarvik 2000 (median age 55.0
      years; six men) between 2005 and 2010, including two who participated in a
      multicenter clinical trial in Japan, were reviewed. Two patients underwent LVAD
      implantation as destination therapy. Four patients underwent Jarvik 2000
      implantation via median sternotomy, while the other four underwent implantation
      via left thoracotomy. There were no major complications during surgery. Four
      patients were supported for more than 2 years. The longest support duration was
      1,618 days. Six patients successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a
      median 725 days of support. One patient on destination therapy died of a cerebral
      infarction. The other patient on destination therapy had had the LVAD for 1,618
      days. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100, 86, and 86%,
      respectively. The median postoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase level was
      860.5 U/L at 1 month, 735 U/L at 6 months, and 692 U/L at 1 year. There were no
      fatal device-related infections. We found that the Jarvik 2000 with pin bearing
      could support patients with end-stage heart failure with acceptable mortality and
      morbidity rates. Further evaluations of the prevalence of thromboembolic and
      hemolytic events in patients with the new conical-bearing Jarvik 2000 are
      required.

TI  - Dental treatment in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit for patients with
      ventricular assist devices awaiting heart transplant: a case series.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1016/j.oooo.2014.04.010 [doi]
LID - S2212-4403(14)00458-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe the dental protocol for treating in the
      intensive care unit patients with end-stage heart failure who have had
      ventricular assist devices (VADs) emergently implanted as a bridge to heart
      transplant. This protocol permitted the rendering of safe and effective dental
      care in this setting and did not result in near-term (1-30 days) excessive
      hemorrhage, local and systemic infection, or contamination of the VAD. STUDY
      DESIGN: This descriptive cross-sectional study by the University of California,
      Los Angeles, Hospital Dental Service examined the dental care of 9 patients (mean
      age, 50 +/- 12.9 years) with class IV stage D heart failure. RESULTS: Nine
      patients, 22 days (mean) after VAD placement, received dental treatment after
      intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and maintenance of prior anticoagulation,
      antiplatelet, or antithrombin regimen. Eight patients had extractions (mean, 4;
      range, 1-12), and one of them also required scaling and root planing (SRP) of the
      remaining teeth. A ninth individual only required SRP of 4 quadrants. No adverse 
      outcomes developed. CONCLUSIONS: Emergent removal of active dental disease in
      patients with VAD awaiting heart transplant can be safely accomplished using
      established protocols with extended vigilance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is the standard therapy for the 
      management of acute or chronic end-stage heart failure. We report on our
      two-center experience with MCS therapy. METHODS: Between January 2000 and
      December 2012, 116 adult patients (mean age 56.8 +/- 9.9 years, range: 31 to 76
      years) were primarily supported on temporary or long-term ventricular assist
      devices (VADs) or total artificial hearts (TAHs) at our institutions. Temporary
      extracorporeal radial VAD support was established in 50 patients (43.1%) (Group
      A) whereas 66 (56.8%) patients received long-term paracorporeal and
      intracorporeal VAD or TAH (Group B). LVAD support was established in 63 patients 
      (54.3%), with BVAD/TAH support in 29 (25%). A temporary CentriMag was the only
      device adopted as an isolated RVAD support, being placed in 24 patients (20.6%). 
      RESULTS: In Group A, the overall mean support time was 10.2 +/- 6.6 days (range: 
      3 to 43 days) and the overall success rate was 55.1% (27 patients). The mean LVAD
      support time was 357 +/- 352.3 days (range: 1 to 902 days) in Group B and 98 +/- 
      82.6 days (range: 8 to 832 days) in BVAD/TAH patients, with success rates of
      72.5% (37 patients) and 46.6% (seven patients), respectively. The heart
      transplantation (Htx) rate for both groups combined was 25.8% (n = 30). The
      overall one- and five-year survival rates after Htx were 73.3% and 60%,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When a decision to treat with VAD or TAH is made
      early, either modality can be used as an alternative to Htx, affording comparable
      early to mid-term outcomes.

TI  - Impact of short-term mechanical circulatory support with extracorporeal devices
      on postoperative outcomes after emergency heart transplantation: data from a
      multi-institutional Spanish cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the potential impact of preoperative
      short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with extracorporeal devices on
      postoperative outcomes after emergency heart transplantation (HT). METHODS: We
      conducted an observational study of 669 patients who underwent emergency HT in 15
      Spanish hospitals between 2000 and 2009. Postoperative outcomes of patients
      bridged to HT on short-term MCS (n=101) were compared with those of the rest of
      the cohort (n=568). Short-term MCS included veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenators (VA-ECMOs, n=23), and both pulsatile-flow (n=53) and continuous-flow 
      (n=25) extracorporeal ventricular assist devices (VADs). No patient underwent HT 
      on intracorporeal VADs. RESULTS: Preoperative short-term MCS was independently
      associated with increased in-hospital postoperative mortality (adjusted
      odds-ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.05-2.91) and overall post-transplant mortality
      (adjusted hazard-ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.15-2.23). Rates of major surgical bleeding,
      cardiac reoperation, postoperative infection and primary graft failure were also 
      significantly higher among MCS patients. Causes of death and survival after
      hospital discharge were similar in MCS and non-MCS candidates. Increased risk of 
      post-transplant mortality affected patients bridged on pulsatile-flow
      extracorporeal VADs (adjusted hazard-ratio 2.21, 95% CI 1.48-3.30) and
      continuous-flow extracorporeal VADs (adjusted hazard-ratio 2.24, 95% CI
      1.20-4.19), but not those bridged on VA-ECMO (adjusted hazard-ratio 0.51, 95% CI 
      0.21-1.25). CONCLUSIONS: Patients bridged to emergency HT on short-term MCS are
      exposed to an increased risk of postoperative complications and mortality. In our
      series, preoperative bridging with VA-ECMO resulted in comparable post-transplant
      outcomes to those of patients transplanted on conventional support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drive-line infections (DLIs) frequently complicate ventricular assist
      device (VAD) support. We sought to describe the detailed effects of DLIs over
      time in patients with continuous-flow VADs, including the onset, risk factors,
      organisms involved, association with invasive infections, and outcomes. METHODS: 
      We reviewed data for patients with HeartMate II VADs (HMII) who were implanted at
      the Cleveland Clinic from October 2004 to September 2011 and followed through
      December 2011. DLIs were defined according to published criteria. RESULTS: DLIs
      developed in 45 of 194 HMII VADs over a median period of 232 days (range 22 to
      883 days). Hazard for DLI was 2.0%/month, but transiently peaked at 11%/month at 
      7.5 months after implant. Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 31%, 42% and 55%
      of initial, final and deep DLIs, respectively. Of the 40 superficial DLIs, 13
      (32.5%) became deep. DLI-associated bacteremia and hospitalization occurred in 14
      of 45 (31%) and 30 of 45 (67%), respectively. All patients received antibiotics
      (median 171 days), but only 3 of 44 (6.8%) developed an antibiotic complication. 
      DLIs increased the risk for death while on VAD support (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.20 to
      4.05; p = 0.01). Six and 12 months after DLI, mortality was 9.8% and 31%, but the
      competing event of transplantation occurred successfully in 20% and 28%,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most DLIs begin superficially with peak hazard at 7.5 
      months after implant. Depth of infection and infecting organism may evolve over
      months on support, with Pseudomonas becoming more prominent. Although effectively
      managed for prolonged periods, DLIs are associated with reduced survival on VAD
      support. Earlier transplantation is the most successful approach to treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two implantable continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices
      (LVADs), DuraHeart (Terumo Heart, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and EVAHEART (Sun Medical, 
      Nagano, Japan), were approved in Japan in April 2011. We analyzed the midterm
      outcome of patients implanted with these implantable LVADs at the University of
      Tokyo Hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 31 patients who underwent
      implantation of LVADs (10 DuraHeart, 21 EVAHEART) as a bridge to transplantation 
      at our institution between April 2011 and August 2013 were retrospectively
      reviewed. All patients were followed up through December 2013. Seven patients
      underwent conversions from NIPRO paracorporeal LVAD (Nipro, Osaka, Japan) to an
      implantable LVAD. The mean observation period was 483+/-239 days (41.0 patient
      years). Eight patients were transplanted and one patient showed functional
      recovery with subsequent LVAD explantation. Four patients died due to
      cerebrovascular accident, empyema, or device malfunction due to pump thrombosis
      after cerebral bleeding. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed 6-, 12-, and 24-month
      survival rates of 93%, 86%, and 86%, respectively. The rates of freedom from
      cerebrovascular accidents and device-related infections at 1 year after LVAD
      implantation were 65% and 36%, respectively. Twenty-nine patients were discharged
      home after LVAD implantation. During the period of this study, there were 59
      readmissions (53 urgent, 6 elective) among 22 patients (76%). The overall and
      urgent readmission rates were 1.66 and 1.49 per patient year, respectively. The
      common reason for readmission was device-related infection (31%), followed by
      cerebrovascular accidents (17%). The total out-of-hospital time after the primary
      discharge was 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Our midterm survival rate after LVAD implantation
      is satisfactory. However, patients undergoing LVAD support were often readmitted 
      with adverse events.

      failure in adult patients who fail conventional treatment. ECLS also complements 
      cardiac surgical and cardiology procedures, implantation of long-term mechanical 
      cardiac assist devices, heart and lung transplantation and cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation. Available ECLS therapies provide a range of options to the
      multidisciplinary teams who are involved in the time-critical care of these
      complex patients. While venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can
      provide complete respiratory support, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal
      facilitates protective lung ventilation and provides only partial respiratory
      support. Mechanical circulatory support with venoarterial (VA) ECMO employed in a
      traditional central/peripheral fashion or in a temporary ventricular assist
      device configuration may stabilise patients with decompensated cardiac failure
      who have evidence of end-organ dysfunction, allowing time for recovery,
      decision-making, and bridging to implantation of a long-term mechanical
      circulatory support device and occasionally heart transplantation. In highly
      selected patients with combined severe cardiac and respiratory failure, advanced 
      ECLS can be provided with central VA ECMO, peripheral VA ECMO with timely
      transition to venovenous ECMO or VA-venous ECMO upon myocardial recovery to avoid
      upper body hypoxia or by addition of an oxygenator to the temporary ventricular
      assist device circuit. This article summarises the available ECLS options and
      provides insights into the principles and practice of these techniques. One
      should emphasise that, as is common with many emerging therapies, their optimal
      use is currently not backed by quality evidence. This deficiency needs to be
      addressed to ensure that the full potential of ECLS can be achieved.

TI  - Bridge-to-decision therapy with a continuous-flow external ventricular assist
      device in refractory cardiogenic shock of various causes.
PG  - 799-806
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality for refractory cardiogenic shock remains high. In this
      patient cohort, there have been mixed results in mechanical circulatory support
      device use as a bridge-to-decision therapy. We evaluated a continuous-flow
      external ventricular assist device (VAD), CentriMag VAD (Thoratec Corp.,
      Pleasanton, CA), in patients with various causes of refractory cardiogenic shock.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective review of adult patients who
      underwent surgical CentriMag VAD insertion as bridge-to-decision therapy. From
      January 2007 through June 2012, 143 patients received CentriMag VAD. The cause of
      refractory cardiogenic shock was failure of medical management in 71 patients,
      postcardiotomy shock in 37, graft failure post-heart transplantation in 22, and
      right ventricular failure post-implantable left VAD in 13. Mean age was 52+/-16
      years, and 71% were in INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted 
      Circulatory Support) profile 1. Among 158 device runs, device configuration was
      BiVAD in 67%, isolated right VAD in 26%, and isolated left VAD in 8%. Median
      duration of support was 14 days (interquartile range, 8-26). Survival was 69% at 
      30 days and 49% at 1 year. The next destination after the CentriMag VAD was
      myocardial recovery in 30%, device exchange to an implantable VAD in 15%, and
      heart transplantation in 18%. The failure of medical management and the graft
      failure post-heart transplantation groups had higher 30-day survival compared
      with the postcardiotomy shock group. Major bleeding events occurred in 33% and
      cerebrovascular accidents in 14%. There was no CentriMag pump failure or
      thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bridge-to-decision therapy with CentriMag VAD is
      feasible in a variety of refractory cardiogenic shock settings. Patients with
      postcardiotomy shock have inferior survival.

PG  - 396-400
LID - 10.5535/arm.2014.38.3.396 [doi]
AB  - A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a mechanical circulation support
      implanted for patients with end-stage heart failure. It may be used either as a
      bridge to cardiac transplantation or as a destination therapy. The health of a
      75-year-old man with a medical history of systolic heart failure worsened.
      Therefore, he was recommended to have implanted a LVAD (Thoratec Corp.) as a
      destination therapy. After the surgery, he was enrolled in patient cardiac
      rehabilitation for the improvement of dyspnea and exercise capacity. In results, 
      there is an improvement on his exercise capacity and quality of life. For the
      first time in Korea, we reported a benefit of exercise therapy after being
      implanted with a LVAD.

TI  - Coronary sinus biomarker sampling compared to peripheral venous blood for
      predicting outcomes in patients with severe heart failure undergoing cardiac
      resynchronization therapy: the BIOCRT study.

LID - 10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.07.007 [doi]
LID - S1547-5271(14)00743-7 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant minority of patients receiving cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) remain nonresponsive to this intervention.
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether coronary sinus (CS) or baseline 
      peripheral venous (PV) levels of established and emerging heart failure (HF)
      biomarkers are predictive of CRT outcomes. METHODS: In 73 patients (aged 68 +/-
      12 years; 83% men; ejection fraction 27% +/- 7%) with CS and PV blood samples
      drawn simultaneously at the time of CRT device implantation, we measured
      amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), galectin-3 (gal-3),
      and soluble ST2 (sST2) levels. NT-proBNP concentrations >2000 pg/mL, gal-3
      concentrations >25.9 ng/mL, and sST2 concentrations >35 ng/mL were considered
      positive on the basis of established PV cut points for identifying "high-risk"
      individuals with HF. CRT response was adjudicated by the HF Clinical Composite
      Score. A major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was defined as the composite
      end point of death, cardiac transplant, left ventricular assist device, and HF
      hospitalization at 2 years. RESULTS: NT-proBNP concentrations were 20% higher in 
      the CS than in the periphery, while gal-3 and sST2 concentrations were 10% higher
      in the periphery than in the CS (all P < .001). There were 45% CRT nonresponders 
      at 6 months and 16 (22%) patients with MACE. Triple-positive CS values yielded
      the highest specificity of 95% for predicting CRT nonresponse. Consistently, CS
      strategies identified patients at higher risk of developing MACE, with >11-fold
      adjusted increase for triple-positive CS patients compared to triple-negative
      patients (all P </= .04). PV strategies were not predictive of MACE. CONCLUSION: 
      Our findings suggest that CS sampling of HF biomarkers may be better than PV
      sampling for predicting CRT outcomes. Larger studies are needed to confirm our
      findings.

AB  - The aim of the study was to systematically evaluate effect of CentriMag heart
      pump (Thoratec Corporation) as temporary ventricular assist device (VAD) and part
      of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system on outcomes in patients with
      cardiac or cardiac-respiratory failure. A systematic search was conducted in five
      databases for the period 2003 to 2012. Fifty-three publications with data for 999
      patients, supported with CentriMag, were included. In 72% studies, CentriMag was 
      used as a VAD and in 25% as part of ECMO circuit. Mean duration of VAD support
      was 25.0 days in precardiotomy group, 10.9 days in postcardiac surgery
      cardiogenic shock group, 8.8 days in post-transplant graft failure and rejection 
      group, and 16.0 days in post-LVAD placement right ventricular failure group.
      Survival on support was 82% (95% CI 70-92) for VAD support in precardiotomy
      cardiogenic shock indication, 63% (95% CI 46-78) in VAD support in postcardiac
      surgery cardiogenic shock indication, 62% (95% CI 46-76) in VAD support in
      post-transplant graft rejection or failure indication, and 83% (95% CI 73-92) in 
      VAD support in post-LVAD placement right ventricular failure indication.
      CentriMag is an effective technology for temporary support of patients with
      cardiac and cardiorespiratory failure.

TI  - Low cardiac output stimulates vasopressin release in patients with stage d heart 
      failure.
PG  - 2259-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressed hemodynamics stimulates arginine vasopressin (AVP) release,
      but the relationship between plasma AVP levels (P-AVP) and cardiac parameters,
      especially in patients with stage D heart failure (HF) receiving
      guideline-directed medical therapy, has not examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data
      including P-AVP were obtained from 162 in-hospital patients with stage D HF and
      from 80 patients receiving ventricular assist device (VAD, n=46) or heart
      transplantation (HTx, n=34) at 3 months after surgery. In the HF group,
      considerably high P-AVP (5.9+/-6.1 pg/ml) negatively correlated with serum sodium
      concentration (S-Na, 135.3+/-5.8 mEq/L, r=-0.548 [P<0.01]) and cardiac index (CI,
      2.2+/-0.5 L.min(-1).m(-2), r=-0.458 [P<0.01]). After VAD/HTx treatment,
      improvement in the CI (2.7+/-0.5 L.min(-1).m(-2)[P<0.01] vs. HF) was accompanied 
      by normalization of serum sodium concentration (S-Na; 138.2+/-2.0 mEq/L [P<0.01] 
      vs. HF) and suppressed release of AVP (1.7+/-3.4 pg/ml [P<0.01] vs. HF). P-AVP
      positively correlated with only S-Na (r=0.454 [P<0.01]), whereas no correlation
      was observed with CI after VAD/HTx treatment. P-AVP >/=5.3 pg/ml well predicted
      poor 2-year survival in HF group (60% [P<0.01] vs. 90%). CONCLUSIONS: Low cardiac
      output stimulates AVP release via a non-osmotic process that results in
      hyponatremia and poor prognosis in patients with stage D HF. After sufficient
      recovery of cardiac output by cardiac replacement therapy, AVP release is
      suppressed and is mainly regulated by serum osmolality.

TI  - Efficacy and durability of central oversewing for treatment of aortic
      insufficiency in patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.
PG  - 937-42
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.04.017 [doi]
LID - S1053-2498(14)01115-2 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic insufficiency (AI) in patients supported with continuous-flow 
      left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD) results in regurgitant volume returning
      from the aorta to the left ventricle, increased LVAD pump volume and reduced
      systemic cardiac output. One common strategy to address AI during CF-LVAD support
      is central oversewing of the aortic valve, which allows some opening between the 
      valve leaflets laterally. However, the long-term durability of this technique has
      not been extensively described. METHODS: All patients who underwent central
      oversewing of the aortic valve during CF-LVAD support between January 2006 and
      March 2013 were included in this analysis. Pre- and post-procedure
      intra-operative transesophageal echocardiograms (TEEs) were reviewed to determine
      the efficacy of the surgical technique, whereas all subsequent transthoracic
      echocardiograms (TTEs) were reviewed to assess durability. AI severity was graded
      using the vena contracta (VC) width and the ratio between the VC and left
      ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with
      central aortic valve oversewing were identified. Median follow-up was 560 days
      (range 46 to 954 days). All but 1 patient had their aortic insufficiency reduced 
      to "none/trace" on post-operative TEE. There was no statistically significant
      increase in the VC width and VC/LVOT ratio between the first and last follow-up
      echocardiograms, and only 2 patients developed more than mild aortic
      insufficiency after central oversewing. Central oversewing of the aortic valve
      did not adversely affect outcomes after LVAD implantation. CONCLUSION: Central
      oversewing of the aortic valve is an effective and durable means of addressing
      greater than mild AI in patients with CF-LVAD.

AB  - Patients on long-term left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support present
      unique challenges in the intensive care unit. It is crucial to know the status of
      end-organ perfusion, which may require invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a
      systemic arterial and pulmonary artery catheter. Depending on the indication for 
      LVAD support (bridge to decision or cardiac transplantation vs destination
      therapy), it is important to readdress goals of care with the patient (if
      possible) and their family after major events have occurred that challenge the
      survival of the patient.

AB  - Right ventricular failure complicates several commonly encountered conditions in 
      the intensive care unit. Right ventricular dilation and paradoxic movement of the
      interventricular septum on echocardiography establishes the diagnosis. Right
      heart catheterization is useful in establishing the specific cause and aids
      clinicians in management. Principles of treatment focus on reversal of the
      underlying cause, optimization of right ventricular preload and contractility,
      and reduction of right ventricular afterload. Mechanical support with right
      ventricular assist device or veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      can be used in select patients who fail to improve with optimal medical therapy.

TI  - Four-year outcomes with third-generation centrifugal left ventricular assist
      devices in an era of restricted transplantation.
PG  - e35-40
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezu258 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Third-generation ventricular assist devices (VADs) are associated
      with improved outcomes, though in recent clinical trials bridge-to-transplant
      (BTT) rates are approximately 30% at 6 months, so that transplantation can be
      used as a 'bail out' for serious complications. In the UK, there was a
      significant reduction in heart transplantation rates over the last decade, so
      that transplantation from VADs is much less frequent. The objective of this study
      was to determine outcomes and their predictors in this situation of low BTT
      rates, and as patients were exposed to long-term support, the incidence and
      outcomes of VAD thrombosis. METHODS: We analysed outcomes for 102 consecutive
      patients between 2009 and 2013 (mean age 47 +/- 13; VentrAssist n = 6 and
      HeartWare n = 96). The median duration of support was 462 +/- 426 days. RESULTS: 
      Survival rates on the device were 75 and 66% at 1 and 2 years, respectively.
      Older age and more acute INTERMACS groups were significantly related to reduced
      survival within the first 90 days (P = 0.030 and 0.010, respectively). Poor
      preoperative right ventricular (RV) function had a negative effect on survival
      after 1 year (P = 0.009), though not earlier. VAD thrombosis (n = 24 HeartWare
      and n = 1 VentrAssist) occurred at 0.18 events per patient-year for HeartWare and
      0.07 for VentrAssist devices at a median time of onset at 404 +/- 281 days. There
      was no significant effect of VAD thrombosis on survival. Only 14 of 102 patients 
      were transplanted at a median of 334 +/- 347 days, and only 3 were transplanted
      within the first 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation left ventricular assist 
      device implants with a low rate of transplantation have similar survival to
      destination therapy, and are susceptible to long-term complications of VAD
      thrombosis and right heart failure.

AB  - Aortic insufficiency (AI) following rotary left ventricular assist device (LVAD) 
      implantation is an increasingly common problem with inadequately defined
      treatment options. Percutaneous transcatheter (PTC) closure of the aortic valve
      (AV) has been described as a potential nonsurgical approach. Alternatively, we
      present a case of decompensated heart failure due to de novo severe AI following 
      LVAD in which successful PTC closure of the AV resolved the severe AI and allowed
      for clinical recovery and stability for more than 10 months as a bridge to heart 
      transplantation. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New generation continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices
      (LVADs) utilise centrifugal pumps. Data concerning their effect on patient
      haemodynamics, ventricular function and tissue perfusion is limited. We aimed to 
      document these parameters following HeartWare centrifugal continuous-flow LVAD
      (HVAD) implantation and to assess the impact of post-operative right heart
      failure (RHF). METHODS: We reviewed 53 consecutive patients (mean age 49.5 +/-
      14.1 yrs) with HVAD implanted in the left ventricle, at St. Vincent's Hospital,
      Sydney, between January 2007 and August 2012. Available paired right heart
      catheterisation (n=35) and echocardiography (n=39) data was reviewed to assess
      response of invasive haemodynamics and ventricular function to LVAD support.
      RESULTS: A total of 28 patients (53%) were implanted from interim mechanical
      circulatory support. Seventeen patients (32%) required short-term post-implant
      veno-pulmonary artery extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. At 100 +/- 61 days
      post-implant, mean pulmonary artery pressure and mean pulmonary capillary wedge
      pressure decreased from 38.8 +/- 7.7 to 22.9 +/- 7.7 mmHg and 28.3 +/- 6.4 to
      13.4 +/- 5.4 mmHg respectively (p<0.001). LV end diastolic diameter decreased
      from 71.3 +/- 12.7 to 61.1 +/- 13.7 mm and LV end-systolic diameter from 62.7 +/-
      12.3 to 53.9 +/- 14.4mm (p<0.001). Aortic regurgitation remained trivial. Serum
      sodium increased from 133.3 +/- 5.7 to 139.3 +/- 2.8 mmol/L and creatinine
      decreased from 109.1 +/- 42.5 to 74.3 +/- 26.2 mumol/L (p<0.001). Across the
      entire cohort, the six-month survival/transplant rate was significantly lower for
      RHF patients (72.2%, n=18) compared to those without (96.9%, n=35, p=0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: HVAD support improves haemodynamics, LV dimensions and renal
      function. Following implantation with a centrifugal continuous-flow LVAD, RHF
      remains a significant risk with a tendency to worse outcomes in the short to
      medium term.

AB  - The number of children in need of mechanical circulatory support has increased
      substantially over the last two decades, due to the technological progress made
      in surgery and intensive care, leading to improved survival of patients with
      congenital heart disease. In addition, primary myocardial dysfunction related to 
      myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy may cause end-stage cardiac failure in
      children or infants, although not as frequently as in adults. The need for
      mechanical circulatory support may be either temporary until spontaneous
      myocardial recovery, as in postcardiotomy cardiac failure, or prolonged until
      heart transplantation in the absence of recovery. Two types of mechanical
      circulatory devices are suitable for the paediatric population: extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation for short-term support; and ventricular assist devices for
      long-term support as a bridge to transplantation. The aim of this review is to
      describe the specific issues related to paediatric mechanical circulatory support
      and the different types of devices available, to report on their rapidly growing 
      use worldwide and on the outcomes for each indication and type of device, and to 
      provide a perspective on the future developments and remaining challenges in this
      field.

TI  - Liver dysfunction assessed by model for end-stage liver disease excluding INR
      (MELD-XI) scoring system predicts adverse prognosis in heart failure.
PG  - e100618
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0100618 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Liver dysfunction due to heart failure (HF) is often referred to as cardiac
      or congestive hepatopathy. The composite Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
      excluding INR (MELD-XI) is a robust scoring system of liver function, and a high 
      score is associated with poor prognosis in advanced HF patients with a heart
      transplantation and/or ventricular assist device. However, the impact of MELD-XI 
      on the prognosis of HF patients in general remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      We retrospectively analyzed 562 patients who were admitted to our hospital for
      the treatment of decompensated HF. A MELD-XI score was graded, and patients were 
      divided into two groups based on the median value of MELD-XI score: Group L
      (MELD-XI <10, n = 289) and Group H (MELD-XI >/=10, n = 273). We compared
      all-cause mortality and echocardiographic findings between the two groups. In the
      follow-up period (mean 471 days), 104 deaths (62 cardiac deaths and 42
      non-cardiac deaths) were observed. The event (cardiac death, non-cardiac death,
      all-cause death)-free rate was significantly higher in group L than in group H
      (logrank P<0.05, respectively). In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, a high
      MELD-XI score was found to be an independent predictor of cardiac deaths and
      all-cause mortality in HF patients. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, right
      atrial and ventricular areas, inferior vena cava diameter, and systolic pulmonary
      artery pressure were higher in group H than in group L (P<0.05, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: The MELD-XI scoring system, a marker of liver function, can identify
      high-risk patients with right heart volume overload, higher pulmonary arterial
      pressure and multiple organ failure associated with HF.

TI  - Are peripherally inserted central catheters associated with increased risk of
      adverse events in status 1B patients awaiting transplantation on continuous
      intravenous milrinone?

LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2014.06.004 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are used to deliver
      continuous intravenous (IV) milrinone in stage D heart failure (HF) patients
      awaiting heart transplantation (HT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed PICC
      adverse events (AEs) and associated cost in 129 status 1B patients from 2005 to
      2012. End points were HT, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and death.
      Regression analysis was used to identify AE risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty-three
      PICC AEs occurred in 35 patients (27%), consisting of 48 infections, 4
      thromboses, and 1 bleeding event. Median duration of PICC support was 63
      (interquartile range [IQR] 34-131) days, and median time to first PICC infection 
      was 44 (IQR 14-76) days. Among PICC infections, 9% required defibrillator removal
      and 30% were inactivated on the HT list for a mean of 23 +/- 17 days. Rate of HT,
      LVAD, or death was similar between groups (P > .05). Regression analysis found
      that a double lumen PICC was associated with a shorter time to first PICC
      infection (hazard ratio 7.59, 95% CI 1.97-29.23; P = .003). Median cost per PICC 
      infection was $10,704 (IQR $7,401-$26,083). CONCLUSIONS: PICC infections were the
      most frequent AEs. PICCs with >1 lumen were associated with increased risk of
      infection. PICC AEs accounted for increased intensive care unit admissions, HT
      list inactivations, and overall cost.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the prognostic significance of pre- and
      post-capillary components of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients receiving
      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). BACKGROUND: PH is common in patients
      with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) receiving CRT. The impact of PH
      subtype on clinical outcome in CRT is unknown. METHODS: The study population
      consisted of 101 patients (average age 66 +/- 13 years, left ventricular ejection
      fraction 0.23 +/- 0.07, and New York Heart Association functional class 3.2 +/-
      0.4) who underwent right heart catheterization in the 6 months before CRT. PH was
      defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure >/=25 mm Hg; a significant
      pre-capillary contribution to elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure was defined
      as a transpulmonary gradient (TPG) >/=12 mm Hg. Clinical endpoints were assessed 
      at 2 years and included all-cause mortality and a composite of death, left
      ventricular assist device, or cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with TPG
      >/=12 mm Hg were more likely to experience all-cause mortality (hazard ratio
      [HR]: 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 7.4; p = 0.009) and the composite
      outcome (HR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.4 to 6.3; p = 0.004) compared with patients with TPG 
      <12 mm Hg. After multivariate adjustment for hemodynamic, clinical, and
      echocardiographic variables, only TPG >/=12 mm Hg and baseline right ventricular 
      (RV) dilation (RV end-diastolic dimension >42 mm) were associated with the
      composite clinical outcome (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
      High TPG PH and RV dilation are independent predictors of adverse outcomes in
      patients with LVSD who are receiving CRT. RV pulmonary vascular dysfunction may
      be a therapeutic target in select patients receiving CRT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, ventricular assist device (VAD) or total artificial heart 
      (TAH) mechanical support provides an effective treatment of unstable patients
      with advanced heart failure. We report our single-center experience with
      mechanical circulatory support therapy. METHODS: From March 2002 to December
      2012, 107 adult patients (mean age, 56.8 +/- 9.9 y; range, 31-76 y) were primarly
      supported on temporary or long-term VAD or TAH support as treatment for
      refractory heart failure at our institution. Temporary extracorporeal radial VAD 
      support (group A) was established in 49 patients (45.7%), and long-term
      paracorporeal and intracorporeal VAD or TAH (group B) in 58 patients (54.2%).
      Left ventricular (LVAD) support was established in 55 patients (51.4%; n = 33,
      Heartmate II; n = 6, Heartmate I XVE; n = 4, Heartware HVAD; and n = 12,
      Centrimag) and biventricular (BVAD/TAH) support (group B) in 28 patients (26.1%; 
      n = 10, Thoratec paracorporeal; n = 2, Heartware HVAD, n = 1, Thoratec
      implantable; n = 1, Syncardia TAH; and n = 14, Centrimag). The temporary
      Centrimag was the only device adopted as isolated right ventricular (RVAD)
      support, and it was inserted in 24 patients (22.4%). RESULTS: In group A, overall
      mean support time was 10.2 +/- 6.6 days (range, 3-43 d). In group B, LVAD mean
      support time was 357 +/- 352.3 days (range, 1-902 d) and BVAD/TAH support time
      was 98 +/- 82.6 days (range, 8-832 d). In group A, the overall success rate was
      55.1% (27 patients). In group B, LVAD overall success rate was 74.4% (32
      patients) and BVAD/TAH success rate was 50% (7 patients). Overall heart
      transplantation rate for both groups was 27.1% (n = 2, group A; n = 27, group B).
      Overall 1-year and 5-year survivals after heart transplantation were 72.4% (n =
      21) and 58.6% (n = 17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical circulatory support
      is an effective strategy even in cases of end-stage heart failure according to
      our experience. Further improvement of VAD and TAH technologies may support their
      adoption as an encouraging alternative to heart transplantation in the near
      future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular assist devices have become a standard treatment for
      patients with advanced heart failure. We present data comparing results after
      implantation of HeartMate II (HM II) versus HVAD (HW) left ventricular assist
      devices (LVADs) for the past 7 years at our institution. METHODS: From July 2006 
      to August 2012, 121 consecutive patients underwent LVAD implantation: 70 (57.9%) 
      received HM II and 51 (42.1%) HW. Patient demographics, perioperative
      characteristics, and laboratory parameters as well as postoperative outcome were 
      compared retrospectively. RESULTS: Patients in the HM II group were significantly
      younger (P < .01), with more deranged liver function (higher bilirubin [P = .02] 
      and alanine aminotransferase [P = .01] levels), and had a significantly higher
      rate of preoperative infections requiring antibiotic treatment (P = .02) and a
      higher body core temperature (P < .01). Other demographic and preoperative
      parameters did not show statistical differences. Most postoperative
      characteristics were also similar between the two groups. HM II patients had a
      significantly higher transfusion rate, but there were no differences in incidence
      of resternotomy (P = .156). Recovery and VAD explantation were more likely in the
      HM II group (P = .02). Although there was no significant difference in survival
      (log rank test: P = .986; Breslow test: P = .827), HM II patients were more
      likely to develop a percutaneous site infection (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both HM
      II and HW provide similar early postoperative outcome and good long-term
      survival. The differences observed between the groups may be related to
      demographic and preoperative factors rather than the type of the device used.

AB  - Cardiac transplantation remains the gold standard for end stage heart failure
      however results of long-term mechanical circulatory support have dramatically
      improved over the last 10years. One should now clearly consider a left
      ventricular assist device as bridge to transplant or destination therapy in
      refractory isolated left heart failure. Mechanical biventricular support remains 
      more challenging with lower survival and may be proposed as bridge to transplant.
      Correct patient's selection and appropriate follow-up are mandatory in such
      critical patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The DuraHeart is a continuous centrifugal-flow left ventricular
      assist device that uses active magnetic levitation for impeller positioning
      designed for improved hemocompatibility and durability. This study reviews the
      results of the US trial with specific attention to hemolysis, thrombotic
      complications, and pump failure. METHODS: The US SUSTAIN trial was a multicenter,
      prospective, single-arm observational study in advanced heart failure patients
      listed for transplantation. Follow-up was complete in 100% of the patients at 6
      months. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were enrolled at 23 centers. Forty-six
      patients (73%) reached the primary end points of survival to transplantation,
      alive on the original device at 180 days and listed for transplantation, or
      explant for recovery. Median duration of support was 267 days (range, 10 to 952
      days) with a total support time of 46 patient-years. There was no clinical
      hemolysis reported during the study. Mean lactate dehydrogenase values peaked at 
      day 4 and significantly decreased during support (435+/-236 U/L and 297+/-142 U/L
      on day 3 and day 180, respectively). There were no cases of pump thrombosis
      reported, and 3 cases of pump thrombus "in transit" (0.06 events/patient-year)
      were observed. There were 6 (10%) cases of magnetic levitation system failure,
      all secondary to cable wire fractures (0.12 events/patient-year). All patients
      were hemodynamically stable with the backup hydrodynamic mode. Major adverse
      events included gastrointestinal bleeding (0.52 events/patient-year), ischemic
      and hemorrhagic strokes (0.17 events/patient-year and 0.09 events/patient-year,
      respectively), and driveline infections (0.67 events/patient-year). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The DuraHeart demonstrated good hemocompatibility; however, the reliability of
      full magnetic levitation systems should be a high priority in future pump
      designs.

AB  - The present study defined the short- and long-term effects of left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) implantation and heart transplantation (HT) on physical
      activity and quality of life (QoL). Forty patients (LVAD, n = 14; HT, n = 12; and
      heart failure [HF], n = 14) and 14 matched healthy subjects were assessed for
      physical activity, energy expenditure, and QoL. The LVAD and HT groups were
      assessed postoperatively at 4 to 6 weeks (baseline) and 3, 6, and 12 months. At
      baseline, LVAD, HT, and HF patients demonstrated low physical activity, reaching 
      only 15%, 28%, and 51% of that of healthy subjects (1,603 +/- 302 vs 3,036 +/-
      439 vs 5,490 +/- 1,058 vs 10,756 +/- 568 steps/day, respectively, p <0.01). This 
      was associated with reduced energy expenditure and increased sedentary time (p
      <0.01). Baseline QoL was not different among LVAD, HT, and HF groups (p = 0.44). 
      LVAD implantation and HT significantly increased daily physical activity by 60%
      and 52%, respectively, from baseline to 3 months (p <0.05), but the level of
      activity remained unchanged at 3, 6, and 12 months. The QoL improved from
      baseline to 3 months in LVAD implantation and HT groups (p <0.01) but remained
      unchanged afterward. At any time point, HT demonstrated higher activity level
      than LVAD implantation (p <0.05), and this was associated with better QoL. In
      contrast, physical activity and QoL decreased at 12 months in patients with HF (p
      <0.05). In conclusion, patients in LVAD and HT patients demonstrate improved
      physical activity and QoL within the first 3 months after surgery, but physical
      activity and QoL remain unchanged afterward and well below that of healthy
      subjects. Strategies targeting low levels of physical activity should now be
      explored to improve recovery of these patients.

      explantation influences graft survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are increasing numbers of patients undergoing orthotopic heart 
      transplantation (OHT) with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) explantation
      (LVAD explant-OHT). We hypothesized that LVAD explant-OHT is a more challenging
      surgical procedure compared to OHT without LVAD explantation and that
      institutional LVAD explant-OHT procedural volume would be associated with
      post-transplant graft survival. We sought to assess the impact of institutional
      volume of LVAD explant-OHT on post-transplant graft survival. METHODS: This is a 
      retrospective analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for
      adult OHTs with long-term LVAD explantation. LVAD explant-OHT volume was
      characterized on the basis of the center's year-specific total OHT volume
      (OHTvol) and year-specific LVAD explant-OHT volume quartile (LVADvolQ). The
      effect of LVADvolQ on graft survival (death or re-transplantation) was analyzed. 
      RESULTS: From 2004 to 2011, 2,681 patients underwent OHT with LVAD explantation
      (740 with HeartMate XVE, 1,877 with HeartMate II and 64 with HeartWare devices). 
      LVAD explant-OHT at centers falling in the lowest LVADvolQ was associated with
      reduced post-transplant graft survival (p = 0.022). After adjusting for
      annualized OHTvol (HR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.993 to 1.003, p = 0.515 and pulsatile XVE
      (HR = 0.842, 95% CI 0.688 to 1.032, p = 0.098), multivariate analysis confirmed a
      significantly (approximately 37%) increased risk of post-transplant graft failure
      among explant-OHT procedures occurring at centers in the lowest volume quartile
      (HR = 1.371, 95% CI 1.030 to 1.825, p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: Graft survival is
      decreased when performed at centers falling in the lowest quartile of LVAD
      explant-OHT for a given year. This volume-survival relationship should be
      considered in the context of limited donor organ availability and the rapidly
      growing number of LVAD centers.

TI  - Assessment of a University of California, Los Angeles 4-variable risk score for

PG  - e000998
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.114.000998 [doi]
LID - e000998 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 4-variable risk score from University of California, Los Angeles 
      (UCLA) demonstrated superior discrimination in advanced heart failure, compared
      to established risk scores. However, the model has not been externally validated,
      and its suitability as a selection tool for heart transplantation (HT) and left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated
      the UCLA risk score (based on B-type natriuretic peptide, peak VO2, New York
      Heart Association class, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
      angiotensin receptor blocker) in 180 patients referred for HT. The outcome was
      survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival
      was compared to Kaplan-Meier's estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model
      discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1
      years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival
      was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97,
      respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses
      demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year,
      0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was
      poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to
      +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results 
      were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate
      imputation of missing data. CONCLUSIONS: The UCLA 4-variable risk model
      calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external
      validation cohort. Further model assessment is warranted before widespread use.

TI  - Does prior valve surgery change outcome in patients treated with cardiac
      resynchronization therapy?
PG  - 1206-13
LID - 10.1111/jce.12469 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cardiac valve surgery (CVS) has been implicated as a potential barrier to
      optimal response after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) though prospective
      data regarding outcome remains limited. We sought to determine CRT response in
      patients with a prior history of CVS. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired cohort of CRT patients with
      history of CVS. Echocardiographic response was evaluated at baseline and 6
      months. The coprimary endpoints were time to first heart failure (HF)
      hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality, transplantation and left 
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) assessed over a 3-year follow-up period. The
      study group consisted of 569 patients undergoing CRT. Of these, 86 patients had a
      history of CVS (46.5% aortic, 37.2% mitral, 16.3% combined, and tricuspid), and
      were compared to 483 patients with no history of CVS. Baseline clinical and
      echocardiographic characteristics were not significantly different between the
      groups except for a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF; 74.4% vs. 55.3%;
      P = 0.001), coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG; 58.1% vs. 38.7%; P = 0.001),
      and longer QRS duration (167.6 +/- 29.3 milliseconds vs. 159.4 +/- 27.5
      milliseconds; P = 0.01) in those with prior CVS. Survival with respect to HF
      hospitalization and composite outcome was comparable in both groups.
      Echocardiographic response (improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction of 
      >/=10%) was similar. No difference in clinical or echocardiographic outcome was
      found by type of valve surgery performed. CONCLUSION: Despite a higher incidence 
      of AF, CABG, and longer QRS duration, history of CVS is not associated with worse
      clinical or echocardiographic outcome after CRT.

LID - S1071-9164(14)00213-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced exercise tolerance from impaired cardiac output is an
      important criterion for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.
      However, little is known about how exercise capacity changes after LVAD and how
      changes compare with patients undergoing heart transplantation. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We compared changes in cardiopulmonary exercise testing performed pre-
      and postoperatively in patients who underwent HeartMate II LVAD implantation (n =
      25) and heart transplantation (n = 74) at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
      Minnesota, between 2007 and 2012. Preoperatively, patients undergoing LVAD and
      transplant had markedly reduced exercise time (mean 5.1 minutes [45% predicted]
      and 5.0 minutes [44% predicted], respectively), low peak oxygen consumption (VO2;
      mean 11.5 mL . kg . min [43% predicted] and 11.9 mL . kg . min [38% predicted]), 
      and abnormal ventilatory gas exchange (ratio of minute ventilation to carbon
      dioxide production [VE/VCO2] nadir 39.4 and 37.4). After LVAD and transplant,
      there were similar improvements in exercise time (mean Delta +1.2 vs. 1.7
      minutes, respectively, P = .27) and VE/VCO2 nadir (mean Delta -3.7 vs. -4.2, P = 
      .74). However, peak VO2 increased posttransplant but did not change post-LVAD
      (mean Delta +5.4 vs. +0.9 mL . kg . min, respectively, P < .001). Most patients
      (72%) had a peak VO2 < 14 mL . kg . min post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Although
      improvements in exercise capacity and gas exchange are seen after LVAD and heart 
      transplant, peak VO2 doesn't improve post-LVAD and remains markedly abnormal in
      most patients.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices are fast becoming an accepted alternative to treat
      end-stage heart failure, and are being implemented as a bridge to myocardial
      recovery, a bridge to heart transplantation, or as destination therapy.
      Positioning of the inflow cannula into the apex of the ventricle is a crucial
      step due to the risk of sucking in air. We describe an improved method of
      preparing the insertion site for the ventricular assist device inflow cannula, to
      minimize the chances of air embolism and blood spillage, which we applied in a
      34-year-old man, as a bridge to transplantation.

TI  - Inotrope use and outcomes among patients hospitalized for heart failure: impact
      of systolic blood pressure, cardiac index, and etiology.
PG  - 593-601
LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2014.05.006 [doi]
LID - S1071-9164(14)00210-3 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inotropes are widely used in hospitalized systolic heart failure (HF)
      patients, especially those with low systolic blood pressure (SBP) or cardiac
      index. In addition, inotropes are considered to be harmful in nonischemic HF.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the association of in-hospital inotrope use with
      (1) major events (death, ventricular assist device, or heart transplant) and (2) 
      study days alive and out of hospital during the first 6 months in the Evaluation 
      Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization
      Effectiveness, which excluded patients with immediate need for inotropic therapy.
      Predefined subgroups of interest were baseline SBP <100 versus >/= 100 mm Hg,
      cardiac index <1.8 vs >/= 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2), and ischemic versus nonischemic HF
      etiology. Inotropes were frequently used in both the <100 mm Hg (88/165 [53.3%]) 
      and the >/= 100 mm Hg (106/262 [40.5%]) SBP subgroups and were associated with
      higher risk for major events in both subgroups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.85, 
      95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-5.12 [P < .001]; and HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.02-3.37 
      [P = .042]; respectively). Risk with inotropes was more pronounced among those
      with cardiac index >/= 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 114; HR 4.65, 95% CI 1.98-10.9; P
      < .001) vs <1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 82; HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.61-3.58; P = .39).
      Event rates were higher with inotropes in both ischemic (n = 215; HR 2.64, 95% CI
      1.49-4.68; P = .001) and nonischemic (n = 216; HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.18-4.07; P =
      .012) patients. Across all subgroups, patients who received inotropes spent fewer
      study days alive and out of hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of cardiogenic 
      shock or end-organ hypoperfusion, inotrope use during hospitalization for HF was 
      associated with unfavorable 6-month outcomes, regardless of admission SBP,
      cardiac index, or HF etiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The psychosocial assessment of candidates for transplantation (PACT),
      developed to assess candidates for heart transplant, has not been routinely used 
      to assess left ventricular assist device (LVAD) candidacy. We examined the
      efficacy of the PACT to assess psychosocial outcomes in LVAD patients. METHODS:
      We reviewed patients who received LVAD implants between June 2006 and April 2011 
      and retrospectively applied the PACT. We determined the accuracy of identifying
      social success with the PACT and revised domains to reflect criteria influencing 
      social success for LVAD patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (72% men, 44%
      non-white, 50.4 years old) were divided into high-scoring and low-scoring groups.
      Nine patients with low PACT scores were falsely categorized as high-risk, whereas
      4 with high scores had poor social outcomes. The score had a high
      positive-predictive value (0.86) but low negative-predictive value (0.31). The
      PACT was revised (modified [m]PACT) to measure indicators, such as social support
      and understanding of care requirements, identified to more closely affect LVAD
      outcome. The mPACT exhibited improved accuracy. A reclassification table was
      developed, and the net reclassification index was 0.32. The percentage of
      patients incorrectly classified for social risk decreased from 27% with the PACT 
      to 8% with the mPACT. Patients with higher mPACT scores had decreased 30-day
      readmission rates (26% vs 67%, p = 0.045) after device implantation. CONCLUSIONS:
      By emphasizing social support, psychologic health, lifestyle factors, and device 
      understanding, the mPACT showed improved performance in risk-stratifying
      candidates for LVAD therapy. Prospective validation is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis increases in heart failure (HF) and is
      implicated in disease progression. The apoptotic cell is not inevitably committed
      to death, and appropriate therapy like left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      support could offer a rescue of cellular functions. Literature data regarding the
      modulation of the apoptotic process during LVAD support are still controversial. 
      METHODS: To assess whether LVAD implantation modifies the apoptotic profile in
      the heart, cardiac tissue was collected from end-stage HF patients before LVAD
      implant (pre-LVAD, n=22) and at LVAD removal (post-LVAD, n=6) and from stable HF 
      patients on medical therapy without prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at heart
      transplantation as control. Caspase (Casp)-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and Hsp72 cardiac mRNA 
      and protein expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and 
      Western blotting (WB) in the three groups of patients. Immunohistochemical
      analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
      assay, and DNA laddering analysis were performed; cellular size and interstitial 
      fibrosis content were also determined. RESULTS: All the apoptotic indices were
      increased in the post-LVAD group compared to pre-LVAD, specially antiapoptotic
      Hsp72 and proapoptotic Bax (Hsp72: 3.27+/-0.41 vs. 0.76+/-0.14, P<.001; Bax:
      2.15+/-0.38 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.29, P=.035; post-LVAD vs. pre-LVAD, respectively). The
      significant increase in Hsp72 was confirmed by WB and immunohistochemical
      analysis. CONCLUSION: LVAD appears to induce an activation of apoptotic
      mediators, mainly at the mitochondrial level, while the following activation of
      Casp-3 is reduced by the significant increase of Hsp72, whose enhancement could
      be an important factor in cardiac remodeling associated with LVAD support.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in refractory cardiogenic shock:
      treatment strategies and analysis of risk factors.
PG  - E129-41
LID - 10.1111/aor.12317 [doi]
AB  - Two centrifugal pumps, the RotaFlow (Maquet, Jostra Medizintechnik AG,
      Hirrlingen, Germany) and Levitronix CentriMag (Levitronix LCC, Waltham, MA, USA),
      used in central or peripheral veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) support systems have been investigated, in terms of double-center
      experience, as treatment for patients with refractory cardiogenic shock (CS).
      Between January 2006 and December 2012, 228 consecutive adult patients were
      supported on RotaFlow (n=213) or CentriMag (n=15) ECMO, at our institutions (155 
      men; age 58.3+/-10.5 years, range: 19-84 years). Indications for support were:
      failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy
      (n=118) and primary donor graft failure (n=37); postacute myocardial infarction
      CS (n=27); acute myocarditis (n=6); and CS on chronic heart failure (n=40). A
      peripheral ECMO setting was established in 126 (55.2%) patients while it was
      established centrally in 102 (44.7%). Overall mean support time was 10.9+/-9.7
      days (range: 1-43 days). Eighty-four (36.8%) patients died on ECMO. Overall
      success rate, in terms of survival on ECMO (n=144), weaning from mechanical
      support (n=107; 46.9%), bridge to mid-long-term ventricular assist device (n=6;
      2.6%), and bridge to heart transplantation (n=31; 13.5%), was 63.1%. One hundred 
      twenty-two (53.5%) patients were successfully discharged. Stepwise logistic
      regression identified blood lactate level and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase
      (CK-MB) relative index at 72 h after ECMO initiation, and number of packed red
      blood cells (PRBCs) transfused on ECMO as significant predictors of mortality on 
      ECMO (P=0.010, odds ratio [OR]=2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-3.14;
      P=0.010, OR=2.82, 95% CI=1.014-3.721; and P=0.011, OR=2.69; 95% CI=1.06-4.16,
      respectively). Central ECMO population had significantly higher rate of
      continuous veno-venous hemofiltration need and bleeding requiring surgery events 
      compared with the peripheral ECMO setting population. No significant differences 
      were seen by comparing the RotaFlow and CentriMag populations in terms of device 
      performance. At follow-up, persistent heart failure with left ventricle ejection 
      fraction (LVEF)</=40% was a risk factor after hospital discharge. Patients with a
      poor hemodynamic status may benefit from rapid central or peripheral insertion of
      ECMO. The blood lactate level, CK-MB relative index, and PRBCs transfused should 
      be strictly monitored during ECMO support. In addition, early ventricular assist 
      device placement or urgent listing for heart transplant should be considered in
      patients with persistent impaired LVEF after ECMO.

TI  - First experience with the Synergy Micro-Pump in patients in INTERMACS class 1-2
      as a bridge to transplantation: pushing the limits?
PG  - 118-25
LID - 10.1111/aor.12316 [doi]
AB  - The Synergy Micro-pump is the smallest implantable left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) and provides partial flow support up to 4.25 L/min. It was shown that
      early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits to patients 
      with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support LVAD. However,
      as it can be inserted via small incisions with no need for sternotomy or
      cardiopulmonary bypass, it might be beneficial for selected high-risk patients.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Synergy Micro-pump in
      patients in INTERMACS class 1-2. From February 2012 to August 2013, 13 patients
      with severe heart failure were supported with the Synergy Pocket Micro-pump.
      Patients were divided into two groups according to INTERMACS class: the high-risk
      group (INTERMACS class 1-2) and the low-risk group (INTERMACS class 3-4). There
      were seven patients in INTERMACS class 1-2 and six in INTERMACS class 3-4.
      Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and postoperative outcomes
      were compared. There were no statistically significant differences in patient
      demographics, and mean support time was 108 +/- 114 days in the high-risk group
      and 238 +/- 198 days in the low-risk group. Also, there were no significant
      differences in perioperative characteristics or in the rate of postoperative
      adverse events. The overall survival was comparable between the two groups (one
      late death in each group, log-rank P = 0.608). Two patients from the high-risk
      group were upgraded to a full-support LVAD (P = 0.462) after 65 +/- 84.9 days of 
      mean support. One patient from the high-risk group and two patients from the
      low-risk group were successfully transplanted (P = 0.559). The use of the Synergy
      Micro-pump in INTERMACS 1-2 patients is feasible and is associated with similar
      postoperative outcome as in patients in INTERMACS 3-4. Carefully selected
      patients with severe heart failure could benefit due to the small size of the
      pump; however, further studies and medium-term follow-up are required.

TI  - Pump size of Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric device influences clinical outcome in
      children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pediatric Berlin Heart (BH) EXCOR device provides mechanical
      circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation or recovery in children.
      Despite the availability of various pump sizes, information on the impact of pump
      size on clinical outcome is still lacking. We aimed to evaluate whether pump size
      in relation to body surface area (BSA) has an impact on clinical outcome.
      METHODS: Children requiring implantation of a BH between 2000 and 2013 were
      included in this retrospective study. Primary end-points were events leading to
      BH explantation (transplantation, recovery or death) and the secondary end-point 
      was occurrence of thromboembolic events. Patients were categorized into three
      groups according to BH stroke volume per BSA: optimal (30 to 50 ml/m(2)); small
      (<30 ml/m(2)); and large (>50 ml/m(2)). RESULTS: Eighty children (median age 2.2 
      years, median BSA 0.50 m(2)) underwent BH implantation. Fifty-five (69%) children
      had an optimally sized pump implanted, whereas 8 children (10%) had small pump
      and 17 (21%) large pump implantation. Overall survival rate was 69%. Weaning was 
      possible in 15 children (19%), and 39 children (49%) were transplanted.
      Mortality, myocardial recovery and transplantation were not related to age, BSA
      or pump size. Thromboembolic events occurred significantly more frequently in
      children treated with large pumps. CONCLUSIONS: The broad range of body sizes in 
      children from newborns to adolescents requires a wide choice of appropriately
      sized devices. Large pump size in relation to BSA is an independent risk factor
      for occurrence of thromboembolic events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired bioenergetics is a prominent feature of the failing heart,
      but the underlying metabolic perturbations are poorly understood. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We compared metabolomic, gene transcript, and protein data from 6 paired
      samples of failing human left ventricular tissue obtained during left ventricular
      assist device insertion (heart failure samples) and at heart transplant
      (post-left ventricular assist device samples). Nonfailing left ventricular wall
      samples procured from explanted hearts of patients with right heart failure
      served as novel comparison samples. Metabolomic analyses uncovered a distinct
      pattern in heart failure tissue: 2.6-fold increased pyruvate concentrations
      coupled with reduced Krebs cycle intermediates and short-chain acylcarnitines,
      suggesting a global reduction in substrate oxidation. These findings were
      associated with decreased transcript levels for enzymes that catalyze fatty acid 
      oxidation and pyruvate metabolism and for key transcriptional regulators of
      mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1A, 1.3-fold) and estrogen-related receptor
      alpha (ERRA, 1.2-fold) and gamma (ERRG, 2.2-fold). Thus, parallel decreases in
      key transcription factors and their target metabolic enzyme genes can explain the
      decreases in associated metabolic intermediates. Mechanical support with left
      ventricular assist device improved all of these metabolic and transcriptional
      defects. CONCLUSIONS: These observations underscore an important pathophysiologic
      role for severely defective metabolism in heart failure, while the reversibility 
      of these defects by left ventricular assist device suggests metabolic resilience 
      of the human heart.

TI  - Decision making for destination therapy left ventricular assist devices: "there
      was no choice" versus "I thought about it an awful lot".
PG  - 374-80
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Destination therapy left ventricular assist devices (DT LVADs) are
      one of the most invasive medical interventions for end-stage illness. How
      patients decide whether or not to proceed with device implantation is unknown. We
      aimed to understand the decision-making processes of patients who either accept
      or decline DT LVADs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2012 and September
      2013, we conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews to understand patients'
      decision-making experiences. Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and
      deductive approach. Twenty-two eligible patients were interviewed, 15 with DT
      LVADs and 7 who declined. We found a strong dichotomy between decision processes 
      with some patients (11 accepters) being automatic and others (3 accepters, 7
      decliners) being reflective in their approach to decision making. The automatic
      group was characterized by a fear of dying and an over-riding desire to live as
      long as possible: "[LVAD] was the only option I had...that or push up
      daisies...so I automatically took this." By contrast, the reflective group went
      through a reasoned process of weighing risks, benefits, and burdens: "There are
      worse things than death." Irrespective of approach, most patients experienced the
      DT LVAD decision as a highly emotional process and many sought support from their
      families or spiritually. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients offered a DT LVAD face the
      decision by reflecting on a process and reasoning through risks and benefits. For
      others, the desire to live supersedes such reflective processing. Acknowledging
      this difference is important when considering how to support patients who are
      faced with this complex decision.

      heart failure: a comparison with heart transplantation.
PG  - 165-70
LID - 10.1179/2295333714Y.0000000017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse overall cost involved with destination therapy (DT) in
      comparison to transplantation (HTX) and bridging to transplantation. METHODS:
      Three groups of patients at one hospital were considered for this cost analysis: 
      (1) patients included in the BENEMACS study starting May 2009 (n = 6); (2) all
      patients from May 2009 till May 2010 undergoing heart transplantation (n = 19);
      or (iii) undergoing Heartmate II implantation as a bridge to transplant (n = 13).
      Patients undergoing bridging were more sick (lower Intermacs class). DT patients 
      were older (64+/-8 years). Cost was derived from actual hospital invoices,
      device, organ procurement and medical cost, and follow-up care during 1 year from
      implantation. Costs are presented in euro, by their mean values and standard
      deviation. RESULTS: One-year survivals were 83, 84, and 77%, respectively, for
      DT, HTX, and bridging. Costs for initial and re-hospitalizations were not
      different between groups. Costs for medical follow-up and medication were
      significantly higher for transplanted patients. The 1-year total cost was euro85 
      531+/-19 823 for HTX, euro125 108+/-32 399 for bridging, and euro137 068+/-29 007
      for DT. As 42% of the transplanted patients were bridged, the cost of the medical
      pathway HTX was euro138 076+/-19 823. Assuming a 5-year survival and a similar
      yearly follow-up cost, the average cost per year is euro42 153 for HTX, euro53
      637 for transplantation including the bridging cost, and euro47 487 for DT.
      CONCLUSION: Direct transplantation without bridging is the most cost-efficient
      treatment. The cost per patient per year for DT is similar to HTX considering its
      bridging activity.

TI  - Planned repetitive use of levosimendan for heart failure in cardiology and
      internal medicine in Sweden.
PG  - 55-61
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.04.243 [doi]
LID - S0167-5273(14)00939-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Levosimendan is used in acute heart failure (HF) and
      increasingly as planned repetitive infusions in stable chronic HF, but the extent
      of this practice is unknown. The aim was to assess the use of levosimendan vs.
      conventional inotropes and the use as planned repetitive vs. acute treatment, in 
      Sweden. METHODS: We performed a descriptive study with individual patient
      validation assessing the use of levosimendan and conventional intravenous
      inotropes, indications for levosimendan, clinical characteristics and survival in
      the Swedish Heart Failure Registry between 2000 and 2011. For repetitive
      levosimendan, we assessed potential indications for alternative interventions.
      RESULTS: Of 53,548 total registrations, there were 655 confirmed with inotrope
      use (597 levosimendan, 37 conventional, 21 both) from 22 hospitals responding to 
      validation, and 6069 in-patient controls with New York Heart Association III-IV
      and ejection fraction <40%. The indications for levosimendan were acute HF in 384
      registrations (306 patients), and planned repetitive in 234 registrations (87
      patients). Planned repetitive as a proportion of total levosimendan registrations
      ranged 0-65% and of total levosimendan patients ranged 0-54% in different
      hospitals. Of planned repetitive patients without existing cardiac
      resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, transplant
      and/or assist device, 46-98% were potential candidates for such interventions.
      CONCLUSION: In HF in cardiology and internal medicine in Sweden, levosimendan was
      the overwhelming inotrope of choice, and the use of planned repetitive
      levosimendan was extensive, highly variable between hospitals and may have
      pre-empted other interventions. Potential effects of and indications for planned 
      repetitive levosimendan need to be evaluated in prospective studies.

TI  - Predictors of hospital length of stay after implantation of a left ventricular

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported on hospital length of stay (LOS) after left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. The purpose of this study was to
      determine pre- and peri-operative predictors of hospital LOS after LVAD
      implantation. METHODS: We analyzed adult primary continuous-flow LVAD patients
      implanted between June 23, 2006 and December 31, 2010 at 105 institutions from
      the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
      (INTERMACS). Retrospective analyses included measures of central tendency,
      frequencies, correlations and stepwise multivariable regression modeling (p </=
      0.05). Independent variables included demographic characteristics, pre-implant
      clinical and behavioral variables and concomitant surgery. RESULTS:
      Characteristics of the patients (n = 2,200) included: mean age 54.6 +/- 12.6
      years; 79% male; 69% white; 57% INTERMACS Profile 1 or 2; 37% diabetic; 21% with 
      history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG); 7% with history of valve surgery;
      and 37% with concomitant surgery. Median hospital LOS (implant to discharge) was 
      20 days. Significant predictors of an increased hospital LOS included demographic
      characteristics (older age and non-white), pre-implant clinical variables
      (history of CABG or valve surgery, diabetes, ascites, INTERMACS Profiles 1 and 2,
      low albumin, high blood urea nitrogen, high right atrial pressure) and
      concomitant surgery, explaining 12% variance (F = 22.65, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Demographic characteristics, pre-implant variables and concomitant surgery
      partially explained hospital LOS after continuous-flow LVAD implant. These
      variables have implications regarding selection of patients for mechanical
      circulatory support.

AB  - As a result of stagnant heart transplantation rates, ventricular assist devices
      (VADs) have become a widely accepted therapy for the treatment of advanced-stage 
      heart failure. Long-term reliability of VADs will become increasingly vital as
      the population of destination therapy patients expands. In this study, eight HVAD
      pumps (n = 8) completed a 6-year reliability test in the HeartWare Life Cycle
      Testing System, an in-vitro mock circulatory loop that simulated physiologic
      pressures and flows. Cumulative runtime for the pumps was 2,408 +/- 60 days.
      During this time, no device failures of any type occurred. These results strongly
      support the durability of the pump design.

TI  - Preoperative liver dysfunction influences blood product administration and
      alterations in circulating haemostatic markers following ventricular assist
      device implantation.
PG  - 497-504
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezu183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Preoperative liver dysfunction may influence haemostasis following
      ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. The Model for End-stage Liver
      Disease (MELD) score was assessed as a predictor of bleeding and levels of
      haemostatic markers in patients with currently utilized VADs. METHODS:
      Sixty-three patients (31 HeartMate II, 15 HeartWare, 17 Thoratec paracorporeal
      ventricular assist device) implanted 2001-11 were analysed for preoperative liver
      dysfunction (MELD) and blood product administration. Of these patients, 21 had
      additional blood drawn to measure haemostatic marker levels. Cohorts were defined
      based on high (>/=18.0, n = 7) and low (<18.0, n = 14) preoperative MELD scores. 
      RESULTS: MELD score was positively correlated with postoperative administration
      of red blood cell (RBC), platelet, plasma and total blood product units (TBPU) , 
      as well as chest tube drainage and cardiopulmonary bypass time. Age and MELD were
      preoperative predictors of TBPU by multivariate analysis. The high-MELD cohort
      had higher administration of TBPU, RBC and platelet units and chest tube drainage
      postimplant. Similarly, patients who experienced at least one bleeding adverse
      event were more likely to have had a high preoperative MELD. The high-MELD group 
      exhibited different temporal trends in F1 + 2 levels and platelet counts to
      postoperative day (POD) 55. D-dimer levels in high-MELD patients became elevated 
      versus those for low-MELD patients on POD 55. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative MELD
      score predicts postoperative bleeding in contemporary VADs. Preoperative liver
      dysfunction may also alter postoperative subclinical haemostasis through
      different temporal trends of thrombin generation and platelet counts, as well as 
      protracted fibrinolysis.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support of the failing heart has become an important means
      of treating end-stage heart disease. This rapidly growing therapeutic field has
      produced impressive clinical outcomes and has great potential to help thousands
      of otherwise terminal patients worldwide. In this review, we examine the state of
      the art of mechanical circulatory support: current practice, totally implantable 
      systems of the future, evolving biventricular support mechanisms, the potential
      for myocardial recovery and adjunctive treatment methods, and miniaturized
      devices with expanded indications for therapy.

LID - 10.1111/petr.12266 [doi]
AB  - Bleeding complications are a source of morbidity after Berlin EXCOR VAD
      implantation yet remain poorly characterized. We evaluated our experience to
      describe the bleeding complications among pediatric VAD recipients. We
      hypothesized that those with bleeding requiring exploration had abnormal
      coagulation profile compared with those without bleeding. The retrospective study
      included 43 consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure supported on
      pediatric mechanical cardiac support as a bridge to transplantation.
      Day-/event-based analysis on factors below associated with (i) bleeding and (ii) 
      bleeding in next 48 h. Cases with bleeding were compared with day-matched
      patients without bleeding complications. Among 43 subjects bleeding occurred in
      47% of cases, which necessitated exploration or chest tube placement. Twenty of
      34 interventions for bleeding occurred in the first seven post-operative days. No
      differences in coagulation parameters or use of antiplatelet agents were noted
      among those who had bleeding vs. those who did not. Our results indicate that (i)
      re-bleeding requiring re-exploration was common, (ii) most of the bleeding
      occurred early post-implantation, (iii) there were no differences in coagulation 
      parameters or the use of antiplatelet agents within 48 h of bleeding compared
      with those who did not bleed on each successive post-operative day.

TI  - Heart failure with recovered ejection fraction: clinical description, biomarkers,
      and outcomes.
PG  - 2380-7
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.006855 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that patients with heart failure (HF) who recover
      left ventricular function (HF-Recovered) have a distinct clinical phenotype,
      biology, and prognosis compared with patients with HF with reduced ejection
      fraction (HF-REF) and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF).
      METHODS AND RESULTS: The Penn Heart Failure Study (PHFS) is a prospective cohort 
      of 1821 chronic HF patients recruited from tertiary HF clinics. Participants were
      divided into 3 categories based on echocardiograms: HF-REF if EF was <50%, HF-PEF
      if EF was consistently >/=50%, and HF-Recovered if EF on enrollment in PHFS was
      >/=50% but prior EF was <50%. A significant portion of HF-Recovered patients had 
      an abnormal biomarker profile at baseline, including 44% with detectable troponin
      I, although in comparison, median levels of brain natriuretic factor, soluble
      fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1, troponin I, and creatinine were greater in
      HF-REF and HF-PEF patients. In unadjusted Cox models over a maximum follow-up of 
      8.9 years, the hazard ratio for death, transplantation, or ventricular assist
      device placement in HF-REF patients was 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-6.8;
      P<0.001) and in HF-PEF patients was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.5;
      P=0.013) compared with HF-Recovered patients. The unadjusted hazard ratio for
      cardiac hospitalization in HF-REF patients was 2.0 (95% confidence interval,
      1.5-2.7; P<0.001) and in HF-PEF patients was 1.3 (95% confidence interval,
      0.90-2.0; P=0.15) compared with HF-Recovered patients. Results were similar in
      adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: HF-Recovered is associated with a better biomarker

      still have abnormalities in biomarkers and experience a significant number of HF 
      hospitalizations, suggesting persistent HF risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias after cardiac
      resynchronization defibrillator therapy (CRT-D) for severely symptomatic heart
      failure are of clinical importance but are not clearly defined. The objective of 
      this study was to test the hypothesis that mechanical dyssynchrony after CRT-D is
      a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: A total of 266 consecutive
      CRT-D patients with class III or IV heart failure, QRS duration >/=120 msec, and 
      ejection fractions </= 35% were prospectively studied. Dyssynchrony was assessed 
      before and 6 months after CRT-D using speckle-tracking radial strain
      anteroseptal-to-posterior wall delay, predefined as >/=130 msec. Ventricular
      arrhythmias were predefined as appropriate antitachycardia pacing or shock, and
      the combined end point of ventricular arrhythmias, death, transplantation, or
      left ventricular assist device implantation was followed over 2 years. RESULTS:
      Of the initial 266 patients, 11 died, five underwent transplantation, three
      received left ventricular assist devices before their 6-month echocardiographic
      examinations, 19 (7%) had inadequate speckle-tracking at 6-month follow-up, and
      27 (10%) were lost to follow-up. Accordingly, the study group consisted of 201
      patients. Dyssynchrony after CRT-D was observed in 79 (39%) and was associated
      with a significantly higher ventricular arrhythmic event rate: 21% (P < .001)
      with persistent dyssynchrony and 35% (P < .001) with new dyssynchrony, compared
      with 8% with no dyssynchrony after CRT-D. The combined end point of ventricular
      arrhythmias, death, transplantation, or left ventricular assist device
      implantation was significantly associated with dyssynchrony after CRT-D (hazard
      ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-4.28; P = .001). Dyssynchrony after
      CRT-D was associated with ventricular arrhythmias or death in patient subgroups
      by cardiomyopathy type, QRS width, and morphology (P < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS:
      Persistent or new radial dyssynchrony after CRT-D in severely symptomatic
      patients with heart failure with widened QRS complexes and reduced ejection
      fractions was associated with an increased rate of ventricular arrhythmias or
      death and appears to be a marker for a less favorable prognosis.

AB  - In Kazakhstan, geographical and cultural reasons do not favor the development of 
      heart transplant activity. Thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,
      refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricular
      assist device (VAD) therapy. The program, supported and funded by the national
      healthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical Center for
      the operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.
      Regional VAD coordinators are educated by the National Center. They are in charge
      of regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription, 
      and continuing patients' and caregivers' education, mainly regarding driveline
      exit site dressing and driveline stabilization. From November 2011 to November
      2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support
      (LVAD): HeartMate II, n=70, HeartWare, n=25. Mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37% 
      of the patients were males. Most patients had INTERMACS profile 4 (55%), followed
      by 3 and 2 (17% each). Symptomatic and functional improvement are testified by
      changes from baseline to month 3 of NYHA functional class (from III-IV to I-II), 
      results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and NT-proBNP levels (from
      6997 to 1126 pg/ml). Overall 1-year survival was 69%, with a trend for outcome
      improvement over time and a relationship with preoperative INTERMACS profile
      (1-year survival of 60% in patients with INTERMACS profile 1-2 vs 75% in those
      with INTERMACS profile 3-4). In summary, where and when a heart transplant
      program cannot be implemented, LVAD represents a realistic therapeutic
      alternative. The key points for a successful VAD program are a dedicated, highly 
      specialized multidisciplinary team at the Cardiac Surgery Center, an
      infrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,
      adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.

      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.
PG  - 572-80
LID - 10.1111/jocs.12336 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although atrial arrhythmias (AAs) are common in heart failure, the
      incidence of AAs subsequent to the placement of left ventricular assist devices
      (LVADs) has not been elucidated. METHODS: Patients receiving a HeartMate II LVAD 
      in the bridge to transplant (n = 490) and destination therapy (n = 634) trials
      were included (n = 1125). AAs requiring treatment were recorded, regardless of
      symptoms. Using Cox models with and without a 60-day blanking period, risk
      factors for early and late AAs were determined. RESULTS: In total, there were 271
      AAs in 231 patients (21%), most of which occurred within the first 60 days.
      Patients with and without AAs had similar survival (p = 0.16). Serum creatinine
      (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.49 per unit increase, 1.18 to 1.88; p < 0.001) and
      ejection fraction (HR = 0.98 per 1% increase, 0.95 to 0.999; p = 0.04) were
      associated with AAs in a multivariable model. Although quality of life (QoL) and 
      functional status improved in all patients, those with AAs had worse unadjusted
      QoL (p < 0.001) and a decreased rate of improvement in six-minute walk distance
      over six to 24 months postimplant (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately
      one-fifth of LVAD patients have AAs, most commonly within the first 60 days of
      support. Preoperative creatinine is a strong risk factor for early and late AAs. 
      Although AAs do not impact survival, they are associated with decreased
      functional status and QoL improvements during LVAD support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The EVAHEART left ventricular assist device was approved in 2010 by
      the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for bridge to
      heart transplantation (BTT). However, its effectiveness has not been evaluated
      since approval. In this study we evaluated the EVAHEART device in a commercial
      setting in Japan. METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients enrolled in the
      Japanese Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (J-MACS), who
      were listed for transplant or likely to be listed and who received an EVAHEART
      device, were enrolled from 2011 to 2013 at 14 Japanese centers. Patients'
      survival rates, adverse events and quality-of-life data were obtained from the
      J-MACS Registry. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 43 years (85% male). The
      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profiles
      revealed 12 patients in Level 1, 45 in Level 2, 37 in Level 3 and 1 in Level 4.
      The mean support duration was 384.7 days, with a cumulative duration of 101.2
      years. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate during support was 93.4% at 6 months, 87.4%
      at 1 year and 87.4% at 2 years. Seventy-seven patients (80.2%) currently remain
      on support, 7 received a transplant and 10 died during support. Major adverse
      events included drive-line infection (14.6%) and neurologic events such as
      ischemic stroke (17.7%), hemorrhage (13.5%), transient ischemic attack (3.1%),
      pump thrombosis (1%) and hemolysis (1%). There was no gastrointestinal (GI)
      bleeding or right heart failure requiring right ventricular assist device (RVAD).
      There was no pump exchange due to mechanical failure. CONCLUSIONS: The EVAHEART
      device provides safe, reliable and long-term circulatory support with improved
      survival in commercial settings of BTT in Japan, where the transplant waiting
      period is much longer. Incidences of GI bleeding, hemolysis, right ventricular
      failure, device thrombosis and mechanical failure were extremely rare in patients
      on EVAHEART devices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Device availability of mechanical circulatory or respiratory support 
      to the right heart has been limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate
      the effect of right heart unloading and respiratory support with a wearable
      integrated artificial pump-lung (APL). METHODS: The APL device was placed
      surgically between the right atrium and pulmonary artery in 7 sheep.
      Anti-coagulation was performed with heparin infusion. The device's ability to
      unload the right ventricle (RV) was investigated by echocardiograms and right
      heart catheterization at different bypass flow rates. Hemodynamics and
      echocardiographic data were evaluated. APL flow and gas transfer rates were also 
      measured at different device speeds. RESULTS: Hemodynamics remained stable during
      APL support. There was no significant change in systemic blood pressure and
      cardiac index. Central venous pressure, RV pressure, RV end-diastolic dimension
      and RV ejection fraction were significantly decreased when APL device flow rate
      approached 2 liters/min. Linear regression showed significant correlative trends 
      between the hemodynamic and cardiac indices and device speed. The oxygen transfer
      rate increased with device speed. The oxygen saturation from the APL outlet was
      fully saturated (>95%) during support. The impact of APL support on blood
      elements (plasma free hemoglobin and platelet activation) was minimal.
      CONCLUSIONS: APL device support significantly unloaded the RV with increasing
      device speed. The device also provided stable hemodynamics and respiratory
      support in terms of blood flow and oxygen transfer. The right heart unloading
      performance of this wearable device needs to be evaluated further in an animal
      model of right heart failure with long-term support.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heart transplantation is the therapy of choice for advance heart
      failure. Our group developed two transplant programs at Instituto Nacional del
      Torax and Clinica Davila. We report our clinical experience based on distinctive 
      clinical policies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients were
      transplanted between November 2008 and April 2013, representing 51% of all
      Chilean cases. Distinctive clinical policies include intensive donor management, 
      generic immunosuppression and VAD (ventricular assist devices) insertion.
      RESULTS: Ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy were the main indications (23 (43%)
      each), age 48 +/- 13 years and 48 (91%) were male. Transplant listing Status: IA 
      14 (26%) (VAD or 2 inotropes), IB 14 (26%) (1 inotrope) and II25 (47%) (no
      inotrope). Mean waiting time 70 +/- 83 days. Twelve (24%) were transplanted
      during VAD support (median support: 36 days). OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: orthotopic
      bicaval transplant with ischemia time: 175 +/- 54 min. Operative mortality: 3
      (6%), all due to right ventricular failure. Re-exploration for bleeding 2 (4%),
      stroke 3 (6%), mediastinitis 0 (0%), pneumonia 4 (8%), and transient dialysis 6
      (11%). Mean follow-up was 21 +/- 14 months. Three-year survival was 86 +/- 6%.
      One patient died of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and the other died suddenly 
      (non-compliance). Freedom from rejection requiring specific therapy was 80 +/- 7%
      at 3 years of follow-up. Four hundred eighty four endomyocardial biopsies were
      done: 11 (2.3%) had 2R rejection. All survivors are in NYHA (New York Heart
      Association) functional class I and all but one have normal biventricular
      function. CONCLUSION: Mid-term results are similar to those reported by the
      registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. This
      experience has a higher proportion of VAD support than previous national series. 
      Rejection rates are low in spite of generic immunosuppression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute right ventricular failure (ARVF) refractory to optimal medical 
      management may require rescue therapy with mechanical circulatory support (MCS). 
      The RV exhibits a greater capacity for rapid recovery than the left ventricle,
      making devices designed specifically for temporary RV MCS attractive. We report
      our experience with the Impella Right Direct (RD) and Right Peripheral (RP)
      temporary ventricular assist devices (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) in patients with
      ARVF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the clinical
      outcomes of consecutive patients supported with the Impella RD or RP at 2
      institutions during a 6-year period. RESULTS: During the study period, 18
      patients (67% men; mean age 57 +/- 10 years) received MCS, 15 with the Impella RD
      and 3 with the Impella RP. Before RV MCS, all patients required intravenous
      inotropes, 7 (39%) required inhaled nitric oxide, 7 (39%) required intra-aortic
      balloon counterpulsation, and 2 (11%) had experienced a cardiac arrest. Device
      implantation resulted in an improvement in cardiac index (2.1 +/- 0.1
      liters/min/m(2) pre-implant vs 2.6 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m(2) post-implant, p =
      0.04) and reduced central venous pressure (22 +/- 5 vs 15 +/- 4 mm Hg, p < 0.01).
      Fourteen (78%) patients recovered sufficient RV function to facilitate device
      explanation after 7 days (range, 2-19 days) of support, and 4 (22%) patients died
      on support after 6 days (range 1-11 days). Survival to 30 days was 72% and to 1
      year was 50%. At 1-year follow-up, the mean New York Heart Association functional
      classification was 1.3 +/- 0.5, and only 1 patient demonstrated severe RV
      dysfunction on echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with ARVF rapidly
      recover sufficient RV function to facilitate device explantation, highlighting an
      expanding role for minimally invasive temporary RV assist devices optimized for
      the treatment of recoverable ARVF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy is
      dependent on appropriate patient selection. The HeartMate II risk score (HMRS)
      was recently derived and validated to predict 90-day mortality in clinical trial 
      patients with continuous-flow LVADs. The aim of this study was to test HMRS
      validity in predicting survival at our institution. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of patients implanted with HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec,
      Pleasanton, CA) LVADs from March 31, 2004 to September 20, 2012 at the Columbia
      University Medical Center (CUMC). Patients were stratified according to HMRS
      profiles (HMRS Low < 1.58, 1.58 </= HMRS Medium </= 2.48, HMRS High > 2.48)
      calculated using age, albumin, creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR)
      and center volume. Outcome was defined as survival at 90 days after device
      implantation. RESULTS: HeartMate II LVADs were implanted in 205 patients.
      Pre-operative data from 201 patients were categorized into HMRS Low (n = 101;
      1.04 [0.64 to 1.31]), HMRS Medium (n = 73; 1.98 [1.78 to 2.25]) and HMRS High (n 
      = 27, 3.07 [2.70 to 3.43]) (p < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 90
      days (HMRS Low 91.0 +/- 2.9%, HMRS Medium 91.7 +/- 3.2%, HMRS High 88.7 +/- 6.1%)
      and at 1 year (HMRS Low 85.5 +/- 3.8%, HMRS Medium 79.3 +/- 5.5%, HMRS High 82.4 
      +/- 8.4%) after LVAD implantation were not statistically different (p = 0.43).
      Prediction of 90-day mortality by receiver operating characteristic was poor (AUC
      = 0.56). CONCLUSION: HMRS stratification poorly discriminates 90-day mortality
      after HMII LVAD implantation at our institution. Its generalizability as a
      universal prognostic score may be limited.

AB  - Patients with acute or progressive heart failure in the setting of congenital
      heart disease may need mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to enhance survival
      while awaiting cardiac transplantation. Because the majority of MCS devices are
      implanted after prior cardiac operations, special precautions are necessary at
      the time of implant. MCS in single ventricle patients usually requires
      ventricular and aortic cannulation, with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt for
      pulmonary blood flow. Limited outcomes data is available, with less than 15% of
      pediatric MCS patients having congenital heart disease. The Berlin EXCOR is the
      only durable device currently available for infants. Neurologic complications are
      the major cause of mortality, and survival during support is poor for infants <5 
      kg. Patients post-Fontan with acute cardiac failure and/or respiratory failure
      are at high risk for death before transplant and should be considered for MCS
      therapy. Several emerging miniature continuous flow devices will soon broaden the
      landscape of available pediatric devices.

AB  - Fulminant myocarditis is a clinical syndrome with signs of acute heart failure,
      cardiogenic shock, or life-threating rhythm disturbances in the context of
      suspected myocarditis. It is not an etiological diagnosis, but may have different
      underlying causes and pathogenetic processes - viral, bacterial, toxic, and
      autoreactive. Clinical management of the disease entity at the acute stage
      involves hemodynamic monitoring in an intensive care unit or similar setting.
      Rapid routine work-up is mandatory with serial EKGs, echocardiography, cardiac
      MRI, heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy for histology,
      immunohistology, and molecular analysis for the underlying infection and
      pathogenesis. Heart failure therapy is warranted in all cases according to
      current guidelines. For fulminant autoreactive myocarditis, immunosuppressive
      treatment is beneficial; for viral myocarditis, IVIg can resolve the
      inflammation, reduce the viral load, and even eradicate the microbial agent.
      ECMO, IABP, ventricular assist devices, LifeVest, or ICD implantation can bridge 
      to recovery or to heart transplantation.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support has seen numerous advances in the recent years,
      with important observations made to guide patient selection for the therapy,
      indications for use, and management of devices after implantation. There is rapid
      growth in the use of left ventricular assist device therapy (LVAD) for advanced
      heart failure, with a movement to pursue device intervention earlier in the
      disease spectrum before comorbidities escalate. With this increase in LVAD use
      have come new challenges, including unanticipated adverse events and high
      readmission rates. Simultaneously, complications encountered during LVAD support 
      and an increased number of patients supported with a goal for transplant have had
      an important effect on the allocation of cardiac allografts. Still, the field
      continues to evolve and address these challenges in systematic fashion to provide
      novel solutions and meet the needs of a growing population with advanced heart
      failure. This has led to an extensive body of literature, ranging from case
      reports to multicenter clinical trials, which will enhance the future of LVAD
      technology and patient outcomes. This review summarizes important publications in
      mechanical circulatory support during the past 24 months.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the impact of the United Network for Organ
      Sharing (UNOS) policy changes for regional differences in waitlist time and
      mortality before and after heart transplantation. BACKGROUND: The 2006 UNOS
      thoracic organ allocation policy change was implemented to allow for greater
      regional sharing of organs for heart transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed 36,789
      patients who were listed for heart transplantation from January 1999 through
      April 2012. These patients were separated into 2 eras centered on the July 12,
      2006 UNOS policy change. Pre- and post-transplantation characteristics were
      compared by UNOS regions. RESULTS: Waitlist mortality decreased nationally (up to
      180 days: 13.3% vs. 7.9% after the UNOS policy change, p < 0.001) and within each
      region. Similarly, 2-year post-transplant mortality decreased nationally (2-year 
      mortality: 17.3% vs. 14.6%; p < 0.001) as well as regionally. Waitlist time for
      UNOS status 1A and 1B candidates increased nationally 17.8 days on average (p <
      0.001) with variability between the regions. The greatest increases were in
      Region 9 (59.2-day increase, p < 0.001) and Region 4 (41.2-day increase, p <
      0.001). Although the use of mechanical circulatory support increased nearly
      2.3-fold nationally in Era 2, significant differences were present on a regional 
      basis. In Regions 6, 7, and 10, nearly 40% of those transplanted required left
      ventricular assist device bridging, whereas only 19.6%, 22.3%, and 15.5% required
      a left ventricular assist device in regions 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: The 2006 UNOS policy change has resulted in significant regional
      heterogeneity with respect to waitlist time and reliance on mechanical
      circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation, although overall both
      waitlist mortality and post-transplant survival are improved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to bridge pediatric
      patients to transplant or recovery has been expanding. There are few current
      pediatric data assessing the impact of VAD support on post-transplant survival.
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric (</=18 years old, n
      = 4,028) transplants performed between 1995 and 2011 and contained within the
      United Network for Organ Sharing data set. Transplants were divided into three
      eras: early (1995 to 2002, n = 1,450); intermediate (2003 to 2007, n = 1,138);
      and recent (2008 to 2011, n = 1,440). VADs were present at transplant in 398
      patients (9.8%). Outcomes among patients with and without VADs were assessed and 
      compared across eras. RESULTS: The use of VADs for bridge to transplant has
      increased (early 1.1%, intermediate 10.5%, recent 17.9%; p < 0.0001). Mean weight
      among VAD-supported patients (early 63.5 kg, intermediate 42.3 kg, recent 28.8
      kg; p < 0.0001) has decreased during this period. VAD patients <10 kg had an
      increased risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1
      to 10.8) compared with non-mechanical support patients. In multivariable
      analyses, extracorporeal VADs were the only type of VAD associated with higher
      post-transplant mortality (OR = 3.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 10.6). Other types of VAD had 
      lower mortality (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.0). Long-term survival was unaffected 
      by the use of a VAD pre-transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients bridged to
      transplantation with VADs are increasingly younger and smaller. Complication
      rates remain high among patients <10 kg. Early post-transplant survival among
      intracorporeal and paracorporeal VAD patients is excellent and better when
      compared with unsupported patients. The use of short-term support devices is
      associated with higher post-transplant mortality. Long-term survival is
      unaffected by VAD use.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the association of SCN5A
      cardiac sodium (Na(+)) channel mRNA splice variants in white blood cells (WBCs)
      with risk of arrhythmias in heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: HF is associated with
      upregulation of two cardiac SCN5A mRNA splice variants that encode prematurely
      truncated, nonfunctional Na(+) channels. Because circulating WBCs demonstrate
      similar SCN5A splicing patterns, we hypothesized that these WBC-derived splice
      variants might further stratify patients with HF who are at risk for arrhythmias.
      METHODS: Simultaneously obtained myocardial core samples and WBCs were compared
      for SCN5A variants C (VC) and D (VD). Circulating variant levels were compared
      among patients with HF, divided into three groups: HF without an implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), HF with an ICD without appropriate
      intervention, and HF with an ICD with appropriate intervention. RESULTS:
      Myocardial tissue-derived SCN5A variant expression levels strongly correlated
      with circulating WBC samples for both VC and VD variants (r = 0.78 and 0.75,
      respectively). After controlling for covariates, patients with HF who had
      received an appropriate ICD intervention had higher expression levels of both
      WBC-derived SCN5A variants compared with patients with HF with ICDs who had not
      received appropriate ICD intervention (odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.64-6.45; p =
      0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that circulating
      SCN5A variant levels were highly associated with the risk for appropriate ICD
      intervention (area under the curve >/=0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating expression 
      levels of SCN5A variants were strongly associated with myocardial tissue levels. 
      Furthermore, circulating variant levels were correlative with arrhythmic risk as 
      measured by ICD events in an HF population within 1 year. (Sodium Channel
      Splicing in Heart Failure Trial [SOCS-HEFT]; NCT01185587).

TI  - Status 2 patients had poor prognosis without mechanical circulatory support.
PG  - 1396-404
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indication for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been a matter
      of debate in less sick status 2 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained
      from 183 consecutive patients assigned to stage D heart failure (HF) who were
      evaluated by the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo Hospital
      and then listed for heart transplantation as status 1 or 2 of the Japan Organ
      Transplant Network. Patients with status 2 (n=38) had a prognosis as poor as
      those dependent on inotropes (n=54) or MCS (n=91; P=0.615, log-rank test), and
      only 4 of them had eventual ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation (10.5%).
      Patients who eventually received VAD (n=92) had better 4-year survival than those
      without MCS among status 1 and 2 (P=0.030, log-rank test). On Cox regression
      analysis plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >740pg/ml was the only
      significant predictor for 4-year survival among the status 2 group (P=0.014;
      hazard ratio, 8.267). Ten patients with status 2 died: 6 due to acute hemodynamic
      compromise and 4 due to ventricular fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis in
      status 2 patients was as poor as that of those dependent on inotrope infusion or 
      VAD, mostly because of out-of-hospital sudden death without MCS. Status 2
      patients with considerably high plasma BNP may be good candidates for continuous 
      flow VAD therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
      Support (INTERMACS) I classification encompasses patients with varying clinical
      presentations and prognoses. The purpose of this review is to discuss four
      sub-classifications of cardiogenic shock patients (acute myocardial infarction,
      acute decompensated heart failure, biventricular failure, and myocarditis), and
      explore management considerations for these groups, with particular emphasis on
      strategies for device placement. RECENT FINDINGS: In single-center studies, the
      use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, percutaneous ventricular assist
      devices, and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has allowed
      approximately half of cardiogenic shock patients to receive an implantable left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant, or experience myocardial
      recovery. Primary implantation of a durable LVAD in well-selected myocardial
      infarction shock patients was associated with a 1-year survival of 86% in one
      small case series. Analysis of a multi-institutional database suggests patients
      older than 65 years have a lower post-implantation survival compared with younger
      recipients. SUMMARY: Device selection strategies for INTERMACS I patients are
      predicated on a patient's prognosis, hemodynamic stability, end organ, and
      neurologic status. Percutaneous assist devices may be preferred for patients with
      favorable prognoses, ECMO for patients with hemodynamic compromise, and durable
      mechanical support for patients failing to recover sustainable myocardial
      function after short-term device use.

      or medium during LVAD implantation. The primary safety end point was incidence of
      infectious myocarditis, myocardial rupture, neoplasm, hypersensitivity reaction, 
      and immune sensitization (90 days after randomization). Key efficacy end points
      were functional status and ventricular function while temporarily weaned from
      LVAD support (90 days after randomization). Patients were followed up until
      transplant or 12 months after randomization, whichever came first. Mean age was
      57.4 (+/-13.6) years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 18.1%, and
      66.7% were destination therapy LVADs. No safety events were observed. Successful 
      temporary LVAD weaning was achieved in 50% of MPC and 20% of control patients at 
      90 days (P=0.24); the posterior probability that MPCs increased the likelihood of
      successful weaning was 93%. At 90 days, 3 deaths (30%) occurred in control
      patients, and none occurred in MPC patients. Mean left ventricular ejection
      fraction after successful wean was 24.0% (MPC=10) and 22.5% (control=2; P=0.56). 
      At 12 months, 30% of MPC patients and 40% of control patients were successfully
      temporarily weaned from LVAD support (P=0.69), and 6 deaths (30%) occurred in MPC
      patients. Donor-specific HLA sensitization developed in 2 MPC and 3 control
      patients and resolved by 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary trial,
      administration of MPCs appeared to be safe, and there was a potential signal of
      efficacy. Future studies will evaluate the potential for higher or additional
      doses to enhance the ability to wean LVAD recipients off support. CLINICAL TRIAL

PG  - S52-9
LID - 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.10.26 [doi]
AB  - Right heart failure (RHF) is a frequent complication following left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) implantation. The incidence of RHF complicates 20-50%
      (range, 9-44%) of cases and is a major factor of postoperative morbidity and
      mortality. Unfortunately, despite the fact that many risk factors contributing to
      the development of RHF after LVAD implantation have been identified, it seems to 
      be extremely difficult to avoid them. Prevention of RHF consists of the
      management of the preload and the afterload of the right ventricle with optimum
      inotropic support. The administration of vasodilators designed to reduce
      pulmonary vascular resistance is standard practice in most centers. The surgical 
      attempt of implantation of a right ventricular assist device does not always
      resolve the problem and is not available in all cardiac surgery centers.

TI  - The cost impact of short-term ventricular assist devices and extracorporeal life 
      support systems therapies on the National Health Service in the UK.
PG  - 41-8
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivu078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the cost of using different 
      blood pumps for short-term ventricular assist device (VAD) and extracorporeal
      life support (ECLS) systems for cardiac and cardiorespiratory failure in the UK. 
      METHODS: The cost analysis presented was based on evaluation of the time required
      to provide circulatory support for the following indications: post-cardiac
      surgery cardiogenic shock, postacute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock,
      deteriorating end-stage heart failure (ESHF) and the ability of different blood
      pumps to provide support for the necessary duration. The maximum length of
      support for each device was based on the manufacturers' recommendations. Direct
      medical cost of each treatment was evaluated only for the period of mechanical
      circulatory support in adults and children. Only the cost of device, placement
      and replacement procedures were considered. List prices were used for devices;
      resource use was based on expert opinion; unit costs were obtained from official 
      UK sources and Wythenshawe hospital, Manchester, UK. Hospital perspective was
      utilized for analysis. Three VADs were selected for comparison in adults and two 
      in children. Four centrifugal ECLS systems were selected for comparison in adults
      and two in children. RESULTS: In both VAD and ECLS indications, the CentriMag(R) 
      was the least expensive when used for support of patients with end-stage heart
      failure. Compared with Cardiohelp(R) for ECLS (which has the same maximum claim
      duration of support of 30 days), CentriMag(R) lead to cost savings of pound4294
      per patient in all three clinical conditions considered. In post-cardiac surgery 
      cardiogenic shock, CentriMag(R) VAD lead to savings of pound5014 per patient
      compared with BPX-80. Results were robust in one-way sensitivity analysis in
      comparison with Cardiohelp(R). CONCLUSIONS: CentriMag(R) and PediVAS(R) blood
      pumps can lead to significant cost savings to the National Health Service, when
      used instead of other pumps for short-term VAD or ECLS treatment.

TI  - Concomitant tricuspid valve surgery during implantation of continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist devices: a Society of Thoracic Surgeons database analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Performing concomitant tricuspid valve procedures (TVPs) in left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients with significant pre-operative
      tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is controversial, and no studies have been large
      enough to definitively guide therapy. METHODS: Between January 2006 and September
      2012, 2,196 patients with moderate to severe pre-operative TR from 115
      institutions underwent implantation of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist 
      device (LVAD) as reported by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database. 
      Of these, 588 (27%) underwent a concomitant TVP. Inverse probability weighting
      based on propensity score was used to adjust for differences between the LVAD
      alone and LVAD+TVP groups, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Most patients in 
      the LVAD+TVP group underwent an annuloplasty alone (81.1%). Concomitant TVP did
      not affect risk of post-operative right VAD insertion (risk ratio [RR], 0.81; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.36; p = 0.4310) or death (RR, 0.95; 95% CI,
      0.68-1.33; p = 0.7658). However, TVP was associated with an increased risk for
      post-operative renal failure (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.13-2.08; p = 0.0061), dialysis 
      (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.03-2.15; p = 0.0339), reoperation (RR, 1.24; 95% CI,
      1.07-1.45; p = 0.0056), greater total transfusion requirement (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 
      1.01-1.05; p = 0.0013), and hospital length of stay > 21 days (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 
      1.16-1.43; p < 0.0001). Time on the ventilator and intensive care unit length of 
      stay were also significantly prolonged for the LVAD+TVP group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Performing a concomitant TVP for continuous-flow LVAD patients with moderate to
      severe TR did not reduce early death or right VAD requirement and was associated 
      with worse early post-operative outcomes. These data caution against routine
      concomitant TVP based solely on degree of pre-operative TR and suggest that
      additional selection criteria are needed to identify those patients in whom
      concomitant TVP may prevent post-operative right ventricular failure.

TI  - Derivation of indices of left ventricular contractility in the setting of
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 1029-34
LID - 10.1111/aor.12292 [doi]
AB  - It is important to accurately monitor residual cardiac function in patients under
      long-term continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cfLVAD) support. Two
      new measures of left ventricular (LV) chamber contractility in the
      cfLVAD-unloaded ventricle include IQ, a regression coefficient between maximum
      flow acceleration and flow pulsatility at different pump speeds; and K, a
      logarithmic relationship between volumes moved in systole and diastole. We sought
      to optimize these indices. We also propose RIQ, a ratio between maximum flow
      acceleration and flow pulsatility at baseline pump speed, as an alternative to
      IQ. Eleven patients (mean age 49 +/- 11 years) were studied. The K index was
      derived at baseline pump speed by defining systolic and diastolic onset as time
      points at which maximum and minimum volumes move through the pump. IQ across the 
      full range of pump speeds was markedly different between patients. It was
      unreliable in three patients with underlying atrial fibrillation (coefficient of 
      determination R(2) range: 0.38-0.74) and also when calculated without pump speed 
      manipulation (R(2) range: 0.01-0.74). The K index was within physiological
      ranges, but poorly correlated to both IQ (P = 0.42) and RIQ (P = 0.92). In four
      patients there was excellent correspondence between RIQ and IQ, while four other 
      patients showed a poor relationship between these indices. As RIQ does not
      require pump speed changes, it may be a more clinically appropriate measure.
      Further studies are required to determine the validity of these indices.

      with nonpulsatile left ventricular assist devices.

LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.01.004 [doi]
LID - S1053-2498(14)00017-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) expose blood 
      cells to high shear stress, potentially resulting in the production of
      microparticles that express phosphatidylserine (PS+) and promote coagulation and 
      inflammation. In this prospective study, we attempted to determine whether PS+
      microparticle levels correlate with clinical outcomes in LVAD-supported patients.
      METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients undergoing implantation of the HeartMate II LVAD
      (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) and 10 healthy controls who provided reference
      values for the microparticle assays. Plasma was collected before LVAD
      implantation, at discharge, at the 3-month follow-up, and when an adverse
      clinical event occurred. We quantified PS+ microparticles in the plasma using
      flow cytometry. RESULTS: During the study period, 8 patients developed adverse
      clinical events: ventricular tachycardia storm in 1, non-ST-elevation myocardial 
      infarction in 2, arterial thrombosis in 2, gastrointestinal bleeding in 2, and
      stroke in 3. Levels of PS+ microparticles were higher in patients at baseline
      than in healthy controls (2.11% +/- 1.26% vs 0.69% +/- 0.46%, p = 0.007). After
      LVAD implantation, patient PS+ microparticle levels increased to 2.39% +/- 1.22% 
      at discharge and then leveled to 1.97% +/- 1.25% at the 3-month follow-up.
      Importantly, levels of PS+ microparticles were significantly higher in patients
      who developed an adverse event than in patients with no events (3.82% +/- 1.17%
      vs 1.57% +/- 0.59%, p < 0.001), even though the 2 patient groups did not markedly
      differ in other clinical and hematologic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest that an elevation of PS+ microparticle levels may be associated with
      adverse clinical events. Thus, measuring PS+ microparticle levels in
      LVAD-supported patients may help identify patients at increased risk for adverse 
      events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malfunction of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device
      (CF-LVAD) due to device thrombosis is a potentially life-threatening event that
      currently presents a diagnostic challenge. We aimed to propose a practical
      echocardiographic assessment to diagnose LVAD malfunction secondary to pump
      thrombosis. METHODS: Among 52 patients implanted with a CF-LVAD from a single
      center who underwent echocardiographic pump speed-change testing, 12 had
      suspected pump thrombosis as determined by clinical, laboratory, and/or device
      parameters. Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation was performed at baseline 
      pump speed and at each 1,000-rpm interval from the low setting of 8,000 rpm to
      the high setting of 11,000 rpm in 11 of these patients. RESULTS: Receiver
      operating characteristic curves and stepwise logistic regression analyses showed 
      that the best diagnostic parameters included changes in the LV end-diastolic
      diameter (<0.6 cm), aortic valve opening time (<80 msec), and deceleration time
      of mitral inflow (<70 msec) from lowest to highest pump speed. One parameter was 
      predictive of pump malfunction, with 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity,
      whereas 2 of 3 parameters increased the sensitivity to 100% and specificity to
      95%. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 echocardiographic variables of measured changes in LV
      end-diastolic diameter, aortic valve opening time, and deceleration time of
      mitral inflow between the lowest (8,000 rpm) and highest pump speed settings
      (11,000 rpm) during echo-guided pump speed-change testing appear highly accurate 
      in diagnosing device malfunction in the setting of pump thrombosis among patients
      supported with CF-LVAD. Further investigation is warranted to create and validate
      a prediction score.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The post-market Registry to Evaluate the HeartWare Left Ventricular
      Assist System (ReVOLVE) is an investigator-initiated registry established to
      collect post-CE Mark Trial clinical data on patients receiving a HeartWare
      ventricular assist device (HVAD) in the European Union and Australia. METHODS:
      The ReVOLVE is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm registry performed at
      seven centers in Europe and two in Australia. Herein we describe a total of 254
      commercial HVAD implants according to labeled indications between February 2009
      and November 2012. Summary statistics included patients' demographics, adverse
      events, length of support and outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with the clinical trial
      supporting the CE Mark of the HeartWare system, patient selection differed in
      that patients were older, and there were higher proportions of females and
      patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathies in the ReVOLVE cohort. Duration of
      support ranged from 1 to 1,057 days, with a mean of 363 +/- 280 days (median
      299.5 days). Transplantation was done in 56 patients (22%), explant for recovery 
      was performed in 3 patients (1%), 43 died while on support (17%), and 152 (60%)
      remain on the device. Success in patients with the HeartWare system was 87% at 6 
      months, 85% at 1 year, 79% at 2 years and 73% at 3 years. Adverse event rates
      were low, comparable or improved when compared to the CE Mark Trial. CONCLUSION: 
      Real-world use of the HeartWare system continues to demonstrate excellent
      clinical outcomes in patients supported with the device.

      transplantation.

AB  - Primary graft failure in the early postoperative period after heart
      transplantation, remains a main cause of a poor outcome. Current treatment
      options include pharmacological (catecholamines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors)
      and mechanical assist device support. Pharmacological support with catecholamines
      is related to elevated myocardial oxygen consumption and regional hypoperfusion
      leading to organ damage. On the other hand, levosimendan, as a
      calcium-sensitizing agent increases cardiac contractility without altering
      intracellular Ca(2+) levels and increase in oxygen demand. We present a case of a
      51-year-old man, who was suffering from acute right-heart failure in the early
      postoperative period after heart transplantation. As a rescue therapy at the late
      stage of a low cardiac output state, levosimendan was started as continuous
      infusion at 0.1 mug/kg/min for 12 h and thereafter, at 0.2 mug/kg/min for the
      following 36 h. Levosimendan demonstrated an advanced pharmacological option as
      was portrayed in this case, where the right ventricle was under a prolonged
      severe depression and acutely overloaded after heart transplantation.

AB  - Heart transplantation (HTx) is considered the "gold standard" therapy of
      refractory heart failure (HF), but it is accessible only to few patients because 
      of the paucity of suitable heart donors. On the other hand, left ventricular
      assist devices (LVADs) have proven to be effective in improving survival and
      quality of life in patients with refractory HF. The challenge encountered by
      multidisciplinary teams in dealing with advanced HF lies in identifying patients 
      who could benefit more from HTx as compared to LVAD implantation and the
      appropriate timing. The decision-making is based on clinical parameters,
      imaging-based data and risk scores. Current outcome of HF patients supported by
      LVAD (2-year survival around 70%) is rapidly improving and leads the way to a new
      therapeutic strategy. Patients who have a low likelihood to gain access to the
      heart graft pool could benefit more from LVAD implantation (defined as bridge to 
      transplantation indication) than from remaining on HTx waiting list with the
      likely risk of clinical deterioration or removal from the list because patients
      are no longer suitable for transplantation. LVAD has also demonstrated to be
      effective in patients who are not considered eligible candidates for HTx with a
      destination therapy indication. HTx should be reserved to those patients for whom
      the maximum clinical benefit can be expected, such as young patients with no
      comorbidities. Here we discuss the current listing criteria for HTx and
      indications to implant of LVAD for patients with refractory acute and chronic HF 
      based on the guidelines and the practical experience of our center.

TI  - HeartMate II left ventricular assist device implantation in patients with
      advanced hepatic dysfunction.
PG  - 419-23
LID - 10.1111/jocs.12318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the outcomes for patients with advanced
      hepatic dysfunction undergoing HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      implantation. METHODS: Between November 1, 2003 and December 1, 2012, we
      implanted the HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD in 338 patients, either for
      bridging to heart transplantation or for destination therapy. Twenty-three of
      these patients (19 men and 4 women; mean age, 47 +/- 16 years) had advanced
      hepatic dysfunction, as characterized by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or
      aspartate transaminase (AST) levels five times normal; serum total bilirubin
      levels three times normal; and/or necessity for a liver biopsy before or during
      device implantation. Of this group, 17 patients received the LVAD as a bridge to 
      transplantation, and six patients received it for destination therapy. RESULTS:
      Nine of the 23 patients required either a transjugular or a core liver biopsy
      during LVAD implantation. Three patients died within the first postoperative
      month; the 20 surviving patients had significant improvements in their hepatic
      parameters. The ALT decreased from 238 +/- 296 to 27 +/- 13 U/L (p = 0.022), AST 
      decreased from 209 +/- 199 to 29 +/- 8 U/L (p = 0.009), and total bilirubin level
      decreased from 6.9 +/- 6.0 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/dL (p = 0.044). The serum albumin
      level increased from 3.2 +/- 0.6 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 g/dL (p = 0.003), and creatinine 
      clearance increased from 77.6 +/- 35.2 to 110.2 +/- 35.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p =
      0.101). CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD support may significantly improve
      hepatic function, allowing patients with poor preimplant liver function to become
      better candidates for heart transplantation.

AB  - A girl received an ABO-incompatible heart transplantation (ABOiHTx) at the age of
      3.5 years for failed univentricular palliation with protein-losing enteropathy
      (PLE). She was born with a hypoplastic left heart syndrome and underwent
      multistage palliation to a Fontan circulation at 2(1/2) years of age. After the
      Fontan surgery, she developed PLE, necessitating a Fontan revision, followed by a
      Fontan takedown and eventually HTx, which was performed with a blood group B
      heart into an O recipient. Right ventricular (RV) failure secondary to increased 
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) evolved immediately after HTx. A temporary
      right ventricular assist device (RVAD) was implanted and later switched to a
      pneumatic pulsatile RVAD. With the adaption of PVR on the RVAD, the PLE resolved 
      and the RVAD was explanted. In the following 12 months, she developed multiple
      relapses of PLE which eventually resolved after exchange of the calcineurin
      inhibitor.

TI  - Stroke while on long-term left ventricular assist device support: incidence,
      outcome, and predictors.
PG  - 284-9
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000074 [doi]
AB  - Development of stroke while on left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support can 
      be a source of significant morbidity and mortality. From March 2006 through
      November 2011, one hundred patients with chronic heart failure underwent
      implantation of a HeartMate II (HM II) LVAD (Thoratec Corp.) as a bridge to
      transplant (BTT; n = 65) or destination therapy (DT; n = 35). Records were
      reviewed to determine the prevalence and type of postimplant stroke, anatomic
      cerebral location of strokes, and associated morbidity and mortality. Cox
      multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent
      predictors of postoperative stroke. Strokes occurred in 12 patients (12.0%): four
      embolic and eight hemorrhagic. Median duration of support at the time of stroke
      was 281.0 days for embolic strokes and 380.5 days for hemorrhagic strokes (p =
      0.028). Stroke patients had a significantly higher incidence of diabetes (66.7%
      vs. 40.9%; p = 0.024), history of preimplant stroke (16.7% vs. 4.5%; p = 0.046), 
      and aortic cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest during their LVAD implant
      (50.0% vs. 20.2%; p = 0.034) compared with patients without postoperative
      strokes. Mean international normalized ratio (INR) at the time of stroke was
      subtherapeutic in all four patients with embolic strokes (mean: 1.5 +/- 0.1 IU;
      range 1.3-1.6 IU) and supratherapeutic in four of eight patients with hemorrhagic
      strokes (mean: 3.2 +/- 2.2 IU, range: 1.4-7.0 IU; p = 0.024). There was a 25.0%
      30 day mortality after stroke. Diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 6.36; p = 0.029), aortic
      cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest (OR 4.75; p = 0.025), duration of LVAD
      support (OR 1.00; p = 0.008), and INR (OR 4.42; p = 0.020) were independent
      predictors of stroke in multivariate analysis with a trend toward significance
      for history of stroke (OR 6.25; p = 0.075). Stroke represented an important
      source of morbidity and mortality for patients on HM II LVAD support. As
      long-term device therapy continues to gain popularity for both BTT and DT, a
      better understanding of the predictors of stroke, more strict control of
      postoperative anticoagulation, and the establishment of a risk stratification
      model may aid in minimizing its occurrence.

TI  - Design of a phase 2b trial of intracoronary administration of AAV1/SERCA2a in
      patients with advanced heart failure: the CUPID 2 trial (calcium up-regulation by
      percutaneous administration of gene therapy in cardiac disease phase 2b).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Impaired cardiac isoform of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)
      ATPase (SERCA2a) activity is a key abnormality in heart failure patients with
      reduced ejection fraction. The CUPID 2 (Calcium Up-Regulation by Percutaneous
      Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease Phase 2b) trial is designed to 
      evaluate whether increasing SERCA2a activity via gene therapy improves clinical
      outcome in these patients. BACKGROUND: Intracoronary delivery of recombinant
      adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1)/SERCA2a improves intracellular Ca(2+)
      handling by increasing SERCA2a protein levels and, as a consequence, restores
      systolic and diastolic function. In a previous phase 2a trial, this therapy
      improved symptoms, functional status, biomarkers, and left ventricular function, 
      and reduced cardiovascular events in advanced heart failure patients. METHODS:
      CUPID 2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational,
      multicenter, randomized event-driven study in up to 250 patients with
      moderate-to-severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New York
      Heart Association functional class II to IV symptoms despite optimal therapy.
      Enrolled patients will be at high risk for recurrent heart-failure
      hospitalizations by virtue of having elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
      peptide/BNP (>1,200 pg/ml, or >1,600 pg/ml if atrial fibrillation is present)
      and/or recent heart failure hospitalization. The primary endpoint of
      time-to-recurrent event (heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence
      of terminal events [all-cause death, heart transplant, left ventricular assist
      device implantation or ambulatory worsening heart failure]) will be assessed
      using the joint frailty model. This ongoing trial is expected to complete
      recruitment in 2014, with the required number of 186 recurrent events estimated
      to occur by mid 2015. RESULTS: Available data indicate that calcium up-regulation
      by AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy is safe and of potential benefit in advanced heart
      failure patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CUPID 2 trial is designed to study the effects
      of this therapy on clinical outcome in these patients. (Calcium Up-Regulation by 
      Percutaneous Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease Phase 2b
      [CUPID-2b]; NCT01643330).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of a
      strategy for percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement through the 
      left axillary-subclavian artery to provide mechanical circulatory support in
      patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation.
      BACKGROUND: The transfemoral approach to IABP placement is associated with major 
      disadvantages, including the risk for infection and limitation of patient
      mobility in those requiring extended support. METHODS: We developed a
      percutaneous technique for placing IABPs in the left axillary artery that permits
      upright sitting and ambulation. We performed a retrospective review of data from 
      patients who had undergone left axillary IABP implantation between 2007 and 2012.
      RESULTS: Fifty patients who received a left axillary IABP as a bridge to
      transplantation were identified, of whom 42 (84%) underwent heart or
      heart-multiorgan transplantation. Cumulative survival on IABP support was 92%,
      and post-transplant 90-day survival was 90%. Median duration of support was 18
      days. Four of 50 patients (8%) died while on IABP support, and 3 (6%) received
      greater mechanical circulatory support. Four patients (8%) had clinically
      significant thromboembolic or bleeding events without long-term sequelae. The
      most common minor adverse event was IABP malposition, in 22 patients (44%).
      Prolonged IABP support in the heart-transplantation cohort was associated with
      significant improvements in mean pulmonary artery pressure and in creatinine and 
      total bilirubin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous insertion of an IABP
      through the left axillary artery is a feasible and relatively well-tolerated
      strategy to bridge patients with end-stage heart failure to heart
      transplantation. This form of mechanical-device treatment permits upright sitting
      and ambulation in those requiring extended support.

TI  - Resting heart rate and heart rate reserve in advanced heart failure have distinct

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the prognostic impact of
      clinical and biomarker correlates of resting heart rate (HR) and chronotropic
      incompetence in heart failure (HF) patients. BACKGROUND: The mechanisms and
      underlying pathophysiological influences of HR abnormalities in HF are
      incompletely understood. METHODS: In a prospective pilot study, 81 patients with 
      advanced systolic HF (97% were receiving beta-blockers) and 25 age-, sex-, and
      body-size matched healthy controls underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing with sampling of neurohormones and biomarkers. RESULTS: Two-thirds of HF 
      patients met criteria for chronotropic incompetence. Resting HR and HR reserve
      (HRR, a measure of chronotropic response) were not correlated with each other and
      were associated with distinct biomarker profiles. Resting HR correlated with
      increased myocardial stress (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]: r = 0.26;
      pro-A-type natriuretic peptide: r = 0.24; N-terminal-proBNP: r = 0.32) and
      inflammation (leukocyte count: r = 0.28; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
      assay: r = 0.25). In contrast, HRR correlated with the neurohumoral response to
      HF (copeptin: r = -0.33; norepinephrine: r = -0.29) but not with myocyte stress
      or injury reflected by natriuretic peptides or hs-troponin I. Patients in the
      lowest chronotropic incompetence quartile (HRR </=0.38) displayed more advanced
      HF, reduced exercise capacity, ventilatory inefficiency, and poorer quality of
      life. Over a median follow-up of 17 months, the combined endpoint of death or
      urgent transplant/assist device implantation occurred more frequently in patients
      with higher resting HR (>67 beats/min) or lower HRR, with both markers providing 
      additive prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Increased resting HR and
      chronotropic incompetence may reflect different pathophysiological processes,
      provide incremental prognostic information, and represent distinct therapeutic
      targets.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical utility of a
      commercially available centrifugal flow pump as a centrifugal flow-right
      ventricular support device (CF-RVSD) in patients with right ventricular failure
      (RVF). BACKGROUND: RVF is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Limited
      data regarding efficacy of the CF-RVSD for RVF exist. METHODS: We retrospectively
      reviewed data from 46 patients receiving a CF-RVSD for RVF from a registry
      comprising data from 8 tertiary-care hospitals in the United States. CF-RVSD use 
      was recorded in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; myocarditis; chronic 
      left heart failure; after valve surgery, orthotopic heart transplantation, left
      ventricular assist device surgery, coronary bypass grafting. Devices were
      implanted via the percutaneous (n = 22) or surgical (n = 24) route. RESULTS: No
      intraprocedural mortality was observed. Mean time from admission to CF-RVSD
      implantation was 5.7 +/- 8.5 days, with a mean of 6,769 +/- 789 rotations/min,
      providing 4.2 +/- 1.3 l/min of flow. Mean duration of support was 5.4 +/- 5.1
      days. Mean arterial pressure (65 +/- 12 mm Hg vs. 73 +/- 14 mm Hg; p < 0.05),
      right atrial pressure (21 +/- 8 mm Hg vs. 16 +/- 7 mm Hg; p = 0.05), pulmonary
      artery systolic pressure (43 +/- 15 mm Hg vs. 33 +/- 15 mm Hg; p = 0.01), and
      cardiac index (1.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.6; p = 0.01) were improved within 48 h
      of CF-RVSD implantation. Total in-hospital mortality was 57% and was lowest in
      the setting of left ventricular assist device implantation, chronic left heart
      failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Increased age, biventricular failure,
      and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-defined major bleeding were associated 
      with increased in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the CF-RVSD for RVF is 
      clinically feasible and associated with improved hemodynamic status. Observations
      from the registry of patients who have received this device may support the
      development of prospective studies that will examine the role of percutaneous
      circulatory support for RVF.

TI  - Unplanned hospital readmissions after HeartMate II implantation: frequency, risk 
      factors, and impact on resource use and survival.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify potential areas for quality
      improvement and cost containment. We investigated readmissions after HeartMate II
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation by characterizing their type, 
      temporal frequency, causative factors, and resource use and survival after
      readmission. BACKGROUND: The HeartMate II LVAD provides enhanced survival and
      quality of life to end-stage heart failure patients. Whether these improved
      outcomes are accompanied by a similar reduction in unplanned hospital
      readmissions is largely unknown. METHODS: From October 2004 to January 2010, 118 
      patients received a HeartMate II, of whom 92 were discharged on device support.
      Subsequent readmissions were analyzed using prospectively maintained clinical and
      financial databases. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (52%) had 177 unplanned
      hospital readmissions, 87 non-LVAD- and 90 LVAD-associated. Reasons for
      non-LVAD-associated readmissions included medical management of comorbidities and
      progression of cardiac pathology (n = 48), neuropsychiatric/psychosocial issues
      (n = 22), and infections (n = 17). Those for LVAD-associated readmissions
      included device component infection (n = 51), management of nontherapeutic
      anticoagulation or device malfunction (n = 22), and bleeding (n = 15). Cumulative
      incidence of unplanned readmissions was higher (p < 0.0001) for destination
      therapy than bridge-to-transplant patients (9/patient vs. 4/patient at 24
      months). Cumulative hospital days overall were 25 and 42 at 12 and 18 months,
      respectively, and the costs were 18% and 29% of initial implantation costs.
      Increased number of unplanned readmissions was predictive of mortality.
      CONCLUSIONS: Unplanned readmissions are common during HeartMate II support and
      negatively affect resource use and survival. Refining patient selection,
      especially in destination therapy patients, reducing infectious and bleeding
      complications, and increasing awareness about these devices might reduce
      unnecessary readmissions.

AB  - Gelatin-impregnated nonporous sealed grafts were introduced in the inflow and
      outflow conduits for use with the HeartMate II (HMII) to eliminate preclotting
      procedures and to reduce operative bleeding. We compared results of 67 patients
      who received first-time left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) with sealed
      inflow and outflow grafts (S-graft group) with a preceding 65 patients who
      received an LVAD with nonsealed grafts (NS-graft group). Overall, the amount of
      blood product transfusions was less in the S-graft group than that in the
      NS-graft group (red blood cells, 4.9 +/- 4.5 vs. 8.0 +/- 9.4 units, p = 0.022;
      fresh-frozen plasma, 5.0 +/- 3.0 vs. 8.7 +/- 9.3 units, p = 0.004; platelets, 2.9
      +/- 1.1 vs. 4.5 +/- 3.5 units, p = 0.001; and cryoprecipitate, 1.2 +/- 0.9 vs.
      2.01 +/- 1.9 units, p = 0.002). Within a follow-up period of 6 months, no
      device-related infections or strokes occurred in the S-group, but the NS-group
      had one (1.5%) driveline infections and four (6%) strokes. The 30 days survival
      rate was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.053), but favored the 
      S-group (97%) over the NS-group (88%). Use of a HMII with a sealed graft on the
      inflow and outflow conduits is associated with less postoperative bleeding and
      may have helped to decrease the frequency of postoperative adverse events.

AB  - The availability of donor organs is the biggest limitation for lung
      transplantation, and a significant proportion of patients die on the waiting
      list. We describe a case of a 44-year-old lady who developed subarachnoid
      hemorrhage and cerebral edema on second postoperative day after left ventricular 
      assist device implantation. She was declared brain stem dead 2 days later, and
      her organs were transplanted to suitable recipients on the waiting list for lung,
      liver and kidney transplantation.

AB  - Viable treatment options for advanced heart failure have not emerged as the
      number of people afflicted with this condition has grown. Although heart
      transplantation is the only curative strategy for patients with end-stage heart
      failure, the relative shortage of donors has led to a worldwide plateau of this
      option over the past 20 years. The result is an unacceptably high mortality rate 
      among patients with advanced heart failure. Interest in developing alternative
      curative strategies based on chronic circulatory support, with the aim of
      prolonging and improving quality of life for these patients, has grown. Patients 
      supported with left ventricular assist devices require structured longitudinal
      care from a team of providers. An integrated approach using basic
      echocardiography is critical to patient selection, implantation, and continued
      surveillance and success of patients with left ventricular assist devices.

TI  - Comparative cost-effectiveness of the HeartWare versus HeartMate II left
      ventricular assist devices used in the United Kingdom National Health Service
      bridge-to-transplant program for patients with heart failure.
PG  - 350-8

LID - S1053-2498(14)00016-3 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced heart failure may receive a left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) as part of a bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy. The United
      Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the 
      predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton,
      CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed to
      compare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program.
      METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Base
      were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomes
      were time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences of
      HT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistate
      economic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was from
      the NHS, discount rates were 3.5%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years
      (QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB pound) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs 
      HM II. RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulative
      incidence of HT was low for both groups (11% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued
      4.99 lifetime QALYs costing pound258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84 
      QALYs costing pound231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for 
      HW vs HM II were pound23,530 ($37,349) and pound20,799 ($33,014), respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a better
      clinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was more
      cost-effective. This result needs to be reassessed in a randomized controlled
      trial comparing the 2 devices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronically supported left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients 
      may be candidates for novel therapies aimed at promoting reverse remodeling and
      myocardial recovery. However, the effect of hemodynamic unloading with a LVAD on 
      myocardial viability and LV function in chronically supported LVAD patients has
      not been fully characterized. We aimed to develop a non-invasive imaging protocol
      to serially quantify native cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability
      while at reduced LVAD support. METHODS: Clinically stable (n = 18) ambulatory
      patients (83% men, median age, 61 years) supported by a HeartMate II (Thoratec,
      Pleasanton, CA) LVAD (median durations of heart failure 4.6 years and LVAD
      support 7 months) were evaluated by echocardiography and technetium-99m
      ((99m)Tc)-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging at
      baseline and after an interval of 2 to 3 months. Echocardiographic measures of LV
      size and function, including speckle tracking-derived circumferential strain,
      were compared between ambulatory and reduced LVAD support at baseline and between
      baseline and follow-up at reduced LVAD support. The extent of myocardial
      viability by SPECT was compared between baseline and follow-up at reduced LVAD
      support. RESULTS: With reduction in LVAD speeds (6,600 rpm; interquartile range: 
      6,200, 7,400 rpm), LV size increased, LV systolic function remained stable, and
      filling pressures nominally worsened. After a median 2.1 months, cardiac
      structure, function, and the extent of viable myocardium, globally and
      regionally, was unchanged on repeat imaging while at reduced LVAD speed.
      CONCLUSIONS: In clinically stable chronically supported LVAD patients, intrinsic 
      cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability did not significantly
      change over the pre-specified time frame. Echocardiographic circumferential
      strain and (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT myocardial viability imaging may provide
      useful non-invasive end points for the assessment of cardiac structure and
      function, particularly for phase II studies of novel therapies aimed at promoting
      reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery in LVAD patients.

LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezu039 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A significant number of children affected by congenital heart disease
      (CHD) develop heart failure early or late after surgery, and heart
      transplantation (OHTx) remains the last treatment option. Due to shortage of
      donor organs in paediatric group, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is now
      routinely applied as bridging strategy to increase survival on the waiting list
      for OTHx. We sought to assess the impact of MCS as intention to bridge to OHTx in
      patients with CHD less than 16 years of age. METHODS: From 1998 to 2013, 106
      patients received 113 episodes of MCS with paracorporeal devices as intention to 
      bridge to OHTx. Twenty-nine had CHD, 15 (52%) with two-ventricle (Group A) and 14
      (48%) with single-ventricle physiology (Group B). In Group A, 5 children had
      venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), 6 left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD), 2 biventricular assist device (BIVAD), 1 VA ECMO followed
      by BIVAD and 1 BIVAD followed by VA ECMO. In Group B, VA ECMO was used in 7
      children, univentricular assist device (UVAD) changed to VA ECMO in 4, UVAD in 2 
      and surgical conversion to two-ventricles physiology with BIVAD support changed
      to VA ECMO in 1. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 29 (72%) children survived to
      recovery/OHTx. Seven of 29 (59%) survived to discharge. In Group A, 11/15 (73%)
      survived to recovery/OHTx and 9/15 (60%) survived to discharge. Four of 15 (27%) 
      died awaiting OHTx. One child had graft failure requiring VA ECMO and was bridged
      successfully to retransplantation. One child dying after OHTx had acute
      rejection, was supported with VA ECMO and then BIVAD but did not recover. One
      patient had an unsuccessful second run on BIVAD 1 year after recovery from VA
      ECMO. In Group B, 10/14 (71%) survived to recovery/OHTx and 8/14 (57%) survived
      to discharge. Four of 14 (29%) died awaiting OHTx. Of deaths after OHTx, 1
      occurred intraoperatively and 1 was consequent to graft failure and had an
      unsuccessful second run with VA ECMO. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CHD can be
      successfully bridged with MCS to heart transplantation. Single-ventricle
      circulation compared with biventricular physiology does not increase the risk of 
      death before transplant or before hospital discharge.

AB  - Reports on sex-related outcomes in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients
      are conflicting. In addition, females have been underrepresented in most
      multicenter randomized controlled trials for mechanical circulatory support
      (MCS). The objective of our study was to analyze our experience implanting 130
      continuous-flow LVADs and to determine the impact of sex on survival. We
      identified 130 patients who underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD at
      our institution. Patients were stratified into two groups based on sex. Variables
      were compared using two-sided t-tests, chi(2) tests, Cox proportional hazards
      models, and log-rank tests to determine whether there was a difference between
      the two groups and if sex was a significant independent predictor of outcome. Of 
      the 130 patients, 35 were females and 95 were males. Female patients had worse
      pre-LVAD cardiac output and cardiac index and were more likely to be on MCS at
      the time of implantation. Male patients had worse renal function. Survival was
      analogous for both cohorts with 30 day, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year survivals of 
      97%, 90.8%, 90.8%, and 84.3%, respectively, for female patients versus 94.7%,
      87.9%, 78.4%, and 72.8%, respectively, for male patients. The incidence of other 
      LVAD-related complications was also similar in both groups. Gender did not
      predict postoperative mortality on univariate analysis. Contrary to most
      published reports, female and male LVAD patients have similar postoperative and
      midterm survival, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and postoperative
      complications. It appears that females have gained more benefit from newer
      generation devices compared to males.

TI  - Right heart failure and benefits of adjuvant tricuspid valve repair in patients
      undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation.
PG  - 802-7
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezu040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although right heart failure (RVF) is an important issue in the
      management of patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), the benefits
      of performing tricuspid valve repair in conjunction with LVAD implantation have
      not been demonstrated. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 141
      patients who received LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplant from May 1999
      to January 2013. We assessed short- and long-term right heart function in 69 of
      these patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair because of moderate-to-severe
      tricuspid regurgitation (TR) or severe dilatation of the tricuspid annulus. RVF
      was defined as the need for a right ventricular assist device or >30 days of
      intravenous inotropic support. TR was graded from 0 to 4, while fibrosis in
      myocardial biopsy samples was graded pathologically from 0 to 3. RESULTS: The
      average duration of LVAD support was 595 days. Twenty-seven patients developed
      RVF and their survival rate was significantly worse than that of patients who did
      not develop RVF (65 vs 91% at 1 year). RVF was significantly related to high
      preoperative ratio of central venous pressure (CVP) to pulmonary capillary wedge 
      pressure, high total bilirubin, high fibrosis score and high TR grade. In
      patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair, the TR grade was significantly
      reduced from 2.6 to 1.0, and this decrease was maintained for 2 years. Although
      patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair had significantly higher TR grades,
      ratios of CVP to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and fibrosis scores
      preoperatively, no survival impairment was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid valve
      repair is a useful and durable adjuvant procedure for restoring deteriorated
      right ventricular function in patients requiring LVAD implantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is affecting millions of people every year and it 
      is characterized by impaired ventricular performance, exercise intolerance and
      shortened life expectancy. Despite significant advancements in drug therapy,
      mortality of the disease remains excessively high, as heart transplant remains
      the gold standard treatment for end-stage HF when no contraindications subsist.
      Traditionally, implanted Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) have been employed in 
      order to provide circulatory support to patients who cannot survive the waiting
      time to transplantation, reducing the workload imposed on the heart. In many
      cases that process could recover its contractility performance. OBJECTIVES: The
      SensorART platform focuses on the management and remote treatment of patients
      suffering from HF. It provides an interoperable, extendable and VAD-independent
      solution, which incorporates various hardware and software components in a
      holistic approach, in order to improve the quality of the patients' treatment and
      the workflow of the specialists. This paper focuses on the description and
      analysis of Specialist's Decision Support System (SDSS), an innovative component 
      of the SensorART platform. METHODS: The SDSS is a Web-based tool that assists
      specialists on designing the therapy plan for their patients before and after VAD
      implantation, analyzing patients' data, extracting new knowledge, and making
      informative decisions. RESULTS: SDSS offers support to medical and VAD experts
      through the different phases of VAD therapy, incorporating several tools covering
      all related fields; Statistics, Association Rules, Monitoring, Treatment,
      Weaning, Speed and Suction Detection. CONCLUSIONS: SDSS and its modules have been
      tested in a number of patients and the results are encouraging.

AB  - Despite the progress in medical therapy, advanced heart failure (AHF) remains a
      global epidemic with high morbidity and mortality. Novel cardiac support
      strategies such as pharmacologic agents, mechanical circulatory support (MCS),
      and cell- or matrix-based therapies are promising for these patients. The
      indications, types, and timing of MCS implantation depend to a large extent on
      the presentation, clinical status of the patient, underlying etiology, and
      long-term prospects. The presence or absence of end-organ damage has a
      significant impact on prognosis following MCS initiation. Although many patients 
      with acute AHF may have end-organ damage, their prospect of recovery, once
      appropriate therapy is instituted, is better than for patients who had AHF for
      longer periods of time. We consider the multidisciplinary approaches used for the
      management of AHF and the novel cardiac support strategies (eg, MCS). Appropriate
      selection of patient, device, time, and end point is essential for better
      outcomes.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been increasingly used for 20 years 
      in terminally ill patients with advanced heart failure or awaiting cardiac
      transplantation. Despite improvement in morbidity and mortality from use of these
      devices, quality of life may be limited by cataract. Access to cataract surgery
      in this predominantly elderly population is essential but limited by
      unfamiliarity with these devices. We describe phacoemulsification and intraocular
      lens implantation in 2 patients with LVADs. The patients had extensive
      preoperative cardiology evaluations and were instructed to continue warfarin
      through the day of surgery. Monitored sedation was used with fentanyl and
      midazolam. Both patients experienced significant improvement in visual acuity and
      quality of life. Neither experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability.
      Cataract surgery may be safely performed in patients with LVAD support when
      adequate monitoring resources are available. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has

TI  - Case report: atypical fungal obstruction of the left ventricular assist device
      outflow cannula.

AB  - We describe a very rare case of outflow cannula obstruction with fungal
      infectious thrombus formation. Discussion includes the etiology, diagnosis, and
      management of fungal infection complications related with long-term mechanical
      circulatory support. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly
      used as bridge to transplant and permanent long-term therapy in the population
      with end-stage heart failure. Even though better clinical outcomes have been
      achieved with the newer-generation continuous-flow devices, infection
      complications are still a major risk for patients with continuous-flow LVAD
      implantation in long-term follow-up [Ann Thorac Surg 90:1270-1277, 2010].
      Device-related infections can be categorized as driveline infections, pump-pocket
      infections, and LVAD-associated endocarditis [Expert Rev Med Devices 8: 627-634, 
      2011]. The microbiological profile is very heterogeneous; the most common
      pathogens are Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus species, and Candida.
      Severe fungal infection may lead to dysfunction of the LVAD due to obstructive
      mass formation within the device. Due to the only anecdotal reports in the
      current literature, we present a very rare case of outflow fungal infectious
      thrombus formation leading to outflow cannula obstruction in patient with LVAD.

AB  - Historically, cardiac transplantation is the only definitive therapy for
      mortality reduction, symptom reduction, and improved quality of life in advanced 
      heart failure. Because of improvement in cardiovascular care there is now a
      growing number of patients such as the elderly and those with abundant
      comorbidity who are not eligible for cardiac transplant. Durable mechanical
      circulatory support is the new reality in the treatment of advanced heart failure
      in this population subset. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has evolved 
      from humble origins as a short-term extracorporeal and pulsatile device into a
      durable intracorporeal continuous flow device capable of providing permanent
      support in the form of destination therapy (DT) LVAD. Data gathered from original
      landmark clinical trials including Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance
      for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH), and the Heart Mate II
      Trial, and the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
      (INTERMACS) provide insight into the type of patient and the timing in which to
      consider DT LVAD therapy. There are a number individual patient warning signs and
      symptoms that predate clinical decline; thus, identifying individuals who might
      benefit from a DT LVAD strategy. The adverse event burden that accompanies DT
      LVAD therapy cannot be ignored when considering LVAD as an adjunct to ongoing
      medical therapy. Trends in patient selection regarding mechanical circulatory
      support continue to evolve along with the technology. As more clinical outcome
      data are gathered we will continue to refine our patient selection criteria and
      timing of implant.

TI  - Comparative survival and cost-effectiveness of advanced therapies for end-stage
      heart failure.
PG  - 470-8
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000807 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment options for end-stage heart failure include
      inotrope-dependent medical therapy, orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), left 
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) as destination therapy or bridge to transplant. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a state-transition model to simulate 4
      treatment options and associated morbidity and mortality. Transition
      probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from published sources.
      Calculated outcomes included survival, quality-adjusted life-years, and
      incremental cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed on model
      parameters to test robustness. Average life expectancy for OHT-eligible patients 
      is estimated at 1.1 years, with 39% surviving to 1 year. OHT with a median wait
      time of 5.6 months is estimated to increase life expectancy to 8.5 years, and
      costs <$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent
      medical therapy. Bridge to transplant-LVAD followed by OHT further is estimated
      to increase life expectancy to 12.3 years, for $226,000/quality-adjusted
      life-year gained versus OHT. Among OHT-ineligible patients, mean life expectancy 
      with inotrope-dependent medical therapy is estimated at 9.4 months, with 26%
      surviving to 1 year. Patients who instead received destination therapy-LVAD are
      estimated to live 4.4 years on average from extrapolation of recent constant
      hazard rates beyond the first year. This strategy costs $202,000/quality-adjusted
      life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent medical therapy. Patient's age, 
      time on wait list, and costs associated with care influence outcomes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Under most scenarios, OHT prolongs life and is cost effective in
      eligible patients. Bridge to transplant-LVAD is estimated to offer >3.8
      additional life-years for patients waiting >/=6 months, but does not meet
      conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. Destination therapy-LVAD
      significantly improves life expectancy in OHT-ineligible patients. However,
      further reductions in adverse events or improved quality of life are needed for
      destination therapy-LVAD to be cost effective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcomes in patients who are removed from
      the heart transplant (HT) waiting list before receiving a transplant. We sought
      to analyze outcomes in such patients in the United States (U.S.) in the current
      era. METHODS: All patients aged >/= 18 years old listed for a primary HT in the
      U.S. between July 2004 and September 2010 were identified. Outcomes in those
      removed from the list by March 2011 (survival, relisting, HT) were examined using
      time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: Of 15,061 patients listed for primary HT, 10,168
      (68%) received a HT, 1,393 (9%) died on the waiting list, and 1,871(12%) were
      removed before receiving HT. Of patients removed from the list, 560 (30%) were
      removed due to clinical improvement, 692 (37%) due to deterioration, and 619
      (33%) due to other reasons. After removal, 30-day and 1-year survival were 99.6% 
      and 94%, respectively, in patients removed due to improvement and 44% and 26%,
      respectively, in patients removed due to deterioration. Multivariable predictors 
      of death after removal were removal due to clinical deterioration, hypertrophic
      or restrictive cardiomyopathy, United Network of Organ Sharing status 1A/1B at
      listing, and renal dysfunction. Only 27 patients (4.8%) among those removed due
      to improvement, 21 (3.0%) removed due to deterioration, and 46 (7.4%) removed due
      to other reasons were relisted. CONCLUSIONS: One in 8 patients listed for HT in
      the U.S. are removed from the waiting list before receiving HT. The indication
      for removal (clinical deterioration vs improvement) is the strongest independent 
      predictor of survival after removal from the list.

PG  - 195-203
LID - 10.1159/000358495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are increasingly common, and their 
      surgical implantation predisposes patients to an increased risk of acute kidney
      injury (AKI). We sought to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and short- and
      long-term all-cause mortality of patients with AKI following VAD implantation.
      METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent VAD implantation at the
      University of Chicago between January 1, 2008, and January 31, 2012. We evaluated
      the incidence of AKI, defined as a >/=50% increase in serum creatinine over the
      first 7 postoperative days (RIFLE Risk-Creatinine). A logistic regression model
      was used to identify risk factors for the development of AKI, and a Cox
      proportional hazards model was used to examine factors associated with 30-day and
      365-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 157 eligible patients had VAD
      implantations with 44 (28%) developing postimplantation AKI. In a multivariate
      analysis, only diabetes mellitus [odds ratio = 2.25 (1.03-4.94), p = 0.04] was
      identified as a significant predictor of postoperative AKI. Using a multivariable
      model censored for heart transplantation, only AKI [hazard ratio, HR = 3.01
      (1.15-7.92), p = 0.03] and cardiopulmonary bypass time [HR = 1.01 (1.001-1.02), p
      = 0.02] were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Preoperative body mass
      index [HR = 0.95 (0.90-0.99), p = 0.03], preoperative diabetes mellitus [HR =
      1.89 (1.07-3.35), p = 0.03] and postimplantation AKI [HR = 1.85 (1.06-3.21), p = 
      0.03] independently predicted 365-day mortality. CONCLUSION: AKI is common
      following VAD implantation and is an independent predictor of 30-day and 1-year
      all-cause mortality.

TI  - Pearls and pitfalls in short-term mechanical circulatory assist: how to avoid and
      manage complications.
PG  - 829-37

AB  - In today's era, given the worsening risk profiles of patients undergoing cardiac 
      surgery, the increasing number of complex cardiac surgeries, and the increasing
      number of patients undergoing thoracic organ transplantation, short-term
      mechanical circulatory assist (MCA) devices are indispensable. MCA devices are
      capable of supporting heart and lung function and have emerged as potentially
      lifesaving instruments, but may prove to be as hazardous as helpful due to their 
      inherent tendency toward hemolysis, thromboembolism, and hemorrhage. Although MCA
      devices are being used regularly at some specialized centers, surgeries involving
      MCA are not as common as other routine cardiac surgeries, and even though
      professionals implanting and maintaining short-term MCAs are well acquainted with
      operating such devices, it is not uncommon to come across complications as a
      result of minor mistakes committed while dealing with them. Avoiding simple
      mistakes and taking proper precautions while implanting and maintaining these
      devices can prevent major catastrophes. We discuss commonly encountered problems 
      and complications during the implantation and maintenance of short-term MCAs and 
      offer reasonable and practical solutions. In addition, crucial issues such as
      anticoagulation, replacement of the device circuit, and management of the distal 
      perfusion cannula are discussed. Continuous and efficient monitoring of the MCA
      device and the patient supported on MCA, together with anticipation and avoidance
      of complications, is key for successful short-term MCA support.

AB  - Left ventricular assist device therapy has radically improved congestive heart
      failure survival with smaller rotary pumps. The driveline used to power today's
      left ventricular assist devices, however, continues to be a source of infection, 
      traumatic damage, and rehospitalization. Previous attempts to wirelessly power
      left ventricular assist devices using transcutaneous energy transfer systems have
      been limited by restrictions on separation distance and alignment between the
      transmit and receive coils. Resonant electrical energy transfer allows power
      delivery at larger distances without compromising safety and efficiency. This
      review covers the efforts to wirelessly power mechanical circulatory assist
      devices and the progress made in enhancing their energy sources.

AB  - The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), which is the main representative of the
      counterpulsation technique, has been an invaluable tool in cardiologists' and
      cardiac surgeons' armamentarium for approximately half a century. The IABP
      confers a wide variety of vaguely understood effects on cardiac physiology and
      mechano-energetics. Although, the recommendations for its use are multiple, most 
      are not substantially evidence-based. Indicatively, the results of recently
      performed prospective studies have put IABP's utility in the setting of
      post-infarction cardiogenic shock into question. However, the particular issue
      remains open to further research. IABP support in high-risk patients undergoing
      PCI is associated with favorable long-term clinical outcome. In cardiac surgery, 
      the use of IABP in cases of peri-operative low-output syndrome, refractory angina
      or ischemia-related mechanical complications is a usual, but poorly justified
      strategy. Anecdotal cases of treatment of incessant ventricular arrhythmias,
      reversal of right ventricular dysfunction and partial myocardial recovery have
      also been reported with its use. Converging data demonstrate the potential of
      safe long-term IABP support as a bridge to decision making or a bridge to
      transplantation modality in patients with heart failure. The feasibility of IABP 
      insertion via other than the femoral artery sites enhances this potential.
      Despite the fact that several other counterpulsation devices have been developed 
      and tested overtime none has managed to substitute the IABP, which continues to
      be most frequently used mechanical assist device.

TI  - Echocardiographic assessment of pulmonary artery systolic pressure and outcomes
      in ambulatory heart failure patients.
PG  - e000363
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.113.000363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with heart failure (HF) is
      associated with worse outcomes and is rapidly being recognized as a therapeutic
      target. To facilitate pragmatic research efforts, data regarding the prognostic
      importance of noninvasively assessed pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in
      stable ambulatory patients with HF are needed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined
      the association between echocardiographic PASP and outcomes in 417 outpatients
      with HF (age, 54 +/- 13 years; 60.7% men; 50.4% whites; 24.9% with preserved
      ejection fraction). Median PASP was 36 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR]: 29, 46).
      After a median follow-up of 2.6 years (IQR: 1.7, 3.9) there were 72 major events 
      (57 deaths; 9 urgent heart transplants; and 6 ventricular assist device
      implantations) and 431 hospitalizations for HF. In models adjusting for clinical 
      risk factors and therapy, a 10-mm Hg higher PASP was associated with 37% higher
      risk (95% CI: 18, 59; P<0.001) for major events, and 11% higher risk (95% CI: 1, 
      23; P=0.039) for major events or HF hospitalization. The threshold that maximized
      the likelihood ratio for both endpoints was 48 mm Hg; those with PASP >/= 48 mm
      Hg (N=84; 20.1%) had an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.33 (95% CI: 1.96, 5.65;
      P<0.001) for major events and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.11; P=0.037) for major events
      or HF hospitalization. Reduced right ventricular systolic function had
      independent prognostic utility over PASP for adverse outcomes. Right atrial
      pressure and transtricuspid gradient both contributed to risk. CONCLUSIONS:
      Elevated PASP, determined by echocardiography, identifies ambulatory patients
      with HF at increased risk for adverse events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of percutaneous lead failure among patients supported
      with a HeartMate II left ventricular assist device is unknown. METHODS: All
      HeartMate II left ventricular assist device driveline dysfunctions reported to
      Thoratec Corporation were retrospectively reviewed. The location and severity of 
      driveline failures and their association with adverse clinical outcomes were
      examined. Also, the effect of design modifications was evaluated. RESULTS:
      Between 2004 and October 2012, 12,969 HeartMate II pumps were implanted
      worldwide. The incidence of percutaneous lead dysfunction was 1,418 events
      occurring in 1,198 pumps (9.2% of pumps) over a cumulative support period of
      13,932 patient-years (maximum, 8 years). Lead failure was mostly in the
      externalized part of the cable (87.2%). Lead dysfunction was managed by clamshell
      reinforcement of the external connector strain relief or by tape or silicone
      cable reinforcement in 76% of cases. Mortality or significant morbidity,
      including pump exchange or urgent transplant, or more complex cable repair
      occurred in 2.3% of all implanted pumps. The cumulative incidence of lead
      failures leading to major adverse clinical events has decreased with two lead
      design revisions: at 18 months postimplantation, the incidence was 6.2%+/-1.2%
      for the original design versus 2.2%+/-0.5% for the latest design change
      introduced in 2010 (log-rank p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lead failures remain an
      important factor in the durability of left ventricular assist devices during
      long-term support. Most lead failures in the HeartMate II occurred in the
      externalized portion of the driveline, suggesting lead fatigue. The incidence of 
      both internal and external lead failures has diminished since 2004 with
      improvements in lead design.

AB  - Because of the extreme donor shortage in Japan, waiting times for heart
      transplantation exceed 2 years. Since 1980s in Japan, device availability has
      also been an issue, with only a few paracorporeal ventricular assist devices
      (VADs) available as a bridge to transplantation or recovery. However, two
      implantable VADs became commercially available in 2011. Given these constraints
      in our healthcare system, we report a relatively rare case of bridge-to-bridge
      use of an implanted EVAHEART after having used a paracorporeal AB-5000 support
      for an extended period of time. We successfully employed a combined left
      thoracotomy and median sternotomy approach as a conversion technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is recognized as a major prognostic indicator in heart
      failure. There has been interest in understanding whether pre-operative frailty
      is associated with worse outcomes after implantation of a left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) as destination therapy. METHODS: Patients undergoing LVAD
      implantation as destination therapy at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota,
      from February 2007 to June 2012, were included in this study. Frailty was
      assessed using the deficit index (31 impairments, disabilities and comorbidities)
      and defined as the proportion of deficits present. We divided patients based on
      tertiles of the deficit index (>0.32 = frail, 0.23 to 0.32 = intermediate frail, 
      <0.23 = not frail). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to
      examine the association between frailty and death. Patients were censored at
      death or last follow-up through October 2013. RESULTS: Among 99 patients (mean
      age 65 years, 18% female, 55% with ischemic heart failure), the deficit index
      ranged from 0.10 to 0.65 (mean 0.29). After a mean follow-up of 1.9 +/- 1.6
      years, 79% of the patients had been rehospitalized (range 0 to 17
      hospitalizations, median 1 per person) and 45% had died. Compared with those who 
      were not frail, patients who were intermediate frail (adjusted HR 1.70, 95% CI
      0.71 to 4.31) and frail (HR 3.08, 95% CI 1.40 to 7.48) were at increased risk for
      death (p for trend = 0.004). The mean (SD) number of days alive out of hospital
      the first year after LVAD was 293 (107) for not frail, 266 (134) for intermediate
      frail and 250 (132) for frail patients. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty before destination
      LVAD implantation is associated with increased risk of death and may represent a 
      significant patient selection consideration.

TI  - IntraVAD, an intra-ventricular assistive device for heart failure patients:
      design and proof of concept simulations.
PG  - 999-1011
LID - 10.1007/s10439-014-0978-8 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assistive devices are approved by Food and Drug Administration as an 
      alternative to heart transplant for congestive heart failure patients. Unlike
      other devices requiring open-heart surgery, thin active flexible membrane of
      IntraVAD, made of ionic polymer-metal composites and shape memory alloys (SMA),
      enables transcatheter implantation and eliminates thoracotomy. Actuation
      mechanism of the device mimics the natural motion of the heart, applies almost no
      shear stress on blood cells, and leaves no stagnant points. Hence, it reduces
      hemolysis and thrombosis risks. The first step in designing the device is
      defining the objectives based on hemodynamics of eligible patients. A
      3-dimensional model is extracted from magnetic resonance images of a subject to
      provide a precise representation of the inner shape of the ventricle. Numerical
      solution to the mathematical model of the behavior of ionic polymer-metal
      composites is then used to check their compliancy with the objectives. Different 
      actuator designs are evaluated to perform the desired motions and address the
      cardiac insufficiency. Using an iterative design and simulation process, various 
      geometric and material parameters affecting the performance of the device are
      optimized, including those of the antagonistic two-way SMA actuators. Although
      methods and results provided here are for the left ventricle, the same are also
      applicable to the right ventricle.

AB  - Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization of pediatric heart recipients
      increases their risk of rejection and graft loss. As more children are placed on 
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to transplant, the risk factors 
      for development of sensitization warrant further study. A single-center
      retrospective review of 36 children who received MCS identified 22 patients
      supported with either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (n = 15) or
      ECMO-ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 7) with paired (pre-MCS/post-MCS) panel
      reactive antibodies (PRA) or only negative post-MCS PRAs. Four patients (18%)
      became sensitized post-MCS (one ECMO-only patient, three ECMO-VAD patients). No
      difference was found between sensitized and nonsensitized patients in terms of
      congenital heart disease versus primary cardiomyopathy (p = 0.096), duration of
      MCS (38 days vs. 14 days, p = 0.233), or volume of blood product transfusions
      (358.6 ml/kg vs. 612.7 ml/kg, p = not significant). By multivariable analysis,
      the association of sensitization with older age at MCS (p = 0.076) and history of
      homograft (p = 0.064) approached significance. Pediatric patients supported with 
      MCS are at low risk of developing HLA sensitization. Diagnosis, MCS duration, and
      volume of transfused blood products do not appear to be associated with HLA
      sensitization, but there is a suggestion of an association with older age at MCS 
      and history of a homograft.

PG  - 263-8
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000054 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure can be treated with devices that mechanically support the
      circulation. The improvement of these devices would benefit many patients,
      especially those refractory to maximal pharmacological treatment and ineligible
      for heart transplantation. This study examined whether the shape memory alloy
      (SMA) fibers, which are fibers that contract when electric current flows through 
      them and relax passively when that flow is interrupted, can be wrapped around the
      failing heart and assist in its pumping action. A band of SMA fibers was wrapped 
      around a silicon cylindrical chamber which simulated a dilated heart and its
      pumping action was tested in a circulatory mockup. This rudimentary device was
      innovatively controlled by pulse width modulation. The band was made of only six 
      fibers but yet produced the considerable pressure of 20 mm Hg and a stroke volume
      of 11.8 ml with modest energy demands. A SMA device could assist a severely
      failing heart, but there are limiting factors to overcome before designing highly
      effective devices.

LID - 10.1007/s10047-013-0752-y [doi]
AB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are becoming the standard
      of care for patients with refractory end-stage heart failure. We present the
      outcomes of patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter clinical study in
      Japan using the HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD for bridge to transplantation. 
      The study evaluated 6 inotrope-dependent heart failure patients failing on
      medical management (3 males and 3 females, age 44.7 +/- 15.8 years, BSA 1.58 +/- 
      0.17 m(2)) implanted with the HMII LVAD at 5 Japanese centers. Functional status,
      adverse events and outcomes were determined for the first 6 months with follow-up
      at 2 years. After implant, functional improvement was evident in 6-min walk
      distance which increased from 268 +/- 92 m at baseline to 399 +/- 105 m at 6
      months, and 100% of patients were in NYHA class I or II at 6 months compared to
      0% at baseline. Adverse events included localized non-device-related infection
      (4/6), arrhythmias (3/6) and percutaneous lead infection (1/6). There were no
      re-thoracotomies for bleeding and no strokes or pump replacements. All patients
      were alive at 6 months and all were transplanted after 1.96-3.58 years of LVAD
      support. The results in Japan of the HMII LVAD for BTT are consistent with
      results from the US pivotal clinical trial. The expanded use of this technology
      to Japanese heart failure patients is appropriate.

TI  - Weaning from inotropic support and concomitant beta-blocker therapy in severely
      ill heart failure patients: take the time in order to improve prognosis.
PG  - 435-43
AB  - AIMS: Beta-blockers improve the prognosis in heart failure (HF), but their
      introduction may seem impossible in patients dependent on inotropic support.
      However, many of these patients can be titrated on beta-blockers, but there is
      little evidence of successful clinical strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      analysed the records of inotropy-dependent patients referred for assessment for
      heart transplantation. Thirty-six patients (45%) could not be weaned (NW) and
      underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation or transplantation, 
      or died. However, 44 (55%) were successfully weaned (SW). Neither the aetiology
      (ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic) nor cardiac indexes were different in the SW as
      compared with the NW group (2.27+/-0.5 vs. 2.15+/-0.6 L/min/m2). The NW patients 
      had lower LVEF (15+/-5% vs. 19+/-5%, P=0.001), higher right atrial pressure
      (12+/-6 vs. 8+/-6 mmHg, P=0.02), and more severe mitral regurgitation (P<0.001)
      than the SW patients. At discharge, 35 of 44 SW patients were receiving
      beta-blockers. In 29 of them, a beta-blocker could only be initiated or continued
      during concomitant support with i.v. enoximone for a duration of 14.1+/-7.2 days.
      Patients discharged on a beta-blocker had an LVAD/transplantation-free cumulative
      survival of 71% during a follow-up of 2074+/-201 days (confidence interval
      1679-2470). CONCLUSION: It takes time to put severely ill HF patients on
      beta-blockers and it may require bridging with inotropes which are independent of
      beta-adrenergic receptors. Whether such a strategy may result in a better
      clinical outcome warrants further research.

AB  - We describe the first clinical experiences in Japan with the HeartWare
      ventricular assist device (HVAD: HeartWare Inc., Miami Lakes, FL, USA) in
      patients awaiting heart transplantation. Nine patients (6 males, 3 females; mean 
      33.5 +/- 7.8 years; New York Heart Association class III or IV) received the HVAD
      as a bridge to transplantation between 2011 and 2012. Six had dilated
      cardiomyopathy, 2 secondary cardiomyopathy, and 1 dilated phase hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy. All operations were uneventful, with a mean operation time of 269
      +/- 77 min and cardiopulmonary bypass time of 121 +/- 40 min. One required a
      temporary right ventricular assist device and was weaned on postoperative day 20,
      while another required pump exchange due to foreign tissue in the inflow. Mean
      support duration was 245 +/- 162 days (range: 50-535 days) and mean pump blood
      flow at 1 month postoperatively was 4.8 +/- 0.8 l/min. There was no mortality
      after 30 days, though 1 patient died during support due to cerebral hemorrhage.
      Presently, the others are waiting for heart transplantation without problems,
      except 1 who suffered from an active infection. There was no pump mechanical
      failure in any case. The HeartWare pump enables quick implantation with
      acceptable morbidity and mortality. Our preliminary results indicate that this
      left ventricular assist device is safe for circulatory assistance for heart
      transplant candidates in Japan.

TI  - Survival benefit from transplantation in patients listed for heart

LID - S0735-1097(14)00176-4 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the survival benefit from heart
      transplantation (HT), defined as reduction in the risks for 90-day and 1-year
      mortality on undergoing HT close to listing, in candidates stratified by their
      risk for waiting list mortality. BACKGROUND: Among patients listed for HT, those 
      at higher risk for death without transplantation are also at higher risk for
      early post-transplantation mortality. METHODS: All patients age >/=18 years
      listed for HT in the United States from 2007 to 2010 were analyzed. A model was
      developed to predict the risk for waiting list mortality within 90 days, and
      listed patients were stratified into 10 risk groups (deciles). All groups were
      followed for 1 year to assess cumulative 1-year mortality while on the waiting
      list. Models of 90-day and 1-year post-transplantation mortality were developed
      using recipient data, and these risks were estimated at listing in all listed
      candidates. RESULTS: Of 10,159 patients listed for HT, 596 (5.9%) died within 90 
      days and 1,054 (10.4%) within 1 year without undergoing transplantation. Of 5,720
      recipients of transplants with 1-year follow-up, 576 (10.1%) died within 1 year. 
      The risk for death while on the waiting list within 90 days increased from 1.6%
      to 19% across the 10 risk groups. The survival benefit from HT increased
      progressively with higher risk for death without transplantation (p < 0.001 for
      trend), but there was no benefit in the first 6 risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: The
      risk for waiting list mortality varies considerably among HT candidates. Although
      the survival benefit of HT generally increases with increasing risk for waiting
      list mortality, there is no measurable benefit in many candidates at the lower
      end of the risk spectrum.

TI  - Recent advances in computational methodology for simulation of mechanical
      circulatory assist devices.
PG  - 169-88
LID - 10.1002/wsbm.1260 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide mechanical circulatory support to
      offload the work of one or both ventricles during heart failure. They are used in
      the clinical setting as destination therapy, as bridge to transplant, or more
      recently as bridge to recovery to allow for myocardial remodeling. Recent
      developments in computational simulation allow for detailed assessment of VAD
      hemodynamics for device design and optimization for both children and adults.
      Here, we provide a focused review of the recent literature on finite element
      methods and optimization for VAD simulations. As VAD designs typically fall into 
      two categories, pulsatile and continuous flow devices, we separately address
      computational challenges of both types of designs, and the interaction with the
      circulatory system with three representative case studies. In particular, we
      focus on recent advancements in finite element methodology that have increased
      the fidelity of VAD simulations. We outline key challenges, which extend to the
      incorporation of biological response such as thrombosis and hemolysis, as well as
      shape optimization methods and challenges in computational methodology.

      Circulatory Support.
PG  - 300-9
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000721 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe the characteristics and outcomes of peripartum
      cardiomyopathy (PPCMP) patients who received durable mechanical circulatory
      support and compared it with other etiologies of advanced heart failure. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: We analyzed 1258 women who were registered in Interagency Registry
      for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support between June 2006 and March 2012.
      Baseline characteristics, implant strategies, hemodynamics, echocardiographic
      data, and outcomes were compared. Ninety-nine women had PPCMP and 1159 had
      non-PPCMP as primary diagnosis. PPCMP women were younger (P<0.001), more likely
      to be blacks, and had less comorbidities than non-PPCMP patients. PPCMP women had
      better survival than non-PPCMP women (P=0.01) with a 2-year survival of 83%.
      Multivariable risk factor adjustment analysis showed that the improved survival
      was likely because of younger age and fewer comorbidities. At 36 months, a
      proportion of 48% PPCMP received heart transplantation. Recovery occurred at a
      frequency of 6% and 2% in the PPCMP and non-PPCMP groups (P=0.1). Adverse event
      rates were similar in PPCMP and non-PPCMP patients except for higher cardiac
      arrhythmias and respiratory failure in the non-PPCMP in the first 3 months post
      implant. CONCLUSIONS: PPCMP women who receive durable mechanical circulatory
      support have a better survival than women with non-PPCPM. The improved survival
      observed in PPCMP is likely related to their fewer comorbidities and younger age.
      Myocardial recovery was uncommon and less than half of women with end-stage PPCPM
      received heart transplantation after 3 years of mechanical support.

AB  - Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a good treatment option for the patients
      ineligible for cardiac transplantation. Several studies have demonstrated that a 
      ventricular assist device improves the quality of life and prognosis of the
      patients with end-stage heart failure. A 75-yr-old man debilitated with New York 
      Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV due to severe left ventricular
      systolic dysfunction received LVAD implantation as a destination therapy. The
      patient was discharged with improved functional status (NYHA functional class II)
      after appropriate cardiac rehabilitation and education about how to manage the
      device and potential emergency situations. This is the first case of successful
      continuous-flow LVAD implantation as a destination therapy in Korea.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for patients with
      advanced heart failure: analysis of the British NHS bridge to transplant (BTT)
      program.
PG  - 338-45
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.12.015 [doi]
LID - S0167-5273(13)02197-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous cost-effectiveness analysis showed that bridge to
      transplant (BTT) with early design left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for
      advanced heart failure was more expensive than medical management while appearing
      less beneficial. Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and third
      generation LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimate
      comparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flow
      LVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A
      semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHS costs data and patient
      data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database (BTDB). Quality-adjusted
      life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY were calculated for patients
      receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotrope supported medical
      management. LVADs cost pound80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices and delivered
      greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilistic incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95%CI:
      pound31,802- pound94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates 
      were sensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of
      receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the
      device cost by 15% decreased the ICER to pound50,106 ($79,533)/QALY. CONCLUSIONS:
      Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefits at higher
      costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK threshold of
      pound20,000 to pound30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now
      begins to approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently
      recommended by the British NHS. Cost-effectiveness estimates are hampered by the 
      lack of randomized trials.

TI  - Ventricular assist devices or inotropic agents in status 1A patients? Survival
      analysis of the United Network of Organ Sharing database.

LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.10.077 [doi]
LID - S0003-4975(13)02402-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved outcomes as well as lack of donor hearts have increased the 
      use of ventricular assist devices (VADs), rather than inotropic support, for
      bridging to transplantation. Recognizing that organ allocation in the highest
      status patients remains controversial, we sought to compare outcomes of patients 
      with VADs and those receiving advanced medical therapy. METHODS: The United
      Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to compare survival on the
      waiting list and posttransplantation survival in status 1A heart transplantation 
      patients receiving VADs or high-dose/dual inotropic therapy or an intraaortic
      balloon pump( IABP), or both. Adjusted survival was calculated using Cox's
      proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Adjusted 1-year posttransplantation mortality
      was higher among patients with VADs compared with patients receiving inotropic
      agents alone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; p<0.05). Survival remained better for
      patients receiving inotropic agents alone in the post-2008 era (HR, 1.36; p=0.03)
      and among those with isolated left-sided support (HR, 1.33; p=0.008). When
      patients who received IABPs were added and analyzed after 2008, the left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) group had similar survival (HR, 1.2; p=0.3).
      Survival on the waiting list, however, was superior among patients with LVADs
      (HR, 0.56; p<0.05). In a therapy transition analysis, failure of inotropic agents
      and the need for LVAD support was a consistent marker for significantly worse
      mortality (HR, 1.7; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although posttransplantation survival
      is better for patients who are bridged to transplantation with inotropic
      treatment only, the cost of failure of inotropic agents is significant, with a
      nearly doubled mortality for those who later require VAD support. Survival on the
      waiting list appears to be improved among patients receiving VAD support. Careful
      selection of the appropriate bridging strategy continues to be a significant
      clinical challenge.

      heart failure.
PG  - e000550
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.113.000550 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain and
      strain rate in determining prognosis in chronic heart failure is not well
      established. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 416 patients with chronic systolic heart
      failure, we performed speckle-tracking analyses of left ventricular longitudinal,
      circumferential, and radial strain and strain rate on archived echocardiography
      images (30 frames per second). Cox regression models were used to determine the
      associations between strain and strain rate and risk of all-cause mortality,
      cardiac transplantation, and ventricular-assist device placement. The area under 
      the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) was also calculated at 1 year and 5 years.
      Over a maximum follow-up of 8.9 years, there were 138 events (33.2%). In
      unadjusted models, all strain and strain rate parameters were associated with
      adverse outcomes (P<0.001). In multivariable models, all parameters with the
      exception of radial strain rate (P=0.11) remained independently associated, with 
      patients in the lowest tertile of strain or strain rate parameter having a
      approximately 2-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes compared with the
      reference group (P<0.05). Addition of strain to ejection fraction (EF) led to a
      significantly improved AUC at 1 year (0.697 versus 0.633, P=0.032) and 5 years
      (0.700 versus 0.638, P=0.001). In contrast, strain rate did not provide
      incremental prognostic value to EF alone. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal and
      circumferential strain and strain rate, and radial strain are associated with
      chronic heart failure prognosis. Strain provides incremental value to EF in the
      prediction of adverse outcomes, and with additional study may be a clinically
      relevant prognostic tool.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pump thrombosis in patients with left ventricular assist devices
      (LVADs) continues to present treatment challenges. Anti-coagulation strategies
      used to treat this complication are empiric and without firm data for guidance.
      The addition of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to intravenous
      anti-coagulation has been suggested by several case series and recent guidelines.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate our use of eptifibatide for the treatment
      of suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center
      cohort study was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The medical informatics
      system was queried to identify all LVAD patients who received eptifibatide for
      suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis from January 1, 2011, through April 30, 2013. 
      RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (16 HeartMate II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], 1
      HeartWare [HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA]) with 22 separate
      administration attempts received eptifibatide (dose range, 0.1-2 mug/kg/min) for 
      suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis presenting as one or more of the following
      findings: elevated lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, elevated plasma 
      free hemoglobin, LVAD dysfunction, or new, persistently high LVAD power. The mean
      time from device implantation to eptifibatide therapy was 47.34 days (range,
      3.88-397.67 days). Of the 22 attempts, 5 (22.7%) resulted in resolution of 1 or
      more patient-specific indicators of LVAD thrombus/thrombosis. Three patients
      (17.6%) had resolution of an indicator while also remaining free from continued
      hemolysis, death, pump exchange, or emergent heart transplant. Bleeding events
      were common, with 11 patients (64.7%) experiencing bleeding during the infusion. 
      Seven patients (41.2%) died, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage as the cause of
      death in 2 patients. Pump exchange was performed in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      limited experience indicates the risk of using eptifibatide outweighs the
      proposed benefit of salvaging the existing LVAD in the setting of suspected pump 
      thrombus/thrombosis at our institution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic and bleeding events in patients with a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) are still a major cause of complications.
      Therefore, the balance between anti-coagulant and pro-coagulant factors needs to 
      be tightly controlled. The principle hypothesis of this study is that different
      pump designs may have an effect on hemolysis and activation of the coagulation
      system. Referring to this, the HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA)
      and the HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) were
      investigated. METHODS: For 20 patients with LVAD support (n = 10 each), plasma
      coagulation, full blood count, and clinical chemistry parameters were measured.
      Platelet function was monitored using platelet aggregometry, platelet function
      analyzer-100 system ( Siemens, Marburg, Germany), vasodilator-stimulated
      phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay, immature platelet fraction,
      platelet-derived microparticles, and von Willebrand diagnostic. RESULTS: Acquired
      von Willebrand syndrome could be detected in all patients. Signs of hemolysis, as
      measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean, 470 U/liter HMII, 250 U/liter
      HVAD; p < 0.001), were more pronounced in the HMII patients. In contrast, D-dimer
      analysis indicated a significantly higher activation of the coagulation system in
      HVAD patients (mean, 0.94 mg/liter HMII, 2.01 mg/liter HVAD; p < 0.01). The
      efficacy of anti-platelet therapy using clopidogrel was not sufficient in more
      than 50% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the finding that all
      patients with rotary blood pumps suffered from von Willebrand syndrome. In
      addition, a distinct footprint of effects on hemolysis and the coagulation system
      can be attributed to different devices. As a consequence, the individual status
      of the coagulation system needs to be controlled in long-term patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemolysis is becoming increasingly recognized as a major complication
      of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. Data regarding risk factors,
      prevalence, and outcomes are limited. To better define the characteristics and
      prognosis of hemolysis, we present a retrospective case-control study of LVAD
      patients in our institution. METHODS: A detailed record review was conducted of
      18 patients supported with the HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA)
      who were diagnosed with hemolysis, and their data were compared with 82 patients 
      who received an LVAD implant during the same period who did not develop
      hemolysis. Patients were excluded if they did not survive hospitalization at the 
      time of LVAD implantation. The primary end points of this analysis were time to
      death and time to first hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 100 total patients, 18 HMII 
      patients (18%) were diagnosed with hemolysis. Those with hemolysis were younger, 
      had significantly higher lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels, lower
      international normalized ratio, and no difference in cannula velocities by
      transthoracic echocardiography. Patient survival in the hemolysis group was
      markedly decreased at 1 year (38.9% vs 89.3%, p < 0.001), but no differences in
      hospitalization (p = 0.57) were observed. Partial to complete thrombosis was
      noted in all of the pumps at explant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate
      that hemolysis is associated with high mortality, likely serving as a marker of
      pump thrombosis. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels are
      important indicators for hemolysis, and lower international normalized ratio may 
      pre-dispose for this worrisome condition. Diagnosis should prompt clinicians to
      consider pump exchange or explant, listing for transplantation, or intensifying
      anti-coagulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of elevated serum markers of hemolysis during 
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support has not been fully ascertained.
      METHODS: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum free hemoglobin (sfHg) values were
      tallied monthly in 182 patients on HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD
      support. Peak values for each marker were identified, and 2 hemolysis definitions
      were applied to the cohort: Hemolysis according to Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) criteria (sfHg > 40 mg/dl
      with signs/symptoms) and/or hemolysis defined by an LDH >/= 600 IU/liter
      (2.5-times the upper limit of laboratory normal). Kaplan-Meier survival free from
      death, urgent United Network of Organ Sharing 1A transplant for thrombosis,
      device exchange for thrombosis, and stroke/peripheral embolism was estimated, and
      Cox hazard ratios (HR) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated.
      Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for predicting
      1-year event-free survival were calculated. RESULTS: Hemolysis occurred in 32
      patients (18%) by INTERMACS criteria and in 68 (37%) patients by LDH criteria.
      Over a median (25(th), 75(th)) support of 427 days (245, 793 days), there were 78
      events. One year event-free survival after the onset of INTERMACS-defined
      hemolysis was 16% +/- 8.3% compared with 85% +/- 3.2% in non-hemolyzers (HR,
      14.7; 95% CI, 7.9-27; AUC 0.70 +/- 0.05; p < 0.001; ). One year event-free
      survival after the onset of LDH-defined hemolysis was 32% +/- 7.2% compared with 
      89% +/- 3.2% in those with persistent LDH values < 600 IU/liter (HR, 8.0; 95% CI,
      4.4-14; AUC 0.87 +/- 0.04; p < 0.001). Patients who met the LDH hemolysis
      definition had longer times from hemolysis onset to clinical events and larger
      magnitudes of risk for embolism and device exchange for thrombosis than those
      with INTERMACS hemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Serum hemolysis marker elevations are
      associated with increased events in LVAD patients. LDH monitoring provides an
      earlier diagnosis of adverse events than sfHg, supporting need for a new
      INTERMACS definition of VAD-associated hemolysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare left ventricular assist device (HVAD, HeartWare Inc,
      Framingham, MA) is the first implantable centrifugal continuous-flow pump
      approved for use as a bridge to transplantation. An infrequent but serious
      adverse event of LVAD support is thrombus ingestion or formation in the pump. In 
      this study, we analyze the incidence of pump thrombus, evaluate the comparative
      effectiveness of various treatment strategies, and examine factors pre-disposing 
      to the development of pump thrombus. METHODS: The analysis included 382 patients 
      who underwent implantation of the HVAD as part of the HeartWare Bridge to
      Transplant (BTT) and subsequent Continued Access Protocol (CAP) trial.
      Descriptive statistics and group comparisons were generated to analyze baseline
      characteristics, incidence of pump thrombus, and treatment outcomes. A
      multivariate analysis was performed to assess significant risk factors for
      developing pump thrombus. RESULTS: There were 34 pump thrombus events observed in
      31 patients (8.1% of the cohort) for a rate of 0.08 events per patient-year. The 
      incidence of pump thrombus did not differ between BTT and CAP. Medical management
      of pump thrombus was attempted in 30 cases, and was successful in 15 (50%). A
      total of 16 patients underwent pump exchange, and 2 underwent urgent
      transplantation. Five patients with a pump thrombus died after medical therapy
      failed, 4 of whom also underwent a pump exchange. Survival at 1 year in patients 
      with and without a pump thrombus was 69.4% and 85.5%, respectively (p = 0.21). A 
      multivariable analysis revealed that significant risk factors for pump thrombus
      included a mean arterial pressure > 90 mm Hg, aspirin dose </= 81 mg,
      international normalized ratio </= 2, and Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile level of >/= 3 at implant.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pump thrombus is a clinically important adverse event in patients
      receiving an HVAD, occurring at a rate of 0.08 events per patient-year.
      Significant risk factors for pump thrombosis include elevated blood pressure and 
      sub-optimal anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapies. This suggests that pump
      thrombus event rates could be reduced through careful adherence to patient
      management guidelines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pump thrombosis remains an uncommon but potentially catastrophic
      complication of durable continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). A
      perceived increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis in the HeartMate II (HMII)
      LVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) by clinicians prompted this analysis of the
      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)
      database. METHODS: Between 2006 and June 2013, 8,988 United States patients aged 
      older than 18 years received a durable LVAD. Of these, 6,910 adult patients from 
      132 institutions who received a HMII LVAD were entered in the INTERMACS database 
      and constitute the study group for this analysis. RESULTS: Overall survival (with
      censoring at transplant or explant for recovery) with the HMII LVAD was 80% at 1 
      year and 69% at 2 years and was not significantly different when stratified by
      era of implant. Freedom from device exchange or death due to thrombosis decreased
      from 99% at 6 months in 2009 to 94% in 2012 (p < 0.0001). Multivariable hazard
      function analysis showed risk factors for pump thrombosis included later implant 
      year (p < 0.0001), younger age (p < 0.0001), higher creatinine (p = 0.002),
      larger body mass index (p = 0.004), white race (p = 0.0004), left ventricular
      ejection fraction above 20% (p = 0.02), and higher lactate dehydrogenase level at
      1 month (p < 0.0001). Survival (p < 0.0001) and freedom from infection (p =
      0.008) and cerebrovascular accident (p < 0.0001) were lower after pump exchange
      than after primary implant. CONCLUSIONS: Pump exchange or death due to pump
      thrombosis increased during 2011 and 2012, but the magnitude of the increase
      remained relatively small. Survival remains high (80% at 1 year) with the HMII
      LVAD. Risk factor analysis suggests that a number of patient-related factors
      contribute to the risk of thrombosis. Markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase in 
      the first month is a predictor of pump thrombosis. This analysis could not
      examine the potential role of technical factors during implant, such as
      sub-optimal pump or graft positioning, changes in patient management paradigms
      with pump speed settings, improved recognition and change in the threshold for
      pump exchange, or design or production changes with the pump, as contributors to 
      the risk of pump thrombosis.

AB  - Durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have not only enhanced longevity 
      but also conferred sustained improvements in quality of life, symptom control,
      and functional capacity in patients with medically refractory advanced heart
      failure. Problems with device-related infection, bleeding, neurologic events,
      right-sided heart failure, and device malfunction have dominated the clinical
      care of patients living on mechanical support. Even as adoption of durable LVADs 
      accelerated globally, we began to encounter a growing dilemma of pump malfunction
      caused by thrombosis. In early 2011, clinicians began to notice a spike in the
      incidence of pump thrombosis with the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton,
      CA) LVAD. By 2012, the problem of thrombosis in LVADs began to consume most of
      the scientific direction as centers and collaborative groups began to dissect
      this nascent phenomenon. In this perspective, we describe the magnitude and
      implications of pump thrombosis, discuss secular and management trends in this
      unique population, attempt to dissect the problem at its root, offer guidance on 
      surveillance and therapeutic principles, and outline issues that deserve our
      immediate and collaborative attention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preexisting valve pathology is common in patients with end-stage
      heart failure undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. The
      indications and subsequent benefits of performing valvular procedures in these
      patients are unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of 
      performing concurrent surgical valve procedures in a large cohort of patients
      receiving LVADs. METHODS: One thousand one hundred six patients received the
      HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD in the bridge to transplant (n = 470) and destination
      therapy (n = 636) clinical trials. Of these, 374 patients (34%) had concurrent
      cardiac surgery procedures as follows: 242 patients (21%) with 281 concurrent
      valve procedures (VP) (aortic 80, mitral 45, and tricuspid 156), and 641 patients
      had only HMII LVAD. The focus of this study was to determine the clinical
      outcomes of patients undergoing HMII + VP compared with those who received HMII
      alone. RESULTS: Patients undergoing HMII + VP were significantly older, had
      higher blood urea nitrogen levels and central venous pressure, and decreased
      right ventricular stroke work index; intraoperatively, the median cardiopulmonary
      bypass times were also longer. The unadjusted 30-day mortality was significantly 
      higher in patients undergoing HMII + VP (10.3% vs 4.8% for LVAD alone, P = .005).
      Subgroup analysis of individual VPs showed that higher mortality occurred in
      patients with HMII plus 2 or more VPs (13.5%, P = .04) followed by trends for
      increased mortality with HMII plus mitral alone (11.5%, P = NS), HMII plus aortic
      alone (10.9%, P = NS), and HMII plus tricuspid (8.9%, P = NS) procedures. Of
      these various groups, only patients undergoing HMII + isolated aortic VP (P =
      .001) and HMII + multiple VPs (P = .046) had significantly worse long-term
      survival compared with patients undergoing HMII alone. Right heart failure and
      right ventricular assist device use was increased in patients undergoing VPs, but
      there was no difference in the incidence of bleeding or stroke. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients frequently require concurrent VPs at the time of LVAD placement; these
      patients are sicker and have higher early mortality. Furthermore, right
      ventricular dysfunction is increased in these patients. Further studies to
      develop selection criteria for concurrent valve interventions are important to
      further improve clinical outcomes.

AB  - Despite modern treatment modalities, cardiogenic shock is associated with a very 
      high risk of mortality and morbidity. The short- and long-term survival in
      patients with cardiogenic shock or end-stage heart failure has improved
      considerably by recent technological advances in short and long-term mechanical
      circulatory support devices. For short-term mechanical support, veno-arterial
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has been increasingly used as
      bridge-to-decision and bridge-to-recovery in cardiogenic shock patients.
      Long-term mechanical circulatory support devices such as left ventricular assist 
      devices (LVADs) are widely available and play a central role in
      bridge-to-transplantation in those eligible for heart transplantation (HTX) and
      as destination therapy (DT) in those not eligible for heart transplantation.
      Nevertheless, patients with critical cardiogenic shock show a deleterious outcome
      after LVAD-implantation or HTX with higher mortality, more complications and
      higher burden on financial resources. These considerations underscore the
      importance of optimal timing and appropriate patient selection for eventual LVAD 
      therapy. The current report will focus on the immediate management of patients
      with cardiogenic shock with inotropes, discuss the use of IABP and focus mainly
      on pivotal choices to be made in the period spanned by short term mechanical
      circulatory support in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock.

AB  - Recent outstanding clinical advances with new mechanical circulatory systems have
      led to additional strategies in the treatment of end-stage heart failure. Heart
      transplantation can be postponed and for certain patients even replaced by
      smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Mechanical support
      of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate haemodynamic stabilization and 
      recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in these severely ill patients.
      These new devices may be of great help to bridge patients until a suitable
      cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed as definitive treatment for
      patients who do not qualify for transplantation. Main indications for LVAD
      implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to transplantation or destination
      therapy. An LVAD may be an important tool for patients with an expected prolonged
      period on the waiting list, for instance those with blood group O or B, with high
      or low body weight and those with potentially reversible secondary organ failure 
      and pulmonary artery hypertension. However, LVAD implantation means an additional
      heart operation with inherent perioperative risks and complications during the
      waiting period. Finally, cardiac transplantation in patients with prior
      implantation of an LVAD represents a surgical challenge. The care of patients
      after the implantation of miniaturized LVADs, such as the HeartWare(R) system,
      seems to be easier than following pulsatile devices. The explantation of such
      devices at the time of transplantation is technically more comfortable than after
      HeartMate II implantation.

AB  - In heart failure mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be responsible for
      energy depletion and contractile dysfunction. The difficulties in procuring fresh
      left ventricular (LV) myocardium from humans for assessment of mitochondrial
      function have resulted in the reliance on surrogate markers of mitochondrial
      function and limited our understanding of cardiac energetics. We isolated
      mitochondria from fresh LV wall tissue of patients with heart failure and reduced
      systolic function undergoing heart transplant or left ventricular assist device
      placement, and compared their function to mitochondria isolated from the
      non-failing LV (NFLV) wall tissue with normal systolic function from patients
      with pulmonary hypertension undergoing heart-lung transplant. We performed
      detailed mitochondrial functional analyses using 4 substrates: glutamate-malate
      (GM), pyruvate-malate (PM) palmitoyl carnitine-malate (PC) and succinate. NFLV
      mitochondria showed preserved respiratory control ratios and electron chain
      integrity with only few differences for the 4 substrates. In contrast, HF
      mitochondria had greater respiration with GM, PM and PC substrates and higher
      electron chain capacity for PM than for PC. Surprisingly, HF mitochondria had
      greater respiratory control ratios and lower ADP-independent state 4 rates than
      NFLV mitochondria for GM, PM and PC substrates demonstrating that HF mitochondria
      are capable of coupled respiration ex vivo. Gene expression studies revealed
      decreased expression of key genes in pathways for oxidation of both fatty acids
      and glucose. Our results suggest that mitochondria from the failing LV myocardium
      are capable of tightly coupled respiration when isolated and supplied with ample 
      substrates. Thus energy starvation in the failing heart may be the result of
      dysregulation of metabolic pathways, impaired substrate supply or reduced
      mitochondrial number but not the result of reduced mitochondrial electron
      transport capacity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Published data on mechanical circulatory support for elderly patients
      in continuous flow devices are sparse and suggest relatively poor survival. This 
      study investigated whether LVADs can be implanted in selected patients over the
      age of 65 years with acceptable survival compared with published outcomes.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted in 64
      consecutive patients >/=65 years of age implanted with a continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) as either bridge to transplantation or
      destination therapy from August 2005 to January 2012. Baseline laboratory and
      hemodynamic characteristics and follow-up data were obtained. Median survival was
      1,090 days. Survival was 85%, 74%, 55%, and 45% at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3
      years, respectively. Our cohort had a baseline mean Seattle Heart Failure Model
      (SHFM) score of 2.6 +/- 0.9. Observed survival was significantly better than
      SHFM-predicted medical survival. Stratification by age subsets, renal function,
      SHFM, implantation intention, or etiology did not reveal significant differences 
      in survival. The most common cause of death was sepsis and nonlethalcomplication 
      was bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with patients over the age of 65
      receiving CF-LVADs suggests that this group demonstrates excellent survival.
      Further research is needed to discern the specific criteria for risk
      stratification for LVAD support in the elderly.

AB  - Despite its many anatomic modifications, Fontan failure remains prevalent in
      adult patients living with single-ventricle physiology. Although the Fontan
      operation has created a generation of survivors of complex single-ventricle
      disease, recognition of the limitation of this circulation is increasing. Most
      commonly, survivors suffer from ventricular dysfunction, protein-losing
      enteropathy, plastic bronchitis and arrhythmias. Although several medical
      therapies exist to palliate these long-term complications, surgical treatments
      are becoming increasingly useful, including the introduction of mechanical
      devices and cardiac transplantation. Currently, there are a variety of options
      available for mechanical support of the failing Fontan. Further developments in
      mechanical support technology will be required to tailor-make specific devices
      for this unique population. Owing to the fact that availability of donor hearts
      for transplantation is limited, mechanical support will play an increasingly
      important role in the management of complications of the Fontan circulation.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are fast becoming standard of care for
      patients with advanced heart failure. However, despite continuous improvement in 
      VAD technology, there remains a significant early postoperative morbidity and
      mortality in this extreme patient group. The aim of the current study was to
      explore the short-term outcomes and predictors for 90 day mortality in the
      patients after implantation of continuous-flow LVAD. Perioperative clinical,
      echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and laboratory data of 90 day survivors and
      nonsurvivors were collected and compared retrospectively. Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis was performed on univariate predictors for 90 day mortality
      with an entry criterion of p < 0.1. Between July 2006 and May 2012, 117 patients 
      underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD as a bridge to transplantation: 
      71 (60.7%) HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) and 46 (39.3%) HVAD
      (HeartWare International, Framingham, MA). All-cause 90 day mortality was 17.1%. 
      Multivariate analysis revealed higher preoperative central venous pressure (odds 
      ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.014-1.378; p = 0.033) and
      higher age (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38; p = 0.045) as the only independent
      predictors for 90 day mortality. Optimization of preoperative volume status,
      preload, and right heart function as well as age-based selection of candidates
      for LVAD support are the critical factors influencing early outcome after
      continuous-flow LVAD implantation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to review contemporary studies that utilized
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in the treatment of heart failure and to
      elaborate on prospective mechanical alternatives. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a
      growing need for a well-tolerated, durable and effective MCS option in patients
      with refractory heart failure. In previous years, the primary indication for MCS 
      therapy supported bridge to transplantation. These early left ventricular assist 
      devices (LVADs) suffered significant adverse events, thereby limiting their
      prolonged use. With the introduction of newer continuous flow LVADs, with lower
      morbidity, neurological events, pump failure and the expanded indication use
      (i.e. destination therapy), the overall number of implanted patients has grown.
      SUMMARY: There has been a dramatic advancement of durability found in the second 
      and third-generation, continuous flow LVADs, along with improved survival rates
      in patients receiving these devices for destination therapy. MCS may soon become 
      the treatment option of choice in refractory heart failure patients, especially
      with further evolution of less invasive approaches, smaller designs, and energy
      sources.

TI  - Use of left ventricular assist device (HeartMate II): a Singapore experience.
PG  - 543-8
LID - 10.1111/aor.12247 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in medical and device therapies in heart failure have improved
      the survival of patients with heart failure. However, due to the limited
      availability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)
      have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patients
      with refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with the
      HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as a
      bridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was a
      retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVAD
      implantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were 
      classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 
      (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-heart
      transplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 years
      old (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart
      disease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], and
      chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12
      patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwent
      HMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative 
      days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery
      (21.7%), mediastinal infection (21.7%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinal
      collection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0%), 
      and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3%). All patients were discharged
      from hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced driveline
      infections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to the
      following conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0%), gastrointestinal
      bleeding (13.0%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0%), transient ischemic attack
      (8.7%), arrhythmia (8.7%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aortic
      regurgitation (8.7%), right ventricular failure (4.3%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3%),
      and hematuria (4.3%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally New
      York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three 
      patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient was
      successfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were two
      mortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was
      522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to be
      effective in our Asian population. Driveline infection rate remains low even in
      the tropical hot, humid climate in Singapore. With more patients ending up on
      extended periods of LVAD support, increased emphasis in the detection and
      management of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will be
      needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive techniques are desirable to minimize surgical
      trauma during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. This is
      particularly challenging for full-flow support. In this study, a minimally
      invasive implantation technique was developed for a microaxial rotary pump. The
      system was evaluated in a chronic sheep model. METHODS: A HeartWare MVAD
      (HeartWare, Miami Lakes, FL) pump (length, 50 mm; diameter, 21 mm; maximum flow, 
      7-8 liters/min) was combined with a novel inflow cannula, including a new
      flow-optimized tip. The device was implanted into sheep (range, 60-80 kg, mean,
      71.6 +/- 6.8 kg) through a right-sided minithoracotomy. The inflow cannula was
      inserted through the superior pulmonary vein, passing through the left atrium
      into the left ventricle. Scheduled implant period was 30 days for 8 sheep and 100
      days for 3 sheep. Mean support flow was set to half of the nominal cardiac
      output. RESULTS: Six of 8 sheep finished the scheduled 30-day investigation
      period (one failed due to early non-pump-related post-operative bleeding and one 
      due to prototype controller failure). The 3 sheep scheduled for 100 days reached 
      the study end point. Peak pump flows of up to 6.9 liters/min were achieved. At
      necropsy, no signs of mitral valve lesions or thrombus formation around the
      cannula, the tip, or the insertion site were observed, except for valve leaflet
      erosion in 1 animal, where the cannula had been entangled in the sub-valvular
      chords due to lack of ultrasound monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive 
      implantation technique using the HeartWare MVAD pump, together with a new
      cannula, provided excellent results in a chronic animal model.

TI  - IL-33/ST2 pathway and classical cytokines in end-stage heart failure patients
      submitted to left ventricular assist device support: a paradoxic role for
      inflammatory mediators?
PG  - 498703
LID - 10.1155/2013/498703 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a critical process contributing to heart failure
      (HF). We hypothesized that IL-33/ST2 pathway, a new mechanism regulated during
      cardiac stress, may be involved in the functional worsening of end-stage HF
      patients, candidates for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and 
      potentially responsible for their outcome. METHODS: IL-33, ST2, and conventional 
      cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) were determined in cardiac biopsies and
      plasma of 22 patients submitted to LVAD implantation (pre-LVAD) and compared with
      (1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at the moment of heart 
      transplantation without prior circulatory support (HT); (2) patients supported by
      LVAD at the moment of LVAD weaning (post-LVAD). RESULTS: Cardiac expression of
      ST2/IL-33 and cytokines was lower in the pre-LVAD than in the HT group. LVAD
      determined an increase of inflammatory mediators comparable to levels of the HT
      group. Only ST2 correlated with outcome indices after LVAD implantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: IL-33/ST2 and traditional cytokines were involved in decline of
      cardiac function of ESHF patients as well as in hemodynamic recovery induced by
      LVAD. IL-33/ST2 pathway was also associated to severity of clinical course. Thus,
      a better understanding of inflammation is the key to achieving more favorable
      outcome by new specific therapies.

AB  - Although acute pulmonary injury after cardiopulmonary bypass has been detailed in
      the literature, it was seldom mentioned in the context of following implantation 
      of a ventricular assist device. We report on a 65-year-old male with end-stage
      ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent implantation of Levitronix CentriMag
      (Levitronix, Waltham, MA) for cardiac support and was listed for heart
      transplantation. Acute pulmonary injury with profound hypoxaemia was noted 6 h
      after the implantation. Despite optimal medical treatment and maximal ventilator 
      support, refractory hypoxaemia persisted, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (oxygenator: Affinity-NT; centrifugal pump: BPX-80 Bio-Pump,
      Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was applied for ventilation support. The patient
      was weaned from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 4 days later and from the
      ventilator on the next 2 days. He underwent a successful orthotopic heart
      transplant after a total of 77 days on Levitronix left ventricular device cardiac
      support.

AB  - The number of heart transplants performed annually continues to increase
      gradually, and the number of adult candidates on the waiting list increased by
      25% from 2004 to 2012. The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates
      peaked at 149 per 100 wait-list years in 2007 and has been declining since; in
      2012, the rate was 93 heart transplants per 100 active wait-list years. Increased
      waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase in
      wait-list mortality. Since 2007, the proportion of patients on life support
      before transplant increased from 48.6% to 62.7% in 2012. Medical urgency
      categories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgency
      categories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list 
      each year; the number of transplants performed each year increased from 274 in
      1998 to 372 in 2012. Graft survival in pediatric recipients continues to improve;
      5-year graft survival for transplants performed in 2007 was 78.5%. Medicare paid 
      for some or all of the care for nearly 40% of heart transplant recipients in
      2010. Heart transplant appears to be more expensive than ventricular assist
      devices for managing end-stage heart failure, but is more effective and likely
      more cost-effective.

      validation.
PG  - E46-56
LID - 10.1111/aor.12221 [doi]
AB  - The application of rotary left ventricular (LV) assist devices (LVADs) is
      expanding from bridge to transplant, to destination and bridge to recovery
      therapy. Conventional constant speed LVAD controllers do not regulate flow
      according to preload, and can cause over/underpumping, leading to harmful
      ventricular suction or pulmonary edema, respectively. We implemented a novel
      adaptive controller which maintains a linear relationship between mean flow and
      flow pulsatility to imitate native Starling-like flow regulation which requires
      only the measurement of VAD flow. In vitro controller evaluation was conducted
      and the flow sensitivity was compared during simulations of postural change,
      pulmonary hypertension, and the transition from sleep to wake. The Starling-like 
      controller's flow sensitivity to preload was measured as 0.39 L/min/mm Hg, 10
      times greater than constant speed control (0.04 L/min/mm Hg). Constant speed
      control induced LV suction after sudden simulated pulmonary hypertension, whereas
      Starling-like control reduced mean flow from 4.14 to 3.58 L/min, maintaining safe
      support. From simulated sleep to wake, Starling-like control increased flow 2.93 
      to 4.11 L/min as a response to the increased residual LV pulsatility. The
      proposed controller has the potential to better match device outflow to patient
      demand in comparison with conventional constant speed control.

TI  - Can the temporary use of right ventricular assist devices bridge patients with
      acute right ventricular failure after cardiac surgery to recovery?
PG  - 499-510
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt472 [doi]
AB  - A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured
      protocol. The question addressed was: Can the temporary use of right ventricular 
      assist devices (RVADs) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute right
      ventricular failure after cardiac surgery? More than 183 papers were found using 
      the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer the
      clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient
      group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are
      tabulated. Indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass 
      surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assist
      device insertion. Significant reductions in central venous pressure (P = 0.005)
      and mean pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.01) were reported during and after
      RVAD support. Furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (P <
      0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05), right ventricular stroke
      work (P < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (P < 0.05) were also
      seen. Assessment by one study showed that on Day 7 after RVAD removal, the right 
      ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40%. Dynamic
      echocardiography studies performed before, during and after RVAD placement
      demonstrated that after RVAD implantation, right ventricular end-diastolic
      dimensions (P < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (P < 0.05) and right 
      ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) increased. Although several studies
      successfully weaned patients from an RVAD, there were several complications,
      including bleeding requiring surgical intervention. However, this may be reduced 
      by using percutaneous implantation (bleeding incidence: 4 of 9 patients) rather
      than by a surgically implanted RVAD (bleeding incidence: 5 of 5 patients).
      However, mortality is higher in percutaneous RVAD patients rather than in
      surgical RVAD (80-44%) patients. Causes of death cited for patients on an RVAD
      included multiorgan failure, sepsis, thromboembolic events, reoccurring right
      heart failure and failure to wean due to persistent right ventricular failure. We
      conclude that RVADs have been successfully used to bridge patients to recovery
      after cardiac surgery; however, RVADs carry numerous risks and a high mortality
      rate.

TI  - Treatment with higher dosages of heart failure medication is associated with
      improved outcome following cardiac resynchronization therapy.
PG  - 1051-60
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht514 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is associated with improved
      morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) on optimal
      medical therapy. The impact of CHF medication optimization following CRT,
      however, has never been comprehensively evaluated. In the current study, we
      therefore investigated the effect of CHF medication dosage on morbidity and
      mortality in CHF patients after CRT implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chronic
      heart failure medication was assessed in 185 patients after CRT implantation.
      During an overall mean follow-up of 44.6 months, 83 patients experienced a
      primary endpoint (death, heart transplantation, assist device implantation, or
      hospitalization for CHF). Treatment with higher dosages of angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (P = 0.001) and 
      beta-blockers (P < 0.001) as well as with lower dosages of loop diuretics (P <
      0.001) was associated with a reduced risk for the primary combined endpoint as
      well as for all-cause mortality. Echocardiographic super-responders to CRT were
      treated with higher average dosages of ACE-I/ARBs (68.1 vs. 52.4%, P < 0.01) and 
      beta-blockers (59 vs. 42.2%, P < 0.01). During follow-up, the average dosage of
      loop diuretics was decreased by 20% in super-responders, but increased by 30% in 
      non-super-responders (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of higher dosages of
      neurohormonal blockers and lower dosages of diuretics is associated with reduced 
      morbidity and mortality following CRT implantation. Our data imply a beneficial
      effect of increasing neurohormonal blockade whenever possible following CRT
      implantation.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in the pediatric heart failure population
      has a limited history especially for infants, and neonates. It has been
      increasingly recognized that there is a rapidly expanding population of children 
      diagnosed and living with heart failure. This expanding population has resulted
      in increasing numbers of children with medically resistant end-stage heart
      failure. The traditional therapy for these children has been heart
      transplantation. However, children with heart failure unlike adults do not have
      symptoms until they present with end-stage heart failure and therefore, cannot
      safely wait for transplantation. Many of these children were bridged to heart
      transplantation utilizing extracorporeal membranous oxygenation as a bridge to
      transplant which has yielded poor results. As such, industry, clinicians, and the
      government have refocused interest in developing increasing numbers of MCS
      options for children living with heart failure as a bridge to transplantation and
      as a chronic therapy. In this review, we discuss MCS options for short and
      long-term support that are currently available for infants and children with
      end-stage heart failure.

TI  - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with HeartMate II left ventricular
      assist devices.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With an expanding population of patients requiring ventricular
      assist devices, it is inevitable that these patients will require noncardiac
      surgery. Ventricular assist devices provide mechanical support for a failing
      heart either as a bridge to transplant or now as a long-term support if
      transplant is not available, so-called destination therapy. These devices can add
      significant technical challenges to abdominal surgery, in that the power supply
      and drivelines crossing the abdomen can potentially be damaged. The use of
      preoperative or intraoperative imaging may aid in locating these devices and
      increase patient safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy in two patients supported with HeartMate((R)) II (Thoratec Corp.,
      Pleasanton, CA) left ventricular assist devices. Our use of fluoroscopic guidance
      in port placement is also described. A literature review was performed to assess 
      the frequency of laparoscopic procedures performed on patients with similar
      ventricular assist devices and of complications associated with the device and
      other comorbidities. RESULTS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed without 
      significant intraoperative hemodynamic changes. The use of imaging, such as
      fluoroscopy, can identify the location of the ventricular assist device and its
      associated drive wires to assure they are not damaged intraoperatively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely on patients
      with ventricular assist devices. Complications due to damage to the device can be
      avoided with the assistance of fluoroscopy to identify the implanted abdominal
      portions of the ventricular assist device. Each laparoscopic procedure performed 
      on these patients presents the surgeon with unique obstacles in which careful
      operative planning and intraoperative monitoring are essential.

PG  - E129-38

AB  - Mammalian skeletal muscle can remodel, repair, and regenerate itself by
      mobilizing satellite cells, a resident population of myogenic progenitor cells.
      Muscle injury and subsequent activation of myogenic progenitor cells is
      associated with oxidative stress. Cytoglobin is a hemoprotein expressed in
      response to oxidative stress in a variety of tissues, including striated muscle. 
      In this study, we demonstrate that cytoglobin is up-regulated in activated
      myogenic progenitor cells, where it localizes to the nucleus and contributes to
      cell viability. siRNA-mediated depletion of cytoglobin from C2C12 myoblasts
      increased levels of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death both at
      baseline and in response to stress stimuli. Conversely, overexpression of
      cytoglobin reduced reactive oxygen species levels, caspase activity, and cell
      death. Mice in which cytoglobin was knocked out specifically in skeletal muscle
      were generated to examine the role of cytoglobin in vivo. Myogenic progenitor
      cells isolated from these mice were severely deficient in their ability to form
      myotubes as compared with myogenic progenitor cells from wild-type littermates.
      Consistent with this finding, the capacity for muscle regeneration was severely
      impaired in mice deficient for skeletal-muscle cytoglobin. Collectively, these
      data demonstrate that cytoglobin serves an important role in muscle repair and
      regeneration.

AB  - Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type of the heart failure which can be 
      characterized by impaired ventricular contractility. Mechanical circulatory
      support devices were introduced into practice for the heart failure patients to
      bridge the time between the decision to transplant and the actual transplantation
      which is not sufficient due to the state of donor organ supply. In this study,
      the hemodynamic response of a cardiovascular system that includes a dilated
      cardiomyopathic heart under support of a newly developed continuous flow left
      ventricular assist device--Heart Turcica Axial--was evaluated employing computer 
      simulations. For the evaluation, a numerical model which describes the
      pressure-flow rate relations of Heart Turcica Axial, a cardiovascular system
      model describing the healthy and pathological hemodynamics, and a baroreflex
      model regulating the heart rate were used. Heart Turcica Axial was operated
      between 8000 rpm and 11,000 rpm speeds with 1000 rpm increments for assessing the
      pump performance and response of the cardiovascular system. The results also give
      an insight about the range of the possible operating speeds of Heart Turcica
      Axial in a clinical application. Based on the findings, operating speed of Heart 
      Turcica Axial should be between 10,000 rpm and 11,000 rpm.

      single-institute report from Japan.
PG  - 887-91
LID - 10.5301/ijao.5000263 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Numerous difficulties remain associated with pediatric heart
      transplantation. Therefore, the development of a ventricular assist device (VAD) 
      specific to these cases is extremely important for therapeutic effectiveness. We 
      present 5 cases of severe heart failure that were managed by ventricular assist
      device implantation, as a bridge to transplantation. METHODS: We examined the
      clinical course of 5 patients (4 boys, 1 girl; mean age, 10.6 +/- 1.5 years;
      range, 8-12 years) who underwent implantation of a pneumatic extracorporeal
      ventricular assist device between February 2004 and May 2009. Four patients had
      dilated cardiomyopathy and one had corrected transposition of the great arteries.
      RESULTS: The mean period between onset of heart failure and ventricular assist
      device implantation was 594 +/- 750 days (range, 94-1702 days), and the mean
      duration of ventricular assist support was 112 +/- 98 days (range, 44-284 days). 
      Four patients underwent heart transplantation overseas and one died of cerebral
      hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Careful management of pediatric VAD patients and
      development of a device designed specifically for pediatric patients are
      essential for improving clinical outcomes in the future.

TI  - Investigation of hemodynamics in the assisted isolated porcine heart.
PG  - 878-86
LID - 10.5301/ijao.5000257 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the interaction between rotary blood pumps (RBP) and the
      heart is investigated in silico, in vitro, and in animal models. Isolated and
      defined changes in hemodynamic parameters are unattainable in animal models,
      while the heart-pump interaction in its whole complexity cannot be modeled in
      vitro or in silico. AIM: The aim of this work was to develop an isolated heart
      setup to provide a realistic heart-pump interface with the possibility of easily 
      adjusting hemodynamic parameters. METHODS: A mock circuit mimicking the systemic 
      circulation was developed. Eight porcine hearts were harvested using a protocol
      similar to heart transplantation. Then, the hearts were resuscitated using
      Langendorff perfusion with rewarmed, oxygenated blood. An RBP was implanted and
      the setup was switched to the "working mode" with the left heart and the RBP
      working as under physiologic conditions. Both the unassisted and assisted
      hemodynamics were monitored. RESULTS: In the unassisted condition, cardiac output
      was up to 9.5 l/min and dP/dtmax ranged from 521 to 3621 mmHg/s at a preload of
      15 mmHg and afterload of 70 mmHg. With the RBP turned on, hemodynamics similar to
      heart-failure patients were observed in each heart. Mean pump flow and flow
      pulsatility ranged from 0 to 11 l/min. We were able to reproduce conditions with 
      an open and closed aortic valve as well as suction events. CONCLUSIONS: An
      isolated heart setup including an RBP was developed, which combines the
      advantages of in silico/vitro methods and animal experiments. This tool thus
      provides further insight into the interaction between the heart and an RBP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite chronic systemic anticoagulation, advanced heart failure
      patients treated with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      remain at risk for pump thrombosis. Pump thrombosis may initially be suspected in
      the setting of clinical and biochemical evidence for intravascular hemolysis,
      putatively related to shear stress on red blood cells propelled through a
      partially occluded pump. Limited data exist to guide management in these
      patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a series of 8 LVAD patients who
      presented with intravascular hemolysis secondary to pump thrombosis who were
      treated with intraventricular thrombolytic therapy. In 3 patients, thrombolytic
      therapy led to complete and lasting resolution of hemolysis, suggesting
      successful dissolution of pump thrombus. In the remaining 5 patients,
      thrombolytic therapy ultimately failed to halt or reverse pump thrombosis and
      hemolysis: 1 patient required emergent pump exchange, 2 patients progressed to
      cardiogenic shock and died, 1 patient suffered a debilitating stroke after which 
      care was withdrawn, and 1 patient underwent cardiac transplantation. CONCLUSIONS:
      In the setting of LVAD thrombosis, thrombolytic therapy is an alternate treatment
      strategy in a subset of patients. Candidacy for this alternate procedure must
      carefully weigh the risks of complications, including hemorrhage and
      thromboembolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The severity of pre-implantation heart failure may affect
      post-implantation health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The purpose of our
      study was to examine differences in HRQOL from before mechanical circulatory
      support (MCS) through 1 year after surgery by Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) patient profiles. METHODS: 
      Data from 1,559 adults with advanced heart failure who received primary
      continuous-flow pumps between June 23, 2006, and March 31, 2010, and were
      enrolled in INTERMACS were analyzed. HRQOL data were collected using the EQ-5D-3L
      survey before implantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation.
      Statistical analyses included chi-square and t-tests, using all available data
      for each time period. Paired t-tests and sensitivity analyses were also
      conducted. RESULTS: HRQOL was poor before MCS implantation among patients with
      INTERMACS profiles 1 to 7 and significantly improved after MCS implantation for
      all profiles. Stratified by INTERMACS profile, problems within each of the 5
      dimensions of HRQOL (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and
      anxiety/depression) generally decreased from before to after implantation. By 6
      months after implantation, patients with all INTERMACS profiles reported similar 
      frequencies of problems for all HRQOL dimensions. Paired t-tests and sensitivity 
      analyses supported almost all of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is poor among
      advanced heart failure patients with INTERMACS profiles 1 to 7 before MCS
      implantation and improves to similar levels for patients who remained on MCS 1
      year after surgery. Patients have problems in HRQOL dimensions before and after
      MCS; however, the frequency of reporting problems decreases for all dimensions
      within most profiles across time.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence and severity of right ventricular
      dysfunction (RVD) in pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) recipients and to 
      identify the preoperative characteristics associated with RVD and their effect on
      outcomes. METHODS: Children bridged to transplantation from 2004 to 2011 were
      included. RVD was defined as the use of a left VAD (LVAD) with an elevated
      central venous pressure of >16 mm Hg with inotropic therapy and/or inhaled nitric
      oxide for >96 hours or biventricular assist (BiVAD). RESULTS: A total of 57
      children (median age, 2.97 years; range 35 days to 15.8 years) were supported. Of
      the 57, 43 (75%) had an LVAD, and of those, 10 developed RVD. The remaining 14
      (25%) required BiVAD. Thus, RVD occurred in 24 of 57 patients (42%). Preoperative
      variables such as younger age (P = .01), use of extracorporeal mechanical support
      (P = .006), and elevated urea (P = .03), creatinine (P = .02), and bilirubin (P =
      .001) were associated with RVD. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated
      that elevated urea and extracorporeal mechanical support (odds ratio, 26.4; 95%
      confidence interval, 2.3-307.3; and odds ratio, 27.8; 95% confidence interval,
      2.5-312.3, respectively) were risk factors for BiVAD. The patients who developed 
      RVD on LVAD had a complicated postoperative course but excellent survival (100%),
      comparable to those with preserved right ventricular function (91%). The survival
      for those requiring BiVAD was reduced (71%). CONCLUSIONS: RVD occurred in
      approximately 40% of pediatric VAD recipients and affects their peri-implantation
      morbidity and bridging outcomes. Preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      and elevated urea were risk factors for BiVAD. Additional studies of the
      management of RVD in children after VAD implantation are warranted.

LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.3007328 [doi]
AB  - Morbidity and mortality from heart failure (HF) are high, and current risk
      stratification approaches for predicting HF progression are imperfect. Adenosine 
      triphosphate (ATP) is required for normal cardiac contraction, and abnormalities 
      in creatine kinase (CK) energy metabolism, the primary myocardial energy reserve 
      reaction, have been observed in experimental and clinical HF. However, the
      prognostic value of abnormalities in ATP production rates through CK in human HF 
      has not been investigated. Fifty-eight HF patients with nonischemic
      cardiomyopathy underwent (3)(1)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to
      quantify cardiac high-energy phosphates and the rate of ATP synthesis through CK 
      (CK flux) and were prospectively followed for a median of 4.7 years.
      Multiple-event analysis (MEA) was performed for HF-related events including
      all-cause and cardiac death, HF hospitalization, cardiac transplantation, and
      ventricular-assist device placement. Among baseline demographic, clinical, and
      metabolic parameters, MEA identified four independent predictors of HF events:
      New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF), African-American race, and CK flux. Reduced myocardial CK flux was a
      significant predictor of HF outcomes, even after correction for NYHA class, LVEF,
      and race. For each increase in CK flux of 1 mumol g(-)(1) s(-)(1), risk of
      HF-related composite outcomes decreased by 32 to 39%. These findings suggest that
      reduced CK flux may be a potential HF treatment target. Newer imaging strategies,
      including noninvasive (3)(1)P MRS that detect altered ATP kinetics, could thus
      complement risk stratification in HF and add value in conditions involving other 
      tissues with high energy demands, including skeletal muscle and brain.

TI  - Thromboresistance comparison of the HeartMate II ventricular assist device with
      the device thrombogenicity emulation- optimized HeartAssist 5 VAD.
PG  - 021014
AB  - Approximately 7.5 x 106 patients in the US currently suffer from end-stage heart 
      failure. The FDA has recently approved the designations of the Thoratec HeartMate
      II ventricular assist device (VAD) for both bridge-to-transplant and destination 
      therapy (DT) due to its mechanical durability and improved hemodynamics. However,
      incidence of pump thrombosis and thromboembolic events remains high, and the
      life-long complex pharmacological regimens are mandatory in its VAD recipients.
      We have previously successfully applied our device thrombogenicity emulation
      (DTE) methodology for optimizing device thromboresistance to the Micromed Debakey
      VAD, and demonstrated that optimizing device features implicated in exposing
      blood to elevated shear stresses and exposure times significantly reduces
      shear-induced platelet activation and significantly improves the device
      thromboresistance. In the present study, we compared the thrombogenicity of the
      FDA-approved HeartMate II VAD with the DTE-optimized Debakey VAD (now labeled
      HeartAssist 5). With quantitative probability density functions of the stress
      accumulation along large number of platelet trajectories within each device which
      were extracted from numerical flow simulations in each device, and through
      measurements of platelet activation rates in recirculation flow loops, we
      specifically show that: (a) Platelets flowing through the HeartAssist 5 are
      exposed to significantly lower stress accumulation that lead to platelet
      activation than the HeartMate II, especially at the impeller-shroud gap regions
      (b) Thrombus formation patterns observed in the HeartMate II are absent in the
      HeartAssist 5 (c) Platelet activation rates (PAR) measured in vitro with the VADs
      mounted in recirculation flow-loops show a 2.5-fold significantly higher PAR
      value for the HeartMate II. This head to head thrombogenic performance
      comparative study of the two VADs, one optimized with the DTE methodology and one
      FDA-approved, demonstrates the efficacy of the DTE methodology for drastically
      reducing the device thrombogenic potential, validating the need for a robust in
      silico/in vitro optimization methodology for improving cardiovascular devices
      thromboresistance.

TI  - Percutaneous extracorporeal life support for patients in therapy refractory
      cardiogenic shock: initial results of an interdisciplinary team.
PG  - 283-91
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt505 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Therapy refractory cardiogenic shock is associated with dismal
      outcome. Percutaneous implantation of an extracorporeal life support (ECLS)
      system achieves immediate cardiopulmonary stabilization, sufficient end-organ
      perfusion and reduction of subsequent multiorgan failure (MOF). METHODS:
      Forty-one patients undergoing percutaneous ECLS implantation for cardiogenic
      shock from February 2012 until August 2013 were retrospectively analysed. Mean
      age was 52 +/- 13 years, 6 (15%) were female. Mean pH values obtained before ECLS
      implantation were 7.15 +/- 0.24, mean lactate concentration was 11.7 +/- 6.4
      mmol/l. Levels obtained 6 h after ECLS implantation were 7.30 +/- 0.14 and 8.7
      +/- 5.0 mmol/l, respectively. In 23 patients (56%) cardiogenic shock resulted
      from an acute coronary syndrome in 13 (32%) from cardiomyopathy, in 5 (12%) from 
      other causes. Twenty-seven (66%) had been resuscitated, in 14 (34%) implantation 
      was performed under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Of note, 97% of 
      the acute coronary syndrome patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) either before ECLS implantation or under ECLS support. Extracorporeal life 
      support implantation was performed on scene (Emergency Department, Cath Lab,
      Intensive Care Unit) by a senior cardiac surgeon and a trained perfusionist, in 8
      cases (20%) in the referring hospital. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 51% [21 
      patients, due to MOF (n = 14), cerebral complications (n = 6) and heart failure
      (n = 1)]. Logistic regression analysis identified 6-h pH values as an independent
      risk factor of 30-day mortality (P < 0.001, OR = 0.000, 95% CI 0.000-0.042).
      Neither CPR nor implantation under ongoing CPR resulted in significant
      differences. In 26 cases (63%), the ECLS system could be explanted, after mean
      support of 169 +/- 67 h. Seven of these patients received cardiac surgery
      [ventricular assist device implantation (n = 4), heart transplantation (n = 1),
      other procedures (n = 2)]. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the evolution of transportable
      ECLS systems and percutaneous techniques implantation on scene is feasible.
      Extracorporeal life support may serve as a bridge-to-decision and
      bridge-to-treatment device. Neurological evaluation before ventricular assist
      device implantation and PCI under stable conditions are possible. Despite
      substantial mortality, ECLS implantation in selected patients by an experienced
      team offers additional support to conventional therapy as well as CPR and allows 
      survival in patients that otherwise most likely would have died. This concept has
      to be implemented in cardiac survival networks in the future.

TI  - Left ventricular assist device pump thrombosis: is there a role for glycoprotein 
      IIb/IIIa inhibitors?
PG  - 134-6
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000028 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) fill a critical need by providing
      circulatory support to patients with end-stage heart failure who are either
      ineligible for heart transplant or too ill to stably wait for an eventual donor
      organ. Furthermore, they are critical to the arsenal of the heart failure
      cardiologist, given the supply/demand mismatch for donor organs. Unfortunately,
      these devices present their own complications. Despite antiplatelet agents and
      systemic anticoagulation, a number of patients present with pump thrombosis, a
      life-threatening event requiring either pump exchange or treatment with systemic 
      thrombolytics. In an effort to avoid these morbid therapies, glycogen IIb/IIIa
      inhibitors, which have both antiplatelet and thrombolytic properties, have been
      proposed to treat pump thrombosis. We report here the largest case series using
      these agents and document a previously unreported high failure rate with this
      therapy.

TI  - Pre-operative risk factors of bleeding and stroke during left ventricular assist 
      device support: an analysis of more than 900 HeartMate II outpatients.
PG  - 880-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.08.1656 [doi]
LID - S0735-1097(13)06283-9 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the pre-operative risk factors related
      to late bleeding, stroke, and pump thrombosis in patients with HeartMate II
      (HMII) left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton,
      California) that might influence tailored improvements in patient management.
      BACKGROUND: Adverse events in LVAD patients remain high. It is unclear whether
      pre-operative characteristics influence the likelihood of the development of
      post-operative hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Knowing which patients
      are at greater risk might assist in tailoring anticoagulation therapy for certain
      patients. METHODS: Advanced heart failure patients (n = 956) discharged from the 
      hospital after LVAD implantation in the HMII bridge to transplantation (n = 405) 
      and destination therapy (n = 551) clinical trials were retrospectively evaluated.
      Bleeding requiring surgery or transfusion of >2 U of packed red blood cells,
      stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), and pump thrombosis were tracked from hospital
      discharge until patient outcome. RESULTS: Adverse event rates for post-discharge 
      bleeding (0.67 events/patient-year) were higher than those for hemorrhagic stroke
      (0.05), ischemic stroke (0.04), and pump thrombosis (0.03). The main sites of
      bleeding included gastrointestinal (45% of events), wound (12%), and epistaxis
      (4%). Older age (>65 years) (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.31), lower pre-operative
      hematocrit (</=31%) (HR: 1.31), ischemic etiology (HR: 1.35), and female (HR:
      1.45) were statistically significant multivariable risk factors for bleeding.
      Female (HR: 1.92) and 65 years of age and younger (HR: 1.94) were multivariable
      risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke, whereas female (HR: 1.84) and history of
      diabetes (HR: 1.99) were risk factors for ischemic stroke. Female (HR: 1.90) and 
      higher body mass index (HR: 1.71/10 kg/m(2) increase) were also multivariable
      risk factors for pump thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bleeding and
      thrombotic events during LVAD support differs by patient demographics, including 
      sex, age, body mass index, and etiology of heart failure. Further studies should 
      focus on the potential of tailored anticoagulation strategies in these subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) are
      increasingly used to support patients with advanced heart failure (HF). Device
      thrombosis is a serious complication of CF-LVADs, but its precise prevalence and 
      etiology remains uncertain. METHODS: Root-cause analysis was performed in all
      cases with device thrombosis confirmed upon explant among patients implanted with
      a HeartMate II (HM II) from January 1, 2009 to November 15, 2012. Cannula
      position and bend relief integrity were assessed and charts were reviewed with
      particular attention to anti-coagulation and infection profiles. RESULTS:
      Nineteen of 177 patients (11%) were found to have device thrombosis of various
      etiologies after a mean of 351 +/- 311 days, representing 0.12
      event/patient-year. Of the 5 mechanically induced thromboses, proximate etiology 
      was severely abnormal inflow cannula position in 3 patients and bend relief
      disconnect with deformed outflow graft in 2 patients. One patient had a
      hypercoagulable disorder with prior arterial embolism. In the remaining 13
      patients (age 61 +/- 14 years, 77% male, 69% Caucasian), "non-mechanical" device 
      thrombosis occurred after 357 +/- 383 days; INR at the time of diagnosis was 1.81
      (1.62 to 2.07); and mean device speed was 8,855 +/- 359 rpm. Five of 13 patients 
      (38%) had an infection during the month leading up to device thrombosis. Of note,
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was already elevated at the time of discharge in
      patients who would later develop non-mechanical device thrombosis (423 [354 to
      766] vs 352 [272 to 373] U/liter, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Device thrombosis is a 
      multifactorial phenomenon, and differentiation of mechanical and non-mechanical
      causes is an essential step for individual diagnosis and treatment plans. Larger 
      studies excluding patients with obvious mechanical etiology are needed to
      investigate biologic and/or management-related risk factors for device
      thrombosis. Our findings suggest that LDH may be an early risk marker. Due to the
      difficulty in treating late-stage device thrombosis, we suggest early use of
      simple tests to rule out both causes of thrombosis, such as X-rays and closer LDH
      monitoring (bi-weekly).

AB  - Right heart failure is a critical complication in patients requiring mechanical
      ventricular support. However, it is often difficult to provide adequate right
      ventricular support in the acute phase. A 41-year-old woman diagnosed with
      dilated cardiomyopathy with severe right heart failure underwent implantation of 
      a paracorporeal pulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD, Nipro
      Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a MERA monopivot centrifugal pump (Senko Medical
      Instrument Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as a right ventricular assist
      device (RVAD). The patient developed ischemic enteritis 3 weeks after surgery,
      necessitating fasting and reversal of anticoagulation therapy. A target
      international normalized ratio of 1.5 was selected, and aspirin administration
      was discontinued. Following recovery without thromboembolic events, the patient
      failed the RVAD discontinuation test. Five weeks after surgery, the monopivot
      centrifugal pump was exchanged for a pulsatile pump. No thrombus was evident on
      the centrifugal pump. The patient was undergoing cardiac rehabilitation at the
      time of this writing and awaiting heart transplantation.

AB  - From humble beginnings in 1963 with a single desperately ill patient, mechanical 
      circulatory support has expanded exponentially to where it is a viable
      alternative for advanced heart failure patients. Some of these patients are
      awaiting transplant but others will have a mechanical heart pump as their
      ultimate treatment. The history of MCS devices is reviewed, along with the 4
      trials that define the modern era of circulatory support. The practical aspects
      of life with an MCS device are reviewed and common problems encountered with MCS 
      devices. Future trends including miniaturization and development of completely
      contained MCS systems are reviewed.

TI  - Four-variable risk model in men and women with heart failure.
PG  - 88-95
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification is an integral component of clinical decision
      making in heart failure (HF). Women with HF have unique characteristics compared 
      with men, and it is unknown whether common prognostic factors are equally useful 
      in both populations. We aimed to investigate whether sex-specific risk models are
      more accurate for risk prediction in patients with advanced HF. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Patients with advanced HF referred to University of California, Los
      Angeles (UCLA; n=2255), were stratified by sex into derivation (referred in
      2000-2007) and validation (referred in 2008-2011) cohorts. Cox regression
      analysis was used to ascertain key variables predictive of the primary end point 
      of death/urgent transplantation/ventricular assist device in the derivation
      cohorts and confirmed in the validation cohorts in men, women, and the total
      population. Women were younger, with higher ejection fraction and better
      event-free survival. Despite differences in baseline characteristics, the 4
      strongest predictors of outcome in both women and men, as well as in the total
      cohort, were B-type natriuretic peptide, peak oxygen consumption by
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (pkVO2), New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      classification, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin
      receptor blocker. In addition, the UCLA model performed better than the Seattle
      Heart Failure Model (SHFM) and the Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) in our
      cohort (c-indices of 0.791[UCLA] versus 0.758 [SHFM], 0.607 [noninvasive HFSS],
      and 0.625 [invasive HFSS]). CONCLUSIONS: A simple risk model assessing 4 clinical
      variables-B-type natriuretic peptide, pkVO2, NYHA, and angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use-is well suited to provide
      prognostic information in both men and women with advanced HF.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation
      left ventricular assist devices as either bridge to transplant or alternative to 
      transplant for adults eligible for heart transplantation: systematic review and
      cost-effectiveness model.
PG  - 1-499, v-vi
LID - 10.3310/hta17530 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced heart failure (HF) is a debilitating condition for which
      heart transplant (HT) offers the best treatment option. However, the supply of
      donor hearts is diminishing and demand greatly exceeds supply. Ventricular assist
      devices (VADs) are surgically implanted pumps used as an alternative to
      transplant (ATT) or as a bridge to transplant (BTT) while a patient awaits a
      donor heart. Surgery and VADs are costly. For the NHS to allocate and deliver
      such services in a cost-effective way the relative costs and benefits of these
      alternative treatments need to be estimated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate for
      patients aged >/= 16 years with advanced HF eligible for HT: (1) the clinical
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation VADs used as
      BTT compared with medical management (MM); and (2) the clinical effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation VADs used as an ATT in
      comparison with their use as BTT therapy. DATA SOURCES: Searches for clinical
      effectiveness studies covered years from 2003 to March 2012 and included the
      following data bases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 
      EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of 
      Reviews of Effects (DARE), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), HTA
      databases [NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD)], Science Citation
      Index and Conference Proceedings (Web of Science), UK Clinical Research Network
      (UKCRN) Portfolio Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and National Library of Medicine (NLM) Gateway,
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Current Controlled
      Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked,
      and VAD manufacturers' websites interrogated. For economic analyses we made use
      of individual patient data (IPD) held in the UK Blood and Transplant Database
      (BTDB). REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of evidence on clinical effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and/or Conformite Europeenne (CE) approved VADs.
      Publications from the last 5 years with control groups, or case series with 50 or
      more patients were included. Outcomes included survival, functional capacity
      (e.g. change in New York Heart Association functional classification), quality of
      life (QoL) and adverse events. Data from the BTDB were obtained. A discrete-time,
      semi-Markov, multistate model was built. Deterministic and probabilistic methods 
      with multiple sensitivity analyses varying survival, utilities and cost inputs to
      the model were used. Model outputs were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
      (ICERs), cost/quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and cost/life-year
      gained (LYG). The discount rate was 3.5% and the time horizon varied over 3
      years, 10 years and lifetime. RESULTS: Forty publications reported clinical
      effectiveness of VADs and one study reported cost-effectiveness. We found no
      high-quality comparative empirical studies of VADs as BTT compared with MM or as 
      ATT compared with BTT. Approximately 15-25% of the patients receiving a device
      had died by 12 months. Studies reported the following wide ranges for adverse
      events: 4-27% bleeding requiring transfusion; 1.5-40% stroke; 3.3-48% infection; 
      1-14% device failure; 3-30% HF; 11-32% reoperation; and 3-53% renal failure. QoL 
      and functional status were reported as improved in studies of two devices
      [HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) and HeartWare (HW;
      HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA)]. At 3 years, 10 years and lifetime, the
      ICERs for VADs as BTT compared with MM were pound122,730, pound68,088 and
      pound55,173 respectively. These values were stable to changes in survival of the 
      MM group. Both QoL and costs were reduced by VADs as ATT compared with VADs as
      BTT giving ICERs in south-west quadrant of the cost effectiveness plain (cost
      saving/QALY sacrificed) of pound353,467, pound31,685 and pound20,637 over the 3
      years, 10 years and lifetime horizons respectively. Probabilistic analyses
      yielded similar results for both research questions. LIMITATIONS: Conclusions
      about the clinical effectiveness were limited by the lack of randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of different VADs for BTT or
      comparing BTT with any alternative treatment and by the overlapping populations
      in published studies. Although IPD from the BTDB was used to estimate the
      cost-effectiveness of VADs compared with MM for BTT, the lack of randomisation of
      populations limited the interpretation of this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 years,
      10 years and lifetime the ICERs for VADs as BTT compared with MM are higher than 
      generally applied willingness-to-pay thresholds in the UK, but at a lifetime time
      horizon they approximate threshold values used in end of life assessments. VADs
      as ATT have a reduced cost but cause reduced QALYs relative to BTT. Future
      research should direct attention towards two areas. First, how any future
      evaluations of second- or third-generation VADs might be conducted. For ethical
      reasons a RCT offering equal probability of HT for each group would not be
      feasible; future studies should fully assess costs, long-term patient survival,
      QoL, functional ability and adverse events, so that these may be incorporated
      into economic evaluation agreement on outcomes measures across future studies.
      Second, continuation of accurate data collection in the UK database to encompass 
      QoL data and comparative assessment of performance with other international
      centres. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology

AB  - BACKGROUND: As waiting time for heart transplantation has increased, ventricular 
      assist devices have become critical for "bridging" patients with end-stage heart 
      failure. Because most reported post-discharge experience is with left ventricular
      assist devices (LVAD), we sought to evaluate the safety and feasibility of home
      discharge on paracorporeal biventricular assist devices (BIVAD). METHODS: We
      retrospectively reviewed the hospital course and post-discharge outcomes of 46
      consecutive patients who received paracorporeal VADs as bridge to transplant. The
      success of home discharge was assessed by frequency and reasons for hospital
      readmission and survival to transplant. RESULTS: Thirty patients (65%) were
      successfully transferred from the intensive care unit and considered candidates
      for discharge. Of the 26 patients discharged home, 11 were supported with an LVAD
      and 15 with BIVADs. Median duration of support until transplant, explant, or
      death did not differ significantly between LVAD or BIVAD patients (91 days vs 158
      days; p = 0.09). There were 26 readmissions for medical or device-related
      complications; 10 in 7 LVAD patients and 16 in 10 BIVAD patients, with no
      difference in median length of stay (17 days vs 25 days; p = 0.67). Out of
      hospital duration of support was similar between LVAD and BIVAD patients (61 days
      vs 66 days; p = 0.87) as were 6-month and 1-year event-free survival rates (p =
      0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes were similar in patients bridged to transplant on
      home paracorporeal BIVAD versus LVAD support. We recommend discharge for stable
      patients demonstrating device competency and adequate home care regardless of the
      need for univentricular or biventricular paracorporeal support.

AB  - More patients with end-stage heart failure are now being supported by left
      ventricular assist devices (LVAD) as a bridge to heart transplant. The LVAD
      unloads the failing heart and modifies the myocardial structure, with regression 
      of left ventricular hypertrophy. The regression of hypertrophy has been reported 
      histomorphologically in paired samples of myocardial tissues obtained from the
      same patient at the time of LVAD implantation and the heart excised at
      transplant. The understanding of the mechanisms of recovery may contribute to
      strategic development for LVAD weaning and the use of LVAD as a destination
      therapy.

AB  - The rapid evolution of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has extended survival
      and improved quality of life for patients suffering from the most advanced heart 
      failure (HF). Survival at one year after placement of a left ventricular assist
      device exceeds 80%. MCS and transplant have developed in counterpoint to each
      other. Patients with HF now have a meaningful option for lifelong support even if
      they are not candidates for heart transplant. As the profiles of MCS recipients
      change and the next generation of devices emerges, new challenges and
      opportunities await physicians caring for patients with cardiac failure.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have revolutionized heart
      failure management in adults. Recently, VADs have similarly taken a prominent
      role in the management of end-stage heart failure in children. The purpose of
      this review is to describe the indications for VADs in children, types of devices
      available, current outcomes, and future directions of VAD therapy. RECENT
      FINDINGS: There has been a dramatic increase in VAD utilization in children over 
      the last decade. For small children, paracorporeal pneumatic pulsatile pumps
      (e.g., Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD, Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin, Germany) are most
      commonly utilized for long-term support. In older children, intracorporeal
      continuous flow devices (e.g., HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist System,
      Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, California, USA and HeartWare Ventricular
      Assist System, HeartWare Incorporated, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA) have been 
      used and allow the possibility of destination therapy. Other devices, such as the
      total artificial heart, can be utilized for selected patients. Although overall
      outcomes of pediatric VADs are favorable, complication rates remain high. The
      utilization of VADs in complex circulations, such as single ventricle patients,
      remains infrequent and is associated with a high rate of adverse outcomes.
      SUMMARY: VADs are well-established treatment for end-stage heart failure in
      children. Further investigation is needed to refine patient selection criteria,
      minimize complications, and develop additional pediatric-specific devices.

AB  - Patients with refractory congestive heart failure may be considered for
      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Renal failure after LVAD
      placement can occur to varying degrees from cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) or due to 
      intrinsic renal disease. Patients with severely impaired renal function after
      LVAD may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) as a temporary or permanent
      means of support. We present a unique case of a patient who initiated peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD) 1 year after placement of an LVAD for destination therapy (DT). One
      year later, PD continues to be successfully utilized by this patient for RRT.
      There are several proven and theoretical benefits to PD in LVAD patients.
      Peritoneal dialysis can provide sustained daily ultrafiltration offering greater 
      hemodynamic stability, preservation of residual renal function, and a lower risk 
      of systemic infection. Conversely, limitations to PD include nutritional risks
      due to peritoneal albumin losses, hyperglycemia, and potential limitations to
      successful catheter placement. Considering our patient's successful outcome and
      the potential benefits associated with PD, despite the limitations, we conclude
      that PD should strongly be considered in patients with LVADs that require RRT.

AB  - Continuous-flow ventricular assist devices (VADs) are a viable therapy for the
      treatment of end-stage heart failure, offering support for
      bridge-to-transplantation and destination therapy. As support duration for VADs
      continues to rise, patient management and device maintenance will play an
      increasingly crucial role. The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System has currently 
      been implanted in >4,000 patients worldwide. The HeartWare controller stores
      approximately 30 days of VAD data including pump rotational speed, power
      consumption, and estimated VAD flow. Routine assessment of controller log files
      can serve as a pump performance tool and clinical management aid, assisting the
      clinician to make accurate and timely diagnoses. Here, we discuss the
      controller's data collection system as well as present the process for evaluation
      and reporting of controller log files to clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation has become an effective 
      option for patients with severe heart failure. However, device-related infections
      remain a significant problem. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence
      and microbiological aetiology of bacteraemia in patients with VADs, and to assess
      the impact of bacteraemia on clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study
      was conducted of patients having VAD implantation at the Alfred Hospital
      (Melbourne, Australia) from October 1990 to July 2009. Medical records and
      microbiology databases were reviewed. Patients who were supported with a VAD for 
      72h or more were evaluated for demographic data, VAD type, the occurrence of
      bacteraemia and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: During the 19-year period, 135 VAD
      patients (89 Thoratec PVAD, 10 Novacor, and 36 Ventrassist) supported for a total
      duration of 17,304 (median 74) support days were included. Sixty-one patients
      (45%) developed VAD-associated bacteraemia, an incidence of 5.6 episodes per 1000
      support days. The incidence of bacteraemia per 1000 days of support was similar
      for the three devices used: Thoratec PVAD, Novacor and Ventrassist VADs
      (7.8+/-0.8, 5.2+/-1.5 and 3.4+/-0.5, respectively, p=0.74). Staphylococcus aureus
      was the most common pathogen (25%). The rates of death on device, survival to
      transplant, recovery with explant and outcomes after transplantation, including
      30-day mortality, median survival time and incidence of cerebrovascular accidents
      were not significantly impacted upon by bacteraemia. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteraemia is 
      common in VAD patients. However, the incidence of VAD-associated bacteraemia is
      independent of device type and with aggressive antimicrobial therapy; clinical
      outcomes need not be affected by the bacteraemia.

AB  - Despite major advances in the treatment of heart failure over the past two
      decades, improving the natural history of this condition, heart failure continues
      to be a major source of morbidity and mortality. Although availability of heart
      donor for transplantation has declined over the past several years, innovations
      in ventricular assist device (VAD) technology has provided an alternative
      therapeutic option for patients with advanced heart failure. Initiated as a
      mechanical option to "bridge" critically ill patients awaiting transplantation,
      VADs are being increasingly deployed as "destination" devices to provide
      long-term support. With technical advances resulting in improved mechanical
      reliability, reduced postoperative morbidity and greater likelihood of patient
      acceptance, there is interest in expanding the applicability of VAD beyond the
      current indication, as destination therapy for severely ill patients who are not 
      candidates for transplant. This review examines the rational as well as the
      technical details of the different generation of VADs for mechanical cardiac
      support, implanted either surgical or percutaneously. These devices are at
      various stages of development and clinical investigation. One or more of these
      newer devices is likely to emerge as an important development in the treatment of
      patients with advanced heart failure.

TI  - Advanced therapies for end-stage heart failure.
PG  - 63-72
AB  - Management of the advanced heart failure patient can be complex. Therapies
      include cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support, as well
      inotropic agents for the short-term. Despite a growing armamentarium of
      resources, the clinician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each
      therapy to develop an optimal treatment strategy. While cardiac transplantation
      remains the only true "cure" for end-stage disease, this resource is limited and 
      the demand continues to far outpace the supply. For patients who are
      transplant-ineligible or likely to succumb to their illness prior to transplant, 
      ventricular assist device therapy has now become a viable option for improving
      morbidity and mortality. Particularly for the non-operative patient, intravenous 
      inotropes can be utilized for symptom control. Regardless of the treatments
      considered, care of the heart failure patient requires thoughtful dialogue,
      multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized care. While survival is
      important, most patients covet quality of life above all outcomes. An often
      overlooked component is the patient's control over the dying process. It is vital
      that clinicians make goals-of-care discussions a priority when seeing patients
      with advanced heart failure. The use of palliative care consultation is
      well-validated and facilitates these difficult conversations to ensure that all
      patient needs are ultimately met.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a conceptual definition of quality of life (QoL) with a
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD). BACKGROUND: Conceptual and operational
      definitions of QoL with an LVAD are lacking. METHODS: A grounded theory method
      was used. Adult, outpatient LVAD recipients (n = 11) participated twice in
      individual or paired interviews. RESULTS: A conceptual definition of QoL while
      living with an LVAD was established as: "Being well enough to do and enjoy
      day-to-day activities that are important to me." Participants described 5
      important life domains consistent with QoL literature: physical, emotional,
      social, cognitive, and spiritual/meaning. However, participants identified unique
      concerns not addressed by generic or heart failure disease specific measures
      typically used in the LVAD population. CONCLUSION: Existing generic and
      heart-failure specific QoL measures are not adequate for understanding QoL among 
      LVAD patients. Cognition and spiritual/meaning domains were significant; these
      need inclusion for comprehensive QoL assessment in the LVAD population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-coagulation is required in patients with left ventricular assist
      devices (LVADs). We evaluated the feasibility of low-molecular-weight heparin
      (LMWH) for initiation of anti-coagulation and transitioning to oral
      anti-coagulation after LVAD implantation. METHODS: This single-center study
      included 78 consecutive patients who underwent either Thoratec HeartMate II LVAD 
      (n = 27) or HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD, n = 51) implantation. The 
      LMWHs enoxaparin (n = 50) and dalteparin (n = 28) were used. LMWH was started
      within 24 hours post-operatively in 79.5% of patients. No anti-coagulation was
      given before starting LMWH therapy. LMWH activity was monitored by determination 
      of anti-factor Xa levels in plasma. RESULTS: The majority of patients (80.7%) had
      peak anti-Xa activity within the defined range of efficacy of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/ml by
      the second day of treatment. Mean effective peak anti-Xa activity was 0.28 +/-
      0.06 IU/ml. Mean duration of anti-coagulation with LMWH was 25.8 +/- 18 days.
      Ischemic strokes were observed in 3 patients (3.8%), with a total of 4 events.
      Three events occurred while on LMWH, and 1 event occurred during follow-up on
      oral anti-coagulation. There was 1 fatal stroke. No pump thrombus was observed.
      Major bleeding was observed in 5 patients (6.4%), with a total of 6 events.
      Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common complication (n = 3). There were no
      fatal bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: LMWH in the setting of LVAD shows rapid and
      constant biologic efficacy. Anti-coagulation with LMWH appears feasible after
      LVAD implantation. These findings support further evaluation of LMWH as an
      alternative to unfractionated heparin in this patient cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current design trend for left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)
      is miniaturization, which aims to increase the treatable patient population and
      enable new treatment indications by reducing surgical trauma and the
      complications associated with device implantation. The MVAD Pump (HeartWare Inc, 
      Framingham, MA) is a small, axial VAD that uses magnetic and hydrodynamic
      impeller technology and incorporates wide helical flow channels to minimize shear
      stress. In this study, we implanted the MVAD Pump in an ovine model to evaluate
      device hemocomaptiblity, biocompatibility, performance, and safety. METHODS: The 
      MVAD Pump was implanted in an ovine model (n = 9) for 90 days. The pump was
      implanted through a thoracotomy and secured to the LV apex with a gimbaled sewing
      ring, which allowed for intraoperative adjustment of the insertion depth and
      angle of the inflow cannula. Serum analytes and coagulation parameters were
      analyzed at specific intervals throughout the study period. Pump flow, speed, and
      power were recorded daily to monitor device performance. Sheep were electively
      euthanized at 90 days for pathologic and histologic analysis. RESULTS: In this
      study, results demonstrated the safety, reliability, hemocompatability, and
      biocompatibility of the MVAD Pump. Nine animals were implanted for 90 +/- 5 days.
      No complications occurred during surgical implantation. Seven of the 9 animals
      survived until elective sacrifice. Each sheep that survived to the scheduled
      explant appeared physically normal, with no signs of cardiovascular or other
      organ compromise. The 2 sheep that were euthanized early showed no evidence of
      device-related issues. CONCLUSIONS: The MVAD Pump was successfully implanted
      through a thoracotomy and demonstrated excellent hemodynamic support with no
      device malfunctions throughout the study period.

PG  - 68-75

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term durability and prognostic significance of improvement
      in renal function after mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has yet to be
      characterized in a large multicenter population. The primary goals of this
      analysis were to describe serial post-MCS changes in estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) and determine their association with all-cause mortality. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) with serial creatinine
      levels available (n=3363) were studied. Early post-MCS, eGFR improved
      substantially (median improvement, 48.9%; P<0.001) with 22.3% of the population
      improving their eGFR by >/=100% within the first few weeks. However, in the
      majority of patients, this improvement was transient, and by 1 year, eGFR was
      only 6.7% above the pre-MCS value (P<0.001). This pattern of early improvement
      followed by deterioration in eGFR was observed with both pulsatile and
      continuous-flow devices. Interestingly, poor survival was associated with both
      marked improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.19-2.26; P=0.002) and worsening in eGFR (adjusted HR, 1.63; 95% CI,
      1.15-2.13; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Post-MCS, early improvement in renal function
      is common but seems to be largely transient and not necessarily indicative of an 
      improved prognosis. This pattern was observed with both pulsatile and
      continuous-flow devices. Additional research is necessary to better understand
      the mechanistic basis for these complex post-MCS changes in renal function and
      their associated survival disadvantage. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - Identification of differentially expressed transcripts and pathways in blood one 
      week and six months following implant of left ventricular assist devices.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are an
      established therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. The short- and
      long-term impact of these devices on peripheral blood gene expression has not
      been characterized, and may provide insight into the molecular pathways mediated 
      in response to left ventricular remodeling and an improvement in overall systemic
      circulation. We performed RNA sequencing to identify genes and pathways
      influenced by these devices. METHODS: RNA was extracted from blood of 9 heart
      failure patients (8 male) prior to LVAD implantation, and at 7 and 180 days
      postoperatively. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 and sequences 
      mapped to the human Ensembl GRCh37.67 genome assembly. RESULTS: A specific set of
      genes involved in regulating cellular immune response, antigen presentation, and 
      T cell activation and survival were down-regulated 7 days after LVAD placement. 6
      months following LVAD placement, the expression levels of these genes were
      significantly increased; yet importantly, remained significantly lower than age
      and sex-matched samples from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this
      genomic analysis identified a significant decrease in the expression of genes
      that promote a healthy immune response in patients with heart failure that was
      partially restored 6 months following LVAD implant.

AB  - Though cardiac transplantation for advanced heart disease patients remains
      definitive therapy for patients with advanced heart failure, it is challenged by 
      inadequate donor supply, causing durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to 
      slowly become a new primary standard. Selecting appropriate patients for MCS
      involves meeting a number of prespecifications as is required in evaluation for
      cardiac transplant candidacy. As technology evolves to bring forth more durable
      smaller devices, selection criteria for appropriate MCS recipients will likely
      expand to encompass a broader, less sick population. The "Holy Grail" for MCS
      will be a focus on clinical recovery and explantation of devices rather than the 
      currently more narrowly defined indications of bridge to transplantation or
      lifetime device therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current literature assessing factors associated with outcomes of
      patients waiting for pediatric heart transplants has focused on survival to
      transplant and mortality. Our aim was to determine risk factors associated with
      the outcomes of delisting, transplant, or death while waiting. METHODS: In this
      single-center, retrospective study of patients listed for heart transplants,
      competing risk analysis was used to model survival from listing to 4 competing
      outcomes (transplant, death, delisting for clinical deterioration, delisting for 
      clinical improvement or surgical intervention). RESULTS: There were 308 listing
      episodes in 280 patients. In competing risk analysis, 11% remained listed at 6
      months (transplant 62%, dead 13%, delisted worse 6%, delisted improved 8%).
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices were
      associated both with higher probability of transplant (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; P 
      < .001) and delisting for clinical deterioration (HR, 2.7; P = .06). Younger age 
      at listing and complex congenital heart disease were shared risk factors for
      mortality (HR, 1.07; P = .05; HR, 2.9; P = .003) and delisting because of
      clinical deterioration (HR, 1.17; P = .01; HR, 2.8; P = .02). Younger age at
      listing and fetal listing were associated with delisting for clinical improvement
      or surgical intervention (HR, 1.13; P = .01; HR, 2.9; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS:
      Overall survival to transplant depends on risk factors including age at listing, 
      cardiac diagnosis, and mechanical circulatory support. Knowledge of risk factors 
      for death and delisting for clinical deterioration or improvement can assist
      patient selection and timing of transplant listing.

      outcomes from the INTERMACS Registry (Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of durable
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in patients with chemotherapy-induced
      cardiomyopathy (CCMP) and determine their outcomes and survival in comparison to 
      that of other patients with end-stage heart failure treated similarly.
      BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage heart failure as a result of CCMP from
      anthracyclines are often precluded from heart transplantation because of a
      history of cancer. In such patients, durable MCS may offer an important chance
      for life prolongation. Yet, there are no data to support the use of MCS in this
      increasingly prevalent group of patients. METHODS: We searched 3,812 MCS patients
      from June 2006 through March 2011 in the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) database for the diagnosis of CCMP. We
      compared characteristics, outcomes, and survival between CCMP patients and
      patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS:
      Compared with patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ischemic
      cardiomyopathy, patients with CCMP were overwhelmingly female (72% vs. 24% vs.
      13%, p = 0.001), had MCS more often implanted as destination therapy (33% vs. 14%
      vs. 22%, p = 0.03), required more right ventricular assist device support (19%
      vs. 11% vs. 6%, p = 0.006), and had a higher risk of bleeding (p = 0001).
      Survival of CCMP patients was similar to that of other groups. CONCLUSIONS: CCMP 
      patients treated with MCS have survival similar to other MCS patients despite
      more frequent need for right ventricular assist device support and increased
      bleeding risk.

AB  - After heart transplantation (HT), transient right heart failure (RHF) is common. 
      If it does not improve with appropriate medical therapy, we must consider
      mechanical support. Recently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has
      shown better results than a right ventricular assist device or retransplantation.
      Two HT patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had cold ischemic times beyond
      >240 minutes. After HT, their right heart function worsened and was unresponsive 
      to medical therapy. After our application of ECMO, weaning was successful and the
      patients were discharged without complication. Early application of ECMO for RHF 
      after HT is a good option.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to comparatively analyze outcomes of
      heart transplant patients bridged to transplantation with HeartWare (HW-VAD)
      versus HeartMate II (HMII-VAD) left ventricular assist devices. METHODS: The
      United Network for Organ Sharing Database was reviewed to identify first-time
      heart transplant recipients who were bridged to transplantation with either
      HW-VAD (n=141) or HMII-VAD (n=1824) from January 2009 through July 2012. RESULTS:
      Recipients of HW-VAD had a higher proportion of female patients (27.0% versus
      18.9%; p=0.019), a lower body surface area (2.01+/-0.25 m2 versus 2.06+/-0.25 m2;
      p=0.035), and a trend toward a higher peak percentage of panel reactive antibody 
      against human leukocyte class I antigens (40.4%+/-32.8% versus 33.0%+/-30.4%;
      p=0.070). Pretransplantation recipient cardiac index (2.33+/-0.66 Lmin(-1)m(-2)
      versus 2.33+/-0.68 Lmin(-1)m(-2)), serum creatinine (1.21+/-0.43 mg/dL versus
      1.26+/-0.57 mg/dL), and total bilirubin (1.34+/-3.45 mg/dL versus 1.06+/-1.84
      mg/dL) were comparable between the two groups (p>0.05 for all comparisons). After
      transplantation, there were no significant differences in freedom from rejection 
      or freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Posttransplant graft survival
      rates were similar between the HW-VAD group and the HMII-VAD group at 1, 2, and 3
      years (88.4% versus 87.8%, 79.9% versus 83.8%, and 77.4% versus 79.9%,
      respectively; p=0.843). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest similar hemodynamic
      unloading, pretransplant end-organ function, and posttransplant outcomes in
      patients bridged to transplantation with both the HW-VAD and HMII-VAD.

AB  - Patients with advanced heart failure refractory to optimal medical treatment have
      a high mortality and a poor quality of life with frequent hospital admissions.
      The lack of alternative treatment options has prompted the development of
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, first as bridge to heart transplant
      and subsequently as destination therapy as a valid alternative to transplant.
      Last generation MCS devices are mechanically reliable and their management has
      become increasingly less complex. Nowadays, medium-term survival does not
      significantly differ between MCS and heart transplant recipients. MCS management 
      programs require a multidisciplinary team to optimize the pathway leading to
      rehabilitation and improved quality of life and decrease the frequent occurrence 
      of complications. However, in the near future with the growing number of
      implants, the chances for clinical cardiologists to come across a MCS recipient
      will increase. The management of general or acute problems will no longer be
      limited to tertiary implanting centers. A key issue to improve patient outcomes
      is the provision of a smooth and careful transition from the hospital environment
      to home care. The aim of this review is to start this process by providing basic 
      notions and general indications through several scenarios of MCS recipients
      presenting to the emergency room for acute clinical problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health status predicts adverse outcomes in heart failure and cardiac 
      surgery patients, but its prognostic value in left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) placement is unknown. METHODS: We examined the association of
      pre-operative health status, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy
      Questionnaire (KCCQ), with survival and hospitalization after LVAD using the KCCQ
      score as a continuous variable and stratified by KCCQ score quartile plus missing
      KCCQ in 1,125 clinical trial participants who received the HeartMate II (Thoratec
      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) as destination therapy (n = 635) or bridge to
      transplantation (n = 490). RESULTS: The mean pre-operative KCCQ score was 29.4
      +/- 18.7 among survivors (n = 719), and 27.1 +/- 18.3 (n = 406) in those who
      died. In time-to-event analysis for all available follow-up using health status
      as a continuous variable, the pre-operative KCCQ score did not correlate with
      overall mortality after LVAD implantation (p = 0.178). Small absolute differences
      were seen between the pre-operative KCCQ quartile and 30-day survival (Q4 95% vs.
      Q1 89% vs. missing 87%; p = 0.0009 for trend), 180-day survival (Q4 83% vs. Q1
      76% vs missing 79%; p = 0.060 for trend), and days hospitalized at 180 days (Q4
      29.8 +/- 25.6 vs. Q1 34.1 +/- 27.1 vs. missing 36.5 +/- 29.9 days; p = 0.009 for 
      trend). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that pre-operative health status has
      limited association with outcomes after LVAD implantation. Although these data
      require further study in a diverse population, mechanical circulatory support may
      represent a relatively unique clinical situation, distinct from heart failure and
      other cardiac surgeries, in which heart failure-specific health status measures
      may be largely reversed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbidities complicate recovery and contribute to mortality after
      implant of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Coexistent cardiac and renal 
      dysfunction (so-called cardiorenal syndrome) increases the risk of death, both
      with advanced heart failure and after LVAD implantation. We analyzed patients
      from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assist Circulatory Support to
      better estimate postimplant mortality according to the severity of renal
      dysfunction. METHODS: Patients with a continuous-flow LVAD were grouped according
      to their pre-implant level of renal dysfunction: severe was defined as dialysis
      and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min; moderate if eGFR 
      was 30 to 59 ml/min or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was > 60 mg/dl; and mild or no
      renal dysfunction if eGFR was >/= 60 ml/min and BUN was < 60 mg/dl. RESULTS: Of
      the 4,917 patients with a continuous-flow LVAD implanted between June 2006 and
      March 2012, 3,160 (64%) were identified with mild or no renal dysfunction, 1,475 
      (30%) with moderate dysfunction, and 282 (6%) with severe dysfunction. Worsening 
      renal dysfunction correlated with decreased survival, with nearly a 20% reduction
      in the 2-year survival going from low to severe dysfunction. The major negative
      survival effect occurred during the first 3 months. Combination of severe renal
      dysfunction and cardiogenic shock predicted the highest early mortality.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pre-implant renal dysfunction predicts higher mortality after LVAD
      implant. The progressive reduction in survival with higher grades of renal
      dysfunction supports consideration of LVAD implant before cardiorenal syndrome is
      advanced. For patients with severe renal dysfunction and other major
      comorbidities, initial support with a temporary device while awaiting organ
      recovery before implanting a durable pump could be considered.

      LVAD implant, a large proportion of patients have pulmonary hypertension, right
      ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). RV dysfunction
      and TR can exacerbate renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy,
      edema, and even prohibit isolated LVAD implant. Repairing TR mandates increased
      cardiopulmonary bypass time and bicaval cannulation, which should be reserved for
      the time of orthotopic heart transplantation. We hypothesized that CF LVAD
      implant would improve pulmonary artery pressures, enhance RV function, and
      minimize TR, obviating need for surgical tricuspid repair. METHODS: One hundred
      fourteen continuous flow LVADs implanted from 2005 through 2011 at a single
      center, with medical management of functional TR, were retrospectively analyzed. 
      Pulmonary artery pressures were measured immediately prior to and following LVAD 
      implant. RV function and TR were graded according to standard echocardiographic
      criteria, prior to, immediately following, and long-term following LVAD. RESULTS:
      There was a significant improvement in post-VAD mean pulmonary arterial pressures
      (26.6 +/- 4.9 vs. 30.2 +/- 7.4 mmHg, p = 0.008) with equivalent loading pressures
      (CVP = 12.0 +/- 4.0 vs. 12.1 +/- 5.1 p = NS). RV function significantly improved,
      as noted by right ventricular stroke work index (7.04 +/- 2.60 vs. 6.05 +/- 2.54,
      p = 0.02). There was an immediate improvement in TR grade and RV function
      following LVAD implant, which was sustained long term. CONCLUSION: Continuous
      flow LVAD implant improves pulmonary hypertension, RV function, and tricuspid
      regurgitation. TR may be managed nonoperatively during CF LVAD implant.

TI  - Survival results after implantation of intrapericardial third-generation
      centrifugal assist device: an INTERMACS-matched comparison analysis.
PG  - 383-90
LID - 10.1111/aor.12188 [doi]
AB  - Reports on third-generation centrifugal intrapericardial pumps (HeartWare
      International, Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) have shown better survival results than
      the previous-generation devices. However, outcomes depending on the preoperative 
      level of stability can substantially differ, resulting in a limited analysis of
      potentialities and drawbacks of a given device. In the present study we sought to
      compare in our single-center experience the survival results of this
      third-generation device with previous left ventricular systems taking into
      account the different preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) levels. Between February 1993 and March 2012, 287
      patients underwent assist device implantation in our university hospital
      (INTERMACS Level 1-2 = 158 patients; INTERMACS Level 3-4-5 = 129 patients).
      Assist devices implanted were: Group A (HVAD HeartWare, n = 52), group B
      (previous continuous-flow ventricular assist device [VAD], InCor [Berlin Heart,
      Berlin, Germany], n = 37; VentrAssist [VentraCor, Inc., Chatswood, NSW,
      Australia], n = 7; DeBakey [MicroMed Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA], n =
      32), and group C (pulsatile systems, n = 159). After cumulative support duration 
      of 54 436 days and a mean follow-up of 6.21 +/- 7.46 months (range 0-45.21
      months), log-rank analysis revealed a survival for group A of 82.0%, 70.4%, and
      70.4%; for group B of 84.0%, 48.2%, 33.7%; and for group C of 71.6%, 46.1%,
      33.8%, at 1, 12, and 24 months respectively, with a significantly (P = 0.013)
      better outcome for group A. When stratifying the survival on the basis of
      INTERMACS level, no significant survival improvement was observed among all
      patients who underwent VAD implantation in INTERMACS 1-2 (P = 0.47). However,
      among patients who underwent elective VAD implantation (INTERMACS 3-4-5), group A
      had a significantly better outcome (P = 0.005) compared with the other
      INTERMACS-matched groups (B,C) with a survival rate of 88.8% in group A versus
      34.2% in group B and 45.6% in group C at 24 months, respectively. Elective HVAD
      system implantation shows improved survival benefit over the other
      INTERMACS-matched devices. Moreover, preoperative unstable hemodynamics resulted 
      in a poor prognosis independently from the pump generation.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly used for mechanical
      circulatory support of patients with severe heart failure, primarily as a bridge 
      to heart transplantation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a major
      role in the clinical decision making during insertion of the devices and in the
      post-operative management of these patients. The detection of structural and
      device-related mechanical abnormalities is critical for optimal functioning of
      assist device. In this review article, we describe the usefulness of TEE for
      optimal perioperative management of patients presenting for HeartWare LVAD
      insertion.

      and left ventricular non-compaction.
PG  - E165-7

AB  - HC is a rare cause of congestive heart failure that typically presents with
      malignant ventricular arrhythmias in infants, often requiring urgent
      intervention. Successful heart transplantation in a patient with HC has only been
      reported once (J Heart Lung Transplant 2004: 23: 902). The combination of HC with
      concurrent LVNC has only been described three times (Int J Legal Med 2009: 123:
      47; Hum Pathol 2005: 36: 403; Pediatr Dev Pathol 2012: 15: 397). We report two
      rare cases of HC with LVNC in two infants presenting with cardiogenic shock, one 
      requiring ECMO support who was successfully bridged to orthotopic heart
      transplantation with a Berlin Heart LVAD.

AB  - RATIONALE: The Calcium Up-Regulation by Percutaneous Administration of Gene
      Therapy In Cardiac Disease (CUPID 1) study was a phase 1/phase 2 first-in-human
      clinical gene therapy trial using an adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1)
      vector carrying the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase gene (AAV1/SERCA2a) in 
      patients with advanced heart failure. The study explored potential benefits of
      the therapy at 12 months, and results were previously reported. OBJECTIVE: To
      report long-term (3-year) clinical effects and transgene expression in the
      patients in CUPID 1. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with advanced
      heart failure who were on stable, optimal heart failure therapy were randomized
      to receive intracoronary infusion of AAV1/SERCA2a in 1 of 3 doses (low-dose,
      6x10(11) DNase-resistant particles; mid-dose, 3x10(12) DNase-resistant particles;
      and high-dose, 1x10(13) DNase-resistant particles) versus placebo. The following 
      recurrent cardiovascular and terminal events were tracked for 3 years in all
      groups: myocardial infarction, worsening heart failure, heart failure-related
      hospitalization, ventricular assist device placement, cardiac transplantation,
      and death. The number of cardiovascular events, including death, was highest in
      the placebo group, high but delayed in the low- and mid-dose groups, and lowest
      in the high-dose group. Evidence of long-term transgene presence was also
      observed in high-dose patients. The risk of prespecified recurrent cardiovascular
      events was reduced by 82% in the high-dose versus placebo group (P=0.048). No
      safety concerns were noted during the 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: After a
      single intracoronary infusion of AAV1/SERCA2a in patients with advanced heart
      failure, positive signals of cardiovascular events persist for years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is used to support children with
      end-stage heart failure to heart transplant. METHODS: This was a retrospective
      cohort study of 7 years' experience with the Berlin Heart (BH) EXCOR (Berlin
      Heart AG, Berlin Germany) paracorporeal ventricular assist device (VAD) in 2
      United Kingdom (UK) pediatric heart transplant centers and the effect of this
      program on the UK pediatric heart transplant service. RESULTS: Of 102 children
      who received BH support, 84% survived to transplant or BH explant and 81%
      survived to discharge. Neither age nor duration of support influenced outcome.
      Stroke, ongoing requirement for ventilation while on BH, and diagnosis other than
      dilated cardiomyopathy were the only independent mortality risk factors. Children
      who weighed < 20 kg had significantly (p = 0.03) longer support times than bigger
      children. The number of children treated with a BH increased over time (p =
      0.01). Currently > 50% of pediatric heart transplants are bridged with a BH;
      however, pediatric transplants per year have not increased significantly (p =
      0.07) CONCLUSIONS: BH use in the UK has allowed significant increases in the
      number of children with end-stage heart failure who can be successfully bridged
      to transplant and the length of time they can be supported. The total number of
      transplants has not increased.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-surgical bleeding (NSB) is a major complication among heart
      failure (HF) patients supported by continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      devices (CF-LVADs). Understanding the hemostatic defects contributing to NSB
      after CF-LVAD implantation is crucial for prevention of this adverse event. The
      aim of this study was to examine the link between platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha
      (GPIbalpha) ectodomain shedding and NSB in CF-LVAD recipients and to identify a
      potential biomarker of NSB. METHODS: Serial blood samples were collected from 35 
      HF patients supported with CF-LVADs. Platelet function was evaluated by a
      platelet function analysis device and thromboelastography (TEG). Platelet
      GPIbalpha shedding, von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen and vWF collagen binding 
      capacity were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The
      structural analysis of vWF was performed by gel electrophoresis. These platelet
      function measures with vWF parameters of the patients who had NSB between 4 and
      32 days after CF-LVAD implantation (bleeder) were analyzed against those without 
      NSB (non-bleeder). Blood samples from 7 healthy individuals were collected to
      obtain healthy reference values for the laboratory assays. RESULTS: Elevated
      GPIbalpha shedding was found to be a pre-existing condition in all HF patients
      prior to CF-LVAD implantation. Post-operative level of GPIbalpha shedding
      increased and remained elevated in the bleeder group, whereas a consistent
      decrease was found in the non-bleeder group. A receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) analysis indicated that the level of GPIbalpha shedding had a predictive
      power of NSB in patients on CF-LVAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet GPIbalpha
      ectodomain shedding which attenuates platelet reactivity is associated with NSB. 
      Plasma GPIbalpha level may potentially be used to refine bleeding risk
      stratification in CF-LVAD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) are involved in the process of
      endothelial repair and are a prognostic factor in cardiovascular diseases. We
      evaluated the association between serial measurements of CPCs and functional
      capacity and outcomes in heart failure (HF). METHODS: We included 156 consecutive
      consenting ambulatory HF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%). We 
      evaluated CPCs and functional capacity (peak VO2) every 6 months for up to 2
      years. CPCs were measured as early-outgrowth colony-forming units (EO-CFUs) and
      circulating CD34+, VEGFR2+ and/or CD133+ cells. We recorded mortality, HF
      hospital admissions, transplant, and ventricular assist device. RESULTS: The mean
      age was 55 +/- 15 years. A decrease in CD34+VEGFR2+ cells was independently
      associated with increased functional capacity; a 10-cell decrease in CD34+VEGFR2+
      cells was associated with an increase of 0.2 mL/kg/min in peak VO2 (P < 0.05). We
      found an interaction effect (P = 0.02) between EO-CFUs and diabetes: in patients 
      without diabetes, a 10-EO-CFU increase was independently associated with
      increased peak VO2 of 0.28 mL/kg/min (P = 0.01), and in patients with diabetes, a
      decrease in EO-CFUs was associated with an increased peak VO2 (P < 0.05). Higher 
      EO-CFUs were associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.09-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: We noted differential relations
      between CPCs and outcomes in patients with vs without diabetes. Higher EO-CFUs
      and lower CD34+VEGFR2+ cells were associated with improved functional capacity
      and reduced mortality in nondiabetic patients. In patients with diabetes, lower
      EO-CFUs were associated with improved functional capacity. The basis for these
      differences requires further examination.

TI  - Post-transplant outcomes of children bridged to transplant with the Berlin Heart 
      EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device.
PG  - S24-31
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000446 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric (EXCOR)
      ventricular assist device improves waiting list survival for pediatric heart
      transplant candidates. Little is known about their post-transplant outcomes. The 
      aim of this analysis was to determine whether there was a difference in early
      survival for children bridged to transplant with EXCOR versus status 1A pediatric
      heart transplant patients not transplanted with ventricular assist device
      support. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pediatric heart transplant patients (n=106) bridged
      to transplantation with EXCOR were compared with a similarly aged cohort (n=1021)
      within the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) database (both cohorts
      from May 2007 to December 2010). In the EXCOR group, 12-month post-transplant
      survival (88.7%) was similar to OPTN patients listed status 1A who were not on
      ventricular assist device support at transplant (89.3%; P=0.85) and significantly
      better than 12-month survival in OPTN patients on extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation at transplant (60.3%; P<0.001). Rejection (50%) was a significantly
      (P=0.005) higher cause of 12-month post-transplant mortality in the EXCOR
      compared with the OPTN group. Death after transplant was also higher in EXCOR
      patients with congenital heart disease compared with those with cardiomyopathy
      (26.1% versus 7.2%; P=0.02). Post-transplant survival was similar in EXCOR
      patients with >/=1 serious adverse event during ventricular assist device support
      as those without an event during support. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month
      post-transplant survival with EXCOR is comparable with overall pediatric heart
      transplant survival and superior to survival after extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation. Neither adverse events during support nor factors associated with
      mortality during support influence post-transplant survival. Rejection was a
      significantly greater cause of post-transplant mortality in EXCOR than in OPTN
      patients.

TI  - Comparison of continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow blood pumps on reducing
      pulmonary artery pressure in patients with fixed pulmonary hypertension.
PG  - 763-7
LID - 10.1111/aor.12164 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered as a risk factor for morbidity and
      mortality in patients undergoing heart transplantation. Recently, left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation has been increasingly used in
      reducing pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with PH unresponsive to
      medical therapy. Herein, we aimed to compare the efficacy of continuous-flow and 
      pulsatile-flow blood pumps on the improvement of PH in mechanical circulatory
      support patients. Twenty-seven patients with end-stage heart failure who
      underwent LVAD implantation surgery were enrolled. Fifteen of them (55.6%) had
      continuous-flow pump (HeartWare Ventricular Assist System, HeartWare, Inc.,
      Miramar, FL, USA), and 12 of them (44.4%) had pulsatile pump (Berlin Heart EXCOR 
      ventricular assist device, Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany). The efficacy of
      LVADs on the improvement of PH was compared between continuous-flow and pulsatile
      pumps by the evaluation of systolic PAP, tricuspid annular plane systolic
      excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular systolic motion (RVSM), right ventricular
      ejection fraction (RVEF), and grade of tricuspid insufficiency (TI) for each of
      the study participants. All of the 15 patients who underwent continuous-flow
      blood pump implantation surgery (Group 1) were male with a mean age of 46.9 +/-
      11.7 years, and in pulsatile-flow blood pump implanted participants (Group 2),
      the mean age was 40.6 +/- 16.8 years, all of whom were also male (P=0.259). Mean 
      follow-up was 313.7 +/- 241.3 days in Group 1 and 448.7 +/- 120.7 days in Group 2
      (P=0.139). In Group 1, mean preoperative and postoperative systolic PAP were
      measured as 51.7 +/- 12.2 mm Hg and 22.2 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, while those
      in Group 2 were 54.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg and 33.9 +/- 6.4 mm Hg, respectively. A
      significantly greater decrease in systolic PAP was noticed in patients with
      continuous-flow blood pumps (P=0.023); however, no statistically significant
      difference was found when we considered the change in TAPSE between study groups 
      (P=0.112). A statistical significance in the alteration of RVEF, RVSM, and the
      grade of TI during study visits was not found between the study groups (P=0.472, 
      P=0.887, and P=0.237, respectively). Although the two studied types of LVADs were
      found to be effective in reducing PAP in heart transplantation candidates with
      PH, lesser postoperative systolic PAP values were achieved in patients who
      underwent continuous-flow pump implantation surgery.

AB  - Although several left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been used widely,
      remote monitoring of LVAD parameters has been available only recently. We present
      our remote monitoring experience with an axial-flow LVAD (HeartAssist-5, MicroMed
      Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA). Five consecutive patients who were
      implanted a HeartAssist-5 LVAD because of end-stage heart failure due to ischemic
      (n=4) or idiopathic (n=1) cardiomyopathy, and discharged from hospital between
      December 2011 and January 2013 were analyzed. The data (pump speed, pump flow,
      power consumption) obtained from clinical visits and remote monitoring were
      studied. During a median follow-up of 253 (range: 80-394) days, fine tuning of
      LVADs was performed at clinical visits. All patients are doing well and are in
      New York Heart Association Class-I/II. A total of 39 alarms were received from
      three patients. One patient was hospitalized for suspected thrombosis and was
      subjected to physical examinations as well as laboratory and echocardiographic
      evaluations; however, no evidence of thrombus washout or pump thrombus was found.
      The patient was treated conservatively. Remaining alarms were due to insufficient
      water intake and were resolved by increased water consumption at night and summer
      times, and fine tuning of pump speed. No alarms were received from the remaining 
      two patients. We believe that remote monitoring is a useful technology for early 
      detection and treatment of serious problems occurring out of hospital thereby
      improving patient care. Future developments may ease troubleshooting, provide
      more data from the patient and the pump, and eventually increase physician and
      patient satisfaction. Despite all potential clinical benefits, remote monitoring 
      should be taken as a supplement to rather than a substitute for routine clinical 
      visits for patient follow-up.

TI  - Gastrointestinal bleeding and subsequent risk of thromboembolic events during
      support with a left ventricular assist device.
PG  - 60-4

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) require
      anti-coagulation (AC) with warfarin and anti-platelet therapy to prevent
      thromboembolic complications in patients. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) is a
      significant adverse event in these patients and treatment typically requires
      reduction or elimination of AC or anti-platelet therapy. It is not known whether 
      alterations in AC to treat GI bleeding influence subsequent risk of
      thromboembolic (TE) events during LVAD support. METHODS: Between July 2003 and
      September 2011, 389 patients (308 male) underwent implantation of a
      continuous-flow LVAD at the University of Michigan Health System and the Mayo
      Clinic. Median age at implant was 60 years (range 18 to 79 years). Outcomes were 
      analyzed for the association of GI bleeding events and subsequent TE events,
      defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, hemolysis or suspected or confirmed
      pump thrombosis. RESULTS: Median survival was 10 months (maximum 7.2 years, total
      439 patient-years). TE events occurring within the first 30 days were not
      counted. Overall survival and freedom from an outcome event were assessed using
      the Kaplan-Meier method. Associations between GI bleeding and subsequent TE
      events and survival impact were analyzed as time-dependent covariates. One
      hundred ninety-nine GI bleeding episodes occurred in 116 of 389 patients (30%)
      for an event rate of 0.45 GI bleed/patient-year of support. One hundred
      thirty-eight TE events occurred in 97 of 389 patients (25%) for an event rate of 
      0.31 TE event/patient-year of support. Median time from LVAD implant to first GI 
      bleed was 5 months (range 1 to 116 months) and to first TE event was 6 months
      (range 1 to 29 months). For patients who had a TE event after GI bleed, the
      median interval was 5 months (range 0.5 to 25 months). TE events were 7.4-fold
      more likely in patients who had a prior GI bleed (range 4.9- to 11.1-fold) (p <
      0.001); however, neither the presence of GI bleeding (0.7 to 1.2) nor a TE event 
      (0.8 to 2.0) portended a lower overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had GI
      bleeding were at significantly higher risk for a subsequent TE event. Although
      the exact cause of this relationship is unknown, it suggests that a reduction in 
      anti-coagulation and anti-platelet management to treat GI bleeds may contribute
      to this risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) is an established treatment modality for
      advanced heart failure in adults. The objective of this study was to evaluate
      outcomes of pediatric patients supported by the HMII LVAD. METHODS: This was a
      retrospective review of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) of patients supported with a HMII from April 2008
      to September 2011. The primary cohort comprised pediatric patients aged 11 to 18 
      years. Outcomes were compared with a group of young adults aged 19 to 39 years
      who underwent HMII implant during the same period. Ischemic etiologies for heart 
      failure were excluded. RESULTS: There were 28 pediatric patients, of whom 19
      (68%) were males, 14 (46%) were African American, and 7 (25%) underwent device
      placement in a pediatric hospital. Competing outcomes analysis showed that at 6
      months of follow-up, the composite of survival to transplantation, ongoing
      support, or recovery was 96% for the pediatric group, which was not significantly
      different from the young adult group (96%, p = 0.330). The 2 groups had similar
      INTERMACS profiles but differed in diagnosis, weight, and morbidities. Bleeding
      complications requiring surgical intervention were more common in the pediatric
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric outcomes with a HMII LVAD are comparable to that of
      young adults. As we continue to monitor this growing group, more sophisticated
      characterization and comparisons will be possible. Also, as technology progress
      and second- and third-generation devices are introduced, the number of children
      who will benefit from mechanical support will continue to grow.

PG  - 404
LID - 10.1007/s11886-013-0404-0 [doi]
AB  - The management of the pediatric patient with the failing ventricle poses its own 
      therapeutic challenges, not least because patient size limits options available. 
      Once medical management has hit its ceiling, attention is turned to surgical
      options for mechanical support. The approach to these options has to bear in mind
      that there may be many potential causes for pump failure, and that these occur
      often in the context of pulmonary hypertension and poor gas exchange. Although
      extracorporeal life support has been the mainstay of treatment for acute heart
      failure, in the last decade, attention has been focusing on longer-term options
      to bridge to recovery or eventual transplant. Added to this are more novel
      applications of ventricular assist devices, notable in the management of the
      failing Fontan circulation where there are no perfect solutions. There is growing
      interest in the use of such devices to power this delicate circulation and extend
      the functional capacity of patients without resorting to transplantation. In this
      review article, we explore the role each of these surgical modalities has to play
      in the management of the child with acute and chronic heart failure, and explore 
      the recent developments in the rapidly growing field of pediatric ventricular
      assist.

TI  - Cardiovascular implantable electronic device infections in left ventricular
      assist device recipients.
PG  - 225-30
LID - 10.1111/pace.12240 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have
      concomitant cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). However,
      clinical presentation and outcome of CIED infection in the setting of LVAD has
      not been previously described. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 247 patients 
      who underwent LVAD implantation at Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Arizona,
      and Florida, from January 2005 to December 2011. Demographic and clinical data of
      patients who met criteria for CIED infection were extracted. RESULTS: Of 247
      patients with LVADs, 215 (87%) had CIED at the time of LVAD implantation and six 
      (2.8%) subsequently developed CIED infections. Three patients developed CIED
      lead-related endocarditis and the other three had pocket infection. All three
      instances of CIED pocket infection were preceded by device generator exchange,
      whereas all three patients with CIED lead-related endocarditis had prior
      LVAD-related infections. Causative pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginos (1), 
      coagulase-negative staphylococci (2), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (1), a gram-positive bacillus (1), and culture negative (2). All patients
      underwent complete CIED removal along with antimicrobial therapy. The three
      patients with CIED lead-related endocarditis and prior LVAD infections received
      chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy, and one patient had LVAD exchange. All
      but one remained alive at the last follow-up with a median duration of 15 months 
      (7-46 months) from the time of CIED infection. CONCLUSION: Patients who are
      receiving LVAD therapy and develop CIED infection should be managed with complete
      CIED removal. Chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy is warranted in cases that
      have concomitant LVAD infection.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are increasingly being used in pediatric
      patients to support cardiac failure. As more centers adopt this technology, there
      may be a need to transport these patients over long distances to facilitate
      patient care and organ transplantation. Food and Drug Administration indications 
      for use state only that the patient must be a candidate for transplantation and
      does not place restrictions on the transplant capabilities of the implanting
      medical center. Nontransplanting institutions are able to use this technology
      with a predetermined agreement to transfer the patient to a partnering transplant
      center. We report the first two cases of interhospital air and ground transport
      of nonambulatory or intubated pediatric (<13 kg) patients supported by Berlin
      Heart EXCOR pediatric VADs and Ikus stationary drivers. We present our protocol
      for transporting this delicate patient population. In addition, we discuss
      important challenges encountered on these operations regarding vehicle transfers 
      and the management of vehicle power supply. These two cases demonstrate that the 
      transportation of pediatric patients on Berlin Heart VADs is feasible and safe
      and should be considered a treatment option in certain situations.

      oxygenation.
PG  - 533-6

AB  - Peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) for acute
      cardiac failure reestablishes normal oxygen delivery and perfusion. However, VA
      ECMO can be limited by insufficient ventricular unloading, resulting in thrombus 
      formation and pulmonary edema. Impella 2.5 has been used to unload the left
      ventricle and provide hemodynamic support during acute heart failure. We present 
      our experience of the Impella 2.5 as an adjunct for left ventricular unloading
      during peripheral VA ECMO support and as a bridge for the HeartMate II left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD). An Impella 2.5 was placed in patients who were 
      on peripheral VA ECMO with evidence of left ventricular distension. Patients who 
      were candidates for heart transplant were transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD. 
      Five patients on VA ECMO with ventricular distension underwent Impella 2.5
      implantation, resulting in a decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter as
      measured by echocardiography (7.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.8 cm, p = 0.001). Four
      patients were subsequently transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD after
      restoration of end-organ function. Impella 2.5 is a safe means to unload the left
      ventricle while on peripheral VA ECMO to prevent left ventricle thrombus
      formation and worsening pulmonary edema in patients transitioning to a HeartMate 
      II LVAD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize a single-center experience 
      of major bleeding complications during HeartMate II (HMII) (Thoratec Corp.,
      Pleasanton, California) left ventricular assist device support, with focus on the
      subtypes and temporal patterns of post-operative bleeding. BACKGROUND: Bleeding
      complications are the most common post-operative adverse events after HMII
      implantation. The timing of bleeding events, relationship to coagulation status, 
      and effect on post-operative survival are incompletely understood. METHODS: From 
      October 2004 to June 2010, 139 HMII recipients at the Cleveland Clinic received
      145 devices as a bridge to transplant or destination therapy for advanced heart
      failure. Major bleeding was defined using Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support criteria, with an additional category created to
      maximize sensitivity for events. Pre-operative variables, coagulation status, and
      bleeding recurrence were assessed for correlation to primary events using
      modulated renewal within a multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The cumulative
      occurrence of major bleeding was 58% during 171 patient-years of follow-up. There
      were 1.14 major bleeds per patient-year, with 44% occurring as repeat bleeding
      events. A first bleed did not predict subsequent bleeding. The greatest risk of
      bleeding was noted within 2 weeks post-implantation. The international normalized
      ratio profile correlated poorly with the risk of bleeding. Bleeding early after
      surgery was associated with reduced survival while on HMII support. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The risk of bleeding peaks early after HMII implantation. Bleeding of thoracic
      and gastrointestinal sources dominates these events, although many patients
      undergo transfusions for anemia without an apparent source of hemolysis or
      bleeding.

AB  - Ventricular assist device (VAD) technology has rapidly evolved, and VADs are now 
      seen as a reliable lifesaving option to support the failing heart in the short-
      and long-term: in some cases, VAD therapy represents a well-accepted treatment
      option for advanced heart failure that can obviate the need for heart
      transplantation. In the near future, more and more cardiologists will encounter
      VAD patients in their clinical practice and need to know how to handle the
      inherent risks associated with VAD use. The emergency care of a VAD patient
      differs from that of conventional practice and specific expertise is required to 
      avoid inappropriate management that could lead to inefficient treatment and/or
      dangerous consequences. Here, we describe two emergency scenarios in VAD
      patients, two paradigmatic clinical in-hospital situations, in different
      settings. Following a brief overview of the role of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      maneuvers in VAD patients, we propose a working algorithm that might help to
      ensure a timely and efficient response to acute demands in this setting.

TI  - CentriMag short-term ventricular assist as a bridge to solution in patients with 
      advanced heart failure: use beyond 30 days.
PG  - e310-5
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt415 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) offer very valuable
      therapeutic options for patients with advanced heart failure. CentriMag
      (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) is an extracorporeal short-term circulatory
      assist device Conformite Europeenne-marked in Europe for use up to 30 days.
      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 41 patients with advanced heart failure who,
      from 2003 to 2011, were supported with CentriMag for >30 days as a bridge to
      recovery, long-term VAD or transplantation. RESULTS: Forty-one adult patients
      were supported with 46 CentriMag devices for a total of 2695 days with a mean
      support time of 59 (range: 31-167) days. Indications were post-cardiotomy
      cardiogenic shock (PC = 4), primary graft failure (PGF = 7) and refractory heart 
      failure (RHF = 35). Six devices were used to support the left ventricle, 19 to
      support the right ventricle and 21 to support both the ventricles (biventricular 
      support considered as single device unit). In the PC cohort, 3 (75%) patients
      were weaned from support, while 4 (57%) were weaned from support in the PGF
      cohort. In the RHF cohort, 8 patients were bridged to long-term VAD and 5 were
      bridged to transplantation; heart function recovered and device explanted in 14, 
      while 8 patients died on support. There were no device failures. Overall, 34
      (74%) patients were recovered or bridged, with a 1-year survival of 54%.
      CONCLUSIONS: CentriMag proved to be a versatile, safe and effective short-term
      circulatory support for patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge to
      solution. Its use over 30 days is associated with acceptable survival and does
      not increase device-related complications.

TI  - Molecular changes after left ventricular assist device support for heart failure.
PG  - 777-91
LID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301413 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure is associated with remodeling that consists of adverse cellular,
      structural, and functional changes in the myocardium. Until recently, this was
      thought to be unidirectional, progressive, and irreversible. However,
      irreversibility has been shown to be incorrect because complete or partial
      reversal can occur that can be marked after myocardial unloading with a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD). Patients with chronic advanced heart failure
      can show near-normalization of nearly all structural abnormalities of the
      myocardium or reverse remodeling after LVAD support. However, reverse remodeling 
      does not always equate with clinical recovery. The molecular changes occurring
      after LVAD support are reviewed, both those demonstrated with LVAD unloading
      alone in patients bridged to transplantation and those occurring in the
      myocardium of patients who have recovered enough myocardial function to have the 
      device removed. Reverse remodeling may be attributable to a reversal of the
      pathological mechanisms that occur in remodeling or the generation of new
      pathways. A reduction in cell size occurs after LVAD unloading, which does not
      necessarily correlate with improved cardiac function. However, some of the
      changes in both the cardiac myocyte and the matrix after LVAD support are
      specific to myocardial recovery. In the myocyte, increases in the cytoskeletal
      proteins and improvements in the Ca(2)(+) handling pathway seem to be
      specifically associated with myocardial recovery. Changes in the matrix are
      complex, but excessive scarring appears to limit the ability for recovery, and
      the degree of fibrosis in the myocardium at the time of implantation may predict 
      the ability to recover.

AB  - During the last 20 years, the management of heart failure has significantly
      improved by means of new pharmacotherapies, more timely invasive treatments and
      device assisted therapies. Indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely with
      the development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), and the
      total artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with
      end-stage heart failure awaiting for transplantation. However, the transplant
      cannot be the only solution, due to an insufficient number of available donors,
      but also because of the high number of patients who are not candidates for severe
      comorbidities or advanced age. New perspectives are emerging in which the VAD is 
      no longer conceived only as a "Bridge to Transplant", but is now seen as a
      destination therapy. In this review, the main VAD classification, current basic
      indications, functioning modalities, main limitations of surgical VAD and the
      total artificial heart development are described.

TI  - Refractory heart failure dependent on short-term mechanical circulatory support: 
      what next? Heart transplant or long-term ventricular assist device.
PG  - 276-81
LID - 10.1111/aor.12157 [doi]
AB  - Chronic heart failure is a progressive and eventually fatal illness. Although the
      disease cannot be cured and treatment is symptom oriented, most of the patients
      benefit from optimum medical treatment. Patients with rapid deterioration in
      chronic advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment need inotropic
      support and may need intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain circulatory support,
      which of course cannot be prolonged beyond a certain limit. The outcome of heart 
      transplant and long-term ventricular assist device (VAD) in such patients is
      poor. The short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) offered to such
      patients not only provides effective circulatory support and stabilizes them
      hemodynamically, but also halts the ensuing or reverts the established end-organ 
      failure. As the name suggests, the short-term MCS offers support for the short
      term, usually less than a month. Although some patients with acute heart failure 
      experience recovery of myocardial function with short-term MCS support, others
      become dependent. These patients, stabilized and "stuck" with short-term MCS, can
      be "rescued" with long-term VAD or heart transplantation. Both the procedures,
      when done in this special situation, have their inherent advantages,
      disadvantages, and complications and hence need the careful consideration about
      the choice of the procedure. We have tried to elucidate this situation by
      considering the advantages and disadvantages of both options.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used in chronic end-stage heart
      failure as "bridge to transplantation" (BTT) and, more recently, for
      transplant-ineligible patients as "destination therapy" (DT). We reviewed the
      evidence on clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of 2 types of continuous-flow
      LVADs (HeartMate II [HM II] and HeartWare), for BTT and DT patients. We
      systematically searched the scientific literature (January 2008-June 2012) and
      identified 14 clinical studies (approximately 2900 HM II and approximately 200
      HeartWare patients), and 3 economic evaluations (HM II) using simulation models. 
      Data were, however, limited to 2-3 studies per outcome. We made policy
      recommendations on the basis of our systematic review. Although complications
      after implantation are frequent, LVAD therapy is often highly effective across
      transplantation eligibility status and device, with 1-year survival reaching 86% 
      for BTT and 78% for DT (compared with 25% for medical therapy). Neither BTT nor
      DT currently meet traditional cost-effectiveness limits in models using
      historical data, although BTT is standard practice for a limited number of
      patients in many regions. We found that BTT and DT as implantation strategies
      tend to be no longer mutually exclusive. We conclude that evidence is sufficient 
      to support LVAD use, regardless of transplantation eligibility status, as long as
      patients are carefully selected and program infrastructure and budget are
      adequate. However, evidence gaps, limitations in economic models, and the lack of
      Canadian data point to the importance of mandatory, systematic monitoring of LVAD
      use and outcomes.

      or protocol?*.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - When a person consents to have a ventricular assist device (VAD) implanted in
      one's heart, the intention is to extend life toward a new heart or toward more
      time. Complications may develop followed by frequent hospital admissions-most
      often in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting-rendering a transplant a distant
      reality and to discontinue the device means certain death. Emotional support for 
      patient and family is critical. Regardless of the original goal for the device,
      palliative care provides assistance in communication, goal setting, and symptom
      management and yet its consultation is often more for brink-of-death care than
      end-of-life care provided at the time of diagnosis of a life-threatening disease 
      such as heart failure. This study examined the recent deaths of hospitalized
      patients with VADs and the use of the palliative care service. Understanding the 
      benefit and timing of palliative care for VAD patients-particularly in the ICU
      setting--may improve the end-of-life experience for patients, families, and
      healthcare providers.

LID - S0003-4975(13)01159-4 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been used with increasing
      frequency to bridge small children to heart transplantation (HTx), but outcomes
      in large cohorts are not well established. METHODS: Small children (</= 10 kg)
      bridged to HTx with VADs between 2004 and 2010 were identified in the United
      Network for Organ Sharing database. Survival was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier
      method, and 2:1 propensity matching was used to compare outcomes with a
      well-matched control cohort of nonbridged HTx recipients. RESULTS: Of the 803
      small children who underwent HTx during the study period, 59 (7%) were bridged
      with a VAD. The proportion of recipients that were bridged with a VAD increased
      from 3% in 2004 to 9% in 2010 (p = 0.03). Kaplan-Meier 30-day, 6-month, and
      1-year survival was comparable between those bridged with a VAD and 118
      well-matched nonbridged children. Rates of postoperative renal failure,
      reoperation, infection, and rejection were also comparable. Those bridged with a 
      VAD had a significantly higher rate of postoperative stroke (8.5% vs 0.9%; p =
      0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Small children bridged to HTx with a VAD have early survival
      rates that are comparable to nonbridged children; however, this is achieved at
      the expense of a higher rate of stroke. Identifying the risk factors for early
      death and stroke in small children bridged to HTx with VADs is prudent as more
      experience with this patient population accumulates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide
      durable, reliable, energy-efficient long-term support. However, the biologic
      effects of continuous flow are not completely known. Therefore, we examined
      aortic wall morphology in patients with heart failure before and after prolonged 
      circulatory support with a continuous-flow LVAD. METHODS: After applying a
      partial aortic occlusion vascular clamp in the lower half of the ascending aorta,
      we removed samples of aortic wall tissue and then attached the outflow graft of
      the pump. Samples were obtained from 11 patients (9 men and 2 women, mean age 65 
      +/- 7 years) with severe heart failure at the time of LVAD implantation. We
      obtained matched specimens at explantation after heart transplantation (n = 5) or
      autopsy (n = 6). These specimens were removed from the distal ascending aorta,
      remote from the aortic anastomotic site. Tissue sections were stained with
      hematoxylin and eosin, Movat's pentachrome and Masson's trichrome. Smooth muscle 
      actin immunohistochemistry was performed on all sections. To evaluate the
      morphology of the aortic wall media, we quantitatively graded tissue sections for
      medial thickness, medial degenerative changes, smooth muscle cell (SMC)
      disorientation and depletion, elastic fiber fragmentation and depletion, medial
      fibrosis and atherosclerotic changes. RESULTS: The mean duration of support was
      140 +/- 136 days (range 87 to 580 days). The histologic evaluation and comparison
      of specimens obtained before and after LVAD support showed significantly
      increased foci of medial degeneration, SMC depletion, elastic fiber
      fragmentation, medial fibrosis and atherosclerotic changes after LVAD support.
      Mean medial thickness was not significantly different after LVAD support. We
      observed similar changes between samples obtained at transplantation and those
      obtained at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: After continuous-flow LVAD support, the
      morphology of the aortic wall media was altered in all of our patients. The
      clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiac transplantation is an effective surgical therapy for
      end-stage heart failure. Patients (pts) may need to be bridged with a continuous 
      flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) while on the transplant list as
      logistic factors like organ availability are unknown. Cardiac transplantation
      post-LVAD can be a surgically challenging procedure and outcome in these pts is
      perceived to be poorer based on experience with earlier generation pulsatile flow
      pumps. Data from a single institution comparing these pts with those undergoing
      direct transplantation in the present era of continuous flow device therapy are
      limited. AIM: Evaluate results of cardiac transplantation in pts bridged with a
      CF-LVAD (BTx) and compare outcomes with pts undergoing direct transplantation
      (Tx) in a single institution. RESULTS: From June 2007 till January 2012, 106 pts 
      underwent cardiac transplantation. Among these, 37 (35%) pts (51+/-11 years; 85% 
      male) were bridged with a CF-LVAD (BTx), while 70 (65%) comprised the Tx group
      (53+/-12 years; 72% males). The median duration of LVAD support was 227 (153,327)
      days. During the period of LVAD support, 10/37 (27%) pts were upgraded to status 
      1A and all were successfully transplanted. Median hospital stay in the BTx (14
      days) was slightly longer than the Tx group (12 days) but not statistically
      significant (p=0.21). In-hospital mortality in the BTx (5%) and Tx (1%) were
      comparable (p=0.25). Estimated late survival in the BTx cohort was 94+/-7,
      90+/-10 and 83+/-16% at the end of one, two and three years, respectively which
      was comparable to 97+/-4%, 93+/-6% and 89+/-9% for the Tx group (p=0.50).
      CONCLUSION: Cardiac transplantation after LVAD implant can be performed with
      excellent results. Patients can be supported on the left ventricular assist
      device even for periods close to a year with good outcome after cardiac
      transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection is a serious complication of left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) therapy. Published data regarding LVAD-associated infections (LVADIs) are 
      limited by single-center experiences and use of nonstandardized definitions.
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 247 patients who underwent continuous-flow
      LVAD implantation from January 2005 to December 2011 at Mayo Clinic campuses in
      Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida. LVADIs were defined using the International
      Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria. RESULTS: We identified 101
      episodes of LVADI in 78 patients (32%) from this cohort. Mean age (+/- standard
      deviation [SD]) was 57+/-15 years. The majority (94%) underwent Heartmate II
      implantation, with 62% LVADs placed as destination therapy. The most common type 
      of LVADIs were driveline infections (47%), followed by bloodstream infections
      (24% VAD related, and 22% non-VAD related). The most common causative pathogens
      included gram-positive cocci (45%), predominantly staphylococci, and nosocomial
      gram-negative bacilli (27%). Almost half (42%) of the patients were managed by
      chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy. While 14% of the patients had
      intraoperative debridement, only 3 underwent complete LVAD removal. The average
      duration (+/-SD) of LVAD support was 1.5+/-1.0 years. At year 2 of follow-up, the
      cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was estimated to be 43%. CONCLUSION: 
      Clinical manifestations of LVADI vary on the basis of the type of infection and
      the causative pathogen. Mortality remained high despite combined medical and
      surgical intervention and chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy. Based on
      clinical experiences, a management algorithm for LVADI is proposed to assist in
      the decision-making process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A percentage of patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      require device exchange. Although this is an important clinical entity, there are
      only a handful of relevant studies on this topic in the literature. METHODS: From
      2004 to 2012, 30 device exchanges (HeartMate II to HeartMate II) were performed. 
      Since June 2011, we have employed the subcostal approach for device exchange if
      indicated. Sixteen patients underwent device exchange through a subcostal
      approach (S group), whereas 14 patients had devices exchanged through a full
      sternotomy (F group). Pre- and post-operative data were retrospectively reviewed.
      RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline patient characteristics between the 
      two groups. Overall, mean duration between primary surgery and device exchange
      was 425 +/- 407 days. Surgical indications included device thrombus/hemolysis (N 
      = 19), device malfunction (N = 9) and infection (N = 2). Cardiopulmonary bypass
      time was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 40 +/- 23 minutes, F: 105 +/-
      84 minutes; p < 0.05), and post-operative bleeding within 24 hours after surgery 
      was less in the S group (S: 362 +/- 367 ml, F: 1,286 +/- 971 ml; p < 0.05).
      Length of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 4.6 +/- 1.8 days,
      F: 8.2 +/- 4.9 days; p < 0.05). There was no difference in post-operative
      complications, except for prolonged intubation (F: N = 6 [43%], S: N = 1 [6.3%]; 
      p < 0.05). There were 3 deaths in the F group and 0 in the S group, with no
      statistical difference (p = 0.09). Also, there was no significant difference in
      other outcomes, including transplantation, device explantation and ongoing LVAD
      support. CONCLUSIONS: A subcostal approach may be preferred for HeartMate II
      device exchange if indicated.

TI  - Outcome of unplanned right ventricular assist device support for severe right
      heart failure after implantable left ventricular assist device insertion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) becomes necessary
      for severe right ventricular (RV) failure after left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) insertion. Although temporary support could lead to successful RVAD
      weaning in certain patients, the data remain scarce. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      reviewed 398 patients who underwent implantable LVAD insertion between January
      2000 and December 2012. Of these patients, 44 (11%) required unplanned RVAD
      support due to severe RV failure after LVAD insertion. For comparison, 37
      patients who underwent planned biventricular assist device (BiVAD) insertion were
      identified during the same study period. We analyzed the early and late outcomes 
      in these patients. RESULTS: The mean duration of RVAD support was 21 +/- 23 days.
      Of the 44 patients, 21 (49%) were weaned from the RVAD (weaning group), whereas
      23 (51%) required continued biventricular support (failure group). The failure
      group had ongoing end-organ dysfunction after RVAD insertion. Hospital mortality 
      was significantly lower in the weaning group (24%) and in the planned BiVAD group
      (30%) as compared to the failure group (74%, p = 0.0009). The 6-month actuarial
      survival rate was 75% in the weaning group, 62% in the planned BiVAD group and
      13% in the failure group (p < 0.0001). Successful bridge to transplant was
      achieved in 14 patients (67%) in the weaning group as compared with 8 patients
      (35%) in the failure group (p = 0.03). On multivariate logistic regression
      analyses, pre-operative white blood cell (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.50, p = 0.016) and creatinine (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.079 to
      0.88, p = 0.03) levels were significant predictors for RVAD removal. CONCLUSIONS:
      Among patients who developed acute RV failure after LVAD insertion, only half
      could be weaned from the temporary RVAD support. An alternative strategy is
      necessary in patients who require continuous RVAD support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulomatous myocarditis may develop into cardiomyopathy and severe 
      congestive heart failure that requires implantation of a left ventricular assist 
      device (LVAD). METHODS: Left ventricular (LV) core samples were collected from
      177 patients with severe heart failure at the time of LVAD implantation, and
      samples were histologically examined and graded for severity of hypertrophy and
      fibrosis. Granulomatous myocarditis incidentally seen in a subset of samples was 
      characterized by staining and culturing for mycobacteria and fungi. Various
      clinical parameters in these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 177 LV core 
      samples examined, 6 (3.4%) showed nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in
      the myocardial wall. Stains and cultures for mycobacteria and fungi were
      negative. All six patients [three women, three men; five African American, one
      Asian; mean age, 52+/-9 years (range, 41-61 years)] had arrhythmias and required 
      an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Before LVAD implantation,
      the patients' mean cardiac index was 1.8+/-0.4 l/min/m(2); cardiac output,
      2.9+/-0.6 l/min; and ejection fraction, 20+/-2%. One year after LVAD
      implantation, one patient had undergone heart transplantation. At 2 years, a
      second patient was transplanted, and one died. At 3 years, a third patient was
      transplanted and died postoperatively; two patients remained on support. No
      clinical evidence indicated involvement of other organs or recurrence in the
      transplanted patients. CONCLUSION: The incidental diagnosis of granulomatous
      myocarditis in our patients indicates that histological study of LV core samples 
      in patients who undergo LVAD implantation may contribute to the diagnosis and be 
      a consideration in the management of the underlying cause of heart failure.

TI  - Organ allocation in adults with congenital heart disease listed for heart

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) listed for heart
      transplantation are rarely supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs). This
      may be a disadvantage to their priority for organ allocation. We sought to
      determine the relationship between VAD implantation and successful
      transplantation among patients listed for heart transplant. METHODS: Adults with 
      CHD patients (N = 1,250) were identified from the United Network for Organ
      Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2010 and compared to patients without
      congenital etiology for heart failure (N = 59,606). VAD use at listing, listing
      status, status upgrades and reasons for upgrade prior to transplant were trended 
      at 5-year intervals and appropriate statistical comparisons were made between
      groups. RESULTS: Since 1985, VAD use prior to transplant has increased
      significantly in patients without CHD, but not in CHD patients (17% vs 3% in 2006
      to 2010, p < 0.0001). CHD patients were more likely to be listed as Status 2,
      compared to those without (66% vs 40%, p < 0.001 for 2006 to 2010), and less
      likely to be upgraded to Status 1 after listing (43% vs 55%, p = 0.03). Among
      those upgraded to Status 1, CHD patients were less likely to have a VAD at
      transplant than those without (3% vs 18%, p = 0.005). VAD use was more likely to 
      result in death in CHD patients. CONCLUSIONS: VAD use is less common in CHD
      patients than in patients without CHD, both at the time of listing and
      transplantation. Reduced VAD use appears to contribute to lower listing status
      and organ allocation. These differences have grown more disparate over time.
      Separate criteria for organ allocation for CHD patients may be justified.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine the relationships between right
      ventricular (RV) function, body composition, and prognosis in patients with
      advanced heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Previous studies investigating
      HF-related cachexia have not examined the impact of RV function on body
      composition. We hypothesized that RV dysfunction is linked to weight loss,
      abnormal body composition, and worsened prognosis in advanced HF. METHODS:
      Subjects with advanced HF (n = 408) underwent prospective assessment of body
      composition (skinfold thickness, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), comprehensive
      echocardiography, and blood testing. Subjects were followed up for adverse events
      (defined as death, transplantation, or circulatory assist device). RESULTS:
      Subjects with RV dysfunction (51%) had lower body mass index, lower fat mass
      index, and were more likely to display cachexia (19%). The extent of RV
      dysfunction correlated with greater antecedent weight loss and a lower fat/lean
      body mass ratio. Over a median follow-up of 541 days, there were 150 events
      (37%). Risk of event was greater in subjects with RV dysfunction (hazard ratio:
      3.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18 to 4.45]) and cachexia (hazard ratio:
      2.90 [95% CI: 2.00 to 4.12]) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Increased
      body mass index was associated with a lower event rate (HR per kg/m(2): 0.92 [95%
      CI: 0.88 to 0.96]), and this protection was mediated by a higher fat mass (0.91
      [95% CI: 0.87 to 0.96]) but not a fat-free mass index (0.97 [95% CI: 0.92 to
      1.03]). CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction and cardiac cachexia often coexist, have
      additive adverse impact, and might be mechanistically interrelated. Wasting of
      fat but not of lean mass was predictive of adverse outcome, suggesting that fat
      loss is either a surrogate of enhanced catabolism or adipose tissue is
      cardioprotective in the context of HF.

TI  - Safety and feasibility of mapping and stem cell delivery in the presence of an
      implanted left ventricular assist device: a preclinical investigation in sheep.
PG  - 229-34
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the safety and feasibility of
      performing transendocardial electromechanical mapping and mesenchymal precursor
      stem cell injections after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in 
      a sheep model of acute myocardial infarction. Six sheep were assigned to either
      an acute or chronic group. Then we created an acute myocardial infarction in each
      by occluding the distal left anterior descending coronary artery with a balloon
      for 90 minutes. All the sheep underwent LVAD implantation 30 days later. On the
      same day, sheep in the acute group underwent transendocardial cell injections and
      were euthanized. Sheep in the chronic group received cell injections 2 weeks
      after LVAD implantation and were euthanized 30 days later. The presence of the
      LVAD or the use of chest-closure wires did not interfere with electromechanical
      mapping. Furthermore, no adverse events were observed during electromechanical
      mapping or the stem cell injections. In all sheep, the LVAD flow rate was
      approximately 4 L/min during mapping and the injections, and no adjustments were 
      required. Histologic analysis confirmed that the mesenchymal precursor stem cells
      were successfully delivered. No differences were observed between the acute and
      chronic groups. In conclusion, our study showed that transendocardial
      electromechanical mapping and stem cell injections are safe and feasible in the
      presence of an LVAD. Surgically implanted metal devices, including the LVAD,
      steel chest-closure wire, and skin staples, were compatible with the
      electromechanical mapping system.

LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hft127 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Heart transplantation (HTx) is limited by the scarcity of suitable donor
      hearts. Consequently, more patients with advanced heart failure require a
      ventricular assist device (VAD). We report U.K. activity, trends, and outcome for
      long-term VAD support as a bridging therapy to HTx. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients
      were grouped into three eras: E1, February 2004-March 2006; E2, April 2006-March 
      2009; and E3, April 2009-March 2011. Exclusions were patients who received
      isolated short-term support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation without prior 
      or subsequent long-term VAD support. A total of 247 patients received VAD
      support; 202 left ventricular (LVAD) support alone and 45 both left and right
      ventricular support. Activity increased over time, from 36 patients implanted in 
      E1 to 123 in E3. Overall, 46 patients received a first-generation device, 80 a
      second-generation device, and 121 a third-generation device. Use of
      third-generation devices increased from <6% in E1 to 78% in E3. Median duration
      of LVAD support increased from 141 days in E1 to 578 days in E3 (P < 0.001).
      Overall survival to 1 year after LVAD implant rose from 58.3% [95% confidence
      interval (CI) 40.7-72.4%] in E1 to 72.5% (95% CI 63.3-79.8%) in E3 (P = 0.21),
      and improved significantly with device generation; at 1 year, 50% of patients
      with first-generation devices were alive compared with 68.1% and 76.9% of
      patients with second- and third-generation devices, respectively (P = 0.002).
      These differences remained after risk adjustment. HTx following LVAD implant
      reduced over time (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: VAD activity and duration of support
      have increased. There has been a shift from first- and second- to
      third-generation devices, and an associated improvement in survival.

AB  - The left ventricular apical core biopsy performed during implantation of a left
      ventricular assist device (VAD) is a well-known diagnostic procedure in
      confirming cardiomyopathies leading to end-stage heart failure. We describe a
      patient in whom disseminated malignancy was revealed by means of the apical core 
      biopsy after extracorporeal life support and left ventricular assist device
      implantation as a bridge to transplantation. This case emphasizes the importance 
      of thorough oncological screening before VAD implantation and the possible
      consequences of circulating tumour cells in this device-assisted circulation.

TI  - Increased incidence of angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract and bleeding 
      in patients with continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).
PG  - 449-54
LID - 10.5301/ijao.5000224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (cfLVADs) are used in
      clinical practice for the management of end-stage heart failure. Axial flow
      cfLVADS have been associated with increased rates of adverse gastrointestinal
      events such as bleeding angiodysplasia. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the incidence of bleeding gastrointestinal tract angiodysplasia and the
      profile of patients supported with the centrifugal cfLVAD, referred for
      endoscopy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 66 patients implanted with
      Ventrassist (n = 33) and Heartware (n = 33) centrifugal continuous flow LVADs was
      performed. All patients were on warfarin, aspirin and/or clopidogrel. Endoscopy
      was performed in all patients with either active gastrointestinal bleeding (n =
      6) or anemia with positive fecal occult blood (n = 6). RESULTS: Bleeding
      gastrointestinal angiodysplasia was demonstrated in 5 out of the 12 (41.6%)
      patients who underwent endoscopy from the cohort of 66 cfLVAD supported patients 
      (7.6%). The incidence of bleeding angiodysplasia was higher than the
      age-standardized rate of andiodysplasia from literature (0.8%). Active
      gastrointestinal bleeding in one other patient was due to diverticulosis. The
      five patients with bleeding angiodysplasia tended to be older than the remaining 
      61 patients (58.8 +/- 10.3 vs 49.6 +/- 15.7 years, p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: We
      found excess bleeding angiodysplasia in patients on centrifugal cfLVAD support.
      It may be appropriate to screen for angiodysplasia particularly in older patients
      prior to support by centrifugal cf LVADs. Reasons for the higher rate of bleeding
      angiodysplasia in cfLVAD patients warrant further study.

TI  - Pentoxifylline for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in a patient who developed

      assist device support.
PG  - 526-7
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f0eb1 [doi]
AB  - Pentoxifylline is an agent that improves red blood cell deformability (known as a
      hemorrheologic effect) and reduces blood viscosity. Here, we present a case of a 
      patient with hemolytic anemia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      device (CF-LVAD) implantation that was successfully treated with pentoxifylline. 
      Our case is a 64-year-old African American woman who was implanted with a
      HeartMate II device on August 6, 2010, as a bridge to transplant for end-stage
      heart failure. Her postoperative course was complicated by recurrent
      gastrointestinal bleeding and antiplatelet therapy was discontinued. On October
      25, 2011, she was readmitted with anemia and hemoglobin of 6.6 mg/dl and no
      identifiable source of bleeding. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 936 IU/L,
      indicating severe hemolysis. Due to her evidence of hemolytic anemia and her
      inability to tolerate antiplatelet therapy due to recurrent bleeding, she was
      discharged on pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily on October 27, 2011, with
      hemoglobin of 11.2 mg/dl after transfusion. After 60 days of pentoxifylline, her 
      hemoglobin and LDH in clinic were 10.1 mg/dl and 223 IU/L, respectively. The
      patient was successfully bridged to transplant in June 2012. Additional analysis 
      of pentoxifylline as a therapeutic modality to manage hemolytic anemia after
      CF-LVAD implantation may be warranted.

PG  - 469-73
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829be026 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that the addition of mitral valve replacement or repair (MVR) to 
      implantation of continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cf-LVAD) may
      further decrease pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) over Heartmate II (HMII)
      implantation alone. Patients undergoing MVR with concomitant HMII implantation
      were compared with those undergoing HMII implantation alone. Of the 57 patients
      undergoing cf-LVAD implantation, 21 (36.8%) underwent concomitant MVR and 36
      (63.2%) underwent cf-LVAD implantation alone. Patients receiving MVR had greater 
      decrement in PVR (59.4% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.01). Decrease in end-diastolic diameter 
      was greater for patients receiving MVR but did not reach statistical significance

      hours, p = 0.45) and inotropic support (162.4 vs. 153.2 hours, p = 0.86), change 
      in creatinine (0.19 vs. -0.26 mg/dl, p = 0.34), increase in bilirubin (2.54 vs.
      1.55 mg/dl, p = 0.63), intensive care unit stay (168.0 vs. 231.5 hours, p =
      0.38), and overall length of stay (32.0 vs. 42.5 days, p = 0.75) were similar.
      There was no difference in survival at 3 months (89.7% vs. 83.3%) and 1 year
      (83.7 vs. 67.3%, p = 0.34). Addition of MVR may result in greater decrement of
      PVR than HMII implantation alone. This may permit certain patients thought to be 
      ineligible for transplantation to become candidates.

AB  - Increasing incidence of end-stage heart failure and limited availability of donor
      organs have led to longer waiting times for cardiac transplantation and
      subsequently increasing mortality. Ventricular assist device therapy is fast
      becoming an accepted alternative treatment to treat end-stage heart failure and
      is being implemented as a bridge to decision, bridge to myocardial recovery,
      bridge to heart transplantation or as a destination therapy. LVADs not only
      enable hemodynamic stabilization and recovery of secondary organ failure in
      severely ill patients, but have also been shown to reduce pulmonary vascular
      resistance in nontransplantable candidates. Technology of ventricular assist
      devices has evolved over several decades of time and generations of devices. The 
      HVAD(R) Pump (HeartWare International, Inc., MA, USA) is a third-generation,
      miniaturized, continuous-flow ventricular assist device. Due to its miniaturized 
      housing and intrapericardial placing, it can be used proficiently to support the 
      right ventricle and has also demonstrated great utility in minimally invasive and
      off-pump implantation, exchange and explantation. It is favored for similar
      reasons in adolescents and in heart failure due to complex congenital heart
      disease. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical use of
      HeartWare(R) Ventricular Assist System (HeartWare System; HeartWare
      International, Inc.) with different strategies pertaining to its advantages and
      adverse events in comparison with contemporary devices.

AB  - The Levitronix CentriMag is approved in Europe for 30 days as uni- or
      biventricular support in acute heart failure as a bridge to recovery, bridge to
      heart transplantation or to a long-term left ventricular assist device (LVAD). We
      report the case of a patient who was supported with the same Levitronix CentriMag
      pump for 119 days without changing any components of the circuit or the pump head
      because of an anatomical condition which precluded the feasibility of pump
      exchange and who did not experience any mechanical failure of the impeller but
      eventually died due to the rupture of the cannulae. This is the first report of
      failure of paracorporeal short-term LVAD due to disruption of one cannula with a 
      properly functioning pump.

TI  - The role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in patients with continuous
      flow left ventricular assist devices.
PG  - 668-74
LID - 10.1161/CIRCEP.113.000457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis for patients experiencing ventricular arrhythmias (VAs)
      while on continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support has not
      been well elucidated. Accordingly, the role of implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in this patient population remains undefined. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Records of 106 consecutive patients undergoing implantation 
      of the HeartMate II LVAD at a single center were reviewed. For patients surviving
      >30 days postimplant (98 patients), the impact of VAs and ICDs on survival was
      analyzed. Mean age was 56.6+/-11.4 years, 82.1% were male, 42.5% had an ischemic 
      cardiomyopathy, 87.7% were bridge to transplantation, and median length of
      support was 217 days. Twenty-one (19.8%) patients died, 60 (56.6%) survived to
      transplantation, and 25 patients (23.6%) reached the end of study, had the LVAD
      explanted, or were lost to follow-up. Post-LVAD VAs occurred in 37 patients
      (34.9%) but were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.58
      [0.18-1.90]). Sixty-two (63.3%) patients had an active ICD, and 36 (36.7%)
      patients had no ICD or an inactivated ICD post-LVAD. Patients with an ICD were
      more likely to be INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support) level 3 or 4 at the time of implant (54.8% versus 33.3%;
      P=0.04). An appropriate shock was delivered in 27.3% of patients, but the
      presence of an active ICD was not associated with improved survival (hazard
      ratio, 1.12 [0.37-3.35]). CONCLUSIONS: VAs are common in patients with continuous
      flow LVADs. Although some episodes may be clinically significant, VAs are not
      associated with a worse prognosis, and concomitant ICDs in these patients may not
      reduce mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether left ventricular dyssynchrony (LVD) at baseline is 
      predictive for long-term outcome in heart failure (CHF) patients with left
      ventricular (LV) dysfunction and conduction disturbances treated with cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT). METHODS: In 535 consecutive individuals with CHF
      scheduled for implantation of a CRT device, LVD was assessed by tissue Doppler
      imaging (TDI), defined as an electromechanical delay (EMD) difference of >/=40 ms
      in 2 opposed left ventricular wall regions (septal vs. lateral, anterior vs.
      inferior). All-cause mortality, heart transplantation, or assist device
      implantation was defined as combined primary end point. Secondary end points were
      measures of reverse LV remodeling and of symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Mean
      follow-up was 68 +/- 36 [range: 4-150] months. LVD at baseline was present in 308
      patients (61%). Of these, 24% reached the combined primary endpoint in contrast
      to 58% of patients without LVD (p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with LVD showed
      pronounced improvement of all secondary end point parameters. In our cohort LVD
      was an independent predictor for outcome (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.30
      [0.21-0.42], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LVD at baseline as assessed by TDI is
      associated with a more pronounced clinical improvement and is a predictor for
      transplant-free long-term survival in CRT recipients.

      assist device: clinical practice and outcome after extended support.
PG  - e233-8
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt347 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated our single-centre clinical experience with the HeartMate
      II (HM II) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation
      (BTT) in end-stage heart failure (HF) patients. METHODS: Survival rates,
      echocardiographic parameters, laboratory values and adverse events of 85
      consecutive patients supported with a HM II were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall,
      mean age was 45 +/- 13 years, 62 (73%) were male and non-ischaemic dilatated
      cardiomyopathy was present in 60 (71%) patients. The median duration of
      mechanical support was 387 days (IQR 150-600), with a range of 1-1835 days. The
      6-month, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year survival rates during HM II LVAD support were 85, 
      81, 76, 76 and 68%, respectively. Echocardiographic parameters demonstrated
      effective left ventricular unloading, while laboratory results reflected adequate
      organ perfusion. However, HM II support was associated with adverse events, such 
      as infections in 42 patients (49%; 0.67 events/patient-year), cardiac arrhythmia 
      in 44 (52%; 0.86 events/patient-year), bleeding complications in 32 (38%; 0.43
      events/patient-year) and neurological dysfunction in 17 (20%; 0.19
      events/patient-year). CONCLUSIONS: In view of the increasing shortage of donor
      hearts, HM II LVAD support may be considered a life-saving treatment in end-stage
      HF patients, with good survival. However, it is still associated with some
      serious adverse events, of which neurological complications are the most
      critical.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support emerged for the pediatric population in the late
      1980s as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. The Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) 
      (SynCardia Systems Inc., Tuscon, AZ) has been approved for compassionate use by
      the Food and Drug Administration for patients with end-stage biventricular heart 
      failure as a bridge to heart transplantation since 1985 and has had FDA approval 
      since 2004. However, of the 1,061 patients placed on the TAH-t, only 21 (2%) were
      under the age 18. SynCardia Systems, Inc. recommends a minimum patient body
      surface area (BSA) of 1.7 m(2), thus, limiting pediatric application of this
      device. This unique case report shares this pediatric institution's first
      experience with the TAH-t. A 14-year-old male was admitted with dilated
      cardiomyopathy and severe biventricular heart failure. The patient rapidly
      decompensated, requiring extracorporeal life support. An echocardiogram revealed 
      severe biventricular dysfunction and diffuse clot formation in the left ventricle
      and outflow tract. The decision was made to transition to biventricular assist
      device. The biventricular failure and clot formation helped guide the team to the
      TAH-t, in spite of a BSA (1.5 m(2)) below the recommendation of 1.7 m(2). A
      computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, in conjunction with a novel
      three-dimensional (3D) modeling system and team, assisted in determining
      appropriate fit. Chest CT and 3D modeling following implantation were utilized to
      determine all major vascular structures were unobstructed and the bronchi were
      open. The virtual 3D model confirmed appropriate device fit with no evidence of
      compression to the left pulmonary veins. The postoperative course was complicated
      by a left lung opacification. The left lung anomalies proved to be atelectasis
      and improved with aggressive recruitment maneuvers. The patient was supported for
      11 days prior to transplantation. Chest CT and 3D modeling were crucial in
      assessing whether the device would fit, as well as postoperative complications in
      this smaller pediatric patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Full unloading of the left ventricle (LV) in chronic heart failure
      (CHF) induces reversal of LV dilation and geometric distortion. In this study we 
      describe the partial unloading effects in ischemic CHF. METHODS: Six weeks after 
      myocardial infarction, sheep were randomized to partial support ("pump," n = 5), 
      as provided by the CircuLite Synergy micro-pump, or to no therapy ("sham," n = 6)
      for an additional 6 weeks. At baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks after infarction,
      pressure-volume (PV) recordings were made. Systolic and diastolic functions were 
      characterized by the end-systolic volume (ESV) where LV end-systolic pressure
      reached 90 mm Hg (V90), and the end-diastolic volume (EDV) where LV end-diastolic
      pressure reached 15 mm Hg (V15), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      was performed 6 and 12 weeks after infarction. During autopsy at 12 weeks,
      isolated LVs were weighed. Histologically, the degree of fibrosis in the
      non-infarcted area was assessed using systematic randomized sampling, and myocyte
      hypertrophy was measured by the mean linear intercept method. RESULTS: At 6
      weeks, PV measurements showed a V90 and V15 increase (p = NS between groups). Six
      weeks later, V90 and V15 increased in the sham group. In the pump group, V90
      decreased but V15 did not change significantly. At 6 weeks, MRI indicated no
      significant difference between groups. Six weeks later, in the sham group, EDV
      and ESV increased significantly. In the pump group, EDV decreased significantly
      and ESV trended to decrease. Sphericity index increased in the sham group and
      decreased in the pump group, although not significantly. Explanted LV masses were
      significantly higher in the sham group than in the pump group. The pump group had
      a decrease in fibrosis and less myocyte hypertrophy. CONCLUSION: Partial support 
      6 weeks after major myocardial infarction halts and reverses ventricular dilation
      and hypertrophy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predictors of right ventricular failure (RVF) in patients with left
      ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have not been fully elucidated and are
      comprised mostly of clinical variables. We evaluated echocardiographic parameters
      associated with adverse outcomes in this population. METHODS: Transthoracic
      echocardiograms (TTEs) before continuous-flow LVAD implantation were analyzed in 
      109 patients. Twenty-six 2-dimensional and Doppler parameters were assessed for
      their association with the primary outcome of 30-day RVF, defined as a
      requirement of an RV assist device or >/= 14 consecutive days of inotropic
      support, and the secondary composite outcome of 30-day death or RVF. Multivariate
      analysis adjusted for known clinical risk prediction models was performed.
      RESULTS: Overall, 25 (22.9%) and 27 (24.8%) patients reached the primary and
      secondary end-points, respectively. An increased RV/LV diameter ratio was the
      only TTE variable independently associated with both the primary (odds ratio [OR]
      = 5.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.40 to 12.40; p = 0.012) and secondary (OR 
      = 2.70; 95% CI 1.06 to 6.22; p = 0.03) outcomes after multivariate analysis.
      Scatterplot analysis with regression determined the optimal cut-off value for
      RV/LV diameter to be 0.75. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, an 
      increased RV/LV diameter ratio provided an additional predictive value to
      clinical risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: A TTE-measured RV/LV diameter ratio of >/=0.75
      is independently associated with a higher risk for RVF in patients with
      continuous-flow LVAD. When used alone, this simple, easily derived, practical
      echocardiographic measurement has a predictive value equivalent to known clinical
      risk scores, whereas their combination provides stronger risk prediction for
      adverse outcomes.

TI  - Interactions of the heart and the liver.
PG  - 2804-11
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht246 [doi]
AB  - There is a mutual interaction between the function of the heart and the liver and
      a broad spectrum of acute and chronic entities that affect both the heart and the
      liver. These can be classified into heart diseases affecting the liver, liver
      diseases affecting the heart, and conditions affecting the heart and the liver at
      the same time. In chronic and acute cardiac hepatopathy, owing to cardiac
      failure, a combination of reduced arterial perfusion and passive congestion leads
      to cardiac cirrhosis and cardiogenic hypoxic hepatitis. These conditions may
      impair the liver function and treatment should be directed towards the primary
      heart disease and seek to secure perfusion of vital organs. In patients with
      advanced cirrhosis, physical and/or pharmacological stress may reveal a reduced
      cardiac performance with systolic and diastolic dysfunction and electrophysical
      abnormalities termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Electrophysiological abnormalities
      include prolonged QT interval, chronotropic incompetance, and electromechanical
      uncoupling. No specific therapy can be recommended, but it should be supportive
      and directed against the heart failure. Numerous conditions affect both the heart
      and the liver such as infections, inflammatory and systemic diseases, and chronic
      alcoholism. The risk and prevalence of coronary artery disease are increasing in 
      cirrhotic patients and since the perioperative mortality is high, a careful
      cardiac evaluation of such patients is required prior to orthotopic liver
      transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown remarkable decrease in size of the left
      ventricle after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation due to
      mechanical unloading. However, a certain number of patients continue to have
      significant mitral regurgitation (MR) under LVAD support. We investigated
      pre-operative echocardiographic features associated with persistent MR after LVAD
      implantation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 82 consecutive patients
      undergoing continuous-flow LVAD implantation between 2007 and 2010. We obtained
      echocardiograms performed within 2 weeks before and 1 week after surgery. We
      investigated the pre-operative echocardiographic findings associated with
      significant MR post-LVAD and compared 1-year mortality after LVAD surgery between
      patients with and without significant MR post-LVAD. RESULTS: MR was significant
      in 43 patients (52.4%) before LVAD surgery. Among those, 5 underwent concomitant 
      mitral valve repair (MVr) at the time of LVAD implantation. Of the remaining 38
      patients, 25 (65.8%) showed improvement of MR, whereas 13 patients (34.2%)
      continued to have significant MR post-LVAD. Multivariate analysis revealed that
      posterior displacement of the coaptation point of mitral leaflets was
      significantly associated with significant MR post-LVAD (hazard ratio, 1.335; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.035-1.721; p = 0.026) even after adjusting for the amount 
      of pre-operative MR flow. Post-LVAD 1-year survival of patients with and without 
      significant MR post-LVAD was not significantly different (92.3% vs 89.1%, p =
      0.826). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-LVAD posterior displacement of mitral leaflets may be
      indicative of post-operative significant MR, which would help identify
      echocardiographic features of functional MR refractory to simple volume reduction
      of the ventricle.

TI  - Clinical differences between continuous flow ventricular assist devices: a
      comparison between HeartMate II and HeartWare HVAD.
PG  - 604-10
LID - 10.1111/jocs.12158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD) is a new generation
      centrifugal flow VAD recently introduced in Canada. The objective of this study
      was to compare the HVAD device to the HeartMate II (HMII) axial flow device. Very
      few studies have compared clinical outcomes between newer generation VADs.
      METHODS: All perioperative and follow-up data on LVAD recipients were collected
      prospectively in our institutional database. Between January 2006 and April 2012,
      46 consecutive patients underwent implantation of either an HVAD (n=13) or a HMII
      (n=33) device. Pre-implant demographics, perioperative and postoperative clinical
      outcomes were reviewed between groups. RESULTS: Overall, the baseline
      characteristics, demographics, co-morbidities and laboratory values were
      comparable between the two groups. The majority of the patients were Interagency 
      Registry for Mechanical Assisted Circulatory Support 3-4 (92% in both groups) and
      most of the patients were bridge to transplant (75% in HMII vs. 79% in HVAD).
      Survival and the incidence of perioperative bleeding, renal dysfunction, liver
      dysfunction, and infection were similar between the groups. However, HVAD devices
      had a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (31% vs.
      0% in HMII patients, p<0.01) and stroke (44% vs. 10% in HMII patients, at one
      year p=0.04). Hemorrhagic strokes were more frequent in patients with HVAD (three
      of the five episodes vs. one of the three episodes in HMII patients, p=0.06).
      CONCLUSION: While device complications were comparable, patients with HVAD
      experienced a significantly higher incidence of stroke and GI bleeding and
      therefore refinement in patients' management may decrease incidence of these
      complications.

TI  - The failing Fontan: what's NEXT...?
PG  - 89-93
LID - 10.1177/0267659113495913 [doi]
AB  - The Fontan procedure represents the final stage of the transition to single
      ventricle physiology. Conversion of very complex congenital heart anatomy, such
      as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, double-outlet right ventricle or double-inlet
      left ventricle, to a single ventricle has grown in popularity as morbidity and
      mortality have improved. As these patients grow, survivors are at risk for
      impaired ventricular dysfunction, plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy 
      and late failure. Late failing Fontan patients represent a particularly vexing
      scenario for clinicians, as the only durable treatment option is cardiac
      transplantation. However, in the short-term, some of these patients require
      support beyond medical management, with mechanical circulatory support via
      extracorporeal life support or a ventricular assist device. We report the
      successful bridge of an adolescent female post-Fontan conversion with late severe
      cardiac failure. The patient was initially resuscitated with extracorporeal life 
      support, transitioned to a single Berlin Heart EXCOR(R) ventricular assist device
      and, subsequently, underwent successful cardiac transplantation.

TI  - Background and design of the profiling biobehavioral responses to mechanical
      support in advanced heart failure study.
PG  - 405-15
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0b013e318299fa09 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unexplained heterogeneity in response to ventricular assist device
      (VAD) implantation for the management of advanced heart failure impedes our
      ability to predict favorable outcomes, provide adequate patient and family
      education, and personalize monitoring and symptom management strategies. The
      purpose of this article was to describe the background and the design of a study 
      entitled "Profiling Biobehavioral Responses to Mechanical Support in Advanced
      Heart Failure" (PREMISE). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PREMISE is a prospective
      cohort study designed to (1) identify common and distinct trajectories of change 
      in physical and psychological symptom burden; (2) characterize common
      trajectories of change in serum biomarkers of myocardial stress, systemic
      inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction; and (3) quantify associations between 
      symptoms and biomarkers of pathogenesis in adults undergoing VAD implantation.
      Latent growth mixture modeling, including parallel process and
      cross-classification modeling, will be used to address the study aims and will
      entail identifying trajectories, quantifying associations between trajectories
      and both clinical and quality-of-life outcomes, and identifying predictors of
      favorable symptom and biomarker responses to VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS:
      Research findings from the PREMISE study will be used to enhance shared patient
      and provider decision making and to shape a much-needed new breed of
      interventions and clinical management strategies that are tailored to
      differential symptom and pathogenic responses to VAD implantation.

TI  - Cognitive change in heart failure: a systematic review.
PG  - 451-60
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment, highly prevalent in patients with heart failure
      (HF), increases risk for hospitalization and mortality. However, the course of
      cognitive change in HF is not well characterized. The purpose of this systematic 
      review was to examine the available evidence longitudinal changes in cognitive
      function in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: A literature search of several
      electronic databases was performed. Studies published from January 1, 1980, to
      September 30, 2012, that used validated measures to diagnose HF and assess
      cognitive function >/=2x in adults with HF were eligible for inclusion. Change in
      cognitive function was examined in the context of HF treatments applied (eg,
      medication initiation, left ventricular assist device implantation), length of
      follow-up, and comparison group. Fifteen studies met eligibility criteria.
      Significant decline in cognitive function was noted among patients with HF
      followed up for >1 year. Improvements in cognition were observed among patients
      with HF undergoing interventions to improve cardiac function (eg, heart
      transplantation) and among patients examined over short time periods (<1 year).
      Studies comparing patients' cognition over time with their own baseline tended to
      report improvements, whereas studies using a comparison group without HF tended
      to report declines or stability in cognition over time among patients with HF.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF are at increased risk for cognitive decline, but
      this risk seems to be modifiable with cardiac treatment. Further research is
      needed to identify the mechanisms that cause cognitive changes in HF.

      support: a review of techniques and outcomes.
PG  - 489-95
LID - 10.2217/fca.13.34 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support provides
      prolonged support in the event of acute or acute-on-chronic cardiac and/or
      respiratory failure. This support serves as a bridge to recovery,
      decision-making, heart transplantation or ventricular-assist device implantation.
      It can be implanted either through a percutaneous approach using Seldinger's
      technique or via an open approach via the common femoral artery or the axillary
      artery. Early and late arterial vascular complications remain an important issue,
      with rates of up to 28% with femoral and axillary cannulation sites. Among them, 
      limb ischemia requires prompt diagnosis and management to avoid limb amputation. 
      In the case of peripheral artery cannulation, ipsilateral distal limb perfusion
      to prevent acute limb ischemia can be performed via a single lumen catheter
      through the artery or via the 'chimney graft' technique during extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation implantation.

TI  - Four-year paracorporeal left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support for heart
      failure after Rastelli operation.
PG  - 501-3
LID - 10.1007/s10047-013-0720-6 [doi]
AB  - It is well known that heart failure can occur after a conventional Rastelli
      operation (using an anatomical right ventricle as a systemic ventricle) in
      patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA).
      At present, heart transplantation (HTx) is the only definitive therapy known to
      save such patients. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been employed
      for patients presenting with acute deterioration of chronic heart failure as a
      bridge to transplantation when early HTx is not feasible. LVAD implantation in
      postoperative cases and/or in patients with dextrocardia is often difficult
      because of the complex anatomy. We report the case of a 26-year-old male patient 
      with CCTGA who presented with heart failure after a conventional Rastelli
      operation and in whom paracorporeal LVAD implantation was undertaken for the
      management of right (systemic) ventricular failure. The patient recovered from
      the heart failure and remained on the HTx list for approximately 4 years with
      LVAD support.

AB  - Myocarditis is most often caused by a viral infection. Less common causes include
      other infectious agents and autoimmune diseases. Fulminant myocarditis is an
      unusual complication with a rapidly progressive course resulting in severe heart 
      failure and cardiogenic shock. Fulminant myocarditis should be treated with full 
      supportive care, using aggressive pharmacologic therapy and mechanical
      circulatory support, because significant improvement in left ventricular function
      will often occur. Cardiac transplantation is required in a small minority of
      patients. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is becoming a frequently used
      modality to aid in the diagnosis of myocarditis.

TI  - Thyroid hormone signalling is altered in response to physical training in
      patients with end-stage heart failure and mechanical assist devices: potential
      physiological consequences?
PG  - 664-8
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt294 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the potential of the failing
      myocardium of patients with ventricular assist devices (VAD) to respond to
      physiological growth stimuli, such as exercise, by activating growth signalling
      pathways. This may be of therapeutic relevance in identifying novel
      pharmacological targets for therapies that could facilitate recovery after VAD
      implantation. METHODS: Twenty-two patients bridged to heart transplantation (HTx)
      with VAD were included in the study. A group of patients underwent moderate
      intensity aerobic exercise (GT), while another group of patients did not receive 
      exercise training (CG). Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1) protein and
      total (t) and phosphorylated (p) protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal
      kinase (JNK) kinase signalling were measured in myocardial tissue by western
      blotting at pre-VAD and pre-HTx period. In addition, Thyroid hormone (TH) levels 
      were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Peak oxygen consumption (VO2) at pre-HTx period
      was higher in patients subjected to training protocol [18.0 (0.8) for GT when
      compared with 13.7 (0.7) for CG group, P = 0.002]. N-terminal-prohormone of brain
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were 1068 (148) for CG vs 626 (115) for GT
      group, P = 0.035. A switch towards up-regulation of physiological growth
      signalling was observed: the ratio of p-Akt/t-Akt was 2-fold higher in GT vs CG, 
      P < 0.05 while p-JNK/t-JNK was 2.5-fold lower (P < 0.05) in GT vs CG, in pre-HTx 
      samples. This response was accompanied by a 2.0-fold increase in TRalpha1
      expression in pre-HTx samples with concomitant increase in circulating T3 in GT
      vs CG, P < 0.05. No differences in peak VO2, NT-proBNP, T3, TRalpha1, p/t-AKT and
      p/t-JNK were found between groups in the pre-VAD period. CONCLUSIONS: The
      unloaded failing myocardium responded to physical training by enhancing thyroid
      hormone signalling. This response was associated with an up-regulation of Akt and
      suppression of JNK activation.

PG  - 355-66
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f9bb3 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been successfully used as a bridge to
      heart transplant and destination therapy (DT) for congestive heart failure (HF)
      patients. Recently, continuous flow VAD (CVAD) has emerged as an attractive
      clinical option for long-term mechanical support of HF patients, with
      bridge-to-transplant outcomes comparable with pulsatile flow VAD (PVAD).
      Continuous flow VADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than the
      first-generation PVAD. Despite the widespread clinical use, CVAD support has been
      associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, and aortic valve 
      insufficiency. Speculation that diminished arterial pressure pulsatility
      associated with continuous flow devices may be contributing to these
      complications has sparked much debate over CVAD support. Studies comparing
      pulsatile flow and continuous flow (CF) support have presented conflicting
      findings, and the relevance to CVAD as DT is uncertain due to variations in
      device operation, support duration, and the criteria used to quantify
      pulsatility. Currently, there is interest in developing control algorithms for
      CVAD to increase the delivered pulsatility as a strategy to mitigate adverse
      event risks associated with CVAD therapy. There may also be the added benefit of 
      specific control strategies for managing CVAD therapy, potentially improving the 
      rate of myocardial recovery and successful weaning of mechanical circulatory
      support.

LID - 10.1177/2150135112437796 [doi]
AB  - The Berlin Heart Excor (BHE) assist device has become our standard mechanical
      support device for long-term support in children with heart failure. We report
      two useful surgical modifications for the implantation of the BHE in the
      pediatric population, improving ease of implantation as well as subsequent
      surgical procedures at the time of explantation or transplantation. The first
      modification entails the use of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft for cannulation
      via the innominate artery for arterial perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass.
      This graft is preserved and reused for institution of bypass at the time of
      transplantation or explantation of the device after recovery. The second
      modification consists of an extension of the BHE arterial cannula using a length 
      of knitted polyester graft. This allows for improved positioning of the arterial 
      cannula in the ascending aorta or main pulmonary artery, facilitates vascular
      anastomosis, and improves hemostasis.

AB  - The use of long-term left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has revolutionized
      the treatment of end-stage heart failure. The most significant advance in this
      field has been the longer durability of devices secondary to a simpler pump
      design with fewer or no mechanical bearings and valves. Continuous-flow LVADs
      have recently been shown to provide safe and effective circulatory support and
      have replaced the first-generation fill-to-empty devices. The Thoratec HeartMate 
      II and the HeartWare HVAD are currently the 2 most commonly implanted LVADs
      worldwide. As LVAD technology moves forward and new miniaturized, more durable,
      and reliable pumps are being developed, the number of recipients who will benefit
      from this technology continues to grow. Elimination of the driveline with fully
      implantable pumps, implantation of miniature pumps with minimally invasive
      surgical techniques, wireless data transmission, and improved patient selection
      will further transform this field in the next few years.

AB  - Heart failure frequently complicates congenital heart disease (CHD) in children
      and adults. In patients with end-stage disease, mechanical circulatory support
      may improve survival, quality of life, and serve as bridge to cardiac
      transplantation. There are many ethical issues surrounding the use of mechanical 
      circulatory support in patients with CHD including the use of prospective and
      randomized trials, proper oversight of new therapies, and transparency in
      reporting. Additionally, there are ethical considerations relevant to the greater
      society as these therapies are highly resource intensive in a resource-limited
      society. This article will review the burden of disease of heart failure in
      patients with CHD, the challenges of mechanical circulatory support and heart
      transplantation, and the ethical considerations and problems that arise for this 
      population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (cf-LVADs) may induce
      commissural fusion of the aortic valve leaflets. Factors associated with this
      occurrence of commissural fusion are unknown. The aim of this study was to
      examine histological characteristics of cf-LVAD-induced commissural fusion in
      relation to clinical variables. METHODS: Gross and histopathological examinations
      were performed on 19 hearts from patients supported by either HeartMate II (n =
      17) or HeartWare (n = 2) cf-LVADs and related to clinical characteristics (14
      heart transplantation, 5 autopsy). RESULTS: Eleven of the 19 (58%) aortic valves 
      showed fusion of single or multiple commissures (total fusion length 11 mm [4-20]
      (median [interquartile range]) per valve), some leading to noticeable nodular
      displacements or considerable lumen diameter narrowing. Multiple fenestrations
      were observed in one valve. Histopathological examination confirmed commissural
      fusion, with varying changes in valve layer structure without evidence of
      inflammatory infiltration at the site of fusion. Commissural fusion was
      associated with continuous aortic valve closure during cf-LVAD support (P =
      0.03). LVAD-induced aortic valve insufficiency developed in all patients with
      commissural fusion and in 67% of patients without fusion. Age, duration of
      cf-LVAD support and aetiology of heart failure (ischaemic vs dilated
      cardiomyopathy) were not associated with the degree of fusion. CONCLUSIONS:
      Aortic valve commissural fusion after support with cf-LVADs is a non-inflammatory
      process leading to changes in valve layer structure that can be observed in >50% 
      of cf-LVAD patients. This is the first study showing that patients receiving full
      cf-LVAD support without opening of the valve have a significantly higher risk of 
      developing commissural fusion than patients on partial support.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is becoming the mainstay of therapy for
      patients with advanced heart failure, both for patients needing support as a
      bridge to transplantation and for those who require the device as a destination
      therapy. As more and more devices are implanted, there is a need to address
      effective discharge planning, arrange appropriate follow-up, anticipate and
      address complications, and develop strategies for long-term care. In this
      article, we will discuss issues surrounding discharge and challenges of managing 
      patients with MCS in the outpatient setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (HeartWare Inc, Framingmam,
      MA) is a miniaturized implantable, centrifugal design, continuous-flow blood
      pump. The pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocols trials have
      enrolled patients with advanced heart failure in a bridge-to-transplant
      indication. METHODS: The primary outcome, success, was defined as survival on the
      originally implanted device, transplant, or explant for ventricular recovery at
      180 days. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of survival, functional and
      quality of life outcomes, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 332 patients in
      the pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocols trial have
      completed their 180-day primary end-point assessment. Survival in patients
      receiving the HeartWare pump was 91% at 180 days and 84% at 360 days. Quality of 
      life scores improved significantly, and adverse event rates remain low.
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of the HeartWare pump as a bridge to transplant continues to
      demonstrate a high 180-day survival rate despite a low rate of transplant.
      Adverse event rates are similar or better than those observed in historical
      bridge-to-transplant trials, despite longer exposure times due to longer survival
      and lower transplant rates.

AB  - The implantation of a left ventricular assist device as a bridge to

      approach with complete removal of all components of a HeartWare left ventricular 
      assist device in a patient with persistent infection related to the device.

TI  - Nursing patients with ventricular assist devices: an interpretive description.
PG  - 147-53
LID - 10.7182/pit2013766 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT-Although researchers have studied the experience of caring for patients
      with ventricular assist devices from the perspective of family caregivers, few
      reports address the experience of nursing patients with such devices. OBJECTIVE
      -To investigate the experience of nursing patients who have a ventricular assist 
      device. DESIGN -A qualitative approach called interpretive description was used
      to conduct semistructured, 1-on-1 interviews. PARTICIPANTS-Six registered nurses 
      with a range of clinical experiences were interviewed in a 1-year period from
      2009 to 2010. Data were transcribed and analyzed by the researcher in conjunction
      with a research team. RESULTS-Four distinct themes were interpreted from the
      interview data: exclusive knowledge, human connection, ethics, and
      interdisciplinary stress and technology. CONCLUSION -Nursing patients who have a 
      ventricular assist device is a complex experience. Nurses develop expert
      knowledge that is related to direct exposure to patients; this unique knowledge
      should be formally considered in team decision making. Nursing care of patients
      who have a ventricular assist device also has features that might result in
      overconnected nurse-patient relationships. Closely connected nurse-patient
      relationships intensified the emotional difficultly of experiences of exposure to
      illness or suffering, or exposure to an unpredictable dying trajectory. Nursing
      patients with ventricular assist devices can be difficult, and nursing leaders
      should be aware of the emotional reactions that can result from direct exposure
      to patients who might be perceived as very ill or suffering. Institutions with
      ventricular assist device programs should consider providing emotional support
      for health care workers who find this type of work emotionally difficult.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support devices such as ventricular assist devices have
      become the approved and accepted treatment option to improve survival and quality
      of life in patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical therapy.
      Patients as a result are living longer and presenting to emergency medical
      services, primary care facilities, emergency departments, and critical care units
      more frequently. Currently, health care providers have limited experience in
      managing this complex patient population. Thus, we created a standardized method 
      of initial evaluation and algorithmic approach of management to help in the
      management of emergencies in this unique patient population. We present a
      comprehensive overview of the types of mechanical assist devices, their
      complications, and an algorithmic approach to the emergency management in the
      patients with mechanical circulatory support. A systematic method is crucial in
      prompt and early recognition of emergencies to ensure appropriate management of
      these patients.

      implantation of continuous flow left ventricular assist devices.
PG  - 883-93
LID - 10.7150/ijms.6219 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the status of oxidative stress and DNA damage repair in
      circulating blood leukocytes of heart failure patients supported by continuous
      flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten HF
      patients implanted with LVAD as bridge to transplant or destination therapy were 
      enrolled in the study and 10 age and sex matched volunteers were recruited as the
      study control. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in blood leukocytes and superoxide
      dismutase (SOD) in erythrocytes were measured by flow
      cytometry/immunofluorescence microscopy and spectrophotometry, respectively.
      ELISA was used to measure oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) in plasma.
      Markers of DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and repairs (Mre11, DNA ligase IV, Ku70, and
      Ku80) were quantified in blood lymphocytes by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS:
      Levels of ROS and oxLDL were significantly higher in HF patients with LVAD than
      baseline as well as the control group; moreover, SOD levels were decreased with
      increasing post-operative periods. All the changes indicated enhanced oxidative
      stress among LVAD recipients. Significantly higher gamma-H2AX foci in lymphocytes
      confirmed DNA double strand breaks in LVAD recipients. gamma-H2AX foci numbers in
      lymphocytes were positively correlated with the ROS and oxLDL and negatively with
      SOD levels (p<0.0001). Expressions of DNA ligase IV, Ku70 and Ku80 proteins were 
      highest after one week and Mre11 protein after 3 months of LVAD transplantation; 
      indicated abnormal DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: The study, for the first time shows
      that, continuous flow LVAD implanted HF patients not only exhibit elevated
      oxidative stress and DNA damage in blood leukocytes but also have abnormalities
      in DNA repair pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are increasingly being used in
      pediatric patients to provide long-term cardiac support. One potential
      complication of VAD therapy is the development of antibodies directed against
      human leukocyte antigens (HLA). This phenomenon has not been well described with 
      the Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD, the most commonly used VAD in pediatric patients.
      METHODS: The records of all pediatric patients undergoing VAD support using the
      Berlin Heart device at our institution between April 2005 and August 2011 were
      reviewed retrospectively. Demographic and clinical data regarding the VAD course 
      were collected. Assessment of anti-HLA antibodies was performed using Luminex,
      and antibodies were quantified using mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).
      Assessment for anti-HLA antibodies was performed before VAD implantation and in
      serial fashion after VAD implantation. Clinically significant anti-HLA antibodies
      (sensitization) were defined by an MFI of more than 1000. RESULTS: Thirty-six
      patients were supported with the Berlin Heart VAD; 13 met inclusion criteria. The
      majority (85%) carried the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Evidence of
      sensitization pre-VAD was found in 69%; new-onset sensitization (the development 
      of new antibodies on VAD) occurred in 69%. All patients survived to
      transplantation. In two patients, the retrospective crossmatch was positive, but 
      only in one patient was the crossmatch positive for antibodies formed while on
      VAD. CONCLUSIONS: Using Luminex and MFI quantification, anti-HLA antibodies are
      common before VAD implantation in pediatric patients. While on VAD support, new
      anti-HLA antibodies formed in a majority, but the immediate impact of these
      antibodies appears to be limited.

PG  - H533-41
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2013 [doi]
AB  - Total mechanical unloading of the heart in classical models of heterotopic heart 
      transplantation leads to cardiac atrophy and functional deterioration. In
      contrast, partial unloading of failing human hearts with left ventricular (LV)
      assist devices (LVADs) can in some patients ameliorate heart failure symptoms.
      Here we tested in heterotopic rat heart transplant models whether partial
      volume-loading (VL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonary 
      artery of donor to left atrium of donor, superior vena cava of donor to inferior 
      vena cava of recipient; n = 27) is superior to the classical model of myocardial 
      unloading (UL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonary
      artery of donor to inferior vena cava of recipient; n = 14) with respect to
      preservation of ventricular morphology and function. Echocardiography, magnetic
      resonance imaging, and LV-pressure-volume catheter revealed attenuated myocardial
      atrophy with ~30% higher LV weight and better systolic contractile function in VL
      compared with UL (fractional area shortening, 34% vs. 18%; maximal change in
      pressure over time, 2,986 +/- 252 vs. 2,032 +/- 193 mmHg/s). Interestingly, no
      differences in fibrosis (Picrosirus red staining) or glucose metabolism
      (2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET) between VL and UL were observed. We
      conclude that the rat model of partial VL attenuates atrophic remodelling and
      shows superior morphological as well as functional preservation, and thus should 
      be considered more widely as a research model.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the physiological
      determinants of ejection fraction (EF)-ventricular size, contractile function,
      and ventricular-arterial (VA) interaction-and their associations with clinical
      outcomes in chronic heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: EF is a potent predictor of
      HF outcomes, but represents a complex summary measure that integrates several
      components including left ventricular size, contractile function, and VA
      coupling. The relative importance of each of these parameters in determining
      prognosis is unknown. METHODS: In 466 participants with chronic systolic HF, we
      derived quantitative echocardiographic measures of EF: cardiac size
      (end-diastolic volume [EDV]); contractile function (the end-systolic pressure
      volume relationship slope [Eessb] and intercept [V0]); and VA coupling (arterial 
      elastance [Ea]/Eessb). We determined the association between these parameters and
      the following adverse outcomes: 1) the combined endpoint of death, cardiac
      transplantation, or ventricular assist device (VAD) placement; and 2) cardiac
      hospitalization. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, there were 76
      deaths, 52 transplantations, 14 VAD placements, and 684 cardiac hospitalizations.
      EF was independently associated with death, transplantation, and VAD placement
      (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 5.0
      comparing third and first tertiles), as were EDV (HR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5 to 4.2);
      V0 (HR: 3.6; 95% CI: 2.1 to 6.1); and Ea/Eessb (HR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.3).
      EDV, V0, and Ea/Eessb were also associated with risk of cardiac hospitalization. 
      Eessb was not significantly associated with any adverse outcomes in adjusted
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular size, V0, and VA coupling are associated 
      with prognosis in systolic HF, but end-systolic elastance (Eessb) is not.
      Assessment of VA coupling via Ea/Eessb is an additional noninvasively derived
      metric that can be used to gauge prognosis in human HF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemporary continuous-flow ventricular assist devices (CFVADs) have
      greatly improved patient survival for indications of bridge to transplantation
      (BTT) and destination therapy. In Japan, CFVAD is limited for BTT use. The
      waiting period for heart transplantation (HT) is long owing to donor shortage. We
      examined the results of CFVAD for BTT indication. METHODS: Eighty-nine VAD
      treatments were performed among subjects whose preimplantation condition was
      profile 1 (n = 49) or profile 2 or 3 (n = 40). The device was the paracorporeal
      pulsatile Nipro VAD (n = 67) or CFVAD (n = 22). All CFVAD patients were profile 2
      or 3. RESULTS: The median assist period was 529 days (Nipro VAD, 530; CFVAD,
      528). Twenty-six patients were on the device for >2 years. Actuarial survival was
      81.6%, 69.5%, and 61.1% at 1, 3, and 5 years. Survival in profile 1 was
      significantly worse than in profile 2 or 3. Survival of CFVAD patients was
      superior to that of paracorporeal VAD. Six-month mortality rate of 20% in cases
      before 2009 (n = 60) was dramatically improved to 3% among those after 2010 (n = 
      29). All patients with CFVAD were alive and discharged home. 26 patients were
      transplanted, 7 had been weaned from VAD and 27 were on a device. The rate of
      events requiring hospital admission was 0.98 per patient-year in CFVAD patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary CFVADs have enabled advanced heart failure patients to 
      await HT safely with an improved quality of life. The advent of CFVAD has also
      shifted their preimplantation condition to a less sick status. CFVADs were the
      safest, most reliable circulatory support devices for long-term waiting periods
      for the BTT indications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support through left ventricular assist
      devices (LVADs) improves survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage
      heart failure who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation. Our aim was to
      calculate the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: A
      cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective was performed. A lifetime
      Markov model was set up in which continuous-flow LVAD was compared with optimal
      medical therapy (OMT). The treatment effect was modeled indirectly combining the 
      results of the REMATCH trial comparing OMT with a pulsatile-flow LVAD and the
      HeartMate II Destination Therapy Trial comparing a pulsatile-flow LVAD with a
      continuous-flow LVAD. Cost data were based on real-world financial data of
      sixty-nine patients with a HeartMate II implantation from the University Medical 
      Centre Utrecht (the Netherlands). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
      were performed. RESULTS: Comparing the continuous-flow HeartMate II with OMT,
      3.23 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2.18-4.49) life-years were gained
      (LYG) or 2.83 (95 percent CI, 1.91-3.90) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The
      cost of an LVAD implant was approximately euro126,000, of which the device itself
      represented the largest cost, being euro70,000. Total incremental costs amounted 
      to euro299,100 (95 percent CI, 190,500-521,000). This resulted in an incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio of euro94,100 (95 percent CI, 59,100-160,100) per LYG or
      euro107,600 (95 percent CI, 66,700-181,100) per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed
      these results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Although LVAD destination therapy
      improves survival and quality of life, it remains a relatively expensive
      intervention which renders the reimbursement of this therapy questionable.

AB  - Diseased, replaced or repaired mitral valve can lead to restricted blood flow to 
      left ventricle and inadequate flow in left ventricular assist device (LVAD). A
      middle age woman with 'burnt out' hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had mitral valve
      repair for mitral regurgitation. She needed LVAD to support severe decompensating
      heart failure. Repaired mitral valve posed a risk of restricted flow through the 
      device. Mitral commissurotomy was performed on beating heart through the left
      ventricular apical hole created for insertion of inflow cannula of LVAD.

PG  - S69-72

AB  - Remarkable outcomes have been reported after prolonged mechanical circulatory
      support in the pediatric population, but there is yet no clear delineation of the
      duration beyond which supporting a child becomes futile. The likelihood of
      survival in patients supported on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for
      respiratory failure decreases with the length of support. However, extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation can be successfully used in these patients for long periods 
      (weeks to months) provided adequate support is maintained without complications. 
      This is not the case with cardiac failure and mechanical circulatory
      support.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is usually the initial form of
      mechanical circulatory support used in patients with primary refractory
      myocardial dysfunction. There is evidence and consensus that if the patient shows
      no signs of recovery after a maximum duration of 2 weeks, he or she should be
      transitioned to a ventricular assist device, which allows prolonged support. In
      post-cardiac surgery patients, survival is only anecdotal beyond 12 days of
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and myocardial recovery is
      exceptionally rare after this time period unless new diagnoses and management
      strategies are formulated.Repeat extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should
      generally not be offered to patients unless it is established that support was
      withdrawn prematurely or a new intervention is planned. Repeat extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation may achieve some improvement in early survival, but the
      long-term outcomes of survivors are so poor that these attempts cannot be
      generally recommended unless organ transplantation is an option.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: For children with severe heart failure in whom medical management has 
      failed, mechanical circulatory support in the form of either extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation or ventricular assist device represents life-sustaining
      therapy. This review provides an overview of these two modalities, including a
      discussion of indications, contraindications, timing, and device selection, as
      part of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society/Extracorporeal Life Support 
      Organization Joint Statement on Mechanical Circulatory Support. DATA SOURCES,
      STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION: PubMed was searched using the following terms: 
      ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ventricular assist device, VAD, and
      pediatric. Case reports, single-center series, multicenter studies, and registry 
      reports were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: The two technologies have unique advantages
      and disadvantages and may be considered complementary devices, although they are 
      frequently used in sequence. Either modality may be used as bridge-to-transplant 
      or bridge-to-recovery, and the choice of device and device timing is influenced
      by the acuity of illness, comorbidities, potential for recovery, and anticipated 
      duration of support.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support is an invaluable tool in the care of children with
      severe refractory cardiac failure. As the field of mechanical circulatory support
      has evolved in children, the frequency of ventricular assist device use has been 
      increasing steadily with excellent results. Ventricular assist devices are being 
      used with increasing frequency in children with cardiac failure refractory to
      medical therapy for primary treatment as a long-term bridge to recovery or
      transplantation. This review, part of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care
      Society/Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Joint Consensus Statement on
      Mechanical Circulatory Support, focuses on ventricular assist device implantation
      and management, as well as anticipation and management of complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence (NA) can result in life-threatening illness 
      in children after solid-organ transplantation. Little is known about the
      incidence, risk factors and outcomes of NA in large numbers of pediatric heart
      transplant (HT) recipients. METHODS: Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) 
      data were used to identify all children <18 years of age in the U.S.A. who
      underwent HT from October 1999 to January 2007. Cox proportional hazards analysis
      was used to identify risk factors for NA and the effect on graft survival.
      RESULTS: Of 2,070 pediatric heart transplants performed the median age at
      transplant was 6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 13 years); 40% had
      congenital heart disease (CHD), 7% were re-transplants, 42% were non-white and
      43% had Medicaid insurance. Overall, 186 (9%) children had a report of NA at a
      median age of 15 years with more than two-thirds of NA episodes occurring after
      12 years of age. Factors independently associated with NA were: adolescent age at
      transplant (hazard ratio [HR] 7.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 12,
      compared with infants); black race (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.3, compared with
      white); Medicaid insurance (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.7, compared with non-Medicaid
      insurance); and ventilator or ventricular assist device (VAD) support at
      transplant. The risk of mortality conditional upon report of NA was 26% at 1 year
      and 33% at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Medication NA is an important problem in
      pediatric HT recipients and is associated with high mortality. Adolescent age,
      black race, Medicaid insurance and invasive hemodynamic support at transplant
      were associated with NA, whereas time on the wait list and gender were not.
      Targeted interventions among at-risk populations may be warranted.

AB  - Options for long-term mechanical circulatory support to sustain pediatric heart
      failure patients requiring cardiac transplantation while they wait for donor
      hearts have been unsatisfactory. The conventional approach has been to use
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but its lack of feasibility for
      long-term use and the major complications associated with the technology have
      limited its use, especially in light of lengthy waiting lists for donor hearts.
      With the advent of the Berlin Heart EXCOR(R) Pediatric ventricular assist device 
      (VAD), pediatric heart failure specialists have gained an important tool for
      helping this patient population survive until a donor heart can be identified.
      The EXCOR Pediatric VAD is designed to support pediatric patients of all age
      groups, from newborns to teenagers, and can be used successfully for many months.
      This paper describes the early experience with the EXCOR Pediatric VAD and the
      challenging journey undertaken to gain U.S. FDA approval, including successful
      completion of the first worldwide prospective clinical study of VADs in a
      pediatric population.

      was deemed ineligible for heart transplantation and a left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) was thought to be high risk due to persistent right heart failure. 
      To determine if he could tolerate left ventricular support alone, a trans-septal 
      cannula was placed via the left femoral vein. Transition from veno-arterial ECMO 
      to isolated left-sided support allowed for risk assessment for LVAD implantation 
      and extubation, providing the patient an opportunity to participate in further
      clinical decision making.

TI  - Clinicians' attitudes regarding withdrawal of left ventricular assist devices in 
      patients approaching the end of life.

LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hft094 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are implanted to support the
      circulation of patients with advanced heart failure. Patients approaching death, 
      or their surrogates, may request withdrawal of LVAD support. We sought to study
      the attitudes and practices of heart failure clinicians regarding withdrawal of
      LVAD support in patients approaching death. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using
      internet-based and secure methods, we surveyed members of the European Society of
      Cardiology-Heart Failure Association (ESC-HFA), the International Society for
      Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), and the Heart Failure Society of America 
      (HFSA) to assess their attitudes and practices regarding LVAD withdrawal for
      patients approaching death. The results indicated that clinicians have varied
      attitudes and practices regarding withdrawing LVAD support in these patients.
      Furthermore, ESC-HFA clinicians (primarily European) and ISHLT and HFSA
      clinicians (primarily North American) differed in their attitudes and practices
      regarding withdrawal of LVAD support, particularly its ethical and legal
      permissibility. For example, more European clinicians than North American
      clinicians regarded withdrawing LVAD support as a form of euthanasia. CONCLUSION:
      Opinions and level of comfort with LVAD withdrawal vary among clinicians.
      Clinicians should be aware of suggested approaches or guidelines for managing
      requests for withdrawal of LVAD therapy.

AB  - In chronic cardiomyopathy, mechanical circulatory support plays an increasingly
      important role for children as the shortage of suitable donor hearts increases
      times on the transplant waiting list. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) for
      adults have evolved dramatically over the last decade, both as a bridge to
      transplantation and for permanent support. In contrast, VADs designed for
      children, especially for all age groups, are still in their infancy. The Medos
      HIA and the Berlin Heart Excor are specially designed for children with a body
      surface area <1.2 m2. Increased experience with existing paediatric VADs and the 
      introduction of third-generation VADs for the paediatric age group offer new
      possibilities for children suffering from end-stage heart failure. We review the 
      literature on this topic, summarise the indications and contraindications for
      long-term support VADs and describe the decision-making algorithm used at our
      institution for use of long-term VADs in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage
      heart failure. Destination mechanical circulatory support is often the only
      therapy available for these patients who are not transplant candidates. The
      outcomes after continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF LVAD) implant
      in older patients remains unclear. We undertook this multi-institutional study to
      quantify short-term and midterm outcomes after CF LVAD implant in the elderly.
      METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients in the Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) national registry that
      underwent implant of a CF LVAD (June 2006 to April 2012). Patients were divided
      into 2 cohorts based upon age (<70 years [n = 4,439] and >/= 70 years (n = 590]).
      Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed. The
      primary endpoint, survival, was compared between cohorts. RESULTS: Patients age
      70 and older were more hemodynamically stable pre-VAD implant as evidenced by
      INTERMACS profile and inotrope dependence. Perioperative outcomes, including
      median bypass time (89 vs 89 minutes) and length of stay (0.657 vs 0.657 months) 
      were similar between cohorts (p = not significant). Kaplan-Meier analysis
      revealed a significant difference in 2-year survival between patients aged 70
      years or greater (63%) and less than 70 (71%, p < 0.001). Multivariable Cox
      proportional hazard analysis revealed age as an independent predictor of
      mortality during follow-up (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, midterm cumulative survival 
      in the older cohort was still reasonable (63% at 2 years). CONCLUSIONS:
      Multi-institutional analysis revealed advanced age as a predictor of increased
      mortality after CF LVAD implantation. Careful patient selection is critical in
      the elderly to optimize long-term outcomes after CF LVAD implantation.

TI  - Heterotopic heart transplant: is there an indication in the continuous flow
      ventricular assist device era?
PG  - 372-6
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Heterotopic heart transplantation (HHTx) is a therapeutic option in
      heart failure patients with fixed elevated pulmonary hypertension. However,
      survival is poorer in HHTx recipients, and with improving results in continuous
      flow ventricular assist devices (VADs), many patients can be bridged to allow
      normalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic heart
      transplant (OHTx) candidates. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyse the
      survival of our HHTx cohort and compare them with our VAD bridge patients.
      METHODS: A retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 OHTx and 27
      HHTx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124
      bridge-to-transplant VAD patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received 
      an OHTx. Pulmonary artery pressures before and after VAD implant were analysed.
      Survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS:
      HHTx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older,
      smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the OHTx cohort. Comparison of the
      VAD types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longer time
      supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than the
      pulsatile devices. The continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonary
      artery pressures pretransplant. The HHTx cohort had a significantly poorer
      survival than the OHTx cohort (P=0.002). Survival on a continuous device and then
      OHTx was significantly better than either HHTx or pulsatile device support.
      CONCLUSIONS: The main indication for HHTx, namely fixed elevated pulmonary
      hypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by 
      continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.

TI  - Risk stratification for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy: the role 
      of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator.
PG  - 2230-42
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht167 [doi]
AB  - The benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy depends upon 
      appropriate evaluation of a persisting risk of sudden death and estimation of the
      patient's overall survival. Assessment of a stable and unchangeable
      arrhythmogenic substrate is often difficult. Structural abnormality and
      ventricular dysfunction, the two major risk parameters, may recover, and heart
      failure symptoms can improve so that ICD therapy may not be indicated. Risk
      stratification can take time while the patient continues to be at high risk of
      arrhythmic death, and patients may need temporary bridging by a defibrillator in 
      cases of interrupted ICD therapy. The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD)
      combines a long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring system with an external
      automatic defibrillator. The LIfeVest(R) (ZOLL, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) is composed 
      of a garment, containing two defibrillation patch electrodes on the back, and an 
      elastic belt with a front-defibrillation patch electrode and four non-adhesive
      ECG electrodes, connected to a monitoring and defibrillation unit. The WCD is a
      safe and effective tool to terminate ventricular tachycardia/ventricular
      fibrillation events, unless a conscious patient withholds shock delivery. It may 
      be used in patients in the early phase after acute myocardial infarction with
      poor left ventricular function, after acute coronary revascularization procedures
      (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) and
      reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (</=35%), in patients with acute heart
      failure in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy of uncertain aetiology and prognosis. The
      WCD may be helpful in subjects with syncope of assumed tachyarrhythmia origin or 
      in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The WCD may replace ICD
      implantation in patients waiting for heart transplantation or who need a
      ventricular-assist device. This review describes the technical details and
      characteristics of the WCD, discusses its various potential applications, and
      reports the currently available experience with the wearable defibrillator.

AB  - Although cardiac transplant remains the gold standard for the treatment of
      end-stage heart failure, limited donor organ availability and growing numbers of 
      eligible recipients have increased the demand for alternative therapies.
      Limitations of first-generation left ventricular assist devices for long-term
      support of patients with end-stage disease have led to the development of newer
      second-generation and third-generation pumps, which are smaller, have fewer
      moving parts, and have shown improved durability, allowing for extended support. 
      The HeartMate II (second generation) and HeartWare (third generation) are 2
      devices that have shown great promise as potential alternatives to
      transplantation in select patients.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of ventricular assist device therapy as a bridge to
      transplantation compared with nonbridged cardiac recipients.
PG  - 2424-35
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current available treatment options for advanced heart failure
      include heart transplantation and ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. This
      project aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a bridge-to-transplantation
      (BTT)-VAD approach relative to direct heart transplantation in
      transplant-eligible patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was used to
      evaluate survival benefits and costs for BTT-VAD versus nonbridged heart
      transplant recipients. Three different scenarios were considered according to
      severity of patients' baseline hemodynamic status (high, medium, and low risk).
      Results are presented in terms of survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratio. 
      Sensitivity analyses were used to analyze uncertainty in model estimates. Over a 
      20-year time horizon, BTT-VAD therapy increased survival at an increased cost
      relative to nonbridged heart transplant recipients: $100 841more in costs and
      1.19 increased life years (LYs) in high-risk patients ($84 964/LY), $112 779 more
      in costs and 1.14 more LYs ($99 039/LY) in medium-risk patients, and an
      additional cost of $144 334 and incremental clinical benefit of 1.21 more LYs
      ($119 574/LY) in low-risk patients. The sensitivity analysis estimated a 59%,
      54%, and 43% chance of BTT-VAD therapy being cost-effective for high-, medium-,
      and low-risk patients at a willingness-to-pay level of $100 000/LY. Subgroup
      analyses indicated that risk of post-VAD and transplantation complications,
      waiting time, renal dysfunction, and patient age substantially affected the
      cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSIONS: BTT-VAD therapy is associated with
      improved survival and increased costs. On the basis of commonly accepted
      willingness-to-pay thresholds, BTT-VAD therapy is likely to be cost-effective
      relative to nonbridged heart transplantation in specific circumstances.

TI  - Long-term left ventricular support in patients with a mechanical aortic valve.
PG  - 236-9
LID - 10.3109/14017431.2013.795655 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The presence of a mechanical prosthesis has been regarded as an
      increased risk of thromboembolic complications and as a relative contraindication
      for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Five patients in our center had a
      mechanical aortic valve at the time of device implantation and were studied
      regarding thromboembolic complications. DESIGN: Five patients operated upon with 
      an LVAD (1 HeartMate I, 4 HeartMate II) between 2002 and 2011 had a mechanical
      aortic valve at the time of implantation. The first patient had a patch closure
      of the aortic valve. In four patients, the prosthesis was left in place.
      Anticoagulants included aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel. RESULTS: The average 
      and accumulated treatment times were 150 and 752 days, respectively. Three of the
      five patients showed early signs of valve thrombosis on echo with concomitant
      valve dysfunction. Four patients were transplanted without thromboembolic events 
      during pump treatment. One patient died from a hemorrhagic stroke after 90 days
      on the LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of leaving a mechanical heart valve in
      place at the time of LVAD implantation in five patients led to valvular
      thrombosis in three but did not provoke embolic events. It increased the
      complexity of postoperative anticoagulation.

TI  - Preoperative INTERMACS profiles determine postoperative outcomes in critically
      ill patients undergoing emergency heart transplantation: analysis of the Spanish 
      National Heart Transplant Registry.
PG  - 763-72
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.000237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure
      undergoing ventricular assist device implantation are strongly influenced by
      their preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
      Support (INTERMACS) profiles. We sought to investigate whether a similar
      association exists in patients undergoing emergency heart transplantation.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: By means of the Spanish National Heart Transplant Registry
      database, we identified 704 adult patients treated with emergency heart
      transplantation in 15 Spanish centers between 2000 and 2009. Post-transplant
      outcomes were analyzed pertaining to patient preoperative INTERMACS profiles,
      which were retrospectively assigned by 2 blinded cardiologists. Before
      transplantation, INTERMACS profile 1 (critical cardiogenic shock) was present in 
      207 patients, INTERMACS profile 2 (progressive decline) in 291, INTERMACS profile
      3 (inotropic dependence) in 176, and INTERMACS profile 4 (resting symptoms) was
      present in 30 patients. In-hospital postoperative mortality rates were,
      respectively, 43%, 26.8%, and 18% in patients with profiles 1, 2, and 3 to 4
      (P<0.001). INTERMACS 1 patients also presented the highest incidence of primary
      graft failure (1: 31.3%, 2: 22.3%, 3-4: 21.8%; P=0.03) and postoperative need for
      dialysis (1: 33.2%, 2: 18.9%, 3-4: 21.5%; P<0.001). Adjusted odds-ratios for
      in-hospital postoperative mortality were 4.38 (95% confidence interval,
      2.51-7.66) for profile 1 versus 3 to 4, 2.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.56-3.97)
      for profile 1 versus 2, and 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.03) for profile
      2 versus 3 to 4. Long-term survival after hospital discharge was not influenced
      by preoperative INTERMACS profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative INTERMACS profiles 
      determine outcomes after emergency heart transplantation. Results call for a
      change in policies related to the management of heart transplant candidates
      presenting with INTERMACS profiles 1 and 2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: New device therapies have expanded the strategies for treating heart
      failure (HF) patients. Unloading of the heart with a left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) can lead to the reversal of many remodeling changes whose
      underlying mechanisms are not yet completely known. Molecular analysis might play
      a role in obtaining further insight into the regulatory mechanisms of this
      process. A critical step in an RT-PCR study is the selection of reference genes
      for data normalization. This study aimed to determine an optimal combination of
      stably expressed reference genes in different regions of the human heart in order
      to study the effects of LVAD implants on cardiac remodeling, and in particular to
      check their reliability on the evaluation of pro-inflammatory cytokine
      expression. DESIGN AND METHODS: We validated nine of the most commonly used
      reference genes in human myocardium samples obtained at heart transplantation
      from patients with LVAD implant (n=30 from a total of six patients) and from
      heart transplant (HT from a total of seven patients) recipients as controls
      (n=35). Samples from both left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles were analyzed. The 
      normalization strategy was tested by analyzing mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8 and 
      TNF-alpha, whose protein levels were measured by immunometric assay. RESULTS: The
      most stable gene combinations changed according to the experimental groups (the
      LVAD and HT groups and the different myocardial regions). Considering all the
      cardiac samples as a whole, the three most stably expressed genes were PPIA,
      RPL13A, and YWHAZ (M=0.70). Using the best normalization strategy, a significant 
      increase in IL-6, IL-8 mRNA expression was observed in LVAD samples compared to
      HT (p<0.0001). Similar results were obtained by protein analysis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our results underline the importance of always selecting reference genes for the 
      specific system studied. The most appropriate normalization strategy is of
      pivotal importance for understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with the
      pathophysiology of HF, such as inflammation.

TI  - Improved hemodynamics with a novel miniaturized intra-aortic axial flow pump in a
      porcine model of acute left ventricular dysfunction.

AB  - Currently, long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is limited to large,
      complex devices that require invasive, high-risk surgical implantation. These
      devices are mainly used in patients with late stage heart failure (HF). We are
      developing a novel percutaneous intra-aortic micro-axial fluid entrainment pump
      intended for long-term MCS in patients with earlier stage HF. This study examined
      the pump's hemodynamic effects in a porcine model of acute HF. In three porcine
      experiments, the pump was deployed in the thoracic aorta by standard cardiac
      catheterization techniques and was anchored with self-expanding struts. Acute
      cardiac dysfunction was induced by infusing esmolol continuously. Pump support
      increased cardiac output (+10.4%), stroke volume (+8.9%), and ejection fraction
      (+10.8%) while decreasing cardiac stroke work (-10.8%) and afterload (-22.7%).
      Furthermore, pump support significantly enhanced renal perfusion through
      sustained increases in both renal artery flow (+36.4%) and pressure (+73.6%). In 
      a porcine model of acute HF, the catheter-based intra-aortic fluid entrainment
      pump improved hemodynamics and renal perfusion. These results suggest that the
      pump could improve HF outcomes and patients' quality of life by resting the
      heart, promoting reverse remodeling, and augmenting end-organ perfusion.
      Furthermore, the enhanced renal perfusion may help disrupt the cardiorenal
      syndrome cycle and improve HF treatment.

TI  - The impact of mechanical circulatory support on outcomes in paediatric heart
      transplantation.
PG  - 836-40
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt225 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Internationally, the number of donors for cardiac transplantation has
      remained static, while the number of patients requiring transplantation for
      congenital heart disease (CHD) has increased. Although the availability of
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may increase the number of transplants
      performed by reducing deaths while waiting, it may also lead to increased
      morbidity post-transplantation. We sought to assess the impact of mechanical
      support on post-transplant outcomes in a single centre. METHODS: We assessed the 
      outcomes of paediatric (age </=16 years) heart transplantation in a single unit
      in the era of mechanical support (1998-2012) by retrospective cohort study.
      Outcomes before (1998-2005) and after (2005-2012) the routine use of the Berlin
      Heart EXCOR device were contrasted. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients underwent
      heart transplantation during this period. The diagnosis was dilated
      cardiomyopathy in 61.7%, two-ventricle CHD in 11.4%, single ventricle CHD in
      16.8% and miscellaneous in 10.1%. Sixty-nine (41%) were bridged to transplant by 
      mechanical support; with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 19 (28%),
      ventricular assist device in 40 (58%) and a combination in 10 (14.0%).
      Post-transplant mortality at 30 days was significantly greater in those supported
      by MCS than without (7 vs 1%, P < 0.05), and a greater proportion of patients had
      neurological (23 vs 8%, P < 0.01) and major respiratory sequelae (20 vs 4%, P <
      0.001). There was no significant increase in the need for post-transplant
      mechanical support (10 vs 6%, P = 0.3) in those supported prior to transplant.
      The number of transplants performed increased from 67 in 1998-2005 to 100 in the 
      most recent era (2005-2012), and an increased proportion of these patients have
      been supported mechanically prior to transplantation (51 vs 27%, P < 0.01).
      CONCLUSION: Along with strategies to increase donor utilization, MCS has allowed 
      an increase in cardiac transplant activity at the expense of a higher early
      mortality and morbidity.

TI  - Is it time for a cardiac allocation score? First results from the Eurotransplant 
      pilot study on a survival benefit-based heart allocation.
PG  - 873-80
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2013.03.015 [doi]
LID - S1053-2498(13)01204-7 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients awaiting heart transplantation in Eurotransplant are
      prioritized by waiting time and medical urgency. To reduce mortality, the
      introduction of post-transplant survival in an allocation model based on the
      concept of survival benefit might be more appropriate. The aim of this study was 
      to assess the prognostic accuracy of the heart failure survival score (HFSS), the
      Seattle heart failure model (SHFM), the Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) model, and the index for mortality
      prediction after cardiac transplantation (IMPACT) score for predicting mortality.
      METHODS: The HFSS, SHFM, the adapted SHFM, and the INTERMACS model were evaluated
      for predicting waiting list mortality among heart transplant candidates, and the 
      IMPACT score was tested for predicting post-transplant mortality in separate Cox 
      regression models. Included were the 448 adult heart transplant candidates listed
      for an urgent status between October 2010 and June 2011 in Eurotransplant. A
      cardiac allocation score (CAS) was calculated based on the estimated survival
      times as predicted by the scores. All analyses were performed for the total
      cohort and separately for ventricular assist device (VAD) and non-VAD patients.
      RESULTS: Mortality on the waiting list could significantly be predicted in the
      non-VAD cohort by HFSS (p = 0.005) and SHFM (p < 0.0001) and after transplant by 
      IMPACT (p < 0.0001). None of the tested scores could predict mortality among
      VAD-supported patients. CONCLUSIONS: In non-VAD patients, the HFSS, SHFM, and
      IMPACT provide accurate risk stratification. Further studies will reveal whether 
      these models should be considered as the basis for a new heart allocation policy 
      in Eurotransplant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this report, we share our experience with left ventricular assist 
      device (LVAD) implantation in cases with a left ventricular (LV) thrombus.
      METHOD: Over the 3 years, more than 100 end-stage heart failure cases have been
      treated with LVAD implantation in our center, including 6 patients with a LV
      thrombus. Three were detected using preoperative transthoracic echocardiography. 
      Fifty percent of the patients had dilated cardiomyopathy and the remaining cases 
      had an ischemic etiology. Double inotropic support with dopamine and dobutamine
      was used in all, with 3 drugs with the addition of adrenaline in 2 patients. In 4
      cases we implanted the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (HeartWare, Inc.,
      Miramar, Fla, United States) and in the remaining 2 patients, the Berlin Heart
      EXCOR ventricular assist device (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) for
      biventricular support. In 1 patient the apical ventriculotomy was extended to
      remove an intertrabecular thrombosis and ventricular septal surface covered with 
      a dacron patch to minimize the thrombogenic potential. RESULTS: Two patients died
      due to sepsis and multiorgan failure. None of the patients experienced a
      neurological event, pump thrombosis, or pump malfunction. Two subjects underwent 
      re-explorations due to hemorrhage. Two candidates underwent successfull
      transplantation without any evidence of thrombosis in the explanted heart or
      device. CONCLUSION: We believe that patients with a LV thrombus and preserved
      right ventricular function are good candidates for implantation of a LVAD after
      removing the intracavitary thrombus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Berlin Heart EXCOR is a first-generation paracorporeal, pneumatic
      ventricular assist device that creates pulsatile flow. It can be used for
      long-term support of the left and/or right ventricule during end-stage heart
      failure. The aim of this study was to share our clinical experience in 54
      patients. METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, 54 patients with end-stage
      heart failure underwent Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device
      implantation, including 5 females and 9 children. Twenty-four patients (44%) were
      in Intermacs level 1, 11 (21%) in level 2, and 19 (35%) in level 3. Biventricular
      support was applied to 13 patients. Device implantation was performed with an "on
      pump" beating heart technique while 6 other patients underwent intervention
      operations while the aortic valve has under cross-clamp. Tricuspid annuloplasty
      was performed in 6 patients. RESULTS: There was no peroperative death. Nine
      patients (17%) underwent re-exploration because of hemorrhage in the early
      postoperative period. Heart transplantation was performed in 32 patients (59%),
      while 10 (19%) are still under pump support with a mean follow-up of 13 months.
      Although 1 was successfully weaned from the system, 11 patients (20%) died during
      the support. Pump-head exchange was required 19 times in 17 patients because of
      visible thrombus or fibrin deposit in the pump head or due to membrane rupture.
      DISCUSSION: The use of long-term paracorporeal assist devices has decreased in
      recent years because of the increased popularity of implantable devices that
      permit longer survival and a better quality of life. We believe that the Berlin
      Heart EXCOR has a special role because it can be used in pediatric patients and
      especially in critical conditions like Intermacs levels 1 and 2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of a ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to heart
      transplantation in the pediatric population has evolved over the past decades
      This article presents our institution's clinical experience in the anesthetic
      management of pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure who underwent
      implantation of a VAD between June 2009 and August 2012. METHODS: Between
      February 2011 and August 2012, implantation of a VAD was performed in 10 children
      of mean age 8.6 years. This retrospective review analyzed their perioperative
      anesthetic care. RESULTS: All patients had end-stage heart failure due to dilated
      cardiomyopathy. We used invasive arterial and central venous pressure monitoring 
      and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in conjunction with
      intravenous administration of either ketamine (1 mg/kg) and midazolam (n = 3) or 
      thiopental (3-5 mg/kg; n = 7). The mean intraoperative fentanyl dose was 434 +/- 
      264.27 mug. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. Dopamine, dobutamine, and
      epinephrine were infused in 8, 10, and 5 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric
      oxide was administered to all patients. The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh
      frozen plasma, and thrombocyte suspension transfusions were be 2.3 +/- 0.82
      (range, 1-4), 1.6 +/- 0.69 (range, 1-3), and 2.4 +/- 1.42 (range, 0-4) units,
      respectively. On average, patients were extubated 23 hours after arrival in the
      intensive care unit and exited there on day 6. Six patients were successfully
      bridged to heart transplantation, 2 died during the follow-up, and 2 patients
      remain on VAD support. CONCLUSION: VAD is increasingly being used as a bridge to 
      heart transplantation in the pediatric population. Anesthesiologists must be
      vigilant about the pathophysiology of heart failure, the operative procedure, and
      the implanted device.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulatory support with ventricular assist systems has become a
      treatment alternative for patients with end-stage heart failure owing to the
      donor shortage. In this report, we have presented our institution's clinical
      experience in the anesthetic management of ventricular assist device (VAD)
      implantation. METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, VAD implantation was
      performed in 84 adult patients with end-stage heart failure. The group included
      75 male and 9 female patients of overall mean age, 47.6 +/- 13.4 years. Our
      retrospective review analyzed elements of perioperative anesthetic care,
      including preoperative characteristics, general anesthetic care, and blood
      product usage. RESULTS: The indications for VAD implantation were dilated (n =
      59; 70%) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 25; 30%). An intra-aortic balloon pump
      had been placed in 16 patients. We monitored invasive arterial and central venous
      pressures as well as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Etomidate
      was used as the induction agent in 79 of 84 patients (average dose, 18.75 +/-
      1.40 mg). Intraoperative fentanyl dose was 939.69 +/- 212.44 mug. Anesthesia was 
      maintained with sevoflurane (n = 55) or desflurane (n = 29). Dopamine,
      dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and levosimendan were used in 74, 79,
      60, 14, and 32 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered to
      38 subjects (45%). The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh frozen plasma, and
      thrombocyte suspension transfusions were 3.96 +/- 2.78, 1.91 +/- 1.21, 1.80 +/-
      2.48 u, respectively. On average, patients were extubated 13 hours after arrival 
      in the intensive care unit and discharged therefrom on day 8. Thirty-one patients
      were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. While 27 patients (32%) died 
      during the follow-up period, 26 are still living on VAD support. CONCLUSION:
      Among patients undergoing VAD implantation, the anesthesiologist should become
      familiar with the device and consider the severity of cardiac and other end-organ
      dysfunction.

TI  - Evaluation of inflow cannulation site for implantation of right-sided rotary
      ventricular assist device.
PG  - 704-11
LID - 10.1111/aor.12067 [doi]
AB  - Right heart dysfunction is one of the most serious complications following
      implantation of a left ventricular assist device, often leading to the
      requirement for short- or long-term right ventricular assist device (RVAD)
      support. The inflow cannulation site induces major hemodynamic changes and so
      there is a need to optimize the site used depending on the patient's condition.
      Therefore, this study evaluated and compared the hemodynamic influence of right
      atrial cannulation (RAC) and right ventricular cannulation (RVC) inflow sites. An
      in vitro variable heart failure mock circulation loop was used to compare RAC and
      RVC in mild and severe biventricular heart failure (BHF) conditions. In the
      severe BHF condition, higher ventricular ejection fraction (RAC: 13.6%, RVC:
      32.7%) and thus improved heart chamber and RVAD washout were observed with RVC,
      which suggested this strategy might be preferable for long-term support (i.e.,
      bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy) to reduce the risk of thrombus
      formation. In the mild BHF condition, higher pulmonary valve flow (RAC: 3.33
      L/min, RVC: 1.97 L/min) and lower right ventricular stroke work (RAC: 0.10 W,
      RVC: 0.13 W) and volumes were recorded with RAC. These results indicate an
      improved potential for myocardial recovery, thus RAC should be chosen in this
      condition. This in vitro study suggests that RVAD inflow cannulation site should 
      be chosen on a patient-specific basis with a view to the support strategy to
      promote myocardial recovery or reduce the risk of long-term complications.

      intensive care unit.
PG  - 343-9
LID - 10.1177/0003319713485808 [doi]
AB  - Advanced chronic heart failure (ACHF) patients often require inotropes before
      transplantation or ventricular assist device implantation. Milrinone, an inotrope
      and vasodilator, may accumulate in cardiorenal syndrome with serious adverse
      effects. We investigated the potential for therapeutic drug monitoring of
      milrinone levels using High Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry
      (HPLC-MS). 22 ACHF patients (15 males, 49+/-9 years) received milrinone 50
      microg/kg intravenously (i.v.) during heart catheterization. Milrinone levels
      were 216+/-71 ng/ml (within the reported therapeutic range: 100-300 ng/ml),
      followed by improvements in cardiac index, pulmonary artery and wedge pressures
      (p < 0.005). 18 ACHF patients (17 males, 50+/-12 years, 13 had renal dysfunction)
      received continuous i.v. milrinone (5-26 days) at 0.1-0.2 microg/kg/min, titrated
      according to plasma milrinone levels. No adverse events occurred. Therapeutic
      levels were achieved with doses of 0.2+/-0.06 microg/Kg/min, below those
      recommended in Summary of Product Characteristics. Milrinone therapy can be
      noninvasively monitored by HPLC-MS, while avoiding toxicity in ACHF.

TI  - Predictors of 30-day mortality and outcome in cases of myocardial infarction with
      cardiogenic shock treated by extracorporeal life support.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The twin aims of this study were to identify the independent
      predictors of 30-day mortality and to analyse the outcomes of patients with
      cardiogenic shock (CS) associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and
      necessitating extracorporeal life support (ECLS). METHODS: The investigation was 
      a single-centre, retrospective study of 77 patients who required ECLS for AMI
      with CS. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent
      variables associated with 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Between February 2006 and
      November 2009, 745 patients in our establishment received ECLS. In the
      single-centre cohort, we retrospectively reviewed 77 patients who had required
      ECLS support for AMI with CS. The delay between AMI and CS ECLS was 15 +/- 4 h.
      PCI was performed in 58 patients (75.3%) and isolated emergency CABG in 12
      (15.6%). The remaining 7 patients (9.1%) did not undergo revascularization. ECLS 
      duration averaged 9.8 +/- 7.1 days. Nineteen patients were successfully weaned
      from ECLS (24%). Fifty-eight patients did not undergo or did not tolerate the
      weaning trial (76%). Forty patients died during ECLS support, 13 were implanted
      with a mono-ventricular (n = 9) or biventricular assist device (n = 4) and 5 were
      bridged to heart transplantation. Complications consisted primarily in pneumonia 
      (51.3%) and acute renal failure requiring haemofiltration (46.1%). Pulmonary
      oedema occurred in 24 patients (31.6%) and major bleeding in 16 (21.33%). 30-day 
      and in-hospital survival rates were, respectively, 38.9 and 33.8%. Multivariable 
      analysis identified preimplantation lactate serum level, preimplantation
      creatinine serum level and previous cardiopulmonary resuscitation as independent 
      predictors of 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Prompt ECLS support is an effective 
      strategy and provides a reasonable chance of survival in patients with AMI
      associated with profound CS. As shown in our results pertaining to predictive
      risk factors for 30-day mortality, reducing the duration of end-organ ischaemia
      is the keystone to management of this patient population. A major remaining
      challenge will consist in preventing pulmonary oedema following peripheral ECLS.

AB  - Heart transplantation has evolved as the "gold standard" therapy, with median
      survival exceeding 10 years, for patients with endstage heart failure (HF).
      Advancements in the fields of immunosuppression, infection prophylaxis, and
      surgical techniques have transformed heart transplantation from what was once
      considered an experimental intervention into a routine treatment. The number of
      heart transplants reported to the International Society of Heart and Lung
      Transplantation registry worldwide has been 3,500-4,000 annually, but has not
      been increased over the past 2 decades because of donor shortage despite the
      growing number of patients with HF. This imbalance between the supply of donor
      hearts and the demand of patients with endstage HF has led to increased use of
      mechanical circulatory support as destination therapy, because the supply of
      mechanical devices is virtually unlimited. Although mechanical circulatory
      support technology is improving, heart transplantation remains the preferred
      treatment for many patients because of major complications, such as stroke,
      bleeding and infection, and because of limited quality of life related to the
      driveline and the need for battery change. Therefore, significant efforts have
      been made to maximize the number of heart transplants and to ensure good
      outcomes.

TI  - The effect of long-term left ventricular assist device support on myocardial
      sympathetic activity in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 1035-43
LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hft059 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients have abundant levels of
      norepinephrine secondary to failure of the norepinephrine transporter uptake
      mechanism. Little is known about the effects of an LV assist device (LVAD) on
      cardiac sympathetic innervations and norepinephrine transporter dysfunction. This
      study examines the effects of continuous-flow HeartMate II LVAD on cardiac
      sympathetic innervations using [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine ([(123)I]MIBG)
      nuclear imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS: After injecting 431 +/- 21 MBq of
      [(123)I]MIBG, planar scintigraphy was performed at 15 min and 4 h in 14
      consecutive non-diabetic non-ischaemic DCM patients. Scans were executed early
      post-LVAD implantation (T1) and prior to either device explantation for
      myocardial recovery or transplant listing (T2). [(123)I]MIBG measured parameters 
      included early and delayed heart-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate (W/O).
      Catecholamine levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
      Following 208.4 +/- 85.5 days of LVAD support, both early and delayed H/M ratios 
      increased by 42.1% (P < 0.001) and 54.7% (P < 0.001), respectively. The W/O rate 
      decreased by 46% (P = 0.003). Plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine
      decreased significantly in correlation with [(123)I]MIBG parameters. Ten patients
      had recovered and had their device explanted as they had demonstrated a higher
      percentage change in delayed H/M ratio, W/O rate, and norepinephrine levels.
      Linear regression analysis revealed a strong correlation between percentage
      changes in both norepinephrine and epinephrine and myocardial recovery.
      CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with LVAD and drug resulted in enhancement of
      [(123)I]MIBG uptake in DCM patients.

TI  - Heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy: two comparable 
      options in end-stage heart failure?
PG  - 378-82
LID - 10.1002/clc.22124 [doi]
AB  - Heart transplantation is the only curative therapy for chronic heart failure, and
      it plays an important role in the treatment of chronic heart failure with a
      survival rate of approximately 50% of all patients after 10 years. This has to be
      kept in mind when alternative therapies enter into our daily routine in treating 
      this patient population. However, the shortage of appropriate donor organs and
      the expanding pool of patients waiting for heart transplantation have led to
      growing interest in alternative strategies, particularly in left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) therapy. With growing clinical experience and continued
      technical advances, continuous-flow pumps are evolving as a bridge to
      transplantation or as a destination therapy for advanced heart failure.
      Nevertheless, the importance of this new indication of chronic cardiac support
      compared to heart transplantation is still completely open and the object of
      controversial ongoing discussion. This review (1) describes the clinical use and 
      long-term outcome of a currently available miniaturized LVAD in the context to
      the standard of care-heart transplantation, (2) provides an outlook of the
      ongoing process of further optimization of LVADs, and (3) comments on the
      challenges with assist devices as alternatives to transplantation with a 5-year
      outlook.

TI  - DuraHeart magnetically levitated left ventricular assist device: Osaka University
      experience.
PG  - 1736-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The DuraHeart left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is the world's
      first approved magnetically levitated implantable centrifugal pump. We report our
      initial experience with the DuraHeart as a bridge to heart transplantation.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, 23 patients (17 males; mean age 35
      years, range 16-53 years) with endstage heart failure underwent implantation with
      the DuraHeart LVAD at Osaka University Hospital. Of those, 7 underwent conversion
      surgery from a Nipro paracorporeal LVAD to the DuraHeart. There were no deaths
      during the mean support period of 559+/-241 days (176-999 days). In total, 17
      patients (74%) remain with the LVAD and 5 (22%) underwent heart transplantation
      after 580+/-302 days (176-982 days) of support. Major adverse events included 8
      (34%) driveline/pocket infections, 4 (17%) cerebrovascular accidents, 4 (17%)
      right heart failures requiring mechanical support, and 3 (13%) mechanical device 
      failures (magnetic levitation failure caused by driveline fracture). Of the 5
      patients who developed pump pocket infection, 3 underwent previous conversion
      surgery from the Nipro LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with the
      DuraHeart LVAD in Japan demonstrated excellent long-term survival with acceptable
      rates of adverse events. With refinement of the system, including mechanical
      durability, this pump will further enhance the quality of life for patients who
      require long-term mechanical circulatory support.

LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2013.01.013 [doi]
LID - S1071-9164(13)00032-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is associated with excessive extracellular matrix 
      (ECM) deposition and abnormal ECM degradation leading to cardiac fibrosis.
      Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) modulates ECM production during
      inflammatory tissue injury, but available data on CTGF gene expression in failing
      human heart and its response to mechanical unloading are limited. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Left ventricle (LV) tissue from patients undergoing cardiac
      transplantation for ischemic (ICM; n = 20) and dilated (DCM; n = 20)
      cardiomyopathies and from nonfailing (NF; n = 20) donor hearts were examined.
      Paired samples (n = 15) from patients undergoing LV assist device (LVAD)
      implantation as "bridge to transplant" (34-1,145 days) also were analyzed. There 
      was more interstitial fibrosis in both ICM and DCM compared with NF hearts.
      Hydroxyproline concentration was also significantly increased in DCM compared
      with NF samples. The expression of CTGF, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1, 
      collagen (COL) 1-alpha1, COL3-alpha1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, and MMP9 
      mRNA in ICM and DCM were also significantly elevated compared with NF samples.
      Although TGF-beta1, CTGF, COL1-alpha1, and COL3-alpha1 mRNA levels were reduced
      by unloading, there was only a modest reduction in tissue fibrosis and no
      difference in protein-bound hydroxyproline concentration between pre- and
      post-LVAD tissue samples. The persistent fibrosis may be related to a concomitant
      reduction in MMP9 mRNA and protein levels following unloading. CONCLUSIONS: CTGF 
      may be a key regulator of fibrosis during maladaptive remodeling and progression 
      to HF. Although mechanical unloading normalizes most genotypic and functional
      abnormalities, its effect on ECM remodeling during HF is incomplete.

AB  - Heart transplantation is only available for a limited number of patients with
      end-stage heart failure. Since the arrival of newer ventricular assist devices,
      mechanical circulatory support constitutes an alternative therapy for patients
      with advanced heart failure. The first-generation of pulsatile-flow devices were 
      used only for bridging the sickest patients to transplantation. Frequent adverse 
      events, limited durability and the patients' discomfort made them unsuitable for 
      lifetime support. The second-generation continuous-flow devices were smaller,
      quieter and more durable. Survival rates of patients improved significantly. This
      led to a marked growth of device implantations, largely caused by an increase of 
      lifetime support. Survival of destination therapy patients is somewhat inferior
      to the survival of bridge-to-transplant patients, in part due to their co-morbid 
      conditions which limit life expectancy. A subgroup of patients on destination
      therapy with advanced, but stable heart failure and a low-risk profile reach
      short-term survival rates equal or superior to the survival after heart
      transplantation. These patients may be offered the choice of destination therapy 
      versus heart transplantation. However it remains unclear if long-term survival,
      quality of life and functional status on lifetime support can compete with the
      excellent results after transplantation. A trend to implanting devices at earlier
      stages of heart failure has begun. In a current trial, patients with advanced,
      but stable heart failure are randomised to destination therapy versus optimal
      medical therapy. The results of this trial will be expected to more precisely
      determine the place of mechanical circulatory support in the treatment of
      advanced heart failure.

TI  - Long-term membrane oxygenator use to support an infant with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome on biventricular assist device.
PG  - 196-8
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt131 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are used in children with severe heart failure 
      as a bridge to heart transplantation or recovery. Severe pulmonary dysfunction
      may preclude their use, leaving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as the
      most frequently used option for combined cardiac and respiratory failure. There
      are few case reports describing the use of an oxygenator in combination with VAD 
      support, but none that describes long-term utilization. We report the successful 
      use of a low-resistance oxygenator placed into the right-sided VAD (RVAD) circuit
      of an infant with life-threatening respiratory failure. The oxygenator enabled
      immediate reversal of hypoxaemia and hypercarbia and recovery of the RVAD
      function. The oxygenator remained within the VAD circuit for 15 days,
      facilitating complete lung recovery. An oxygenator used in conjunction with a VAD
      may be a life-saving therapy, allowing adequate oxygenation and ventilation in
      severe respiratory and cardiac failure. Extended use may facilitate the
      prevention of ventilator-associated lung injury and organ dysfunction. This
      therapy may be an attractive intermediate step in the transition from, or
      alternative to ECMO, in patients requiring VAD placement with associated acute
      lung injury.

TI  - Time course of acquired von Willebrand disease associated with two types of

      Synergy Pocket Micro-pump.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bleeding complications are frequent adverse events in patients
      supported with axial continuous-flow pumps. Previous retrospective studies
      demonstrated that bleeding events in patients with the HeartMate II (Thoratec
      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) were attributed to acquired von Willebrand syndrome. We
      sought to analyze the von Willebrand factor (VWF) profile in patients receiving a
      HeartMate II or a CircuLite (Saddle Brook, NJ,) device (Synergy Pocket
      Micro-pump) prospectively. METHODS: Prospectively analyzed were 34 patients
      supported with left ventricular assist device (LVAD; 26 with HeartMate II and 8
      with CircuLite). The control group comprised 20 patients who underwent heart
      transplantation (HTx). Blood samples were taken pre-operatively and at 14 days
      and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-operatively. RESULTS: Patients with LVADs had a
      high incidence of bleeding complications. From the immediate post-operative phase
      throughout the entire observation, the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity
      (Rco)/antigen (Ag) ratio of patients with HeartMate II and CircuLite devices was 
      consistently lower compared with HTx patients. No correlation was found between
      the individual VWF:Rco/Ag ratio and bleeding events or transfusion requirements. 
      The VWF:Rco/Ag ratio normalized immediately in patients who received HTx.
      CONCLUSIONS: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome was confirmed to occur immediately 
      after the implantation of both types of LVAD and persisted up to 12 months. A
      lower VWF:Rco/Ag ratio was associated with larger transfusion requirements.
      Acquired von Willebrand syndrome resolves after LVAD explantation.

TI  - Mechanical unloading activates FoxO3 to trigger Bnip3-dependent cardiomyocyte
      atrophy.
PG  - e000016
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.113.000016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical assist device therapy has emerged recently as an important
      and rapidly expanding therapy in advanced heart failure, triggering in some
      patients a beneficial reverse remodeling response. However, mechanisms underlying
      this benefit are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a model of mechanical unloading
      of the left ventricle, we observed progressive myocyte atrophy, autophagy, and
      robust activation of the transcription factor FoxO3, an established regulator of 
      catabolic processes in other cell types. Evidence for FoxO3 activation was
      similarly detected in unloaded failing human myocardium. To determine the role of
      FoxO3 activation in cardiac muscle in vivo, we engineered transgenic mice
      harboring a cardiomyocyte-specific constitutively active FoxO3 mutant
      (caFoxO3(flox);alphaMHC-Mer-Cre-Mer). Expression of caFoxO3 triggered dramatic
      and progressive loss of cardiac mass, robust increases in cardiomyocyte
      autophagy, declines in mitochondrial biomass and function, and early mortality.
      Whereas increases in cardiomyocyte apoptosis were not apparent, we detected
      robust increases in Bnip3 (Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3), an 
      established downstream target of FoxO3. To test the role of Bnip3, we crossed the
      caFoxO3(flox);alphaMHC-Mer-Cre-Mer mice with Bnip3-null animals. Remarkably, the 
      atrophy and autophagy phenotypes were significantly blunted, yet the early
      mortality triggered by FoxO3 activation persisted. Rather, declines in cardiac
      performance were attenuated by proteasome inhibitors. Consistent with involvement
      of FoxO3-driven activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we detected
      time-dependent activation of the atrogenes program and sarcomere protein
      breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, these data point to FoxO3, a protein
      activated by mechanical unloading, as a master regulator that governs both the
      autophagy-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasomal pathways to orchestrate cardiac
      muscle atrophy.

      Berlin Heart EXCOR in children: incidence and risk factors.
PG  - 851-6
LID - 10.1111/aor.12075 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to describe the incidence of brain injury (BI) in
      children with end-stage cardiac failure who were supported with the Berlin Heart 
      EXCOR ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation.
      Between January 2002 and January 2012, all patients <18 years of age who
      underwent the implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR at Bambino Gesu Children's
      Hospital were included. A total of 25 patients were included in this study.
      Median age and weight at implantation were 22.4 months (range 3.6-154.2) and 10
      kg (range 4.5-36), respectively. Diagnosis included cardiomyopathy (n = 20) and
      congenital heart disease (n = 5). Eleven patients received atrial cannulation.
      Nine patients underwent biventricular assist device support. Seven patients
      underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before the implantation of the
      EXCOR VAD. Median duration of VAD support was 51 days (range 2-167). Nine
      patients had evidence of acute BI including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 5) and
      cerebral ischemia (n = 4). Freedom from BI at 30, 60, and 90 days from VAD
      implantation was 80.7, 69.9, and 43.3%, respectively. Weight <10 kg at
      implantation was significantly associated with BI. BI is a frequent complication 
      among children supported with EXCOR VAD and is associated with lower weight at
      implantation. However, our data do not support the association between size and
      BI. Future prospective multicenter studies are warranted to further help
      understand the etiology and the impact of BI and to improve functional outcomes
      for children undergoing EXCOR VAD mechanical support.

      support.
PG  - 523-30
LID - 10.1111/aor.12038 [doi]
AB  - Early planned institution of temporary right ventricular assist device (RVAD)
      support with the CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, MA, USA) in left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) recipients was compared with permanent biventricular assist 
      device (BVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH) support. Between 2007 and 2011, 77 
      patients (age range: 25-70 years) with preoperative evidence of biventricular
      dysfunction (University of Pennsylvania score >50; University of Michigan score
      >5) were included. Forty-six patients (38 men; median age 54.5 years, range:
      25-70 years) underwent LVAD placement combined with temporary RVAD support (group
      A); in 31 patients (25 men; median age 56.7 years, range: 28-68 years), a
      permanent BVAD or TAH implantation (group B) was performed. Within 30 days, 12
      patients from group A (26.08%) and 14 patients from group B (45.1%) died on
      mechanical support (P = 0.02). Thirty patients (65.2%) in group A were weaned
      from temporary RVAD support and three (6.5%) underwent permanent RVAD (HeartWare,
      Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) placement. A total of 26 patients (56.5%) were
      discharged home in group A versus 17 (54.8%) in group B (P = 0.56). Three
      patients (8.5%) received heart transplantation in group A and six (19.3%) in
      group B (P = 0.04). In group A, 90-day and 6-month survival was 54.3% (n = 25)
      versus 51.6% (n = 16) in group B (P = 0.66). In group A, 1-year survival was
      45.6% (n = 21) versus 45.1% (n = 14) in group B (P = 0.81). The strategy of
      planned temporary RVAD support in LVAD recipients showed encouraging results if
      compared with those of a similar permanent BVAD/TAH population. Weaning from and 
      removal of the temporary RVAD support may allow patients to be on LVAD support
      only despite preoperative biventricular dysfunction.

AB  - Continuous-flow ventricular assist devices (CVADs) have gained widespread use as 
      an effective clinical therapy for patients with advanced-stage heart failure.
      Axial and centrifugal CVADs have been successfully used as bridge-to-transplant
      and destination therapy. CVADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than 
      the first-generation pulsatile-flow ventricular assist devices. Despite their
      recent clinical success, arteriovenous malformations, gastrointestinal bleeding, 
      hemorrhagic strokes, aortic valve insufficiency, and valve fusion have been
      reported in heart failure patients supported by CVADs. It has been hypothesized
      that diminished arterial pressure and flow pulsatility delivered by CVAD may be a
      contributing factor to these adverse events. Subsequently, the clinical
      significance of vascular pulsatility continues to be highly debated. Studies
      comparing pulsatile-flow and continuous-flow support have presented conflicting
      findings, largely due to variations in device operation, support duration, and
      the criteria used to quantify pulsatility. Traditional measurements of pulse
      pressure and pulsatility index are less effective at quantifying pulsatility for 
      mechanically derived flows, particularly with the growing trend of CVAD speed
      modulation to achieve various pulsatile flow patterns. Kinetic measurements of
      energy equivalent pressure and surplus hemodynamic energy can better quantify
      pulsatile energies, yet technologic and conceptual challenges are impeding their 
      clinical adaption. A review of methods for quantifying vascular pulsatility and
      their application as a research tool for investigating physiologic responses to
      CVAD support are presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are minimal data regarding ventricular assist device (VAD)
      implantation in adult patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD).
      METHODS: The medical records of 6 adult patients with complex CHD who underwent
      VAD implantation were retrospectively analyzed to characterize pre-operative
      clinical status, implantation techniques and challenges, post-operative
      management, and post-operative outcomes. RESULTS: All patients had a systemic
      right ventricle, including 2 with single-ventricle physiology. The average age at
      VAD implantation was 41 years. The implanted VADs included 1 HeartMate XVE, 3
      HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA), 1 Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, New
      York, NY), and 1 HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA). In-hospital
      outcomes included no sub-pulmonic ventricular failure, no VAD thrombosis or
      mechanical failure, 30-day mortality in 1 patient, non-fatal sub-arachnoid
      hemorrhage in 1 patient, and sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring
      unsynchronized direct current cardioversion in 1 patient. Of the 5 patients who
      survived to discharge, 1 patient received 171 days of VAD support before cardiac 
      transplantation and survived for 1,484 days after transplantation; 1 patient
      received 262 days of VAD support before out-of-hospital death of unknown
      etiology; 1 patient had received VAD support for 988 days as of December 1, 2012,
      while awaiting a transplant; and 2 patients who received VADs as destination
      therapy had received 577 and 493 days of VAD support, respectively, and were
      still alive as of December 1, 2012. CONCLUSIONS: This case series characterizes
      important post-operative management challenges and clinical outcomes associated
      with VAD implantation as a bridge-to-transplant or as destination therapy in
      adult patients with complex CHD.

TI  - Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric ventricular assist device for bridge to heart
      transplantation in US children.
PG  - 1702-11
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000685 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular
      assist device is superior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for bridge to
      heart transplantation. Published data are limited to 1 in 4 children who received
      the device as part of the US clinical trial. We analyzed outcomes for all US
      children who received the EXCOR to characterize device outcomes in an unselected 
      cohort and to identify risk factors for mortality to facilitate patient
      selection. METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study
      involved all children implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular
      assist device at 47 centers from May 2007 through December 2010. Multiphase
      nonproportional hazards modeling was used to identify risk factors for early (<2 
      months) and late mortality. Of 204 children supported with the EXCOR, the median 
      duration of support was 40 days (range, 1-435 days). Survival at 12 months was
      75%, including 64% who reached transplantation, 6% who recovered, and 5% who were
      alive on the device. Multivariable analysis identified lower weight,
      biventricular assist device support, and elevated bilirubin as risk factors for
      early mortality and bilirubin extremes and renal dysfunction as risk factors for 
      late mortality. Neurological dysfunction occurred in 29% and was the leading
      cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR has risen dramatically
      over the past decade. The EXCOR has emerged as a new treatment standard in the
      United States for pediatric bridge to transplantation. Three-quarters of children
      survived to transplantation or recovery; an important fraction experienced
      neurological dysfunction. Smaller patient size, renal dysfunction, hepatic
      dysfunction, and biventricular assist device use were associated with mortality, 
      whereas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before implantation and congenital
      heart disease were not.

AB  - Heart failure is a leading cause of death in human populations, and as people
      live longer, it is becoming an increasingly prominent problem. Because of the
      insufficient numbers of donor hearts, physicians and engineers are turning to
      mechanical circulatory support in the form of ventricular assist devices (VADs). 
      Their clinical performance and increasing availability of various types, sizes,
      and functions are increasing VAD recognition. However, for any implantable
      medical device, especially one that is life supporting, performance and safety
      must be evaluated both pre- and postmarket. It has been demonstrated that
      specific pathology analysis can provide unique and important information to
      augment the evaluation of performance and safety. To help ensure the safety and
      efficacy of a device, we propose that regulatory agencies include pathology
      analysis by experienced, independent pathologists with relevant expertise as an
      integral component of device submissions. We believe that this analysis should
      include both gross and microscopic components and, when warranted, supplementary 
      data obtained through radiography, electron microscopy, or both. The pathology
      data acquired through these analyses should be correlated with clinical data to
      yield a more thorough data set for submission to the governing regulatory body.
      Submitting this coordinated analysis of data will demonstrate to regulatory
      agencies (United States Food and Drug Administration, Therapeutic Goods
      Administration, Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency, etc.) that the device
      manufacturer shares their objective: making medical devices as safe and effective
      as possible. SUMMARY: This review of ventricular assist devices introduces a
      recommended protocol for pathology evaluations of devices from organizations or
      researchers seeking approval by a governing regulatory agency.

TI  - Ventricular assist devices (VAD) therapy: new technology, new hope?
PG  - 32-7
AB  - Ventricular assist devices are commonly utilized in the treatment of end-stage
      heart failure. Advances in continuous flow technology have improved efficiency,
      size, implantability, extended support, and overall patient outcomes. This has
      led to an expanded role of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) clinical use and
      applications. This review describes the advances and current state of LVAD
      devices and provides a future outlook for this technology.

AB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide acceptable
      clinical results, but the long waiting period for heart transplantation leads to 
      diverse complications. LVAD support can cause reverse left ventricular (LV)
      remodeling that results in the improvement of LV function and allows LVAD
      removal. We present a case of successful removal of a DuraHeart LVAD because of
      sufficient recovery of LV function. Before LVAD removal, we conducted an "LVAD
      weaning test" by decreasing pump speed and performing an additional normal saline
      infusion test. We consider that the LVAD weaning test can be used in place of the
      "pulsatile LVAD off test."

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to prospectively investigate the longitudinal
      effects of continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) unloading on
      myocardial structure and systolic and diastolic function. BACKGROUND: The
      magnitude, timeline, and sustainability of changes induced by continuous-flow
      LVAD on the structure and function of the failing human heart are unknown.
      METHODS: Eighty consecutive patients with clinical characteristics consistent
      with chronic heart failure requiring implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD were 
      prospectively enrolled. Serial echocardiograms (at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12
      months) and right heart catheterizations were performed after LVAD implant.
      Cardiac recovery was assessed on the basis of improvement in systolic and
      diastolic function indices on echocardiography that were sustained during LVAD
      turn-down studies. RESULTS: After 6 months of LVAD unloading, 34% of patients had
      a relative LV ejection fraction increase above 50% and 19% of patients, both
      ischemic and nonischemic, achieved an LV ejection fraction >/= 40%. LV systolic
      function improved as early as 30 days, the greatest degree of improvement was
      achieved by 6 months of mechanical unloading and persisted over the 1-year follow
      up. LV diastolic function parameters also improved as early as 30 days after LVAD
      unloading, and this improvement persisted over time. LV end-diastolic and
      end-systolic volumes decreased as early as 30 days after LVAD unloading (113 vs. 
      77 ml/m(2), p < 0.01, and 92 vs. 60 ml/m(2), p < 0.01, respectively). LV mass
      decreased as early as 30 days after LVAD unloading (114 vs. 95 g/m(2), p < 0.05) 
      and continued to do so over the 1-year follow-up but did not reach values below
      the normal reference range, suggesting no atrophic remodeling after prolonged
      LVAD unloading. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous-flow LVAD unloading induced in a subset
      of patients, both ischemic and nonischemic, early improvement in myocardial
      structure and systolic and diastolic function that was largely completed within 6
      months, with no evidence of subsequent regression.

AB  - We present the first report of the concurrent use of mechanical circulatory
      support and bariatric surgery in a morbidly obese patient as a bridge to
      successful heart transplantation. The concurrent use of mechanical circulatory
      support and bariatric surgery allowed the patient to lose weight and subsequently
      to qualify for placement on the heart transplant waiting list. This strategy
      supports consideration of patients previously deemed unsuitable for heart
      transplantation owing to morbid obesity. Careful patient selection and strict
      monitoring of the immunosuppressive regimens are important considerations for a
      favorable outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) systolic function has a critical role in
      determining the clinical outcome and the success of using left ventricular assist
      devices (LVADs) in patients with refractory heart failure. RV deformation
      analysis by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) has recently allowed a deeper
      analysis of RV longitudinal function. The aim of the study was to observe RV
      function by STE in patients with advanced heart failure before and after LVAD
      implantation. METHODS: Transthoracic echo Doppler was performed in 10 patients
      referred for LVAD therapy at baseline and with serial echocardiograms after LVAD 
      implantation. In a sub-group of 4 patients, an echocardiographic evaluation was
      also made after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support was initiated and before
      LVAD implantation. All echocardiographic images were analyzed off-line to
      calculate the free wall RV longitudinal strain (RVLS). RESULTS: Three patients
      who presented the lowest free wall RVLS values at baseline, showed a progressive 
      decline of RVLS after LVAD implant, presenting finally RV failure; however,
      patients with higher values of RVLS at baseline presented a further and overt
      increase of strain values in the course of follow-up. The overall performance for
      the prediction of RV failure after LVAD implant was greatest for free wall RVLS
      (area under the curve, 0.93). For the sub-group receiving the IABP as an
      intermediate step, only 2 patients with an increase of RVLS after IABP
      implantation also showed an increase of RVLS levels, after subsequent LVAD
      implantation. The 2 patients without an increase of RVLS after IABP implantation 
      also presented with RV failure after LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study of 10 
      patients indicates that the new parameter of RVLS, representing RV myocardial
      deformation, may have important clinical implications for the selection and
      management of LVAD patients. A large multicenter study is required to confirm
      these observations and to quantify the clinical significance of changes in RVLS
      value.

AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 27-year-old man presented with acute dyspnea
      and a previous respiratory tract infection with progressive dyspnoea and chest
      pain over 2 weeks. Clinical findings revealed severe cardiac failure with
      development of cardiogenic shock and need for adrenergic drug therapy for
      circulatory support. INVESTIGATIONS: The electrocardiogram showed a sinus
      tachycardia with unspecific T-wave-inversions, the echocardiogram revealed a
      dilated left ventricle and severely reduced systolic LV-function. An acute
      coronary syndrome could be excluded by coronary angiogram. TREATMENT AND COURSE: 
      A myocardial biopsy was taken to exclude giant cell myocarditis. The immediate
      initiation of a mechanical circulatory support by an Extracorporal Membrane
      Oxygenator (ECMO) facilitated rapid hemodynamic stabilization and recovery of
      organ function. CONCLUSIONS: A drug-only circulatory support very often does not 
      enable stabilization of a patient in progressive cardiogenic shock and cannot
      prevent multiorgan dysfunction. Therefore implantation of an assist device
      facilitates a "bridging-to-recovery" or a "bridging-to transplant" concept in
      critically ill patients presenting with cardiogenic shock. The bridging also
      allows for reviewing etiology and evaluation of further treatment options. In
      case of recovery continuous care in a specialized Heart Failure Clinic can help
      to maintain the clinical status and offer frequent reevaluation of cardiac status
      and therapeutic concepts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scarce literature exists describing the patterns of readmission after
      continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation. These
      carry significant cost and quality of life implications. We sought to describe
      the etiology and pattern of readmission among patients receiving CF-LVADs.
      METHODS: Frequency, reason, urgency, and duration of readmission as well as
      freedom from readmission were examined in a retrospective review of our
      institutional experience. As an indirect means of quality of life, the ratio of
      days out of hospital (OOH)/days alive with device was calculated. RESULTS: From
      2006 to 2011, 71 adult patients implanted with a CF device were included.
      Indication for device implantation was bridge to transplant (n=19), potential
      bridge to transplant (n=25), or destination therapy (n=27). Length of support
      averaged 359 days. Total support time was 69.7 patient years. One hundred
      fifty-five readmissions accounted for a total of 1,659 hospital days. Fifty-six
      patients were readmitted during the study period. Median time to first
      readmission was 48 days (range 2 to 663 days). Median length of stay was 5 days. 
      The single most common etiology for readmission was gastrointestinal bleeding
      accounting for 14% of readmissions. Readmissions were urgent (87%), elective
      (10%), or life-threatening (3%). Patients on the average enjoyed 92% of their
      time OOH. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing CF-LVAD support are often readmitted
      within 6 months of discharge. Readmissions tend to be of short duration and the
      most common reason is for gastrointestinal bleeding. Importantly, following
      discharge after implant procedure, 51 patients spent at least 90% of days OOH.

LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.000178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several new
      therapies for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction over the
      preceding 2 decades. This study investigates whether these therapeutic advances
      have translated into improvement in outcomes for patients with advanced HF
      referred to a heart transplant center. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HF
      (n=2507) referred to a single university center were analyzed in three 6-year
      eras during which medical and device therapies were evolving: 1993 to 1998 (era
      1), 1999 to 2004 (era 2), and 2005 to 2010 (era 3). Impaired hemodynamics and
      comorbidities were more frequent at time of referral in later eras, whereas other
      HF severity parameters where similar or improved. Successive eras had greater
      usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, 
      beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, 
      and cardiac resynchronization therapy, consistent with evolving evidence and
      guideline recommendations over the study period. All-cause mortality and sudden
      death were significantly lower in era 2 and 3 compared with era 1. After
      multivariable risk adjustment, era 3 had significantly decreased 2- and 3-year
      all-cause mortality risk and significantly decreased 1- and 3-year sudden death
      risk compared with era 1. However, progressive HF death and the combined outcome 
      of mortality/urgent transplant/ventricular assist device were modestly increased 
      in the latter eras. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 2 decades, patients with advanced 
      HF referred to and managed at a tertiary university referral center have
      benefited from advances in HF medications and devices, as evidenced by
      improvements in overall survival and sudden death risk.

TI  - Pulsatility and the risk of nonsurgical bleeding in patients supported with the
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device HeartMate II.
PG  - 517-26

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bleeding is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients
      with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Reduced pulsatility
      has been implicated as a contributing cause. The aim of this study was to assess 
      the effects of different degrees of pulsatility on the incidence of nonsurgical
      bleeding. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Utah Transplantation Affiliated Hospitals
      (U.T.A.H.) heart failure and transplant program databases were queried for
      patients with end-stage heart failure who required support with the
      continuous-flow LVAD HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) between 2004
      and 2012. Pulsatility was evaluated by means of the LVAD parameter pulsatility
      index (PI) and by the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve opening during
      the first 3 months of LVAD support. PI was analyzed as a continuous variable and 
      also stratified according to tertiles of all the PI measurements during the study
      period (low PI: <4.6, intermediate PI: 4.6-5.2, and high PI: >5.2). Major
      nonsurgical bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin >/=2 g/dL (in the
      absence of hemolysis) was the primary end point. A total of 134 patients (median 
      age of 60 [interquartile range: 49-68] years, 78% men) were included. Major
      bleeding occurred in 33 (25%) patients (70% gastrointestinal, 21% epistaxis, 3%
      genitourinary, and 6% intracranial). In multivariable analysis, PI examined
      either as a categorical variable, low versus high PI (hazard ratio, 4.06; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.35-12.21; P=0.04), or as a continuous variable (hazard
      ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.92; P=0.02) was associated with an
      increased risk of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced pulsatility in patients
      supported with the continuous-flow LVAD HeartMate II is associated with an
      increased risk of nonsurgical bleeding, as evaluated by PI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic events while receiving ventricular assist device (VAD)
      support remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite standard
      anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapies. The use of bivalirudin and
      epoprostenol infusions as an alternate anti-thrombotic (AT) regimen in pediatric 
      VAD patients was reviewed. METHODS: This was a retrospective record review of 6
      pediatric patients (aged </=17 years) at 2 institutions treated with bivalirudin 
      and epoprostenol infusions while being supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR
      (Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin, Germany) VAD. RESULTS: Six patients (age, 0.8-14
      years; weight, 6.7-29.7 kg) were treated. Diagnoses included cardiomyopathy in 2 
      and congenital heart disease in 4. VAD support was left VAD in 2 and bi-VAD in 4,
      with duration of support of 21 to 155 days. Three patients required
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before VAD support. Bivalirudin/epoprostenol 
      was used after recurrent thromboses on conventional medication in 3 patients,
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in 2, and in 1 patient considered high risk with
      a prosthetic mitral valve. The bivalirudin dose was titrated to partial
      thromboplastin time (PTT) of 1.5- to 2-times baseline (0.1-0.8 mg/kg/hour); the
      epoprostenol dose was 2 to 10 ng/kg/min. Additional anti-platelet agents included
      acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and clopidogrel in 5 patients each. No
      bleeding complications occurred. One patient sustained a cerebrovascular infarct 
      on therapy, with subsequent complete recovery. No other complications occurred.
      Five patients underwent successful transplantation, and 1 patient died of
      multisystem organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides data on estimated
      safety and efficacy of bivalirudin and epoprostenol as an AT strategy in
      pediatric patients on extended VAD support. The short drug half-life and
      predictable AT response facilitated conversion to standard AT regimens at the
      time of transplantation (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-negative patients).
      These agents should be considered for management of pediatric VAD patients when
      standard regimens fail.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is increasingly being
      offered to older patients, few studies have evaluated outcomes in patients older 
      than 70 years of age. We undertook this study to characterize the outcomes of
      septuagenarians bridged to transplantation (BTT) in the modern era. METHODS: We
      conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult OHT in the United Network for
      Organ Sharing database from 2005 to 2011. Primary stratification was by age 70
      years or older. Subgroup analysis evaluated patients who received BTT. The
      primary outcome was survival as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS:
      From January 2005 to December 2011, 12,274 adults underwent OHT, including 3,243 
      (26.4%) who received BTT. In the entire cohort, 11,996 (97.7%) recipients were
      aged 18 to 70 years, and 277 (2.3%) were 70 years of age or older. Overall,
      patients 70 years or older who underwent OHT had decreased 90-day survival (93.6%
      versus 88.8%; p<0.01), 1-year survival (89.0% versus 81.6%; p<0.01), and 2-year
      survival (85.4% versus 79.9%; p<0.01) compared with recipients of other ages.
      However in the BTT subgroup, recipients 70 years and older (n=43) had similar
      90-day (91.2% versus 84.7%; p=0.2), 1-year (86.1% versus 81.7%; p=0.4), and
      2-year (82.8% versus 81.7%; p=0.6) survival compared with recipients of other
      ages (n=3,200). After adjusting for multiple recipient and donor factors, age
      greater than or equal to 70 years was still not associated with an increased
      hazard of mortality at 90 days, 1 year, or 2 years. These results were verified
      by analysis of a propensity-matched cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients older 
      than the age of 70 years undergoing OHT have decreased survival, among patients
      who received BTT, septuagenarians have outcomes similar to those of younger
      recipients. In carefully selected patients dependent on left ventricular assist
      devices (LVADs), recipient age greater than or equal to 70 years should not be
      viewed as a contraindication to OHT.

TI  - Complication profile of the Berlin Heart EXCOR biventricular support in children.
PG  - 730-5
LID - 10.1111/aor.12062 [doi]
AB  - In chronic cardiomyopathy, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) plays an
      increasingly important role for children as the shortage of suitable donor hearts
      increases waiting time on the transplant list. We report our experience with the 
      paracorporal Berlin Heart EXCOR System (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) used as
      a biventricuclar assist device (BVAD). Nine patients with a BVAD EXCOR system
      were treated between 2006 and 2012; out of these patients, four were less than 18
      years old (6, 14, 14, and 17 years old). Their diagnoses were postcardotomy
      failure (n = 1), dilatative cardiomyopathy (n = 2), and terminal heart failure (n
      = 1). Overall survival, waiting time for heart transplantation (HTx) and
      complication profile for the BVAD were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty days'
      mortality was 25% (n = 1). One child died after 84 days on support due to
      cerebral bleeding. Mean support time was 218.75 days (4, 84, 262, and 525 days). 
      Pump chamber exchange was necessary three times due to pump chamber thrombosis (n
      = 2) and partial pump chamber membrane rupture (n = 1). Complications included:
      sepsis (n = 1), drive line infection requiring intravenous antibiotics (n = 2),
      and recurrent epistaxis (n = 3). Two children were successfully transplanted
      after 262/525 days on BVAD; they are currently at home (follow-up: 1.9 and 2.3
      years). The EXCOR is a life-saving MCS system suitable for long-term
      paracorporeal biventricular assistance.

PG  - 253-7

AB  - Fixed pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a contraindication for heart transplantation
      (HTx). Several studies showed that use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      in patients with fixed PH who were initially deemed ineligible for HTx
      effectively decreased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), thus permitting HTx. We 
      recently encountered a candidate for HTx who had severe PH with extremely high
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). A 27-year-old female who had been diagnosed 
      with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and who was approved for HTx at
      age 25 was referred to our institute because of severe fatigability with moderate
      dyspnea even at rest due to severe bilateral heart failure. Despite continuous
      inotrope infusion, the patient's symptoms were not relieved. Right heart
      catheterization (RHC) disclosed a PAP of 62/40 mmHg with severely reduced cardiac
      output (1.8 l/min). A PVR of 15.9 Wood units suggested progressive worsening of
      left ventricular function with almost irreversible remodeling of the pulmonary
      vasculature, and the patient was thought to be contraindicated for HTx. Following
      3 weeks of aggressive medical treatment, repeat RHC demonstrated PVR lowering to 
      8.16 Wood units. This suggested it was likely that PVR could be reversed, and the
      patient underwent LVAD implantation. RHC performed after LVAD implantation showed
      a fall in PVR from the initial, extremely high measurement of 15.9 Wood units to 
      3.4 Wood units at 2 months postoperatively, and to 2.2 Wood units at 1 year. The 
      patient is currently awaiting HTx with favorable LVAD support.

AB  - Despite technological advances in a newer generation of ventricular assist
      devices (VAD), complications, such as pump thromboses, remain a significant cause
      of morbidity and indeed mortality in these patients. We present the case of a
      34-year old patient who underwent HeartAssist 5 (HA5) implantation as a bridge to
      cardiac transplant. After an initial uneventful recovery, he developed a pump
      thrombosis that was refractory to medical treatment. We present the surgical
      technique used to exchange the HA5 with a HeartWare (HVAD), leaving the old
      inflow-sewing ring in situ.

AB  - Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) have 
      become indispensable treatment tools for pediatric patients with congenital heart
      defects undergoing peri-operative or end-stage heart and/or lung failure. ECLS
      and MCS can serve as bridges to recovery, transplantation (heart or lung),
      destination therapy, or "bridge to bridge" long-term MCS. Dependent on patient
      condition, venoarterial ECMO (V-A ECMO) for heart and lung support, venovenous
      ECMO (V-V ECMO) for respiratory support, and MCS for uni- and biventricular
      support can be selected properly. Considering small patient body size, the access
      sites and cannulation should be selected carefully to obtain adequate blood flow,
      minimum injury, and easy management. The applying equipment, including tubing,
      cannulae, oxygenator and blood pump, need to be selected optimally in order to
      enable rapid setup and priming, successful cannulation and early support, and to 
      reduce the risk of device-related morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review
      manuscript was to discuss briefly the current devices for pediatric ECLS and MCS 
      available in US.

      increased risk of developing heart failure. Implantation of a ventricular assist 
      device may be the only therapeutic option for patients who are not

      device into the RV have not been well described, however. We describe our
      experience with one such case and describe our operative strategy in obtaining
      optimal placement of the inflow cannula.

PG  - 117-22

AB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (cfLVADs) have been proven safe
      and effective for bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy (DT) in patients
      with advanced heart failure. However, the fixed pump speed of these devices may
      lack response to activity and oxygen demand, thereby limiting exercise tolerance.
      The objective of this observational study was to describe exercise capacity as
      measured by peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) that may be expected during
      support with a cfLVAD. Peak VO2 was measured in patients (mean age: 58.3 +/- 11.7
      years; 66.7% ischemic and 33.3% DT) before cfLVAD support (11.2 +/- 3.0
      ml/kg/min, n = 25), between 3 and 6 months (12.7 +/- 3.5 ml/kg/min, n = 31), at 1
      year (10.7 +/- 2.6 ml/kg/min, n = 16), and longer than 1 year (11.2 +/- 1.7
      ml/kg/min, n = 10). There was no statistical improvement in peak VO2 at any time 
      point after implantation. In addition, ventilatory efficiency remained poor after
      LVAD implantation at all time points. Although studies have shown an increase in 
      survival and patient's quality of life, exercise capacity as measured by
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing remains low during cfLVAD support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification of ambulatory heart failure (HF) patients has
      relied on peak VO(2)<14 ml/kg/min. We investigated whether additional clinical
      variables might further specify risk of death, ventricular assist device (VAD)
      implantation (INTERMACS <4) or heart transplantation (HTx, Status 1A or 1B)
      within 1 year after HTx evaluation. We hypothesized that right ventricular stroke
      work index (RVSWI), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and the model for
      end-stage liver disease-albumin score (MELD-A) would be additive prognostic
      predictors. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on 151 ambulatory patients
      undergoing HTx evaluation. Primary outcomes were defined as HTx, LVAD or death
      within 1 year after evaluation. RESULTS: Average age in our cohort was 55 +/-
      11.1 years, 79.1% were male and 39% had an ischemic etiology (LVEF 21 +/- 10.5%
      and peak VO(2) 12.6 +/- 3.5 ml/kg/min). Fifty outcomes (33.1%) were observed (27 
      HTxs, 15 VADs and 8 deaths). Univariate logistic regression showed a significant 
      association of RVSWI (OR 0.47, p = 0.036), PCWP (OR 2.65, p = 0.007) and MELD-A
      (OR 2.73, p = 0.006) with 1-year events. Stepwise regression showed an
      independent correlation of RVSWI<5gm-m(2)/beat (OR 6.70, p < 0.01), PCWP>20 mm Hg
      (OR 5.48, p < 0.01), MELD-A>14 (OR 3.72, p< 0.01) and peak VO(2)<14 ml/kg/min (OR
      3.36, p = 0.024) with 1-year events. A scoring system was developed: MELD-A>14
      and peak VO(2)<14-1 point each; and PCWP>20 and RVSWI<5-2 points each. A cut-off 
      at>/=4 demonstrated a 54% sensitivity and 88% specificity for 1-year events.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory HF patients have significant 1-year event rates. Risk
      stratification based on exercise performance, left-sided congestion, right
      ventricular dysfunction and liver congestion allows prediction of 1-year
      prognosis. Our findings support early and timely referral for VAD and/or
      transplant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Combining mechanical unloading by a continuous-flow left ventricular 
      assist device (CF-LVAD) and neurohormonal blockade with heart failure medications
      (HFMED) is an underexplored clinical strategy to promote recovery of cardiac
      function in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). METHODS: We implemented a 
      clinical protocol to achieve maximal neurohormonal blockade after placement of a 
      CF-LVAD and assessed its utility in an LVAD weaning (6,200 rpm) study.
      Thirty-four subjects were enrolled after CF-LVAD and were managed with
      aggressive, bi-weekly up-titration of HFMED. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (8 with
      coronary artery disease, 13 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) were included
      in this LVAD weaning investigation. Overall, combined CF-LVAD and HFMED resulted 
      in significant reverse remodeling with a decrease in left atrial volume index
      (44.7+/-16.0 to 31.6+/-12.1 ml/m(2), p < 0.001) and LV internal diastolic
      diameter (6.7+/-1.5 to 6.0+/-1.6 cm, p = 0.003) and an increase in LV ejection
      fraction (17.4+/-6.5 to 33.1+/-16.2%, p < 0.001) during LVAD weaning (6,200 rpm).
      Five of 21 (24%) subjects demonstrated recovery of biventricular function.
      Exploratory analysis showed that recovered subjects had shorter duration HF, less
      myocardial fibrosis and less myocyte hypertrophy, and were supported at higher
      LVAD speeds. CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support in combination with HFMED leads to
      significant reverse remodeling in patients with advanced HF. Using this approach,
      one quarter of patients demonstrated complete recovery of cardiac function. Our
      results suggest that bridge to recovery in the current device era is a clinically
      meaningful phenomenon and merits further investigation.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly being used both as a
      bridge to transplantation and for long-term myocardial surrogate destination
      therapy in patients with end-stage heart failure. Primarily owing to the presence
      of a driveline that connects the device to an external battery through an open
      skin incision, the rates of LVAD-related infections (LVADRIs) are high, ranging
      from 30 to 50%. LVADRIs can be broadly classified into driveline infection, pump 
      pocket infection, bloodstream infection and endocarditis/pump or cannula
      infection. Diagnostic evaluation and management of these complicated infections
      can be quite challenging for clinicians involved in the care of these patients.
      Here, the authors summarize the current epidemiology, microbiology, diagnostic
      approach and management strategies for each type of LVADRI. The authors also
      review current concepts regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for LVAD implantation.
      Finally, the authors highlight the gaps in the knowledge of LVADRI and provide
      directions for future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow (CF) pumps have yielded improvements in short- and
      long-term survival and quality of life, and have reduced the number of left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD)-related complications. However, their ability to
      unload the right ventricle (RV) and improve RV function has not been as clearly
      defined. We evaluated the short- and mid-term effects of CF-LVADs on central
      venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), pulmonary capillary
      wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac index (CI), RV ejection fraction (RVEF), RV
      end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD), RV stroke work index (RVSWI), tricuspid annular 
      plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
      METHODS: From March 2006 through June 2012, 130 patients with chronic heart
      failure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD (122 HeartMate II and 8 HeartWare
      devices) as a bridge to transplant (n = 76) or as destination therapy (n = 54).
      Patients with pre-operative long-term LVADs (n = 4) and patients who underwent
      concomitant tricuspid valve repairs during their LVAD implant (n = 21) were
      excluded from the analysis. Echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations of
      the remaining 105 patients were reviewed pre-operatively and at 1 and 6 months
      post-LVAD implantation. RESULTS: At 1 month post-LVAD implantation, CVP decreased
      from 12.4 +/- 5.9 mm Hg to 8.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001), systolic PAP decreased 
      from 52.3 +/- 14.1 mm Hg to 36.8 +/- 11.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001), PCWP decreased from 
      23.0 +/- 9.4 mm Hg to 12.9 +/- 8.0 mm Hg (p < 0.001), CI index increased from 1.8
      +/- 0.5 liters/min m2 to 2.4 +/- 0.5 liters/min m2 (p < 0.001), RVEF increased
      from 33.1 +/- 4.9% to 40.4 +/- 6.2% (p < 0.001), RVEDD decreased from 36 mm to 31
      mm (p = 0.020), RVSWI improved from 408.6 +/- 144.6 mm Hg ml m2 to 614.4 +/-
      196.2 mm Hg ml m2 (p < 0.001), and mean TAPSE increased from 1.1 +/- 0.4 cm to
      1.9 +/- 0.4 cm (p = 0.004). Similarly, qualitative RV function on
      echocardiography improved from 57.1% moderately or severely reduced
      pre-operatively to 38.1% at 1 month (p = 0.008). Severity of TR decreased from
      11.4% moderate or severe pre-operatively to 4.8% at 1 month (p < 0.001). These
      improvements were maintained at 6 months post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support 
      significantly decreased CVP and RVEDD, with concomitant improvement in RV
      function, as measured by increases in RVEF, RVSWI and TAPSE, as well as
      improvements in the qualitative echocardiographic appearance of RV contractility 
      and a reduction in TR.

AB  - Right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex problem with poor outcomes. Diagnosis
      requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, because many of the signs and
      symptoms of this condition are nonspecific and can be acute or chronic.
      Identification of the underlying aetiology, which can include pulmonary
      hypertension, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, congenital or valvular heart
      disease, and sepsis, is essential. Echocardiography is the technique of choice
      for first-line assessment, but cardiac MRI is the current gold standard for
      anatomical and functional assessment of the right ventricle. Therapy for RV
      failure should be directed at the underlying cause, although management of
      symptoms is also important. Therapeutic options range from pharmacological
      treatment to mechanical RV support and heart transplantation. The complex 3D
      geometry of the right ventricle and its intricate interactions with the left
      ventricle have left many questions about RV failure unanswered. However,
      promising new targeted therapies are under development and mechanical support is 
      becoming increasingly feasible. The next decade will be an exciting time for
      advances in our understanding and management of RV failure.

LID - 10.1714/1218.13523 [doi]
AB  - Heart transplantation (HTx) is considered to be the gold standard treatment for
      advanced heart failure (HF) but it is available only for a minority of patients, 
      due to paucity of donor hearts (278 HTx were performed in 2011 in Italy).
      Patients listed for HTx have a prolonged waiting time (that is about 2.3 years in
      the 2006-2010 time period in Italy) that is superior compared with patients who
      receive HTx (median time around 6 months), to underline the presence of an
      allocation system that prioritizes candidates in critical conditions. Patients
      listed for HTx have a poor quality of life and their annual mortality is around
      8-10%. Another 10-15% of HTx candidates are removed from the waiting list each
      year because they are no longer suitable for transplantation. On the other hand, 
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been demonstrated to
      improve survival and quality of life of patients with advanced/refractory HF.
      LVAD therapy can represent a valid alternative to HTx, and it is recommended for 
      patients with advanced HF in the recent edition of the European Society of
      Cardiology guidelines on HF management. In the United States, a larger number of 
      centers compared with European ones started to apply a strategy of LVAD implant
      for many patients who meet clinical criteria for listing for HTx. Data from our
      center concerning the last 6 years of LVAD implant (51 implants since 2006)
      reported a 75.5% survival rate at 1 year. In Italian series, as in our center,
      current HTx survival is only slightly superior (83% survival rate at 1 year),
      based on data from the Italian National Transplant Center. We report a proposal
      for updated listing criteria for HTx and indications for LVAD implant in patients
      with advanced acute and chronic HF. Criteria for identifying suitable patients
      for HTx and/or LVAD considering the shortage of donors are discussed.

TI  - Implantable left ventricular assist devices as initial therapy for refractory
      postmyocardial infarction cardiogenic shock.
PG  - 213-6
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently, the initial therapy for refractory cardiogenic shock has
      largely been based on use of short-term mechanical devices with later conversion 
      to durable options. The premise is that such patients cannot tolerate
      cardiopulmonary bypass and the extended surgery needed for implantable left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. We have adopted an alternative
      strategy to implant long-term LVADs as the initial device therapy in such
      patients. METHODS: Over a 3 year period, we used implantable LVADs (Jarvik 2000, 
      one; Ventrassist, one; Heartmate XVE, two; and Heartmate II, nine) in 13 patients
      (11 men and two women; mean age 54 years) with postmyocardial infarction shock
      without prior use of a short-term LVAD. The median time interval from myocardial 
      infarction to LVAD implantation was 3.5 days. Eight patients were on a
      ventilator, two had unknown neurological status and four had suffered cardiac
      arrest in the preceding 24 h. Two had prior coronary artery bypass graft. Nine
      had received dual antiplatelet therapy postmyocardial infarction. The mean
      laboratory value of creatinine was 1.5 mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 748 U/l,
      international normalized ratio 1.5 and lactate 3.2 mmol/l. One procedure was
      carried out off pump; for the others, the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 72
      min. Right ventricular assist devices were used in two cases and were later
      explanted. RESULTS: One patient died of progressive multiorgan failure. All
      others survived to hospital discharge. There were no re-explorations for bleeding
      or major infectious complications; two patients had perioperative stroke. The
      median duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay and hospital 
      stay was 3, 9 and 18 days, respectively. At 1 year, of the 12 survivors, eight
      have since had heart transplant, one patient underwent device explant, two
      remained alive on support and one died 7 months post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      challenge the notion that patients in refractory cardiogenic shock are too ill to
      tolerate immediate placement of implantable LVADs. Despite the surgical
      challenges, a one-stop implantable LVAD approach for cardiogenic shock is
      feasible and may offer unique advantages over the bridge-to-bridge approach
      because it avoids the incremental costs, hospitalization and morbidity associated
      with repeated interventions.

TI  - The biomarker plasma galectin-3 in advanced heart failure and survival with
      mechanical circulatory support devices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During screening of heart transplantation (HTx) candidates supported 
      by ventricular assist devices (VADs) for plasma biomarkers we found that
      galectin-3 (Gal-3) was increased pre-operatively in patients who later died
      during VAD support. Therefore, we analyzed the predictive value of plasma Gal-3
      in the context of other potential clinical risk factors for death on device (DOD)
      in a cohort of 175 VAD patients. METHODS: We analyzed numerous clinical factors
      and plasma Gal-3 levels of 175 VAD patients before device implantation. Eighty
      VAD patients were successfully bridged to HTx (BTT, 45.7%), 80 (45.7%) died on
      VAD, 2 recovered on device (BTR, 1.1%) and 13 (7.4%) were still on device. Uni-
      and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the importance of Gal-3 with
      respect to other clinical factors. Myocardial gene expression of Gal-3 was
      investigated in apex samples by RT-PCR (n = 30) and Western blotting (n = 45).
      RESULTS: Plasma Gal-3 levels were higher in VAD patients than in controls (16.6
      +/- 9.3 vs 9.5 +/- 3.9 ng/ml, p < 0.0001). Cox regression showed several clinical
      factors and type of VAD as independent outcome predictors, but Gal-3 was not
      among them. Using the regression equation we grouped patients according to their 
      factor constellation for prediction of survival on VAD. We propose a calculation 
      method for VAD survival prediction. Gal-3 mRNA and protein were detectable in
      failing myocardium, but did not correlate with its plasma concentration.
      CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 levels are associated with severe heart failure but do
      not provide sufficient discrimination for prediction of outcomes after VAD
      implantation. Importantly, we were unable to confirm myocardial tissue as a
      primary source for the observed plasma elevations of Gal-3.

TI  - Use of centrifugal left ventricular assist device as a bridge to candidacy in
      severe heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension.
PG  - 1237-42
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs678 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Raised pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), trans-pulmonary gradient
      (TPG) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) are risk factors for poor outcomes 
      after heart transplant in patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) and
      may contraindicate transplant. Unloading of the left ventricle with an
      implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonary
      vascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in a
      cohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy. METHODS: Pulmonary
      haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit
      between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:
      Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eight HeartWare
      ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21
      VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplant
      by virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon 
      pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.
      Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7%
      (24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortality
      was 7.7% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91% (10 of 11). Baseline and post-VAD 
      pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic PAP (mmHg), mean
      PAP, TPG (mmHg) of 57 +/- 9.5, 42 +/- 4.4 and 14 +/- 3.9 reduced to 32 +/- 7.5,
      18 +/- 5.5 and 9 +/- 3.3, respectively. PVR reduced from 5 +/- 1.5 to 2.1 +/- 0.5
      Wood units (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In selected heart failure patients with
      secondary PH, use of centrifugal LVAD results in significant reductions in PAP,
      TPG and PVR, which are observed within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months.
      Such patients bridged to candidacy have post-transplant survival comparable with 
      those having a heart transplant as primary treatment.

LID - 10.1159/000346096 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are used to improve the systemic circulation
      and to decrease ventricular loading in patients with hemodynamic instability that
      is refractory to pharmacologic therapies. During an acute critical event,
      percutaneous devices are preferred because of their rapid deployment, since
      implantable devices require more extensive procedures. Implantable devices are
      used for patients with established end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart
      transplantation, recovery or destination therapy. This report reviews mechanical 
      principles and clinical studies regarding percutaneous VAD to address their
      potential renal effects. Since the focus of this study is set on devices that are
      dedicated to cardiac support only, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems
      are not included.

AB  - During the last 20 years, the management of heart failure has significantly
      improved by means of new pharmacotherapies, more timely invasive treatments and
      device assisted therapies. Indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely with
      the development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and
      the total artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patients
      awaiting transplantation, so much so, that LVADs are now approved of as a
      strategy for destination therapy. In this review, the authors describe in detail 
      the current basic indications, functioning modalities, main limitations of
      surgical LAVDs, total artificial heart development, and percutaneous assist
      devices, trying to clarify this complex, but fascinating topic.

AB  - Herein we present a case of fulminant myocarditis in a woman previously treated
      for B-cell lymphoma. While the clinical context was suggestive of
      adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, the initial pathology of the Heartmate-2
      apical core showed lymphocytic myocarditis. After 8 months of stability, the
      patient presented with progressive heart failure and recurrent ventricular
      arrhythmias. An endomyocardial biopsy revealed findings typical of giant cell
      myocarditis (GCM); poor response to immunosuppressive therapy and marked
      hemodynamic instability led to urgent transplantation. To our knowledge, this is 
      the first reported case of GCM following an acute lymphocytic myocarditis and the
      second GCM case associated with B-cell lymphoma.

PG  - 568-9
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivs559 [doi]
AB  - The use of mechanical cardiac assistance is well established as a bridge to
      orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) or to recovery for patients with
      congestive heart failure, however, the experience in single ventricle (SV)
      physiology is still limited. We report two cases of mechanical assistance in
      patients with SV physiology: a 2-year old male with hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome who underwent Norwood Stage I and II followed by HF and a 4-year old
      female with a univentricular heart who developed a severe right ventricular
      dysfunction 2 years after a cavopulmonary shunt. Mechanical support utilizing
      ventricular assist devices (VADs) is considered a valid tool to bridge patients
      with congestive heart failure to either OHT or to recovery. Increasing experience
      and improved outcomes utilizing this technology in children with biventricular
      hearts have led to considering employing these devices in failing SV treatment.
      We present 2 cases of terminally ill children with SV who were assisted with a
      VAD.

TI  - Postcardiac transplant survival in the current era in patients receiving
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices have become the
      standard of care for patients with heart failure requiring mechanical circulatory
      support as a bridge to transplant. However, data on long-term post-transplant
      survival for these patients are limited. We evaluated the effect of
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices on postcardiac transplant
      survival in the current era. METHODS: All patients who received a continuous-flow
      left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant at a single center from 
      June 2005 to September 2011 were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 167 patients who
      received a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device as a bridge to
      transplant, 77 (46%) underwent cardiac transplantation, 27 died before
      transplantation (16%), and 63 (38%) remain listed for transplantation and
      continued with left ventricular assist device support. The mean age of the
      transplanted patients was 54.5 +/- 11.9 years, 57% had an ischemic etiology, and 
      20% were women. The overall mean duration of left ventricular assist device
      support before transplantation was 310 +/- 227 days (range, 67-1230 days). The
      mean duration of left ventricular assist device support did not change in
      patients who had received a left ventricular assist device in the early period of
      the study (2005-2008, n = 62) compared with those who had received a left
      ventricular assist device later (2009-2011, n = 78, 373 vs 392 days, P = NS). In 
      addition, no difference was seen in survival between those patients supported
      with a left ventricular assist device for fewer than 180 days or longer than 180 
      days before transplantation (P = NS). The actuarial survival after
      transplantation at 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis was
      98.7%, 93.0%, 91.1%, and 88.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The short- and
      long-term post-transplant survival for patients bridged with a continuous-flow
      left ventricular assist device in the current era has been excellent.
      Furthermore, the duration of left ventricular assist device support did not
      affect post-transplant survival. The hemodynamic benefits of ventricular
      unloading with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices, in addition to
      their durability and reduced patient morbidity, have contributed to improved
      post-transplant survival.

TI  - Prospective, multicenter study of ventricular assist device infections.
PG  - 691-702
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.128132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) improve survival and quality of
      life in patients with advanced heart failure, but their use is frequently
      complicated by infection. There are limited data on the microbiology and
      epidemiology of these infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients
      scheduled for VAD implantation were enrolled (2006-2008) at 11 US cardiac centers
      and followed prospectively until transplantation, explantation for recovery,
      death, or for 1 year. Eighty-six patients (57%) received HeartMate II devices.
      Data were collected on potential preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative 
      risk factors for infection. Clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were
      collected for suspected infections and evaluated by an infectious diseases
      specialist. Thirty-three patients (22%) developed 34 VAD-related infections with 
      an incidence rate of 0.10 per 100 person-days (95% confidence interval,
      0.073-0.142). The median time to infection was 68 days. The driveline was the
      most commonly infected site (n=28); 18 (64%) were associated with invasive
      disease. Staphylococci were the most common pathogen (47%), but pseudomonas or
      other Gram-negative bacteria caused 32% of infections. A history of depression
      and elevated baseline serum creatinine were independent predictors of VAD
      infection (adjusted hazard ratio=2.8 [P=0.007] and 1.7 [P=0.023], respectively). 
      The HeartMate II was not associated with a decreased risk of infection. VAD
      infection increased 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio=5.6; P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, multicenter study demonstrates that infection
      frequently complicates VAD placement and is a continuing problem despite the use 
      of newer, smaller devices. Depression and renal dysfunction may increase the risk
      of VAD infection. VAD infection is a serious consequence because it adversely
      affects patient survival. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

LID - 10.1007/s13105-013-0235-x [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) ameliorate heart failure by reducing
      preload and afterload. However, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition after
      application of LVADs is not clearly defined. The purpose of the present study was
      to investigate ECM remodeling after mechanical unloading in a rat heart
      transplant model. Sixty male Lewis rats were subjected to abdominal heterotopic
      heart transplantation, and the transplanted hearts were pressure- and
      volume-unloaded. The age- and weight- matched male Lewis rats who had undergone
      open thoracic surgeries were used as the control. Left ventricle ECM accumulation
      and the expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue
      inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were measured on the third,
      seventh, and fourteenth days after transplantation/sham surgery. Compared with
      the control group, myocardial ECM deposition significantly increased on the
      seventh and fourteenth days after heart transplantation (P < 0.05) and peaked on 
      the 14th day. The gelatinase activity as well as mRNA expression of MMP-2 and
      MMP-9 significantly increased after transplantation (P < 0.05). Both mRNA and
      protein levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 significantly increased compared with those
      of the control group. Mechanical unloading may lead to adverse remodeling of the 
      ECM of the left ventricle. The underlying mechanism may due to the imbalance of
      the MMP/TIMP system, especially the remarkable upregulation of TIMPs in the
      pressure and volume unloaded heart.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices have been proven to be superior to medical
      therapy for advanced heart failure patients awaiting heart transplantation and
      viable alternatives to transplantation for destination therapy patients.
      Improvements in the design of ventricular assist devices have been rewarded by a 
      decrease in adverse events and an increase in survival. Despite significant
      progress, even the latest generation left ventricular assist devices are burdened
      by a significant long-term adverse events profile that will increasingly
      challenge physicians as patients survive longer on implantable mechanical
      circulatory support. In this review, we analyze the impact of long-term adverse
      events on clinical outcomes in the major trials of continuous flow left
      ventricular assist devices. We discuss several of the more pertinent and
      interesting adverse events, examine their potential causes, and explore their
      future implications.

AB  - The SynCardia() total artificial heart (TAH) is the only FDA-approved TAH in the 
      world. The SynCardia() TAH is a pneumatically driven, pulsatile system capable of
      flows of >9L/min. The TAH is indicated for use as a bridge to transplantation
      (BTT) in patients at imminent risk of death from non-reversible bi-ventricular
      failure. In the Pivotal US approval trial the TAH achieved a BTT rate of >79%.
      Recently a multi-center, post-market approval study similarly demonstrated a
      comparable BTT rate. A major milestone was recently achieved for the TAH, with
      over 1100 TAHs having been implanted to date, with the bulk of implantation
      occurring at an ever increasing rate in the past few years. The TAH is most
      commonly utilized to save the lives of patients dying from end-stage
      bi-ventricular heart failure associated with ischemic or non-ischemic dilated
      cardiomyopathy. Beyond progressive chronic heart failure, the TAH has
      demonstrated great efficacy in supporting patients with acute irreversible heart 
      failure associated with massive acute myocardial infarction. In recent years
      several diverse clinical scenarios have also proven to be well served by the TAH 
      including severe heart failure associated with advanced congenital heart disease.
      failed or burned-out transplants, infiltrative and restrictive cardiomyopathies
      and failed ventricular assist devices. Looking to the future a major unmet need
      remains in providing total heart support for children and small adults. As such, 
      the present TAH design must be scaled to fit the smaller patient, while providing
      equivalent, if not superior flow characteristics, shear profiles and overall
      device thrombogenicity. To aid in the development of a new "pediatric," TAH an
      engineering methodology known as "Device Thrombogenicity Emulation (DTE)", that
      we have recently developed and described, is being employed. Recently, to further
      our engineering understanding of the TAH, as steps towards next generation
      designs we have: (1) assessed of the degree of platelet reactivity induced by the
      present clinical 70 cc TAH using a closed loop platelet activity state assay, (2)
      modeled the motion of the TAH pulsatile mobile diaphragm, and (3) performed
      fluid-structure interactions and assessment of the flow behavior through inflow
      and outflow regions of the TAH fitted with modern bi-leaflet heart valves.
      Developing a range of TAH devices will afford biventricular replacement therapy
      to a wide range of patients, for both short and long-term therapy.

AB  - The number of patients with advanced heart failure that has become unresponsive
      to conventional medical therapy is increasing rapidly. One of the most promising 
      new alternatives to heart transplantation is use of ventricular assist devices
      (VADs). To date, there are no guidelines for appropriate selection for use of
      these devices that are approved by national societies in the field. This review
      addresses all of the general criteria for clinicians to keep in mind regarding
      when to refer a patient for evaluation and the specific issues addressed in
      patient selection. The field of mechanical circulatory support has advanced
      significantly over the past 10 years, resulting in rapid expansion of patients
      with advanced heart failure who can benefit from implantable devices. With
      progress of technology, limitations associated with age, body size, and
      comorbidities gradually become less prohibitive. The continuing simplification of
      design along with continued reduction in size of the devices, plus eventual
      elimination of the external drive line will make the use of VADs a superior
      option to heart transplant and even to medical management in many patients. We
      anticipate that the patient selection process outlined in the present review will
      continue to shift toward less advanced cases of heart failure.

TI  - Left ventricular assist device withdrawal: an ethical discussion.
LID - 10.1136/bmjspcare-2012-000347 [doi]
AB  - Specialist palliative care (SPC) services are increasingly integrated with
      chronic heart failure (CHF) services. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)
      represent an advance in the management of advanced CHF, but may pose ethical
      challenges for SPC services providing care to this population.The patient
      received an LVAD as 'bridge-to-heart-transplant,' but subsequently experienced
      multiple cerebral haemorrhages, resulting in neurological deficits, and severe
      functional impairment. The risk of further cerebral events precluded ongoing
      anticoagulation, and she was transferred to an SPC inpatient unit for symptom
      control and end-of-life care. Following discussion within the multi-disciplinary 
      team and with the patient's family, LVAD support was withdrawn, and the patient
      died peacefully. This piece reviews the ethical considerations that informed
      decision-making, in particular, autonomy, informed consent and futility. In
      addition, the question of the nature of LVADs is debated and how the perceptions 
      of the patient, and others, of the device may influence decision-making around
      withdrawal of treatment.

TI  - Determinants of dynamic changes in serum creatinine in acute decompensated heart 
      failure: the importance of blood pressure reduction during treatment.
PG  - 433-40
LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs209 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: 'Worsening renal function' (WRF) and 'improvement in renal function' (IRF) 
      monitored by changes in serum creatinine are frequently encountered during
      treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We sought to establish the
      important haemodynamic determinants of alterations in serum creatinine. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: We reviewed data from 443 patients treated for ADHF with
      haemodynamic guidance in a single centre. WRF and IRF were defined as a 25%
      increase or decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from time of 
      admission to pulmonary artery catheter removal, respectively. Of the 443
      patients, 46 (10%) experienced WRF and 127 (29%) had IRF. Baseline eGFR was lower
      in patients with IRF when compared with stable patients or those with WRF (45 +/-
      25 vs. 63 +/- 30 vs. 68 +/- 27 mL/min/m(2), respectively, P < 0.0001). In
      contrast, the relative decrease in mean blood pressure (BP) was more pronounced
      in patients with WRF when compared with stable patients or those with IRF (15 +/-
      15 vs. 9 +/- 17 vs. 4 +/- 15%, respectively, P = 0.003). With larger decreases in
      mean BP, there was greater likelihood of experiencing WRF (P = 0.04) but less
      likelihood of experiencing IRF (P = 0.01). In contrast, the degree of changes in 
      right atrial pressure or cardiac index did not affect the propensity for
      developing WRF or IRF. There was no difference in adverse clinical outcomes
      (death, heart transplantation, LV assist device implantation, or readmission)
      between the three groups (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Blood pressure decrease, rather 
      than alterations in cardiac output or central venous pressure, were associated
      with changes in serum creatinine during treatment of ADHF.

AB  - Heart transplantation remains the gold standard for long-term cardiac
      replacement, but a shortage of donor organs will always limit this option. For
      both transplant-eligible and noneligible patients, advances in mechanical
      circulatory support have revolutionized the options for the management of
      end-stage heart failure, and this technology continues to bring us closer to a
      true alternative to heart transplantation. This review provides a perspective on 
      the past, present and future of mechanical circulatory support and addresses the 
      changes in technology, patient selection and management strategies needed to have
      this therapy fully embraced by the heart failure community, and perhaps replace
      heart transplantation either as the therapy of choice or as a strategy by which
      to delay transplantation in younger patients.

LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivs546 [doi]
AB  - A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured
      protocol. The question addressed was: is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) superior to dedicated ventricular assist device (VAD) in patients with
      acutely failing allograft following transplantation. Altogether, 162 papers were 
      found using the reported search, of which 8 represented the best evidence to
      answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of
      publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of 
      these papers are tabulated. Two studies provide data only for ECMO-treated
      patients, in three, the authors describe their experiences with Levitronix
      CentriMag and three studies directly compare the outcomes of ECMO and VAD
      support. The survival ranges from 40 to 74% in patients rescued with ECMO
      compared with 33-60% in patients supported with dedicated VAD. We conclude that
      there is insufficient evidence to prefer ECMO over VAD and the optimal modality
      of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) following heart transplantation should be
      determined by the surgeon and institutional experience and dependent on the
      extent and severity of myocardial dysfunction and the presence or absence of
      associated respiratory insufficiency.

TI  - Apical ventricular tachycardia morphology in left ventricular nonischemic
      cardiomyopathy predicts poor transplant-free survival.
PG  - 621-6

AB  - BACKGROUND: The scar of patients with left ventricular (LV) nonischemic
      cardiomyopathy (NICM) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) typically originates at or
      near the mitral annulus and extends a variable distance toward the apex.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether electrocardiograms of VT with LV apical exit
      sites would identify patients with larger scars extending a greater distance from
      the base toward the apex and decreased heart transplant/left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD)-free survival. METHODS: Consecutive patients with LV NICM
      undergoing VT ablation between May 2008 and April 2011 were studied. All
      electrocardiograms of spontaneous and induced VT were analyzed. Apical VT was
      defined as left bundle branch morphology with precordial transition >/= V5 or
      right bundle branch morphology with precordial transition </= V3. Scar percentage
      was defined as the area of low voltage divided by the total surface area.
      RESULTS: Thirty-two of 76 patients had 1 or more apical VTs. Those with apical
      VTs had larger percentage of endocardial and epicardial bipolar scars (14.9% vs
      8.1%, P = .01, and 15.5% vs 5.5%, P = .03, respectively), scar that, although
      originating from the periannular region (94.7% of the patients), was more likely 
      to extend apically beyond the basal half (48.3% vs 24.4%, P = .05 endocardial,
      and 85.7% vs 25.9%, P = .07 epicardial), and worse transplant/LVAD-free survival 
      during a mean follow-up of 332 days (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NICM
      and apical VTs have larger voltage abnormality extending as contiguous or patchy 
      "scar" from the base further toward the apex and worse transplant/LVAD-free
      survival. Particular attention should be paid to optimal heart failure management
      in these patients, with more guarded prognosis.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by heart-wall thinning, myocyte
      slippage, and ventricular dilation. The injury to the heart-wall muscle after MI 
      is permanent, as after an abundant cell loss the myocardial tissue lacks the
      intrinsic capability to regenerate. New therapeutics are required for functional 
      improvement and regeneration of the infarcted myocardium, to overcome harmful
      diagnosis of patients with heart failure, and to overcome the shortage of heart
      donors. In the past few years, myocardial tissue engineering has emerged as a new
      and ambitious approach for treating MI. Several left ventricular assist devices
      and epicardial patches have been developed for MI. These devices and
      acellular/cellular cardiac patches are employed surgically and sutured to the
      epicardial surface of the heart, limiting the region of therapeutic benefit. An
      injectable system offers the potential benefit of minimally invasive release into
      the myocardium either to restore the injured extracellular matrix or to act as a 
      scaffold for cell delivery. Furthermore, intramyocardial injection of
      biomaterials and cells has opened new opportunities to explore and also to
      augment the potentials of this technique to ease morbidity and mortality rates
      owing to heart failure. This review summarizes the growing body of literature in 
      the field of myocardial tissue engineering, where biomaterial injection, with or 
      without simultaneous cellular delivery, has been pursued to enhance functional
      and structural outcomes following MI. Additionally, this review also provides a
      complete outlook on the tissue-engineering therapies presently being used for
      myocardial regeneration, as well as some perceptivity into the possible issues
      that may hinder its progress in the future.

TI  - Morbidity and mortality in heart transplant candidates supported with mechanical 
      circulatory support: is reappraisal of the current United network for organ
      sharing thoracic organ allocation policy justified?
PG  - 452-62
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.100123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival of patients on left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has
      improved. We examined the differences in risk of adverse outcomes between
      LVAD-supported and medically managed candidates on the heart transplant waiting
      list. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed mortality and morbidity in 33,073 heart
      transplant candidates registered on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
      waiting list between 1999 and 2011. Five groups were selected: patients without
      LVADs in urgency status 1A, 1B, and 2; patients with pulsatile-flow LVADs; and
      patients with continuous-flow LVADs. Outcomes in patients requiring biventricular
      assist devices, total artificial heart, and temporary VADs were also analyzed.
      Two eras were defined on the basis of the approval date of the first
      continuous-flow LVAD for bridge to transplantation in the United States (2008).
      Mortality was lower in the current compared with the first era (2.1%/mo versus
      2.9%/mo; P<0.0001). In the first era, mortality of pulsatile-flow LVAD patients
      was higher than in status 2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15; P<0.0001) and similar to
      that in status 1B patients (HR, 1.04; P=0.61). In the current era, patients with 
      continuous-flow LVADs had mortality similar to that of status 2 (HR, 0.80;
      P=0.12) and lower mortality compared with status 1A and 1B patients (HR, 0.24 and
      0.47; P<0.0001 for both comparisons). However, status upgrade for LVAD-related
      complications occurred frequently (28%) and increased the mortality risk (HR,
      1.75; P=0.001). Mortality was highest in patients with biventricular assist
      devices (HR, 5.00; P<0.0001) and temporary VADs (HR, 7.72; P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and morbidity on the heart transplant waiting list have
      decreased. Candidates supported with contemporary continuous-flow LVADs have
      favorable waiting list outcomes; however, they worsen significantly once a
      serious LVAD-related complication occurs. Transplant candidates requiring
      temporary and biventricular support have the highest risk of adverse outcomes.
      These results may help to guide optimal allocation of donor hearts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to derive and validate a model to predict
      survival in candidates for HeartMate II (HMII) (Thoratec, Pleasanton, California)
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. BACKGROUND: LVAD mortality risk
      prediction is important for candidate selection and communicating expectations to
      patients and clinicians. With the evolution of LVAD support, prior risk
      prediction models have become less valid. METHODS: Patients enrolled into the
      HMII bridge to transplantation and destination therapy trials (N = 1,122) were
      randomly divided into derivation (DC) (n = 583) and validation cohorts (VC) (n = 
      539). Pre-operative candidate predictors of 90-day mortality were examined in the
      DC with logistic regression, from which the HMII Risk Score (HMRS) was derived.
      The HMRS was then applied to the VC. RESULTS: There were 149 (13%) deaths within 
      90 days. In the DC, mortality (n = 80) was higher in older patients (odds ratio
      [OR]: 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 1.7 per 10 years), those with
      greater hypoalbuminemia (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.76 per mg/dl of albumin),
      renal dysfunction (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.2 per mg/dl creatinine),
      coagulopathy (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7 to 5.8 per international normalized ratio
      unit), and in those receiving LVAD support at less experienced centers (OR: 2.2, 
      95% CI: 1.2 to 4.4 for <15 trial patients). Mortality in the DC low, medium, and 
      high HMRS groups was 4%, 16%, and 29%, respectively (p < 0.001). In the VC,
      corresponding mortality was 8%, 11%, and 25%, respectively (p < 0.001). HMRS
      discrimination was good (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 
      0.71, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: The HMRS might be useful for mortality 
      risk stratification in HMII candidates and may serve as an additional tool in the
      patient selection process.

      with left ventricular assist devices.

AB  - Heart failure continues to be a growing health problem, eluding large-scale
      improvement and treatment. Cardiac transplantation has been the gold standard
      treatment with high post-transplant survival rates and relatively good quality of
      life. However, there has been an extreme shortage of organ donations, limiting
      transplants to only a very small portion of patients with the condition. This led
      to a growing interest in alternative options for the increasing population of
      patients who are waitlisted or ineligible for transplantation. In recent years,
      ventricular assist device (VAD) technologies have advanced from pulsatile blood
      pumps to continuous-flow pumps that have demonstrated unprecedented
      post-implantation survival rates. The HeartMate II, the only commercially
      available, continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in the United
      States and Europe, has been implanted in over 10,000 patients worldwide, setting 
      a benchmark for biomedical modalities of advanced heart failure treatment. Thanks
      to the successes of contemporary LVADs, patients are able to enjoy a better
      lifestyle, with a significantly prolonged life span and the ability to regularly 
      partake in physical activities. In this new biomedical generation, the usage of
      LVADs has begun to expand towards the treatment for a wider range of heart
      conditions, including earlier stages of heart failure. In fact, LVAD
      implantations have surpassed the number of transplants taken place annually. An
      increasing number of patients are considering the permanent, circulatory support 
      with an LVAD, namely destination therapy, as a promising option for treating
      heart failure.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to evaluate bearing wear during clinical 
      use of the HeartMate II (HMII) left ventricular assist device. Bearings obtained 
      from HMII pumps explanted after clinical use in the Destination Therapy and
      Bridge to Transplantation clinical trials were analyzed for wear using surface
      profilometry. Geometric profile variations measured on the inlet bearing ball
      were used to calculate the wear. Bearing wear was normalized to the total pump
      support duration to obtain an annualized bearing wear rate. Bearing life was
      estimated assuming a linear wear rate, as the time to reach a wear limit of 25
      microm, which includes a 3x safety factor, to ensure that there is no contact
      between the rotor blades and the blood bore housing. One hundred and eighty-three
      bearings from left ventricular assist devices implanted in 181 patients were
      analyzed. Average age of the patients was 56.3 +/- 14.6 years, 76% were male, 46%
      had an ischemic etiology of heart failure. Mean support duration for the pumps
      was 363 +/- 349 days (median: 238, range: 1-1,621 days). Sixty pumps (33%) were
      explanted at heart transplantation, 20 (11%) after device replacement, 6 (3%) for
      ventricular recovery, 94 (51%) after patient death, and 3 (2%) were explanted for
      other reasons. Mean bearing wear was 0.59 +/- 0.37 microm (median: 0.46 microm
      [5-95% interval: 0.25-1.48]). The median bearing wear rate for patients supported
      for at least 1 year was 0.30 [5-95% interval: 0.09-0.94] microm/yr. The 5-95%
      limits of the bearing wear rate corresponded to an estimated bearing life between
      27 and 269 years. The pump having the highest bearing wear rate (1.46 microm/yr) 
      had an estimated bearing life of at least 17 years. HMII bearing wear is
      extremely small, with an estimated bearing life well in excess of 17 years; it is
      not a limiting factor for long-term support with the HMII left ventricular
      assistive system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are
      durable and reliable, device replacement will be inevitable in some patients. We 
      evaluated the incidence and outcomes of pump replacement procedures with the
      HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD. METHODS: Data were
      obtained from 1,128 patients implanted from March 2005 to January 2010 with the
      HeartMate II during the clinical trials for bridge to transplant and destination 
      therapy. The operative mortality associated with the replacement procedure was
      determined. RESULTS: The mean duration of HeartMate II support was 568 +/- 535
      days (cumulative duration: 1,755 patient-years, longest: 6.5 years). A total of
      72 (6.4%) patients underwent 79 LVAD replacements (0.045 events/patient-year) of 
      which 2 were in the initial operation and 77 in separate procedures. Reasons for 
      replacement were percutaneous lead damage (36 events, 3.0%), device thrombosis
      (25 events, 2.1%), infection (7 events, 0.6%), and miscellaneous other (11
      events, 0.9%). The median time to pump replacement was 428 days (range 0 to
      1,474). Of the 77 replacement procedures, there were 5 (6.5%) operative deaths
      within 30 days. The causes of death were device thrombosis, right heart failure, 
      multisystem organ failure, and bleeding. One year after exchange (median 2.1
      years after initial implant), 30% had died, 5% were transplanted, and 65% were
      ongoing and alive. CONCLUSIONS: HeartMate II device failure requiring pump
      replacement is infrequent, but when required can be done safely. These data
      continue to provide encouraging evidence supporting HeartMate II use for
      long-term circulatory support.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become an established treatment for 
      patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge to transplantation or for
      permanent support as an alternative to heart transplantation. Continuous-flow
      LVADs have been shown to improve outcomes, including survival, and reduce device 
      failure compared with pulsatile devices. Although LVADs have been shown to be a
      good option for patients with end-stage heart failure, unanticipated
      complications may occur. We describe dynamic left atrial and left ventricular
      chamber collapse related to postural changes in a patient with a recent
      continuous-flow LVAD implantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality for refractory cardiogenic shock (RCS) remains high.
      However, with improving mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) technology, 
      the treatment options for RCS patients are expanding. We report on a recent
      5-year single-center experience with MCSD for treatment of RCS. METHODS: This
      study was a retrospective review of adult patients who required an MCSD due to
      RCS in the past 5 years. We excluded those patients with post-cardiotomy shock
      and post-transplant cardiac graft dysfunction. In the setting of RCS, a
      short-term ventricular assist device (VAD) was inserted as a bridge-to-decision
      device. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) was chosen in
      cases of unknown neurologic status, complete hemodynamic collapse or severe
      coagulopathy. RESULTS: From January 2007 through January 2012, 90 patients
      received an MCSD for RCS, 21 (23%) of whom had active cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR). The etiology of RCS included acute myocardial infarction in 
      49% and acute decompensated heart failure in 27%. Mean age was 53+/-14 years, 71%
      were male, and 60% had an intra-aortic balloon pump. The initial approach
      utilized was short-term VAD in 49% and VA ECMO in 51%. Median length of support
      was 8 days (IQR 4 to 18 days). Exchange to implantable VAD was performed in 26%
      of patients. Other destinations included myocardial recovery in 18% and heart
      transplantation in 11%. Survival to hospital discharge was 49%. Multivariate
      analysis showed ongoing CPR to be an independent risk factor for mortality (OR = 
      5.79, 95% CI 1.285 to 26.08, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: In the current era, roughly
      half of the patients who need an MCSD for RCS survive, and roughly half of these 
      survivors require an implantable VAD. Ongoing CPR is predictive of in-hospital
      mortality.

AB  - The recent success of continuous-flow circulatory support devices has led to the 
      growing acceptance of these devices as a viable therapeutic option for end-stage 
      heart failure patients who are not responsive to current pharmacologic and
      electrophysiologic therapies. This article defines and clarifies the major
      classification of these pumps as axial or centrifugal continuous-flow devices by 
      discussing the difference in their inherent mechanics and describing how these
      features translate clinically to pump selection and patient management issues.
      Axial vs centrifugal pump and bearing design, theory of operation, hydrodynamic
      performance, and current vs flow relationships are discussed. A review of axial
      vs centrifugal physiology, pre-load and after-load sensitivity, flow pulsatility,
      and issues related to automatic physiologic control and suction prevention
      algorithms is offered. Reliability and biocompatibility of the two types of pumps
      are reviewed from the perspectives of mechanical wear, implant life, hemolysis,
      and pump deposition. Finally, a glimpse into the future of continuous-flow
      technologies is presented.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Orthotopic heart transplantation is the standard of care for
      end-stage heart disease. Left ventricular assist device implantation offers an
      alternative treatment approach. Left ventricular assist device practice has
      changed dramatically since the 2008 Food and Drug Administration approval of the 
      HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif), but at what societal cost? The
      present study examined the cost and efficacy of both treatments over time.
      METHODS: All patients who underwent either orthotopic heart transplantation (n = 
      9369) or placement of an implantable left ventricular assist device (n = 6414)
      from 2005 to 2009 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were selected. The trends in
      treatment use, mortality, and cost were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of
      orthotopic heart transplantation increased marginally within a 5-year period. In 
      contrast, the annual left ventricular assist device implantation rates nearly
      tripled. In-hospital mortality from left ventricular assist device implantation
      decreased precipitously, from 42% to 17%. In-hospital mortality for orthotopic
      heart transplantation remained relatively stable (range, 3.8%-6.5%). The mean
      cost per patient increased for both orthotopic heart transplantation and left
      ventricular assist device placement (40% and 17%, respectively). With the
      observed increase in both device usage and cost per patient, the cumulative Left 
      ventricular assist device cost increased 232% within 5 years (from $143 million
      to $479 million). By 2009, Medicare and Medicaid were the primary payers for
      nearly one half of all patients (orthotopic heart transplantation, 45%; left
      ventricular assist device, 51%). CONCLUSIONS: Since Food and Drug Administration 
      approval of the HeartMate II, mortality after left ventricular assist device
      implantation has decreased rapidly, yet has remained greater than that after
      orthotopic heart transplantation. The left ventricular assist device costs have
      continued to increase and have been significantly greater than those for
      orthotopic heart transplantation. Because of the evolving healthcare economics
      climate, with increasing emphasis on the costs and comparative effectiveness, a
      concerted effort at LVAD cost containment and judicious usage is essential to
      preserve the viability of this invaluable treatment.

AB  - From the moment of creation to the moment of death, the heart works tirelessly to
      circulate blood, being a critical organ to sustain life. As a non-stopping
      pumping machine, it operates continuously to pump blood through our bodies to
      supply all cells with oxygen and necessary nutrients. When the heart fails, the
      supplement of blood to the body's organs to meet metabolic demands will
      deteriorate. The treatment of the participating causes is the ideal approach to
      treat heart failure (HF). As this often cannot be done effectively, the medical
      management of HF is a difficult challenge. Implantable rotary blood pumps (IRBPs)
      have the potential to become a viable long-term treatment option for bridging to 
      heart transplantation or destination therapy. This increases the potential for
      the patients to leave the hospital and resume normal lives. Control of IRBPs is
      one of the most important design goals in providing long-term alternative
      treatment for HF patients. Over the years, many control algorithms including
      invasive and non-invasive techniques have been developed in the hope of
      physiologically and adaptively controlling left ventricular assist devices and
      thus avoiding such undesired pumping states as left ventricular collapse caused
      by suction. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the
      developments of control systems and techniques that have been applied to control 
      IRBPs.

TI  - Implantation of rotary blood pumps into 115 patients: a single-centre experience.
PG  - 1233-6
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: From 2004 to 2009, rotary blood pumps were implanted for heart
      failure as a bridge to transplant or destination therapy in 101 male and 14
      female patients at our institution. We report on our experiences of these
      patients with a follow-up of 132 patient years. METHODS: Seventy-four HeartMate
      II axial flow pumps and 41 HeartWare centrifugal pumps were implanted in patients
      with non-ischaemic (n = 70) or ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 45). The mean age of
      the patients was 50 +/- 13 years. All patients were on inotropic support prior to
      implantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used as a bridging
      procedure in 21 cases. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 14%. Hospital
      discharge occurred on average after 46 +/- 33 days. Twenty-two patients of this
      cohort received a heart transplant 492 +/- 342 days after implantation of the
      device. Two patients died after heart transplantation. A 1-year survival of 73%
      and a 2-year survival of 69% were recorded, despite a low incidence of transplant
      procedures. The longest support time was 1686 days. CONCLUSIONS: Modern left
      ventricular assist device technology can be used successfully for heart failure. 
      The scarcity of donor hearts leads to prolonged periods on the device, and
      chronic ventricular assist device therapy has become a reality, although bridge
      to transplant was intended; therefore, sufficient support services for outpatient
      care of these patients are required.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a global phenomenon, and the overall incidence and
      prevalence of the condition are steadily increasing. Medical therapies have
      proven efficacious, but only a small number of pharmacological options are in
      development. When patients cease to respond adequately to optimal medical
      therapy, cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to improve symptoms,
      reduce hospitalizations, promote reverse remodelling, and decrease mortality.
      However, challenges remain in identifying the ideal recipients for this therapy. 
      The field of mechanical circulatory support has seen immense growth since the
      early 2000s, and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have transitioned over
      the past decade from large, pulsatile devices to smaller, more-compact,
      continuous-flow devices. Infections and haematological issues are still important
      areas that need to be addressed. Whereas LVADs were once approved only for
      'bridge to transplantation', these devices are now used as destination therapy
      for critically ill patients with HF, allowing these individuals to return to the 
      community. A host of novel strategies, including cardiac contractility
      modulation, implantable haemodynamic-monitoring devices, and phrenic and vagus
      nerve stimulation, are under investigation and might have an impact on the future
      care of patients with chronic HF.

AB  - Bridge to bridge (BTB) is a promising strategy for the treatment of end-stage
      heart failure that involves the left ventricular assist system (LVAS). We
      describe our experience with the conversion of an extracorporeal ventricular
      assist system (VAS), the NIPRO VAS, to an implantable LVAS, the EVAHEART LVAS. A 
      32-year-old man underwent a NIPRO VAS implantation as a bridge to decision for a 
      condition consistent with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support profile 1. He was later diagnosed with secondary
      cardiomyopathy due to cardiac sarcoidosis. During the period in which he had
      NIPRO VAS support, no significant bacterial cultures were obtained from the
      cannula-piercing site, and no systemic infection occurred. Approximately 5 months
      after the NIPRO VAS implantation, he underwent an EVAHEART LVAS implantation as a
      BTB. The procedure required technical modifications, including the anastomosis of
      outflow grafts, trimming of the apical cuff, and creation of a pump pocket. The
      operation was completed uneventfully. The patient completed the discharge program
      for awaiting heart transplantation at home. Approximately 6 months after the
      EVAHEART LVAS implantation, he continues to do well without any complications,
      including infection, and visits our hospital as an outpatient. Conversion to an
      implantable LVAS can be beneficial in carefully selected patients after
      ascertaining the operative indications and operation timing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a widely accepted modality for
      the treatment of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) after major
      cardiac surgery by providing temporary circulatory support for the stunned
      myocardium. We sought to identify the factors that affect outcomes of ECLS for
      postoperative LCOS. METHODS: From 2005 to 2011, of a total of 9267 adult patients
      underwent major cardiac surgery, 93 patients (aged, 60.6 +/- 13.8 years; 47
      women) underwent ECLS to treat postoperative LCOS. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (41.9%)
      patients were weaned off ECLS successfully, and 1 patient underwent heart
      transplantation. A final total of 23 patients (24.3%), including 1 heart
      transplantation recipient, survived until the end of the follow-up period
      (median, 611 days; range, 125-2247 days). On logistic regression analysis, old
      age (P = .001), a high blood lactate level before ECLS initiation (P < .001),
      cardiopulmonary bypass weaning failure after surgery (P < .001), and
      postoperative bleeding (P = .012) were independent factors associated with
      mortality. In contrast, administration of anticoagulant nafamostat mesilate (P = 
      .040) was found to be associated with improved outcomes of ECLS. When the
      predictive value of pre-ECLS blood lactate level for mortality was assessed using
      the receiver operating characteristic curve, the greatest accuracy was obtained
      at the cutoff value of 7.9 mmol/L, with 63% sensitivity and 68% specificity.
      CONCLUSIONS: High lactate level before ECLS is an independent predictor of
      mortality after ECLS, necessitating earlier ECLS implementations before profound 
      lactic acidosis develops. Moreover, nafamostat mesilate should be considered as
      alternative to heparin to reduce the risk of bleeding in these high-risk
      patients.

AB  - The incorporation of complex medical device technologies into clinical practice
      is governed by critical oversight of the United States Food and Drug
      Administration. This regulatory process requires a judicious balance between
      assuring safety and efficacy, while providing efficient review to facilitate
      access to innovative therapies. Recent contrasting views of the regulatory
      process have emphasized the difficulties in obtaining an optimal balance.
      Mechanical circulatory support has evolved to become an important therapy for
      patients who have advanced heart failure with the advent of more durable,
      implantable ventricular assist devices. The regulatory oversight of these new
      technologies has been difficult owing to the complexities of these devices,
      associated adverse event profile, and severity of illness of the intended patient
      population. Maintaining a regulatory environment to foster efficient introduction
      of safe and effective technologies is critical to the success of ventricular
      assist device therapy and the health of patients with advanced heart failure.
      Physicians representing key surgical and cardiology societies, and
      representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, National Heart Lung, and
      Blood Institute, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Inter-agency
      Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, and industry partners
      gathered to discuss relevant issues regarding the current regulatory environment 
      assessing ventricular assist devices. The goal of the meeting was to explore
      innovative ways to foster the introduction of technologically advanced, safe, and
      effective ventricular assist devices. The following summary reflects opinions and
      conclusions endorsed by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association
      for Thoracic Surgery, American Heart Association, Heart Failure Society of
      America, International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and
      Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support.

TI  - Value of peak exercise oxygen consumption combined with B-type natriuretic
      peptide levels for optimal timing of cardiac transplantation.
PG  - 6-14
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.968123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO(2)) is widely used to select
      candidates for heart transplantation (HTx). However, the prognosis of patients
      with advanced heart failure and peak VO(2) of 10 to 14 mL/min per kg in the era
      of modern medical therapy for heart failure is not fully elucidated. B-type
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a useful prognostic marker in patients with heart
      failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 424 patients undergoing HTx evaluation
      were classified according to peak VO(2) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing
      (>14, 10-14, and <10 mL/min per kg). Survival after cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing without HTx or ventricular assist device (VAD) support was compared with 
      survival of 743 de novo HTx recipients. Multivariable analysis revealed that high
      BNP and low peak VO(2) were independently associated with death, HTx, or VAD
      requirements (hazard ratio, 3.5 and 0.6; 95% CI, 1.24-9.23 and 0.03-0.71; P=0.02 
      and <0.0001, respectively). VAD-free or HTx-free survival of patients with peak
      VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg was identical to post-HTx survival. When patients
      with peak VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg were dichotomized by a cutoff value of BNP
      of 506 pg/mL, those with BNP<506 pg/mL was equivalent to post-HTx survival (1
      year: 90.8% versus 87.2%; P=0.61), whereas those with BNP>/=506 showed worse
      VAD-free or HTx-free survival (1 year: 79.7%; P<0.001 versus post-HTx). Patients 
      with peak VO(2) <10 mL/min per kg showed worse survival compared with post-HTx
      survival, and there was a survival difference between those with BNP>/=506 and
      <506 pg/mL (1 year: 77.2% versus 56.1%; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with peak 
      VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg and low BNP levels have a VAD-free or HTx-free
      survival similar to post-HTx survival in heart recipients, whereas high BNP
      levels indicate worse outcome in this group of patients.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term prognosis of pediatric HTx
      patients treated with VAD before transplantation. The clinical data of six
      patients bridged to HTx with Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric device were analyzed
      retrospectively. Information about graft function, CA results, and EMB findings
      as well as appearance DSA was collected. Also, information about growth and
      cognitive function was analyzed. These findings were compared with age-, gender-,
      and diagnosis-matched HTx patients. During the median follow-up time of four and 
      half yr after HTx, the prognosis including graft function, number of rejection
      episodes, and incidence of coronary artery vasculopathy, growth and cognitive
      development did not differ between VAD-bridged HTx patients compared with control
      patients. In both groups, one patient developed positive DSA titer after HTx. Our
      single-center experience suggests that the prognosis of pediatric HTx patients
      treated with VAD before transplantation is not inferior to that of other HTx
      patients.

TI  - Successful mechanical circulatory support for 251 days in a child with
      intermittent severe neutropenia due to Barth syndrome.
PG  - E46-9
LID - 10.1111/petr.12027 [doi]
AB  - Barth syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder that is characterized by
      cardiomyopathy, variable neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, growth delay, and
      organic aciduria. The cardiac involvement typically results in a high risk of
      severe heart failure in infancy or early childhood. While Berlin Heart EXCOR is
      widely accepted as ventricular assistance in pediatric patients with end-stage
      cardiac failure, infections remain a frequent and potentially severe
      complication. Therefore, the extended use of the device in the setting of
      intermittent or severe neutropenia is challenging. We present the case of a
      three-yr child with Barth syndrome who was bridged successfully to transplant
      with a Berlin Heart EXCOR assist device for eight months (251 days) without major
      infectious complication, despite several episodes of severe neutropenia. This
      case demonstrates that prolonged mechanical circulatory support for a patient
      with neutropenia is feasible without important morbidity, with careful monitoring
      and a multidisciplinary approach. G-CSF provides an excellent support in managing
      neutropenia.

TI  - Variability in infection control measures for the percutaneous lead among
      programs implanting long-term ventricular assist devices in the United States.
PG  - 351-9
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are a surgical treatment for heart failure.
      These devices may be implanted as a bridge to transplant or as destination
      therapy. After surgical recovery and education regarding device care, patients
      are discharged home. Meticulous care of the driveline must be taken to prevent
      infection and trauma of the site throughout the perioperative event and for the
      duration of support. Currently a standardized protocol for care of the driveline 
      and exit site does not exist. VAD coordinators from across the country discussed 
      the variability in care at different centers in the United States through a
      series of conference calls. A survey consisting of 16 questions was developed.
      The survey included questions on preoperative antibiotic recommendations,
      driveline placement and exit site suturing, frequency of dressing changes, and
      showering practices. VAD coordinators shared center-specific dressing protocols
      and any driveline success stories. This survey was sent to 73 centers; 38 centers
      (52%) responded. The purpose of the survey was to define current practice in
      order to move toward a standard of practice or protocol based on expert opinion
      for VAD driveline care and to assess the need for future studies.

TI  - State of the art in paediatric heart transplantation: the Berlin experience.
PG  - 258-67
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs588 [doi]
AB  - Enormous progress has been made in paediatric heart transplantation since the
      first unsuccessful effort by Kantrowitz in 1967. Early reports of children
      undergoing heart transplantation showed alarmingly high perioperative mortality
      rates of 25-60%, with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD)
      representing a particularly high-risk subset compared with cardiomyopathy. Many
      of these early failures were related to poor patient selection, suboptimal
      immunosuppression and technical problems. We learned a great deal from these
      earlier difficulties. Presently, with more refined techniques, better-defined
      patient selection criteria, excellent graft rejection monitoring and optimal
      immunosuppression, the ISHLT 2011 registry reported a 10-year survival rate of
      60% for patients transplanted for end-stage CHD and >70% for those transplanted
      for cardiomyopathy. The technical dilemmas in complex CHD were overcome by
      surgical ingenuity and creativity, innovative solutions and careful surgical
      planning, adapting the complex recipient anatomy to the normal donor anatomy. The
      miniaturized Berlin Heart pulsatile ventricular assist devices in children as a
      bridge to transplantation have revolutionized treatment and become a significant 
      contribution in heart-failure therapy. The intramyocardial electrogram and
      echocardiographic strain rate imaging have been employed as non-invasive
      techniques of rejection monitoring. Immunosuppressive drugs have a major impact
      on the development and progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, the main
      cause of cardiac allograft loss and a leading cause of mortality after the first 
      year post-transplantation. The questions of whether a transplanted heart in a
      newborn grows to adult size along with the child and whether the dimensional
      cardiac growth allows adequate function over time have been largely answered in
      our previous investigations. As more transplanted children reach adulthood,
      concerns about their life expectancy when they have reached 10 years of life
      post-transplant are raised, particularly with respect to establishing
      partnerships and families, their ability to earn a living and the fulfilment of
      personal life perspectives. Some heart-transplanted patients require
      retransplantation to remain alive. The disparity between the demand for and
      supply of donor hearts makes retransplantation an ethical issue. We 'do not
      refuse' any patient who needs retransplantation. Mechanical circulatory support
      devices for long-term use are now largely available to accommodate such cases.

AB  - The incorporation of complex medical device technologies into clinical practice
      is governed by critical oversight of the US Food and Drug Administration. This
      regulatory process requires a judicious balance between assuring safety and
      efficacy, while providing efficient review to facilitate access to innovative
      therapies. Recent contrasting views of the regulatory process have emphasized the
      difficulties in obtaining an optimal balance. Mechanical circulatory support has 
      evolved to become an important therapy for patients who have advanced heart
      failure with the advent of more durable, implantable ventricular assist devices. 
      The regulatory oversight of these new technologies has been difficult owing to
      the complexities of these devices, associated adverse event profile, and severity
      of illness of the intended patient population. Maintaining a regulatory
      environment to foster efficient introduction of safe and effective technologies
      is critical to the success of ventricular assist device therapy and the health of
      patients with advanced heart failure. Physicians representing key surgical and
      cardiology societies, and representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, 
      National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services, Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, and 
      industry partners gathered to discuss relevant issues regarding the current
      regulatory environment assessing ventricular assist devices. The goal of the
      meeting was to explore innovative ways to foster the introduction of
      technologically advanced, safe, and effective ventricular assist devices. The
      following summary reflects opinions and conclusions endorsed by The Society of

      awaiting high-urgency (HU) heart transplantation (HTx) in Spain has steadily
      increased due to longer waiting times and the new heart allocation system. It is 
      unknown whether the use of short-term VAD support in patients with cardiogenic
      shock affects HTx outcome. We sought to investigate long-term outcomes of HU
      transplanted patients with VAD compared with HU transplanted patients without
      device support. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all HTx patients
      transplanted between 1999 and 2011 in our institution. Patients were categorized 
      by urgency: elective HTx, HU-HTx with VAD (status 0), and HU-HTx without VAD
      (status 1). Actuarial survival rates were compared. RESULTS: Of 237 transplanted 
      patients, 55 (23%) were HU-HTx, including 16 on VAD support and 39 without VAD.
      Mean time in the HU waiting list was 6.5 +/- 6 days and mean VAD support was 8.4 
      +/- 8 days (range, 1 to 31 days). Assist devices used were Levitronix Centrimag
      (6), Abiomed (9), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (1). After a
      mean follow-up of 4.6 +/- 4.1 years (range 0 to 13 years), 22 patients had died: 
      5 VAD and 17 non-VAD. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 73% and 61% for the
      VAD and 74% and 62% for the non-VAD group, respectively (P = ns). Kaplan-Meier
      and Cox regression analyses did not show survival differences, HR 1.11 (95% CI
      0.41-3.02), P = 0.84. The presence of renal failure was associated with increased
      mortality risk, HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2), P = 0.02. The presence of renal failure 
      was associated with increased mortality risk [HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2), P = .02.).
      CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the long-term outcome of patients receiving
      HU-HTx under short-term VAD support is comparable to that of patients undergoing 
      HU-HTx without VAD support. Patients with renal failure had an increased risk for
      overall mortality in this set of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD) system (HeartWare
      International Inc, Framingham, MA) is a new centrifugal continuous-flow
      ventricular assist device. The aim of the present study is to review our
      institutional experience with this novel device. METHODS: We reviewed the files
      of 50 patients (39 men, 11 women) with a mean age of 50.6 +/- 11.8 years (range, 
      19 to 70 years) who underwent HVAD implantation between July 2009 and November
      2011. Two patients underwent HeartWare BIVAD implantation. The underlying heart
      diseases were end-stage ischemic heart disease (n = 12), acute myocardial
      infarction (n = 9), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 27) and acute myocarditis (n =
      2). Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
      (INTERMACS) profiles were level 1 (n = 11), 2 (n = 5), 3 (n = 10), and 4 (n =
      24). RESULTS: After a cumulative support duration of 11,086 days, Kaplan-Meier
      analysis revealed a survival of 82.0%, 77.9%, 75.5%, at 1, 12, and 24 months,
      respectively. Causes of early death were right heart failure (n = 4), multiorgan 
      failure (n = 2), septic shock (n = 2), and major neurologic complications (n =
      4). One late death occurred due to a right heart failure. Comparison between
      patients operated on in cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS 1 and 2) and patients who
      underwent elective HVAD implantation (INTERMACS 3 and 4) revealed a survival of
      61.5% and 44.1% for the INTERMACS 1 and 2 group and 90.3% and 87.1% for the
      INTERMACS 3 and 4 group at 1 and 12 months, respectively (odds ratio, 4.67; p =
      0.003). One patient was weaned from the system after 2 years. Eleven patients
      (22%) were successfully bridged to transplantation. Mean time to transplantation 
      was 209 days (range, 72 to 427 days). Posttransplant survival at the 1-year
      follow-up was 90.9% (11 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with HVAD shows
      satisfying results with an excellent posttransplantation survival. Moreover, the 
      stratified survival based on the level of preoperative stability shows better
      outcomes in patients undergoing elective HVAD implantation.

AB  - Recent outstanding clinical advances with new mechanical circulatory systems
      (MCS) have led to additional strategies in the treatment of end stage heart
      failure (HF). Heart transplantation (HTx) can be postponed and for certain
      patients even replaced by smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices
      (LVAD). Mechanical support of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate
      hemodynamic stabilisation and recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in 
      these severely ill patients. These new devices may be of great help to bridge
      patients until a suitable cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed
      as definitive treatment for patients who do not qualify for transplantation. Main
      indications for LVAD implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to
      transplantation or destination therapy. LVAD may be an important tool for
      patients with an expected prolonged period on the waiting list, for instance
      those with blood group 0 or B, with a body weight over 90 kg and those with
      potentially reversible secondary organ failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.
      However, LVAD implantation means an additional heart operation with inherent
      peri-operative risks and complications during the waiting period. Finally,
      cardiac transplantation in patients with prior implantation of a LVAD represents 
      a surgical challenge. This review summarises the current knowledge about LVAD and
      continuous flow devices especially since the latter have been increasingly used
      worldwide in the most recent years. The review is also based on the institutional
      experience at Berne University Hospital between 2000 and 2012. Apart from
      short-term devices (Impella, Cardiac Assist, Deltastream and ECMO) which were
      used in approximately 150 cases, 85 pulsatile long-term LVAD, RVAD or bi-VAD and 
      44 non-pulsatile LVAD (mainly HeartMateII and HeartWare) were implanted. After an
      initial learning curve, one-year mortality dropped to 10.4% in the last 58
      patients.

AB  - The topic of this article, stated a more familiar way, is whether left
      ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are ready for 'Primetime' as a therapeutic
      option in and of themselves. In order to provide an update and insight on this
      question, we briefly review from where the field has come, and in more detail
      describe its current state and where we are heading. We believe the short answer 
      to this question is 'Yes', but like many things, a short answer is not adequate. 
      Here we attempt to deliver a more comprehensive answer, providing some historical
      context, outlining the great achievements that have been made, as well as the
      many challenges that still remain before LVADs become a truly mainstream therapy.

PG  - 26-35
LID - 10.1007/s11897-012-0121-9 [doi]
AB  - Novel treatment of congestive heart failure (HF) involves utilizing unique
      pathways to improve upon contemporary therapies. Increasing the availability of
      cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5)
      is a relatively new, but promising therapeutic strategy. Preclinical studies
      suggest a favorable myocardial effect of PDE5 inhibitors by blocking adrenergic, 
      hypertrophic and pro-apoptotic signaling, thereby supporting their use in HF. The
      clinical benefits of acute and chronic PDE5 inhibition on lung diffusion
      capacity, exercise performance and ejection fraction in humans are emerging and
      appear promising. Larger, controlled trials are now on-going to assess the
      safety, efficacy and tolerability of PDE5 inhibitors on morbidity and mortality
      in patients with both systolic and diastolic heart failure. If the results of
      these trials are positive, a new avenue for the treatment of HF will open, which 
      will help curtail the societal effects of this costly and morbid disease.

PG  - 615-7
AB  - A patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and no history of thromboembolic events
      received a surgically implanted axial-flow left ventricular assist device. After 
      implantation, transesophageal echocardiography revealed a giant thrombus on the
      lateral and anterior aspects of the left ventricle. The inflow cannula inserted
      through the apex of the left ventricle was not obstructed, and the device
      generated satisfactory blood flow. Laboratory screening for thrombophilia showed 
      protein S deficiency, heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, and heterozygous
      MTHFR C667T mutation. During the entire duration of circulatory support, no
      significant suction events were detected, and the patient was listed for heart
      transplantation. Ventricular assist device implantation can unmask previously
      undiagnosed thrombophilia; therefore, it should be necessary to identify
      thrombophilic patients before cardiac support implantation.

TI  - Use of a single-circuit CentriMag(R) for biventricular support in postpartum
      cardiomyopathy.

LID - 10.1177/0267659112464713 [doi]
AB  - Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is defined by acute heart failure in the late
      stages of pregnancy to a few months postpartum. Cardiogenic shock in PPCM, though
      rare, can be life-threatening, often requiring support with mechanical
      circulatory support devices. We present a case of 37-year-old Caucasian female
      who developed cardiogenic shock within 24 hours of the delivery of her twins. The
      echocardiogram demonstrated severe biventricular failure which necessitated
      biventricular device placement and support with a CentriMag(R) centrifugal pump. 
      This biventricular support was employed, using a single-circuit CentriMag(R)
      pump, using a 'Y' connection which made weaning from right-sided support and
      conversion to univentricular support easier and feasible. The patient recovered
      four weeks later and was explanted off the CentriMag(R) support and did well.
      This technology allows for the CentriMag(R) to be considered as an early option
      for biventricular support in the treatment and management of these patients as a 
      bridge to recovery.

AB  - Implantable continuous flow pumps are a routine treatment for end-stage heart
      failure. The waiting time for heart transplantation is increasing, and more and
      more patients receive the pump for permanent support. We retrospectively analyzed
      our database of patients supported with the HeartMate II left ventricular assist 
      device to identify instances of cable damage. Between May 9, 2006 and May 9,
      2012, 161 patients were supported with the HeartMate II. There were 187
      cumulative years of HeartMate II support. The documented cable damage occurred in
      12 patients (7.5%), requiring pump exchange in five patients after a mean time of
      706 days on support. There was no perioperative mortality. The damage occurred
      typically at the "weak" place-the feedthrough of the driveline to the pump body. 
      In some cases, the device alarm history and x-ray may allow diagnosis before pump
      stop occurs. However, since the most recent changes in the design of the
      connection and modifications made in the implantation technique, no instance of
      cable damage has been registered.

TI  - Left ventricular reverse remodeling with a continuous flow left ventricular
      assist device measured by left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions and severity 
      of mitral regurgitation.
PG  - 574-7
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31826e4267 [doi]
AB  - Pulsatile flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) maximally unload the left 
      ventricle (LV), leading to reverse remodeling of the myopathic LV that manifests 
      as decreased LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and decreased severity of mitral 
      regurgitation (MR). There is a paucity of data, however, regarding the ability of
      continuous flow (CF) pumps to adequately decompress the LV to induce similar
      reverse remodeling. We sought to evaluate the effects of CF-LVADs on LV reverse
      remodeling. From March 2006 through July 2011, one hundred patients with chronic 
      heart failure underwent implantation of CF-LVAD (93 HeartMate II LVADs and seven 
      HeartWare LVADs) as bridge-to-transplant (n = 68) and destination therapies (n = 
      32). Echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations were reviewed
      preoperatively and at 1 and 6 months post-LVAD implantation. Mean age was 52.1
      +/- 12.1 years; etiology of heart failure was ischemic cardiomyopathy in 34
      patients and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in 66 patients. Median LVAD
      support time was 378.3 days; 371.5 days for patients who received
      bridge-to-transplant therapy and 422.2 days for patients who underwent
      destination therapy. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension significantly
      decreased at 1 month post-LVAD implantation from 71.6 +/- 12.4 to 58.3 +/- 13.8
      mm (p < 0.001). Severity of MR also significantly decreased from 76.0% of
      patients having moderate or severe MR preoperatively to 8.0% with moderate or
      severe MR at 1 month post-LVAD (p < 0.001). These reductions were maintained at 6
      months. These data demonstrate the ability of a CF-LVAD to significantly
      decompress the LV, leading to significant reductions in LVEDD and severity of MR.
      This reverse remodeling was apparent in the early postoperative period and was
      sustained at 6 months. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether this 
      correlates with clinical LV recovery.

TI  - Clinical, haemodynamic and echocardiographic features of early cardiac graft
      dysfunction.
PG  - 1010-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main cause of early death after heart transplantation (HTx) is
      so-called early primary or secondary graft failure (GF). The risk of profound GF 
      has not declined in the past decade, as the consequence of the liberalisation of 
      donor acceptance criteria because of the scarcity of donors. It is therefore
      important to try to diagnose graft failure and recognise the mechanisms of early 
      graft dysfunction. AIM: To establish haemodynamic and echocardiographic criteria 
      of early GF to define patients who should be considered for assist device support
      or re-transplantation. METHODS: Between January 2000 and March 2009, 116 HTx
      patients were studied. On the basis of echocardiography and continuous invasive
      monitoring, three groups were identified: (1) The true graft failure group (GF)
      consisted of 46 patients; (2) The latent right ventricular (RV) dysfunction group
      (RV-D) consisted of 25 patients with small left ventricular (LV) chamber (< 39
      mm) and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) < 50%; (3) The control group consisted of 45 
      consecutive HTx patients without any haemodynamic complications. RESULTS:
      Postoperatively, only the GF group required large doses of norepinephrine (> 0.3 
      mumg/kg/min) and inhalative NO (40 ppm). Nevertheless, right and left filling
      pressures were significantly higher than in the controls (right 12 +/- 3.6 vs.
      9.0 +/- 2 and left atrial pressure 13.0 +/- 3.2 vs. 9.6 +/- 2 mm Hg, both p <
      0.001). Cardiac index was significantly smaller (2.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.9, p <
      0.001) but neither pulmonary artery pressure (29.5 +/- 6 vs. 29.7 +/- 7 mm Hg)
      nor transpulmonary gradient (6 +/- 5 vs. 5.1 +/- 5 mm Hg) nor pulmonary vascular 
      resistance (273 +/- 97 vs. 287 +/- 144 dyn x s x cm-5) differed significantly
      from those of the control group. In the GF group, LV end diastolic dimension
      (LVEDD) was significantly smaller and function poorer than in controls (39.8 +/- 
      5 vs. 44.4 +/- 5 mm, respectively, p = 0.001). RV function was also significantly
      worse (RVEF 42.2 +/- 14% vs. 56.0 +/- 9%), respectively, p = 0.001), whereas RV
      dimension did not differ significantly. Mechanical support after failure of the
      initial medical treatment was necessary in 37% of patients; 29 (63.0%) patients
      from the GF group died, the cause of death being sepsis with multi-organ failure.
      In the RV-D group, remodelling was quite similar but LVEF was excellent and
      maximal systolic velocity from the posterior wall was significantly higher than
      in GF. No death occurred. CONCLUSIONS: True early GF represents a grave
      haemodynamic situation with high mortality. Bedside echocardiography helps to
      distinguish between latent RV dysfunction and true GF.

TI  - Influence of ivabradine on reverse remodelling during mechanical unloading.
PG  - 230-9
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvs318 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Ivabradine (Iva) has shown beneficial structural and functional effects in 
      clinical and experimental heart failure (HF), but its action in combination with 
      mechanical unloading (MU), such as during treatment with left ventricular assist 
      devices (LVAD), is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects 
      of Iva during MU, in a rodent model of HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the
      chronic effects (4 weeks) of Iva (10 mg/kg/day) alone and in combination with MU 
      [induced by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)] on whole-heart
      and cellular structure, function, and excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in a 
      rodent (rat) model of HF, 12 weeks post-left coronary artery (LCA) ligation.
      Effects of Iva were compared with those of beta-blockade using metoprolol [(Met),
      250 mg/kg/day]. Iva, but not Met, reversed myocardial fibrosis, alone and in
      combination with MU. MU-induced restoration of deranged E-C coupling was enhanced
      by Iva to a greater extent than Met: both Iva and Met enhanced the recovery of
      the Ca(2+) transient amplitude and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)
      content, but Iva alone maintained MU-induced normalization of L-type Ca(2+)
      current and t-tubule abnormalities. Met prevented MU-induced reduction in the
      myocardial size (myocardial atrophy); Iva had no effect on this parameter.
      CONCLUSION: Iva shows beneficial structural and E-C coupling effects during MU:
      Iva reverses myocardial fibrosis and enhances the restoration of deranged E-C
      coupling, displaying more beneficial effects than that of Met. These results
      suggest that Iva may prove effective in enhancing functional recovery in heart
      failure patients receiving LVAD therapy.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become an established surgical
      therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure who require hemodynamic support
      as a bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy. However, the anatomic and
      physiologic consequences of long-term LVAD support have yet to be fully
      clarified. Despite the clinical success of these devices, it has been reported
      that many patients bridged to transplantation with mechanical support develop
      circulating antibodies with potential donor reactivity. Transplanting against
      existing or historic donor-specific antibodies is associated with increased risk 
      of antibody-mediated rejection, graft dysfunction, and decreased survival. Safe
      transplantation of allosensitized patients is dependent on using prospective
      crossmatching and antibody titer reduction techniques (desensitization). Strict
      protocols requiring a negative prospective crossmatch before transplantation
      result in a decreased donor pool and a longer duration of support in sensitized
      LVAD recipients with increased inherent morbidity such as infections and
      thromboembolic complications. The aim of this review is to present the current
      state of knowledge of possible immunologic mechanisms involved in
      alloimmunization of LVAD recipients, outline new methods of antibody detection,
      compare various desensitization strategies, and present an overview of clinical
      data assessing the impact of sensitization on posttransplantation outcome.

TI  - Development of a novel echocardiography ramp test for speed optimization and
      diagnosis of device thrombosis in continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      devices: the Columbia ramp study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to develop a novel approach to optimizing
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) function and diagnosing 
      device malfunctions. BACKGROUND: In CF-LVAD patients, the dynamic interaction of 
      device speed, left and right ventricular decompression, and valve function can be
      assessed during an echocardiography-monitored speed ramp test. METHODS: We
      devised a unique ramp test protocol to be routinely used at the time of discharge
      for speed optimization and/or if device malfunction was suspected. The patient's 
      left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, frequency of aortic valve opening,
      valvular insufficiency, blood pressure, and CF-LVAD parameters were recorded in
      increments of 400 rpm from 8,000 rpm to 12,000 rpm. The results of the speed
      designations were plotted, and linear function slopes for left ventricular
      end-diastolic dimension, pulsatility index, and power were calculated. RESULTS:
      Fifty-two ramp tests for 39 patients were prospectively collected and analyzed.
      Twenty-eight ramp tests were performed for speed optimization, and speed was
      changed in 17 (61%) with a mean absolute value adjustment of 424 +/- 211 rpm.
      Seventeen patients had ramp tests performed for suspected device thrombosis, and 
      10 tests were suspicious for device thrombosis; these patients were then treated 
      with intensified anticoagulation and/or device exchange/emergent transplantation.
      Device thrombosis was confirmed in 8 of 10 cases at the time of emergent device
      exchange or transplantation. All patients with device thrombosis, but none of the
      remaining patients had a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension slope >-0.16.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ramp tests facilitate optimal speed changes and device malfunction
      detection and may be used to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions and
      need for surgical intervention in CF-LVAD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support as bridge to recovery
      (BTR) is uncommon for subjects with chronic heart failure. Myocardial recovery is
      more evident in recent onset nonischemic cardiomyopathy (ROCM); however, the
      prevalence of BTR in this subset has not been addressed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We 
      examined the use of LVAD support for subjects with ROCM in the Intervention in
      Myocarditis and Acute Cardiomyopathy 2 (IMAC2) study. The overall cohort (n =
      373) was 38% female, 21% black, with a mean age of 45 +/- 14 years. LVAD support 
      was used in 3.8% (n = 14, 43% female, age 32 +/- 10). Of LVAD subjects, 57%
      (8/14) were BTR, including 73% (8/11) of subjects with symptoms </=4 months at
      the time of support. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was smaller 
      in BTR than nonrecovered (NR) subjects (P = .04). Myocardial inflammation was
      more common in BTR (75% versus 0%, P = .005), whereas fibrosis was less evident
      (25% versus 100%, P = .005). Of BTR subjects, 7/8 (87.5%) were alive and free of 
      transplant with median follow-up of 19 months. CONCLUSION: In a multicenter
      registry of ROCM, BTR was common and occurred in the majority of subjects
      requiring LVAD support. Histology and LVEDD may assist in predicting potential
      for BTR in ROCM.

TI  - BiVADs: a bridge to the future for patients and their families: the art and
      science of nursing combined in the face of technology.
PG  - 20-3
AB  - Approximately 500,000 Canadians live with heart failure (Ross et al., 2006).
      These numbers continue to rise due to advancing technology and successes in
      treating cardiac conditions and potentially fatal events such as myocardial
      infarctions. According to Carrier (2005), individuals with damaged hearts are
      living longer, and lives are being successfully saved with the surge of
      cardiovascular assist devices developed in recent years, which are increasingly
      used as a bridge to transplant. Despite the lifesaving capabilities of
      ventricular-assist devices, these innovations pose risks and complications that
      can be debilitating for patients and their families (Carrier, 2005). As this
      complex trajectory is navigated, nurses provide care and support to the patient
      and family while playing a unique role in the assessment and monitoring of these 
      devices. A family-centred nursing model provides a framework for practice when
      nursing patients and families are in crisis. The foundations of the McGill Model 
      of Nursing are focused on a strengths-based approach, revolving around
      collaboration between patients, family resources, and tailored interventions
      (Gottlieb & Feeley, 2005). As students placed in a critical care setting, we
      began to realize the complexity of care required to nurse these patients and
      their families. In this paper, a case study is used to describe and share our
      learning experiences of caring for a patient with a biventricular assist device, 
      as well as the principles that guided our interventions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to present the
      results obtained from heart transplantation since this therapeutic modality first
      began to be used in Spain in May 1984. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was
      performed of all heart transplantations performed until 31 December 2011.
      RESULTS: The total number of transplantations is 6528. The average clinical
      profile of the Spanish heart transplantation patient in 2011 was that of a
      53-year-old male who had been diagnosed with nonrevascularizable ischemic heart
      disease accompanied by severely depressed ventricular function and poor
      functional status. The implanted heart was typically from a 38-year-old donor who
      had died from brain hemorrhage. The average waiting list time was 122 days. Mean 
      survival time has progressively increased over the years. For the overall series,
      the probability of survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 77%, 66%, 53%, and 39%,
      respectively, whereas over the past 5 years the probability of survival at 1 and 
      5 years was 80% and 73%, respectively. The most frequent cause of death was acute
      graft failure (16%), followed by infection (15.6%), the combination of graft
      vascular disease and sudden death (14%), tumors (12.3%) and acute rejection
      (7.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The survival rates obtained in Spain from heart
      transplantation, especially in recent years, place heart transplantation as the
      treatment of choice in irreversible heart failure patients without other
      established medical or surgical options.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) using long-term ventricular
      assist devices (VADs) is an established therapy in select patients with advanced 
      heart failure. Studies have suggested that outcomes after VAD implantation may be
      dependent on institutional procedural volume, and outcome data from
      non-transplant centres are lacking. This study reviews the outcomes of patients
      who received a long-term VAD at our centre to determine if these devices can be
      safely implanted at tertiary care, low-volume, non-transplant centres. METHODS:
      We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study, examining the clinical
      outcomes of consecutive patients who received a long-term VAD over a 42-month
      period. RESULTS: During the study period 73 patients required MCS, of whom 16
      received a long-term VAD. This select group had a mean Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile of 1.6 (0.9) and
      before implantation 94% required at least 1 inotropic medication, 69% had
      suffered a cardiac arrest, 63% required an intra-aortic balloon pump, 69%
      required mechanical ventilation, and 44% required short-term MCS. The primary
      outcome of survival to transplant or ongoing MCS at 1 year was achieved in 75% of
      patients. Operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital survival were 100%,
      88%, and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term VADs can be implanted at
      low-volume, nontransplant centres with survival rates comparable with
      contemporary clinical trials. Availability of a specialty trained
      multidisciplinary team with expertise in short-term and long-term MCS options
      facilitates appropriate patient selection and might be more important than
      institutional volume in determining outcomes after implantation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The waiting list for heart transplantation (HTx) in Eurotransplant 
      area has grown to a record size of nearly 1,300 patients, whereas only around 600
      hearts were transplanted last year. The prolonged time for patients awaiting HTx 
      on the high-urgency (HU) status leads mostly to serious medical complications.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the trend of changes in the
      frequency of ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation in patients on the HU
      status. METHODS: A total of 22 adult patients awaiting transplantation on the HU 
      status at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2011 were analyzed,
      assessing risk profile, blood group, and complication rates in terms of VAD
      implantation or death. Results were compared with 16 consecutive patients who
      were on transplant list with the HU status between January 2010 and December 2010
      at our institution. RESULTS: Mean age was 49.5 +/- 12.1 (2010 group) years and
      51.4 +/- 10.7 years (2011 group; p = 0.62). Mean logEuroSCORES raised not
      significantly from 9.1 +/- 6.3% (2010 group) to 10.7 +/- 14.7% (2011 group; p =
      0.68). Six patients died on the HU status and seven patients had to be supplied
      with a VAD in 2011. In comparison with the preceding year, only two patients died
      in 2010 and none of our patients on the HU status had to be provided with
      mechanical circulatory support. CONCLUSION: Because of the prolonged waiting time
      on the HU list, the earlier-mentioned data demonstrate a negative trend in
      transplant medicine. Especially when taking into consideration that five of seven
      patients who needed a VAD implantation during the HU waiting period had blood
      group O. Furthermore, the data derived from Eurotransplant show that the waiting 
      period for patients with blood group O was considerably longer when compared with
      patients of the same average body height and weight but with other blood groups.

AB  - Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is a complex
      congenital cardiac anomaly with a wide spectrum of morphologic features and
      clinical profiles. Most patients are diagnosed late in their life, undergoes
      surgical repairs, eventually leading to systemic ventricular failure needing
      heart transplant or mechanical circulatory assistance. As, aorta is located
      anterior to and left of the PA (Transposition of great arteries), the outflow
      graft of ventricular assist device traverse across pulmonary artery to reach
      aorta which poses challenge during further surgical explorations.

TI  - Mechanical bridging to orthotopic heart transplantation in children.
PG  - 753-63
AB  - This article discusses the main methods currently used in clinical practice to
      support patients with end-stage heart failure and the research into new devices
      under development, particularly for young children. With an increasing demand on 
      the supply of organs available for heart transplant, alternative strategies are
      being sought to maintain patients with end-stage cardiac failure for longer
      periods of time. Devices that support a failing heart, allowing cardiac recovery 
      in some cases, or more commonly accommodate the time to source a suitable donor
      heart for transplantation, provide crucial therapeutic options. Extra-corporeal
      membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices are the mainstay of such
      bridging therapy. Although providing essential support to critically ill
      patients, they are not without their own significant associated risks.
      Therapeutic advances aim to reduce the risks associated with these bridging
      systems, and new artificial devices are being developed to improve this
      supportive care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow (CF) ventricular assist devices (VAD) are an
      established option for treatment of end-stage heart failure. However, the effect 
      of long-term CF with lack of peripheral arterial wall motions on blood pressure
      regulation and end-organ arterial wall sclerosis, especially in the case of
      long-term support (> 3 years), remains unclear. METHODS: Tissue samples obtained 
      at autopsy from liver, kidney, coronary arteries, and brain from 27 VAD
      recipients supported for > 180 days between 2000 and 2010 were histologically
      examined to assess vascular alterations, including perivascular infiltrate,
      intravascular infiltrate, wall thickness, thrombosis, endothelial cell swelling, 
      vessel wall necrosis, and peri-vascular fibrosis. Pulsatile-flow (PF) devices had
      been inserted in 9 patients and CF devices had been inserted in 16. The
      pathologist was blinded to the group distribution. Demographic, pharmacologic,
      and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed before surgery and during the
      follow-up period of up to 24 months. RESULTS: Median duration of support was 467 
      days (range, 235-1,588 days) in the PF group and 263 days (range, 182-942 days)
      in the CF group. Demographic and clinical data before and after surgery were
      similar. Amiodarone was more often used during follow-up in CF group than in the 
      PF group (61% vs 10%, p = 0.009). Throughout the follow-up period, mean arterial 
      pressure did not differ between recipients of the 2 pump types, nor did systolic 
      and diastolic pressure, except at 2 weeks after VAD implantation, when systolic
      blood pressure was higher (p = 0.05) and diastolic lower (p = 0.03) in the PF
      group. Histologic studies did not identify any relevant differences in arterial
      wall characteristics between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Long-term mechanical
      circulatory support with CF devices does not adversely influence arterial wall
      properties of the end-organ vasculature.

TI  - Pre-explant stability of unloading-promoted cardiac improvement predicts outcome 
      after weaning from ventricular assist devices.
PG  - S9-19
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of cardiac recovery that allows long-term cardiac stability
      after ventricular assist device (VAD) explantation is a major goal. After
      normalization of ventricular diameters during unloading, the pre-explant left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) allows the detection of patients with the
      potential to remain stable after VAD explantation. However, some patients with
      LVEF >45 before VAD explantation show early recurrence of heart failure (HF). We 
      aimed to find out if unstable improvement can be recognized before VAD
      explantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 96 patients weaned from VADs since 1995,
      a relatively homogenous group of 53 patients with nonischemic chronic
      cardiomyopathy (CCM) was selected for the study. The pre-explant stability of
      major parameters of LV function, size, and geometry that were measured by
      echocardiography during serial "off-pump" trials was tested for relationship with
      cardiac stability after VAD explantation. LVEF, systolic peak wall motion
      velocity (Sm), end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), end-diastolic relative wall
      thickness (RWT(ED)) and end-diastolic short/long-axis ratio (S/L(ED)) were
      selected for evaluation. In postweaning unstable patients, the selected
      parameters showed relevant instability already before VAD explantation during the
      time period between best cardiac improvement and VAD explantation and also during
      the final off-pump trial just before VAD explantation. For all parameters, there 
      were significant differences (P<0.05) in pre-explant changes between patients
      with and without postweaning cardiac stability. Using the optimal cutoff values
      obtained from receiver-operating characteristic analysis, we found for our
      selected parameters predictive values for postexplant cardiac stability of >/=1
      year, >/=3 years, and >/=5 years, ranging between 94 and 100, 92, and 100, and 78
      and 100, respectively. Using for all parameter changes the cutoff value of 10, we
      found similar predictive values for cardiac stability of >/=1 year, >/=3 years,
      and >/=5 years, ranging between 93 and 97, 90 and 96, and 83 and 92,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest the possibility to
      improve the prediction of postexplant transplant/VAD-free outcome in CCM patients
      with cardiac improvement during VAD support by analyzing the pre-explant
      stability of several LV off-pump echocardiographic parameters during serial
      off-pump trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD),
      pump-related infection can cause adverse effects that may result in death.
      METHODS: We describe three patients who had infections related to a fistula
      between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the LVAD pocket and who subsequently 
      underwent successful heart transplantation without developing sepsis. In no case 
      did the LVAD-related infection adversely affect the outcome of transplantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: For detecting the fistulas, full upper-GI endoscopy and colonoscopy 
      were superior to other types of diagnostic imaging studies.

TI  - Regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate release by selective
      beta2-adrenergic receptor stimulation in human terminal failing myocardium before
      and after ventricular assist device support.

LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.07.005 [doi]
LID - S1053-2498(12)01177-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Response to catecholamines is blunted in terminal heart failure due
      to beta-receptor downregulation and uncoupling from adenylyl cyclase (AC).
      Improved myocardial responsiveness to catecholamines after ventricular assist
      device (VAD) support is associated with upregulation of beta1-adrenergic
      receptors (beta1-ARs). Little is known about the regulation of AC and beta2-AR
      coupling after VAD; moreover beta2-AR stimulation during VAD was claimed to
      induce myocardial recovery. METHODS: We analyzed in VAD-supported human
      myocardium the regulation of AC activity upon beta1-AR and selective beta2-AR
      stimulation in 8 non-failing hearts (NF) and 17 paired samples of VAD patients.
      AC messenger RNA was measured by TaqMan. AC was stimulated via beta2-AR using
      clenbuterol (beta2-AR agonist) and bisoprolol (beta1-AR blocker). Organ bath
      experiments were done with trabeculae from both ventricles. Samples were
      stratified according to chronic or acute heart failure history. RESULTS:
      Isoprenaline-induced AC activity was downregulated (p < 0.001) pre-VAD and
      increased significantly (p < 0.05) after unloading (mean +/- standard deviation
      pmole/mg/min) in NF (47.9 +/- 14.9), pre-VAD (24.35 +/- 13.3), and post-VAD
      (50.04 +/- 50.25). Forskolin stimulation revealed significant (p < 0.05)
      upregulation of AC activity during VAD, especially in acutely failing hearts (NF,
      192.1 +/- 68.7; pre-VAD, 191.1 +/- 60.4; post-VAD, 281.5 +/- 133). However,
      forskolin stimulation relative to isoprenaline-induced inotropy remained reduced 
      before and after VAD compared with NF. The selective stimulation of beta2-AR did 
      not reveal influence of VAD support on beta2-AR-AC coupling. Stimulation of
      ventricular trabeculae by > 100 mumole/liter clenbuterol revealed negative
      inotropic responses. CONCLUSIONS: VAD does not influence beta2-AR coupling to AC 
      stimulation. Elevated response to catecholamines after VAD support is influenced 
      by beta1-AR upregulation and modulation of AC activity. Restoration of
      beta-adrenergic responsiveness was restricted to acutely failing hearts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delayed sternal closure (DSC) is employed after conventional cardiac 
      surgery without a significantly increased risk of late mediastinitis or sternal
      wound infection. There are no data specifically examining its late effects on
      patients undergoing implantation with a ventricular assist device (VAD). METHODS:
      Between October 1996 and October 2010, 364 patients underwent primary VAD implant
      and DSC was utilized in 184 (51%) patients for coagulopathy (n = 155; 84%),
      hemodynamic instability (n = 103; 56%), isolated right ventricular dysfunction (n
      = 15; 8%) or unspecified reasons (n = 17; 9%). RESULTS: Median duration of DSC
      was 1 day (range 1 to 7 days). Patients with DSC were older (54.5 vs. 50.3 years,
      p = 0.002), had a higher incidence of previous sternotomy (42% vs. 28%, p =
      0.005), pre-operative intra-aortic balloon pump (50% vs. 30%, p < 0.001),
      pre-operative temporary extracorporeal mechanical circulatory support (23% vs
      10%, p < 0.001), lower platelet counts (171,000 vs. 209,000, p < 0.001) and lower
      hematocrit levels (32% vs. 36%, p < 0.001). Operative (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.65) or
      late (2 years; 66 +/- 7% vs 66 +/- 7%, p = 0.720) mortality; composite incidence 
      of mediastinitis, percutaneous drive-line infection, pocket infection and
      VAD-related endocarditis (15% vs. 16%, p = 0.79); re-exploration for bleeding
      (18% vs. 18%, p = 0.99); urgent transplantation for infection (4% vs. 3%, p =
      0.99); or need for device exchange (9% vs. 10%, p = 0.16) was not increased after
      DSC when compared with immediate sternal closure. DSC increased ICU stay (10 vs. 
      5 days, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DSC was performed most commonly for coagulopathy
      and/or hemodynamic instability, and patients were older with a greater severity
      of illness as shown by the higher incidence of right-sided circulatory failure
      and history of prior sternotomy. Although DSC was associated with longer ICU
      stay, DSC was not associated with a significantly increased risk of death or
      infection.

AB  - PURPOSE: Despite the remarkable advances with the use of ventricular assist
      devices (VAD) in adults, pneumatic pulsatile support in children is still
      limited. We report on our experience in the pediatric population. METHODS:
      Retrospective review of 27 consecutive children offered mechanical support with
      Berlin Heart as a bridge to heart transplant, and Jarvik 2000 as a destination
      therapy from February 2002 to October 2011. RESULTS: The median patient age was
      4.8 years (range = 75 days to 20.5 years). The median patient weight was 18.6 kg 
      (range = 2.9-63 kg). We divided the patients in two groups, including in group I 
      patients assisted for bridging to heart transplantation and in group II patients 
      with Duchenne's dystrophy assisted as destination therapy. In the group I, 11
      patients required biventricular mechanical support (BVAD), but in all other
      cases, a single left VAD proved sufficient (56%). The median duration of VAD
      support was 48 days (1 to 192 days). The median pre-VAD pulmonary vascular
      resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5 to 14.4 WU/m(2)). Twelve patients
      (48%) were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median duration 
      of mechanical support of 63 days (range = 2-168 days). Ten deaths occurred (40%),
      three for neurological complications, two for sepsis, two for multiorgan failure,
      and three other for device malfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our
      patients has increased from 33% to 75%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from 
      89% to 23%. In the group II, two patients with mean age of 15.3 years were
      assisted with Jarvik 2000, and both of them are alive in a follow-up of 10.4
      months. In two patients with Rpi > 10 WU/m(2), unresponsive to pulmonary
      vasodilatator therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2 WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of
      BVAD support, respectively. Six patients (32%) required at least one pump change.
      Of 12 patients undergoing heart transplantation, five developed an extremely
      elevated (>60%) panel-reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
      confirmed by Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of
      rejection in the first month after heart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The 
      survival rate after heart transplantation was 100% with a median follow-up of
      34.4 months (45 days to 8.7 years). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in children
      with end-stage heart failure is an effective strategy as a bridge to heart
      transplantation with a reasonable morbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer
      an additional means to reverse extremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. 
      The total implantable system opens a future scenarios for patients not eligible
      for heart transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several studies have examined factors affecting survival
      after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), few have evaluated the impact of
      reoperative sternotomy. We undertook this study to examine the incidence and
      impact of repeat sternotomies on OHT outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a
      retrospective review of all adult OHT from 2 institutions. Primary stratification
      was by the number of prior sternotomies. The primary outcome was survival.
      Secondary outcomes included blood product utilization and commonly encountered
      postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression
      models examined mortality while linear regression models examined blood
      utilization. RESULTS: From January 1995 to October 2011, 631 OHT were performed. 
      Of these, 25 (4.0%) were redo OHT and 182 (28.8%) were bridged to transplant with
      a ventricular assist device; 356 (56.4%) had undergone at least 1 prior
      sternotomy. On unadjusted analysis, reoperative sternotomy was associated with
      decreased 90-day (98.5% vs 90.2%, p<0.001), 1-year (93.1% vs 79.6%, p<0.001), and
      5-year (80.4% vs 70.1%, p=0.002) survival. This difference persisted on
      multivariable analysis at 90 days (hazard ratio [HR] 2.99, p=0.01), 1 year (HR
      2.98, p=0.002), and 5 years (HR 1.62, p=0.049). The impact of an increasing
      number of prior sternotomies was negligible. On multivariable analysis, an
      increasing number of prior sternotomies was associated with increased
      intraoperative blood product utilization. Increasing blood utilization was
      associated with decreased 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year survival. CONCLUSIONS:
      Reoperative sternotomy is associated with increased mortality and blood
      utilization after OHT. Patients with more than 1 prior sternotomy do not
      experience additional increased mortality. Carefully selected patients with
      multiple prior sternotomies have decreased but acceptable outcomes.

AB  - Simultaneous adherence with multiple self-care instructions among heart failure
      (HF) patients is not well described. Patient-reported adherence to 8
      recommendations related to exercise, alcohol, medications, smoking, diet, weight,
      and symptoms was assessed among 308 HF patients using the Medical Outcomes Study 
      Specific Adherence Scale questionnaire (0="never" to 5="always," maximum
      score=40). A baseline cumulative score of >/=32/40 (average >/=80%) defined good 
      adherence. Clinical events (death/transplantation/ventricular assist device),
      resource utilization, functional capacity (6-minute walk distance), and health
      status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) were compared among
      patients with and without good adherence. The mean follow-up was 2.0+/-1.0 years,
      and adherence ranged from 26.3% (exercise) to 89.9% (medications). A cumulative
      score indicating good adherence was reported by 35.7%, whereas good adherence
      with every behavior was reported by 9.1% of patients. Good adherence was
      associated with fewer hospitalizations (all-cause 87.8 vs 107.6; P=.018; HF 29.6 
      vs 43.8; P=.007) and hospitalized days (all-cause 422 vs 465; P=.015; HF 228 vs
      282; P<.001) per 100-person-years and better health status (KCCQ overall score
      70.1+/-24.6 vs 63.8+/-22.8; P=.011). Adherence was not associated with clinical
      events or functional capacity. Patient-reported adherence with HF self-care
      recommendations is alarmingly low and selective. Good adherence was associated
      with lower resource utilization and better health status.

AB  - We report the case of a patient who had chronic anthracycline-induced
      cardiomyopathy that was reversed after treatment with a left ventricular assist
      device. A 29-year-old woman had undergone anthracycline-based chemotherapy as a
      teenager in 1991 and 1992 and received a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy 10
      years later. Optimal medical therapy had initially controlled the symptoms of
      heart failure. However, in June 2006, the symptoms worsened to New York Heart
      Association functional class IV status. We implanted a continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation; of note, a left
      ventricular core biopsy at that time showed no replacement fibrosis. The
      patient's clinical status improved thereafter, enabling left ventricular assist
      device ex-plantation after 17 months. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
      of the use of left ventricular assist device support to reverse chronic
      anthracycline-induced heart failure.

TI  - Factors associated with the need of biventricular mechanical circulatory support 
      in children with advanced heart failure.
PG  - 1028-35
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs481 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Postimplantation right ventricular dysfunction is associated with
      increased morbidity and mortality in ventricular assist device (VAD) recipients. 
      This study aimed to determine the preoperative risk factors for severe right
      heart failure needing biventricular mechanical circulatory support in children
      with end-stage heart failure. METHODS: We reviewed data from 84 children
      supported with long-term VADs at the German Heart Institute Berlin between
      January 1999 and October 2010. Right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support was
      needed for 24 (29%) patients, and the other 60 (71%) were implanted with left
      ventricular assist devices (LVADs). RESULTS: The median age at implantation was 7
      years (12 days-18 years), and the median support time was 41 days (1-432 days).
      Of the 84 patients, the overall survival to transplantation or recovery of
      ventricular function was 69%. Compared with children implanted with LVAD,
      patients receiving biventricular support had significantly higher postoperative
      mortality (P = 0.04). The multivariate logistic regression indicated that
      decreased milrinone use was the only preoperative factor independently associated
      with increased requirement for biventricular support (odds ratio: 0.1, 95%
      confidence interval: 0.04-0.64, P = 0.01). Children treated with milrinone
      preoperatively showed improved survival after implantation (P = 0.04).
      CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric patients needing biventricular support had significantly 
      higher postoperative mortality. Preoperative milrinone use might decrease the
      risk of severe right ventricular failure requiring additional RVAD insertion and 
      improve postimplantation survival in children with advanced heart failure.

PG  - 370-5
LID - 10.3171/2012.7.PEDS12161 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are continuous or pulsatile flow 
      devices that could potentially be life-saving measures for patients with
      end-stage heart failure. These devices have clear advantages over extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and are often used in adults. They are only recently 
      being commonly used in the pediatric age group. As the use of LVADs becomes more 
      mainstream in children, it is important to determine the complication profile
      associated with these devices. Furthermore, with the increasing application of
      LVADs in children, pediatric neurosurgeons are seeing a correlative increase in
      associated neurological complications. In this study, the authors reviewed the
      incidence of neurological complications due to LVAD use in the pediatric age
      group and the role of neurosurgery in treatment. METHODS: The authors examined
      data regarding patients with LVADs from the Texas Children's Hospital Heart
      Center database (July 01, 2007, to June 30, 2011) and recorded neurological
      complications requiring neurosurgical consultation. They identified 2 children
      who underwent craniotomies during LVAD treatment. RESULTS: Intracranial
      hemorrhage occurred in 3 (6.5%) of the 46 patients treated with an LVAD at the
      authors' institution. Of these patients, 2 were treated with craniotomies for
      life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages. The 3 patients in the neurosurgical
      cohort presented with cerebral infarction, decreased level of consciousness,
      and/or seizure. At the last follow-up (286, 503, and 550 days), 1 patient (case
      2) had no decline in neurological status, underwent a successful heart
      transplant, and was discharged home; 1 patient (case 1) died of refractory
      cardiac failure; and 1 patient (case 3) was on an LVAD for destination therapy
      (that is, the LVAD is not a bridge to transplantation but rather the final
      treatment). This patient was discharged from the hospital, but he died of
      overwhelming fungemia at 286 days while on VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial
      hemorrhage is a serious and feared complication of LVAD treatment. While the
      surgical risk is substantial due to systemic anticoagulation and significant
      medical comorbidities, neurosurgical evacuation of hemorrhage plays an important 
      life-saving role that can yield successful and acceptable outcomes.

TI  - The influence of device position on the flow within the Penn State 12 cc
      pediatric ventricular assist device.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices are a commonly used heart failure therapy for adult
      patients as bridge-to-transplant or bridge-to-recovery tools. The application of 
      adult ventricular assist devices in pediatric patients has led to increased
      thrombotic events. Therefore, we have been developing a pediatric ventricular
      assist device (PVAD), the Penn State 12 cc PVAD. It is designed for patients with
      a body weight of 5-15 kg and has a stroke volume of 12 cc. Clot formation is the 
      major concern. It is correlated to the coagulability of blood, the blood
      contacting materials and the fluid dynamics within the system. The intent is for 
      the PVAD to be a long term therapy. Therefore, the system may be oriented in
      different positions according to the patient's behavior. This study evaluates for
      the first time the impact of position on the flow patterns within the Penn State 
      12 cc PVAD, which may help to improve the PVAD design concerning chamber and
      ports geometries. The fluid dynamics are visualized by particle image
      velocimetry. The evaluation is based on inlet jet behavior and calculated wall
      shear rates. Vertical and horizontal model orientations are compared, both with a
      beat rate of 75, outlet pressures of 90/60 mm Hg and a flow rate of 1.3 l/min.
      The results show a significant change of the inlet jet behavior and the
      development of a rotational flow pattern. Vertically, the inlet jet is strong
      along the wall. It initiates a rotational flow pattern with a wandering axis of
      rotation. In contrast, the horizontal model orientation results show a weaker
      inlet jet along the wall with a nearly constant center of rotation location,
      which can be correlated to a higher risk of thrombotic events. In addition, high 
      speed videography illustrates differences in the diaphragm motion during
      diastole. Diaphragm opening trajectories measurements determine no significant
      impact of the density of the blood analog fluids. Hence, the results correlate to
      human blood.

AB  - In this article, the routine postoperative care and complications of patients
      with ventricular assist devices are reviewed. Routine postoperative care
      encompasses patients who have undergone emergency ventricular assist device (VAD)
      implantation for acute cardiogenic shock, as a bridge to decision making, and
      semi-elective patients who have undergone VAD implantation for end-stage heart
      failure, either as destination therapy or as a bridge to heart transplantation.
      Early postoperative management should focus on haemodynamic optimisation,
      including fluid and inotrope therapy, VAD settings and support of right
      ventricular function. Echocardiography is an essential tool in optimising
      haemodynamics and identifying complications. Early postoperative complications
      include bleeding, arrhythmias, right ventricular failure and infection. Late
      postoperative problems include bleeding, thrombosis and thrombo-embolism, device 
      failure and psychological problems. In a small percentage of patients, weaning
      and explantation of the VAD are possible. For patients undergoing VAD
      implantation for destination therapy, end-of-life care planning should form part 
      of the multidisciplinary care of the patient.

AB  - End-stage heart failure represents a highly morbid condition for the patient with
      limited treatment options. From a surgical perspective, the treatment options for
      effective long-term survival are usually limited to heart transplantation,
      heart-lung transplantation or implantation of a destination mechanical
      circulatory support device. Assuming an advanced heart-failure patient is indeed 
      deemed a candidate for transplantation, the patient is subject to shortages in
      donor organ availability and thus possible further decompensation and potential
      death while awaiting transplantation. Various extracorporeal and implantable
      ventricular-assist devices (VADs) may be able to provide temporary or long-term
      circulatory support for many end-stage heart-failure patients but mechanical
      circulatory support options for patients requiring long-term biventricular
      support remain limited. Implantation of a total artificial heart (TAH) currently 
      represents one, if not the best, long-term surgical treatment option for patients
      requiring biventricular mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplant.
      The clinical applicability of available versions of positive displacement pumps
      is limited by their size and complications. Application of continuous-flow
      technology can help in solving some of these issues and is currently being
      applied in the research towards a new generation of smaller and more effective
      TAHs. In this review, we discuss the history of the TAH, its development and
      clinical application, implications for anaesthetic management, published outcomes
      and the future outlook for TAHs.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is defined as one of the following: hypertension,
      congestive heart failure (HF), stroke, coronary heart disease and congenital
      heart defects. CVD is the main cause of the disease burden (illness and death) in
      Europe (23% of all the disease burdens) and the second main cause of the disease 
      burden in those European Union (EU) countries with very low child and adult
      mortality (17%).(1) Heart disease is a common health problem worldwide. According
      to the most recent Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2011 update,(2) greater
      than 82 000 000 adults living in the United States of America (USA) have one or
      more types of CVD. Many resources have been invested in attempting to understand 
      and curtail the progression of congestive HF. This article attempts to address
      the growing concern over HF by looking at the epidemiology, pathophysiology and
      available therapies as anaesthesiologists encounter these patients more often
      nowadays in the operating room and intensive care units. Mechanical circulatory
      assistance and heart transplantation are two established treatment methods for
      end-stage HF. In this review, we also address the indications and
      contraindications for mechanical circulatory assistance, types and spectrum of
      available ventricular assist devices, efficacy, safety and cost analysis of
      circulatory support therapy.

TI  - The development and evaluation of a competency-based program for patients with a 
      ventricular assist device.
PG  - 18-23
AB  - The ventricular assist device (VAD) is a mechanical device that is used to
      provide long term support either as a bridge or as an alternative to
      transplantation for patients suffering from end stage heart failure. While in
      hospital, patients with a VAD have traditionally been taught by an educator nurse
      with VAD expertise in preparation for discharge. In 2004, our centre implemented 
      a successful competency-based patient education program in post-heart transplant 
      patients and thought that a similar program may provide increased confidence for 
      bedside nurses to actively participate in VAD patient education prior to
      discharge. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to create a
      competency-based education program that would provide consistency in patient
      teaching. A questionnaire was developed and completed by 13 bedside nurses. This 
      pre-test questionnaire indicated the need for a systematic and organized approach
      to VAD patient teaching. Furthermore, adequate resources, consistency in teaching
      methods, and feedback were seen to be essential. A pilot competency-based program
      was designed to lead bedside nurses and patients through a series of learning
      phases and has successfully been implemented. Since its implementation, the
      questionnaire has been repeated with results reflecting satisfaction with the
      revised competency-based program. Our findings and evaluation of the program
      through pre- and post-testing reflect an increase in organization in our teaching
      methods and has led to improved confidence and satisfaction for bedside nurses
      using this program. By redeveloping the current method of VAD education, our goal
      has been to improve the ways in which we deliver teaching to our patients. It is 
      thought that, as with our experience in the post-heart transplant population,
      bedside nurses and team members will feel more empowered to provide teaching to
      patients with a VAD.

TI  - Is mechanically bridging patients with a failing cardiac graft to
      retransplantation an effective therapy? Analysis of the United Network of Organ
      Sharing database.
PG  - 1192-8
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.07.004 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of bridging patients with cardiac allograft failure to
      retransplantation (ReTx) with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) have not been 
      well studied. The United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to
      analyze outcomes of patients successfully bridged with MCS to cardiac ReTx.
      METHODS: Of 1,690 cardiac ReTx identified in the UNOS database from October 1987 
      to July 2011, 149 (8.8%) were bridged to ReTx with MCS. RESULTS: Patients bridged
      to ReTx with MCS had a poorer survival than patients not bridged (p < 0.0001).
      ReTx after ventricular assist device (VAD) support had better survival than ReTx 
      after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; half-life, 3.9 years vs 61 days,
      p = 0.026). For patients bridged to ReTx, graft survival was 40% for ReTx within 
      1 year of primary Tx vs 64% (p = 0.003). When ReTx was performed 1 year after
      cardiac Tx, survival was similar in patients bridged with a VAD and those not
      bridged (mean, 7.5 vs 8.7 years; p = 0.8). Survival for patients bridged to ReTx 
      with ECMO was consistently worse (p </= 0.05) in all analyses. The 1-year
      survival of ReTx after VAD performed in 2003 to 2011 (67%) was better than in the
      earlier era of 1987 to 2002 (37%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Bridging patients to
      ReTx with ECMO at any time is not advisable. Bridging patients with MCS to ReTx
      within 1 year of primary cardiac Tx is not advisable. Survival after ReTx for
      patients bridged by VAD has improved considerably over time. Patients who survive
      the first year after cardiac Tx can be bridged by VAD to ReTx with an expectation
      that outcomes can be similar to ReTx patients who did not require MCS.

AB  - The field of heart transplantation has seen significant progress in the past 40
      years. However, the breakthroughs in long-term outcome have seen stagnation in
      the past decade. Through advances in genomics and transcriptomics, there is hope 
      that an era of personalized transplant therapy lies in the future. To see where
      heart transplantation truly fits into the long term, searching for and
      understanding the alternative approaches for heart failure therapy is both
      important and inevitable. The application of mechanical circulatory support has
      contributed to the largest advancement in treatment of end stage heart failure.
      It has already been approved for destination therapy of heart failure, and
      greater portability and ease of use of the device will be the future trend.
      Although it is still not prime time for stem cell therapy, clinical experiences
      have already suggested its potential therapeutic effects. And finally, whole
      organ engineering is on the horizon as new techniques have opened the way for
      this to proceed. In the end, progress on alternative therapies largely depends on
      our deeper understanding of the mechanisms of heart failure and how to prevent
      it.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is increasing worldwide and represents a major burden in terms
      of health care resources and costs. Despite advances in medical care, prognosis
      with HF remains poor, especially in advanced stages. The large patient population
      with advanced HF and the limited number of donor organs stimulated the
      development of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices as a bridge to
      transplant and for destination therapy. However, MCS devices require a major
      operative intervention, cardiopulmonary bypass, and blood component exposure,
      which have been associated with significant adverse event rates, and long
      recovery periods. Miniaturization of MCS devices and the development of an
      efficient and reliable transcutaneous energy transfer system may provide the
      vehicle to overcome these limitations and usher in a new clinical paradigm in
      heart failure therapy by enabling less invasive beating heart surgical procedures
      for implantation, reduce cost, and improve patient outcomes and quality of life. 
      Further, it is anticipated that future ventricular assist device technology will 
      allow for a much wider application of the therapy in the treatment of heart
      failure including its use for myocardial recovery and as a platform for support
      for cell therapy in addition to permanent long-term support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Options for mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to heart
      transplantation in children with severe heart failure are limited. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective, single-group trial of a ventricular assist device
      designed specifically for children as a bridge to heart transplantation. Patients
      16 years of age or younger were divided into two cohorts according to
      body-surface area (cohort 1, <0.7 m(2); cohort 2, 0.7 to <1.5 m(2)), with 24
      patients in each group. Survival in the two cohorts receiving mechanical support 
      (with data censored at the time of transplantation or weaning from the device
      owing to recovery) was compared with survival in two propensity-score-matched
      historical control groups (one for each cohort) undergoing extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO). RESULTS: For participants in cohort 1, the median
      survival time had not been reached at 174 days, whereas in the matched ECMO
      group, the median survival was 13 days (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). For
      participants in cohort 2 and the matched ECMO group, the median survival was 144 
      days and 10 days, respectively (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). Serious adverse
      events in cohort 1 and cohort 2 included major bleeding (in 42% and 50% of
      patients, respectively), infection (in 63% and 50%), and stroke (in 29% and 29%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our trial showed that survival rates were significantly higher with 
      the ventricular assist device than with ECMO. Serious adverse events, including
      infection, stroke, and bleeding, occurred in a majority of study participants.

TI  - Renal replacement therapy in congestive heart failure requiring left ventricular 
      assist device augmentation.
PG  - 386-92
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076 [doi]
AB  - "Cardiorenal syndrome" is a term used to describe a dys-regulation of the heart
      affecting the kidneys, or vice versa, in an acute or chronic manner (1,2). Renal 
      impairment can range from reversible ischemic damage to renal failure requiring
      short- or long-term renal replacement therapy (2). Patients who require
      mechanical circulatory support, such as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), 
      as definitive treatment for congestive heart failure or as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation pose a unique challenge with respect to receiving dialysis,
      because they experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality from infection in
      the post-LVAD period (3-7). Acute dialysis access can pose an increased infection
      risk. In this article, we present a patient who required renal replacement
      therapy and a LVAD for management of acute-on-chronic cardiorenal syndrome while 
      awaiting heart transplantation. A literature review to determine whether
      peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is superior for patients with profound
      hemodynamic dysfunction and the need to minimize risk of infection did not offer 
      clear guidance about which modality is superior in patients with advanced
      congestive heart failure. However, there is clear evidence of the superiority of 
      peritoneal dialysis in reducing the risk of systemic infection secondary to acute
      dialysis access. Given the high risk of LVAD infection, we therefore conclude
      that, to decrease mortality secondary to systemic infection, peritoneal dialysis 
      should strongly be considered in patients who require renal replacement therapy
      before or after LVAD placement.

TI  - Outcomes of HeartWare Ventricular Assist System support in 141 patients: a
      single-centre experience.
PG  - 139-45
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs263 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A third-generation ventricular assist device, the HeartWare
      Ventricular Assist System, has demonstrated its reliability and durability in
      animal models and clinical experience. However, studies of a large series of
      applications are still lacking. We evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      HeartWare pump in 141 patients with end-stage heart failure at a single centre.
      METHODS: A total of 141 patients (116 men and 25 women with a mean age of 52
      years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV received implantation of the
      HeartWare Ventricular Assist System between August 2009 and April 2011 at the
      Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin. The outcomes were measured in terms of laboratory
      data, adverse events, NYHA functional class and survival during device support.
      RESULTS: The HeartWare system provided an adequate haemodynamic support for
      patients both inside and outside the hospital. NYHA class improved to I-II. Organ
      function and pulmonary vascular resistance improved significantly. In this cohort
      of patients, 14 patients underwent heart transplantation, one had had the device 
      explanted following myocardial recovery, one had changed to another assist
      device, 81 were on ongoing support and 44 died. The overall actuarial survival
      rates at 6 and 12 months were 70 and 67%, respectively, and the 3-, 6- and
      12-month survival rates on a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support for
      bridge to transplantation patients were 82, 81 and 79%, respectively. Infection
      and bleeding were the main adverse events. Four patients underwent an LVAD
      exchange for pump thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The HeartWare system provides a safe
      and effective circulatory support in a population with a wide range of body
      surface areas, with a satisfactory actuarial survival time and an improved
      quality of life. It can be used for univentricular or biventricular support,
      being implanted into the pericardial space with simplified surgical techniques.

TI  - Should patients 60 years and older undergo bridge to transplantation with
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are now commonly
      used as a bridge to orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), the upper patient age
      limit for this therapy has not been defined. Smaller studies have suggested that 
      advanced age should not be a contraindication to bridge to transplantation (BTT) 
      LVAD placement. The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes in patients 60 
      years and older undergoing BTT with continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: The United
      Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was reviewed to identify first-time OHT
      recipients 60 years of age and older (2005-2010). Patients were stratified by
      preoperative support: continuous-flow LVAD, intravenous inotropic agents, and
      direct transplantation. Survival after OHT was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier
      method. All-cause mortality was examined using multivariable Cox proportional
      hazard regression. RESULTS: Of 2,554 patients, 1,142 (44.7%) underwent direct
      transplantation, 264 (10.3%) had LVAD BTT, and 1,148 (45.0%) had BTT with
      inotropic agents. The mean age was 64+/-3 years, and 460 (18.0%) patients were
      women. Mean follow-up was 29+/-19 months. Survival differed significantly among
      the 3 groups. Patients with LVAD BTT had significantly lower survival after OHT
      compared with the other groups at 30 days and 1 year. This survival difference
      was no longer significant at 2 years after OHT or when deaths in the first 30
      days were censored. LVAD BTT increased the hazard of death at 1 year by 50%
      (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.15; p=0.03),
      compared with patients who underwent direct transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study represents the largest modern cohort in which survival after OHT has been
      evaluated in patients 60 years or older who received BTT. Older patients have
      lower short-term survival after OHT when BTT is carried out with a
      continuous-flow LVAD compared with inotropic agents or direct transplantation.

AB  - We present the case of a 46-year old male with end-stage heart failure due to
      ethyltoxic cardiomyopathy. The patient did not meet the criteria for heart
      transplantation and declined left ventricular assist device implantation. We
      decided to conduct cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D)
      implantation. Under general anaesthesia for CRT-D implantation, cardiac function 
      worsened. Due to deteriorating haemodynamics, CRT-D implantation was aborted and 
      emergent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) implantation
      was performed. Subsequent weaning from ECMO was not possible. We decided to
      proceed with CRT-D implantation while still on ECMO support. With biventricular
      stimulation, cardiac function improved promptly and the patient could be weaned
      from ECMO the same day.

PG  - 859-67
LID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2012.01485.x [doi]
AB  - Long-term rotary left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly
      employed to bridge patients with end-stage heart failure to transplant or as a
      destination therapy. Significant recent device development has increased patient 
      support times, shifting further development focus toward physiologically
      sensitive control of the pump operation. Sensorless control of these devices
      would benefit from increased observability of the ventricular volume/preload to
      the pump, in order to regulate flow based on preload, imitating the native
      Frank-Starling flow control. Monitoring the transmitted flow pulse through the
      pump has been used as a surrogate for preload, although means of maximizing its
      transmission are not clear. However, it is known that a flat hydraulic
      performance curve of the rotary pump induces high changes in flow for a given
      change in pressure head. The aim of this study was to determine geometric pump
      parameters responsible for increasing this flow pulse transmission and to
      demonstrate this increase in vitro. The sensitivity of the performance gradient
      to blade angles, blade heights, blade clearance, and channel areas were studied. 
      Resulting pressure head, flow, and hydraulic efficiency were analyzed with
      respect to textbook designed procedures. Then pumps with comparably "flat" and
      "steep" performance curves were used to simulate LVAD support in vitro over a
      range of pump flow rates to observe the transmitted flow pulsatility. It was
      found that an outlet blade angle of 90 degrees , inlet blade angle between 25 and
      45 degrees , and large throat area generated a "flatter" performance curve. The
      transmitted flow pulsatility through a pump with a flat performance curve was 68%
      higher than that of a steep performance curve at a flow rate of 5 L/min.
      Substantial gains in the observability of LVAD preload/resident blood volume in
      the ventricle exist through the careful selection of specific pump geometries.

TI  - Evaluation of changes in quality of life among Turkish patients undergoing
      ventricular assist device implantation.
PG  - 1735-7
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.05.031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist device (VAD) application has become an
      increasingly common method to treatment end-stage heart failure. In this study we
      evaluated the effect of VAD implantation upon the quality of life among Turkish
      patients with end-stage heart failure. METHODS: Twenty-eight VAD implantation
      patients included 3 (10.7%) with biventricular support using the Berlin Heart
      Excor; 15 (53.6%), left ventricular support with the Berlin Heart Excor; and 10
      (35.7%), Heartware implantation for left ventricular support. The Minnesota
      Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health 
      Questionnaire were used to assess changes in the quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: 
      Of the 28 patients, 2 were females (7.1%) and 26 were males (92.9%) of overall
      mean age of 44.6 +/- 15.3 years (range, 8-66). Preoperative mean score of MLHFQ
      was significantly improved at 200.4 +/- 147.4 days follow-up (72.8 +/- 11.5 vs
      13.7 +/- 10.5; P < .05). SF-36 physical scores and mental scores were improved
      postoperatively (physical scores, 20.0 +/- 24.4 vs 70.2 +/- 19.9; mental scores, 
      38.4 +/- 18.8 vs 73.9 +/- 15.7; P < .05). No significant relation was observed
      between the postoperative scores of questionnaires and type of surgery. More
      improvement in postoperative MLHFQ scores was seen in patients younger than 45
      years of age (P = .027). The severity of chronic heart failure (CHF) regressed
      from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV to NYHA class II in 26 and to
      NYHA class III in 2 patients (P = .000). CONCLUSION: The QOL among patients with 
      end-stage heart failure improved dramatically soon after VAD implantation.

PG  - 1732-4
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.05.044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased experience and success with ventricular assist devices
      (VAD) has permitted more aggressive use in patients formerly believed to be
      inappropriate for mechanical circulatory support (MCS). There is no clearly
      proven policy to manage end-stage heart failure patients with valvular
      pathologies. The aim of this report was to analysis our experience with combined 
      approach of VAD implantation and valvular procedures among patients with valvular
      heart disease and end-stage heart failure. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical
      records of 67 patients who underwent MCS from April 2007 to September 2011. We
      identified 12 patients (17.9%) who received concomitant valvular procedures, four
      of whom had significant aortic insufficiency and received a simple coaptation
      stitch at the center to approximate the fibrous nodules of Arantius. The
      mechanical aortic valve was replaced with a stentless bioprosthesis in three
      patients. Mitral valve commissurotomy was performed in one patient with mitral
      stenosis and seven patients underwent tricuspit valve repair using an
      annuloplasty ring. RESULTS: All 12 patients were males, of mean age 50.3 +/- 11.5
      years (range = 25-66). Eleven of them (91.6%) survived the early and late
      postoperative periods. Ten subjects (83.3%) continue to be supported with VAD; 1 
      (8.3%) was successfully bridged to transplantation. Each study participant
      regression of the valvular pathologies by early echocardiography demonstrated.
      CONCLUSION: Concomitant valve surgery during VAD implantation appeared to be a
      reasonable option in end-stage heart failure patients with valvular heart
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a serious disease ending with death if untreated.
      Although heart transplantation is the best therapy for end-stage heart failure,
      most candidates die in the waiting period due to the lack of donor organs. This
      condition represent a new era of heart failure surgery. METHODS: We
      retrospectively investigated 159 patients from 1998 to 2011 with a mean age of
      40.0 years (range = 5-65), who were mostly diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy (n
      = 113). After April 2007, 67 patients underwent vascular assist device (VAD)
      implantation surgery for acute or chronic end-stage heart failure. We performed
      69 heart transplantation with 27 on VAD systems before transplantation. RESULTS: 
      Early mortality was 13.3% with 21 patients after the heart transplantation. The
      67 patients supported with VAD did not experience an intraoperative death. The
      mean support time was 214 days (range = 3-1035). Twenty-four patients (35.8%) are
      still on pump support. The overall survival until transplantation or weaning was 
      77.6% at mean of 250.7 days survival reached 90% with Heartware (Hartware Inc,
      Miramar, Fla, USA) continuous flow pumps. CONCLUSION: After the introduction of
      VAD in 2007, the overall picture has been restructured radically for heart
      failure surgery, reducing patient loss on the waiting list. Especially, since
      2009 nearly 80% of donor hearts were used for patients on mechanical circulatory 
      support.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Through the new developments in medicine, heart failure therapy has
      advanced to mechanical circulatory support systems. The HeartWare Ventricular
      Assist System HVAD; HeartWare, Inc.; Miramar, Fla, USA) is a new device that is a
      centrifugal, intracorporeal, miniaturized and continuous flow pump that serves
      simple patient use and enhanced life quality. This article reports the midterm
      results of patients who underwent the heartware support system. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We retrospectively compiled our data from December 2010, including 10
      patients of mean age 51.8 years with 90% males, 70% of the overall patient cohort
      had dilated cardiomyopathy and remaining ones, ischemic disease. Mean left
      ventricular ejection fraction was 20.1% and mean systolic pulmonary artery
      pressure was 49.2 mm Hg. A single patient was grade 1; seven were grade 2; and
      remaining ones, grade 3 according to the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) scale. All patients were operated with
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with moderate hypothermia. Tricuspid ring
      annuloplasty was performed in 3 (30%) patients. In one patient we removed a left 
      ventricular thrombus. In a case with severe aortic regurgitation, we placed a
      simple coaptation stitch at the central portion of the three aortic cusps under
      the aortic cross clamp. The mean CPB duration was 95.5 minutes. RESULTS: There
      was no operative or in-hospital mortality. Mean support time was 250.67 days.
      During the early postoperative period, one patient experienced a minor
      hemorrhagic neurological event also requiring a tracheostomy due to pneumonia.
      This patient has completely healed and on follow-up continues a normal life. All 
      patients were asymptomatic regarding heart failure. One patient unfortunately
      died because of possible pancreatic cancer and sepsis. Two patients underwent
      transplantations on days 159 and 172 of support. CONCLUSION: The HVAD system
      provided effective circulatory support for patients with end-stage heart failure 
      with low adverse event rates. Long-term results are needed particularly for
      destination therapy candidates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular assist devices (VAD) are an important therapy that saves
      the lives of candidates a waiting heart transplantation (HTx). However, there are
      questions about posttransplantation effects of VADs. METHODS: Seventy-four
      patients with end-stage heart failure who underwent HTx in our clinic between
      February 2007 and July 2011 were divided into two groups; a bridge cohort (n =
      28) and a nonbridge group comprising 46 who underwent HTx without mechanical
      circulatory support. There mean ages were 39.89 +/- 15.66 and 38.33 +/- 16.23
      years respectively. Significantly more patients in the bridge group, were man
      displayed anemia, were treated with anticoagulation therapy, and underwent a
      resternotomy. In the nonbridge group, more patients needed preoperative inotropic
      support. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative
      renal failure (P = .007, odds ratio [OR] 27) and inotropic support (P = .006, OR:
      10,222) as well as longer cardiopulmonary bypasses (>/= 130 minutes, P = .001,
      OR: 11,24) to be risk factors for in-hospital mortality, which was 15.2% in
      nonbridge and 10.7% in bridge subjects, P = .733). Major adverse events, such as 
      renal failure, pulmonary failure, right ventricular failure, neurological event, 
      and reoperation due to bleeding, shown similar incidences between the groups. The
      amount of blood transfusion was significantly higher in the bridge group (2.34 U 
      versus 3.56 U, P = .037). The preoperative incidence of human leukocyte antigen
      sensitization (panel reactive antibody >/= 10%) and grade 2R were rejection
      episodes in the early period were similar. CONCLUSION: Early posttransplant
      results were not adversely or beneficially influenced by the use of VADs. Similar
      to other types of cardiac surgery, a patients preoperative condition seemed to be
      the major factor affecting mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to demonstrate the enhancement of human
      cardiac progenitor cell (hCPC) reparative and regenerative potential by genetic
      modification for the treatment of myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: Regenerative
      potential of stem cells to repair acute infarction is limited. Improved hCPC
      survival, proliferation, and differentiation into functional myocardium will
      increase efficacy and advance translational implementation of cardiac
      regeneration. METHODS: hCPCs isolated from the myocardium of heart failure
      patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation were engineered
      to express green fluorescent protein (hCPCe) or Pim-1-GFP (hCPCeP). Functional
      tests of hCPC regenerative potential were performed with immunocompromised mice
      by using intramyocardial adoptive transfer injection after infarction. Myocardial
      structure and function were monitored by echocardiographic and hemodynamic
      assessment for 20 weeks after delivery. hCPCe and hCPCeP expressing luciferase
      were observed by using bioluminescence imaging to noninvasively track
      persistence. RESULTS: hCPCeP exhibited augmentation of reparative potential
      relative to hCPCe control cells, as shown by significantly increased
      proliferation coupled with amelioration of infarction injury and increased
      hemodynamic performance at 20 weeks post-transplantation. Concurrent with
      enhanced cardiac structure and function, hCPCeP demonstrated increased cellular
      engraftment and differentiation with improved vasculature and reduced infarct
      size. Enhanced persistence of hCPCeP versus hCPCe was revealed by bioluminescence
      imaging at up to 8 weeks post-delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic engineering of hCPCs
      with Pim-1 enhanced repair of damaged myocardium. Ex vivo gene delivery to modify
      stem cells has emerged as a viable option addressing current limitations in the
      field. This study demonstrates that efficacy of hCPCs from the failing myocardium
      can be safely and significantly enhanced through expression of Pim-1 kinase,
      setting the stage for use of engineered cells in pre-clinical settings.

AB  - The end-stage cardiomyopathy is an increasing worldwide problem. Cardiac
      transplantation lacks sufficient donors to treat all patients, and there is thus 
      debate about alternative strategies. The use of left ventricular assist devices
      for long-term support is increasing with a positive impact on patient survival.
      Although there is an ongoing debate regarding the risks and benefits of
      maintaining pulsatile flow during long-term ventricular assist device support,
      there has been a significant move towards implantation of continuous flow devices
      due to the lower surgical morbidity and better long-term reliability of these
      pumps. The following is a review of the literature on continuous and pulsatile
      flow for long-term support. Starting from the definition of flow, we analyze the 
      current evidence and consider gastrointestinal complications.

      for pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) guided therapy. METHODS: Thirty patients
      admitted to an ICU for PAC guided HF therapy were enrolled; concentrations of
      soluble ST2 (sST2), highly sensitive troponin I, an experimental ultrasensitive
      troponin I, amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, cystatin C, and
      myeloperoxidase were measured over the first 48 hours. Outcomes included response
      of filling pressures and hemodynamics to tailored therapy and 90-day event-free
      survival (death, left ventricular assist device implantation, transplant).
      RESULTS: Of the biomarkers evaluated, only sST2 concentrations were higher in
      those who failed to achieve goals for central venous pressure ((CVP), 225.3
      versus 104.6 ng/mL; P = 0.003) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ((PCWP),
      181.7 versus 88.2 ng/mL; P = 0.05). Only sST2 concentrations were associated with
      adverse events (186.7 versus 92.2 ng/mL; P = 0.01). In age-adjusted Cox
      proportional hazards analysis, an elevated sST2 during the first 48 hours
      following ICU admission independently predicted 90-day outcomes (Hazard Ratio =
      5.53; P = 0.03) superior to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score for this
      application; in Kaplan-Meier analysis the risk associated with elevated sST2
      concentrations was present early and sustained through the duration of follow-up 
      (log rank P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing HF therapy guided by
      invasive monitoring, sST2 concentrations were associated with impending failure
      to reduce filling pressures and predicted impending events. Elevated sST2 values 
      early in the ICU course theoretically could assist therapeutic decision-making in
      advanced stage HF patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Are blood stream infections associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic
      stroke in patients with a left ventricular assist device?
PG  - 509-13

AB  - Blood stream infections (BSIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality 
      in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). The aim of this study
      was to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
      and BSI after implantation of LVAD for advanced heart failure (HF). This was a
      retrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage HF, who underwent 
      implantation of HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD over a 4 year period. Blood
      stream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspected
      neurological complications including CVAs were confirmed by neuroimaging.
      Extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristics
      were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The mean age of our study
      population was 62.3 +/- 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males
      (n = 75, 86.2%). The baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients
      with and without CVAs. Patients with BSI had a much greater incidence of CVA
      compared to patients without BSI (n = 13, 43.3% vs. n = 5, 10.0%; p < 0.0001).
      There was an increased mortality in patients with BSI than those without (n = 57,
      65.5% vs. n = 30, 34.5%; p = 0.003). The risk of all CVAs (hemorrhagic/ischemic) 
      was eightfold (odds ratio [OR] = 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4-25.5; p 
      = 0.001] in patients with BSI. Patients with BSI had a >20-fold risk of
      hemorrhagic CVA (OR = 24; 95% CI = 2.8-201.1; p = 0.03). Advanced HF patients
      with LVAD support who developed BSI need urgent evaluation and close monitoring
      for suspected neurological complications, particularly hemorrhagic CVA.

TI  - Driveline infections in left ventricular assist devices: implications for
      destination therapy.
PG  - 1381-6
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.05.074 [doi]
LID - S0003-4975(12)01233-7 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection is one of the major limitations to successful long-term
      support after ventricular assist device implantation. There are limited data
      specifically examining the incidence and predictors of driveline infections
      (DLI), with a changing treatment paradigm toward destination therapy (DT) and
      longer duration of support. METHODS: Between January 2007 and 2011, 143 patients 
      underwent HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) implantation, with 87 (61%) as 
      DT. Driveline maintenance strategy included sterile dressing changes with
      chlorhexidine and saline application, without prophylactic oral antibiotics.
      RESULTS: DLI developed in 18 patients (12%) at a median of 182 days (range, 26 to
      1,138 days) after implantation, among which 12 (66%) were from the DT cohort.
      Infections were superficial in 15 (82%) and deep in 3 (18%). Trauma was
      documented in 6 patients (33%). Seven patients (38%) needed readmission for DLI. 
      Surgical debridement was needed in 3 (17%). All patients were managed
      successfully, without the need for device explantation or urgent cardiac
      transplantation. No patient required continuous antibiotic prophylaxis after the 
      infection subsided. Risk factor analysis identified duration of support as the
      only independent predictor of infection (mean. 600 vs 390 days; p = 0.03). The
      odds of having a DLI rose by 4% for every month of support. CONCLUSIONS: Longer
      duration of support significantly increased the risk of DLI and hence increased
      the risk of DLI in patients with DT. DLI may be successfully managed with
      antibiotics and local wound care. Most of the infections were superficial, and
      progression to deep pocket or pump infection is rare in our experience.

AB  - Despite many advances in the management of patients with heart failure, acute
      cardiogenic shock and progressive congestive heart failure remain serious
      problems with dismal prognoses. Both temporary and permanent mechanical support
      has been gaining wide clinical application in this patient population. Although
      mechanical circulatory support technology is rapidly evolving, this approach is
      associated with multiple issues such as the optimal duration of temporary
      support, ideal timing to bridge these patients to a long-term device, and
      selection of the right device for the right patient. The currently available
      devices are categorized into two major groups: temporary and long-term devices
      (including destination therapy). Heart failure is a dynamic condition, and the
      therapeutic approach may need to be modified depending on the patient's
      condition. Furthermore, the patient's preexisting morbidity, age, socioeconomic
      status, and family support are confounding factors that need to be considered
      when making such decisions. Clinical trials including prospective studies, as
      well as meticulous analysis of existing data, may help develop universal
      guidelines to select the right device. This manuscript will review the most
      widely used ventricular assist devices.

AB  - The number of children and adolescents suffering from heart failure is increasing
      dramatically. Some of these patients will progress to need advanced therapies in 
      the form of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Over the past few years,
      increased attention has been focused on clinical use of existing devices as well 
      the development of pediatric-specific ventricular assist devices (VADs). As in
      adult populations, these devices offer unique opportunities to successfully
      support children as a bridge-to-transplant, but increasing data suggest that
      bridge-to-recovery and bridge-to-destination are also viable options in select
      pediatric populations. Herein, we will review existing approaches as well
      describe future potential MCS options.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the HeartWare left
      ventricular assist device (HVAD) (HeartWare International, Inc, Framingham, MA)
      on hemodynamics, ventricular function, and exercise capacity. Between July 2009
      and March 2011, 46 patients with advanced heart failure had implantation of the
      HVAD. Of these patients, 30 had subsequent assessments for transplantation and
      these patients formed the study cohort. Thirty patients had assessments at a mean
      of 201+/-86 days and 13 went on to have a second assessment at 351+/-86 days.
      There were marked improvements in hemodynamics and exercise capacity at both
      assessments, with significant decreases in right and left heart filling
      pressures; increases in cardiac index, New York Heart Association class, and peak
      exercise oxygen consumption; and reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (all 
      P<.05). Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were unchanged
      at the first assessment, although there was a significant reduction in
      end-diastolic diameter at the second assessment (P<.01). There were no
      significant changes in a visual grade of right ventricular function. After up to 
      1 year of support, the HVAD system results in significant benefits in overall
      heart failure status, with improved hemodynamics and exercise capacity. This
      occurs in the absence of marked changes in left ventricular size or right
      ventricular function.

TI  - Long-term mechanical circulatory support (destination therapy): on track to
      compete with heart transplantation?
PG  - 584-603; discussion 597-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.05.044 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Average 2-year survival after cardiac transplantation is
      approximately 80%. The evolution and subsequent approval of larger pulsatile and,
      more recently, continuous flow mechanical circulatory support (MCS) technology
      for destination therapy (DT) offers the potential for triage of some patients
      awaiting cardiac transplantation to DT. METHODS: The National Heart, Lung, and
      Blood Institute Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
      Support (INTERMACS) is a national multi-institutional study of long-term MCS.
      Between June 2006 and December 2011, 127 pulsatile and 1160 continuous flow pumps
      (24% of total primary left ventricular assist devices [LVADs]) carried an initial
      strategy of DT therapy. RESULTS: By multivariable analysis, risk factors (P <
      .05) for mortality after DT included older age, larger body mass index, history
      of cancer, history of cardiac surgery, INTERMACS level I (cardiogenic shock),
      dialysis, increased blood urea nitrogen, use of a pulsatile flow device, and use 
      of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD). Among patients with a continuous
      flow LVAD who were not in cardiogenic shock, a particularly favorable survival
      was associated with no cancer, patients not in cardiogenic shock, and blood urea 
      nitrogen less than 50 mg/dL, resulting in 1- and 2-year survivals of 88% and 80%.
      CONCLUSIONS: (1) Evolution from pulsatile to continuous flow technology has
      dramatically improved 1- and 2-year survivals; (2) DT is not appropriate for
      patients with rapid hemodynamic deterioration or severe right ventricular
      failure; (3) important subsets of patients with continuous flow DT now enjoy
      survival that is competitive with heart transplantation out to about 2 years.

AB  - VADs have been used to provide treatment for end-stage heart failure. Parents may
      feel overwhelmed with the VAD regimes responsibility and be affected from this
      process beside children. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the depressive and
      anxiety symptoms of mothers of the first eight children equipped with a VAD in
      Turkey. The mothers of eight pediatric patients living with VADs were filled BDI 
      and STAI at first month of VAD implantation (E.I) and secondly six months after
      their first evaluation (E.II). In E.I, the BDI mean score of mothers was 20.87,
      in E.II 14.37. STAI-S mean score was 53.37 in E.I and 43.62 in E.II. The Wilcoxon
      nonparametric-paired t-test revealed significant difference between baseline and 
      end-point STAI-S scores (Z: -2.035; p: 0.042), and for BDI scores (Z, -1.965; p, 
      0.049). Prolonged usage of VAD may increase distress in parents. Psychiatric
      evaluation and support of the primary caregiver is important for the well-being
      of the pediatric patients.

AB  - End-stage cardiac failure where appropriate is best treated with cardiac
      transplantation. With improvements in medical therapy, the emergence of primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention, and an increasingly ageing population,
      patients with right, left or biventricular failure, who are not suitable for
      cardiac transplantation or long-term ventricular assist device therapy, present
      for cardiac surgery. The modern cardiac surgeon needs to have a safe strategy for
      dealing with these complex cases. We report two cases that illustrate simple and 
      safe cannulation techniques for temporary left and right ventricular failure.

PG  - 831-8
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.04.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies have identified risk factors for survival in patients
      with end-stage heart failure (HF) requiring left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      support. However, patients with biventricular HF may represent a unique cohort.
      METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 113 adult,
      end-stage HF patients at University of California Los Angeles Medical Center who 
      required BIVAD support between 2000 and 2009. RESULTS: Survival to transplant was
      66.4%, with 1-year actuarial survival of 62.8%. All patients were Interagency
      Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Level 1 or 2
      and received Thoratec (Pleasanton, CA) paracorporeal BIVAD as a bridge to
      transplant. Univariate analyses showed dialysis use, ventilator use,
      extracorporal membrane oxygenation use, low cardiac output, preserved LV ejection
      fraction (restrictive physiology), normal-to-high sodium, low platelet count, low
      total cholesterol, low high-density and high-density lipoprotein, low albumin,
      and elevated aspartate aminotransferase were associated with increased risk of
      death. We generated a scoring system for survival to transplant. Our final model,
      with age, sex, dialysis, cholesterol, ventilator, and albumin, gave a C-statistic
      of 0.870. A simplified system preserved a C-statistic of 0.844. Patients were
      divided into high-risk or highest-risk groups (median respective survival, 367
      and 17 days), with strong discrimination between groups for death. CONCLUSIONS:
      We have generated a scoring system that offers high prognostic ability for
      patients requiring BIVAD support and hope that it may assist in clinical decision
      making. Further studies are needed to prospectively validate our scoring system.

      Failure Model in a transplant referral population.
PG  - 817-24
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.04.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we investigated whether the addition of peak oxygen
      consumption (VO(2)) improves the predictive accuracy of the Seattle Heart Failure
      Model (SHFM). The SHFM is a validated multivariate risk model that uses NYHA
      classification to assess functional capacity rather than peak oxygen consumption 
      (VO(2)). METHODS: Outpatients (n = 1,240) evaluated for transplant at three
      centers had their SHFM score calculated and peak VO(2) measured. The outcomes
      assessed were death/LVAD/urgent transplant with censoring at the time of elective
      transplant. RESULTS: Over the course of 4.0 (mean) years of observation, there
      were 571 events. Both the SHFM score (chi(2) = 227) and peak VO(2) (chi(2) = 88, 
      both p < 0.0001) were highly predictive of outcomes. The SHFM and peak VO(2) were
      modestly correlated (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate Cox model, peak
      VO(2) added to the SHFM with a hazard ratio of 0.949 (p < 0.0001) for each
      1-ml/kg/min increase. Peak VO(2) improved both the net reclassification
      improvement and integrated discrimination index (both p </= 0.0002). Peak VO(2)
      provided additive prognostic information within each SHFM score (p < 0.05). The
      1-year areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were obtained for 
      peak VO(2) (0.645, 95% CI 0.606 to 0.684), SHFM (0.758, 95% CI 0.721 to 0.795)
      and SHFM with peak VO(2) (0.766, 95% CI 0.731 to 0.802). The SHFM-predicted vs
      actual survival free of LVAD/UNOS Status 1 transplant at 1 year (86% vs 83%) and 
      4 years (63% vs 63%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate SHFM is a
      powerful predictor of death/LVAD/urgent transplant. Peak VO(2) adds prognostic
      information across the spectrum of the SHFM, but changes in decision regarding
      transplant listing occur mainly in moderate-risk patients.

AB  - Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a key risk factor for heart failure. It is
      associated with increased interstitial fibrosis, cell death and cardiac
      dysfunction. The progression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy has long been
      considered as irreversible. However, recent clinical observations and
      experimental studies have produced evidence showing the reversal of pathological 
      cardiac hypertrophy. Left ventricle assist devices used in heart failure patients
      for bridging to transplantation not only improve peripheral circulation but also 
      often cause reverse remodeling of the geometry and recovery of the function of
      the heart. Dietary supplementation with physiologically relevant levels of copper
      can reverse pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Angiogenesis is essential
      and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a constitutive factor for the
      regression. The action of VEGF is mediated by VEGF receptor-1, whose activation
      is linked to cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase-1 (PKG-1) signaling pathways,
      and inhibition of cyclic GMP degradation leads to regression of pathological
      cardiac hypertrophy. Most of these pathways are regulated by hypoxia-inducible
      factor. Potential therapeutic targets for promoting the regression include:
      promotion of angiogenesis, selective enhancement of VEGF receptor-1 signaling
      pathways, stimulation of PKG-1 pathways, and sustention of hypoxia-inducible
      factor transcriptional activity. More exciting insights into the regression of
      pathological cardiac hypertrophy are emerging. The time of translating the
      concept of regression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy to clinical practice is
      coming.

AB  - We describe the case of a 35-year-old man with severe, dilated idiopathic
      cardiomyopathy who was placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation.
      While awaiting transplantation, his heart failure decompensated to such a degree 
      that left ventricular assist device support was necessary. He did well on device 
      support until a pump-pocket infection (methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative
      staphylococci) developed at 10 months. At that time, echocardiograms showed
      normal heart size and an ejection fraction of 0.45 to 0.49 without pump support. 
      The pump was, therefore, explanted emergently. The patient has remained
      clinically stable with preserved ventricular function nearly 13 years after the
      explantation procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following implantation of a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a serious condition and is associated with
      increased mortality. METHODS: The aim of the study is to investigate the
      significance of pre-existing RV dysfunction, tricuspid valve (TV) insufficiency, 
      and the severity of septal deviation following LVAD implantation on RV
      dysfunction, as well as the outcome and short-term complications in 51 patients
      from June 2006 to August 2010. Student t test was used to compare the data and
      estimate the p value. RESULTS: Mean age was 55.1 +/- 13, with a male to female
      ratio of 3.25. The 30-day mortality was 13.7% (7/51 patients), and the overall
      mortality was 23.5% (12/51 patients). Meanwhile, 21 patients (21/51; 41.2%) have 
      undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. The mean time of support was
      314.5+/-235 days with a median of 240 days at the time of closing this study.
      Echocardiographic evaluation of RV function pre- and post-implantation of an LVAD
      demonstrated septal deviation towards the left ventricle in immediate
      postoperative phase, which correlated with acute RV dysfunction (p = 0.002).
      Preoperative RV dysfunction was a significant predictor of postoperative right
      heart dysfunction following implantation of an LVAD (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION:
      Preoperative RV dysfunction is a predictor of RV failure in LVAD patients. The
      adjustment of septal deviation through gradual increase of the LVAD flow can
      prevent the acute RV dysfunction following LVAD placement.

TI  - A multi-modal intervention in management of left ventricular assist device
      outpatients: dietary counselling, controlled exercise and psychosocial support.
PG  - 1026-32
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs206 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Newer generation left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are
      established for long-term support. The aim of this multi-modal intervention was
      to improve the body weight, exercise tolerance and psychosocial status in
      outpatients on long-term LVAD support. METHODS: Seventy patients participated in 
      this non-randomized intervention study [intervention group (IGr) n = 34; control 
      group (CGr) n = 36] over 18 months (T1-T4); the baseline sample characteristics
      showed no differences between groups. Dietary counselling and weight management
      intervention was performed by a dietician based on a specific algorithm. Physical
      reconditioning followed a home ergometry protocol and was supplemented by
      psychosocial counselling. The outcomes were measured based on the body mass index
      (BMI), cardiopulmonary exercise testing and self-report [hospital anxiety and
      depression scale (HADS), SF-36]. RESULTS: The intervention showed a strong
      positive effect on nutrition and weight management [95% confidence interval (CI):
      -0.71-0.69; effect size (ES): 0.907; P = 0.02)], resulting in the normal BMI
      (kg/m(2)) values in the IGr (T1: 24.0 +/- 0.6; T4: 24.5 +/- 1.1; P = 0.35)
      compared with a significant BMI increase in the CGr (T1: 23.8 +/- 0.6; T4: 29.7
      +/- 0.8; P = 0.05). Significant differences appeared regarding exercise tolerance
      (VO(2)max/% predicted) in favour of IGr patients (IGr: 69 +/- 2.9; CGr 62 +/-
      3.7; P = 0.04). This increase was reflected by patients' self-reporting based on 
      the SF-36 physical component score (IGr: P = 0.04; CGr: P = 0.54). SF-36
      psychosocial component scores showed no changes for both groups. However, CGr
      showed a tendency for increased anxiety scores relative to their counterparts
      (IGr: 4.95 +/- 0.4; CGr: 6.6 +/- 0.9; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IGr patients showed
      a strong benefit from a multi-modal intervention, including dietary counselling, 
      controlled exercise and psychosocial support. Dietary counselling holds potential
      to prevent obesity in this patient population.

TI  - [End-stage heart failure].
PG  - 292-6
AB  - The ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure patients is cardiac
      transplantation. However, many Japanese candidates have not received its benefits
      due to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. The heart transplant waiting period 
      in Japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the Organ
      Transplantation Law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900
      days because of the increase in candidates. According to the Japanese Transplant 
      Registry, almost 90% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (BTT)
      with a ventricular assist device (VAD), and the average duration of BTT is around
      800 to 900 days. The excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in Japan even 
      with such a prolonged BTT duration with VADs is confirmation of the excellent
      clinical results of VAD support. Until April 2011, only the paracorporeal Nipro
      VAD for BTT was covered by Japanese national health insurance. Analysis of the
      clinical outcome of 303 patients who received a Nipro VAD (for left ventricular
      [LV] drainage) as BTT showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days
      (average 427 days), 72 patients (24%) received a heart transplant, and 68
      patients (22%) required ongoing VAD support. Thus the Nipro VAD is an excellent
      paracorporeal device. The 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials 
      of four types of implantable rotary blood pump LVADs (Evaheart, DuraHeart, Jarvik
      200, HeartMate II) was about 70%, which is an outstanding result of BTT using
      implantable LVADs. Only 36 patients in seven Japanese heart centers have received
      implantable LVADs, and this small number corresponds to the initial learning
      curve. Therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use of
      commercially available implantable LVADs becomes more widespread. The long
      waiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellent
      clinical outcomes of VAD therapy in Japan.

PG  - 754-63
LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs080 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The goal of the study was to examine whether resting or post-exercise
      metabolic substrate levels are associated with differential exercise performance 
      and long-term outcome in control subjects or heart failure (HF) patients with or 
      without type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty five healthy
      controls matched with 97 patients with stable advanced HF were prospectively
      enrolled. Exercise capacity, age, gender, and HF aetiology were balanced between 
      HFDM- and HFDM+ groups. Subjects underwent maximal bicycle spiroergometry with
      blood sampling to measure metabolites and neurohormones before and immediately
      after the exercise. HFDM+ patients had increased free fatty acids, glucose, and
      beta-hydroxybutyrate compared with controls. HFDM+ patients had higher baseline
      copeptin (24 +/- 16 vs. 17 +/- 13 pmol/L, P < 0.05) but otherwise showed similar 
      neurohumoral activation and exercise response to HFDM- patients. Peak oxygen
      consumption (VO(2)) was unrelated to post-exercise free fatty acids, glucose,
      lactate, or glycerol, but strongly correlated with post-exercise pyruvate (in
      all: r = 0.62, P < 0.001). During the next 17 +/- 10 months, 36% of HF patients
      experienced an adverse event (death, urgent transplantation, or assist device
      insertion). From metabolic factors, only post-exercise glucose [hazard ratio (HR)
      1.28, P = 0.04), total body fat (HR 0.58, P < 0.001), and the presence of DM (HR 
      1.98, P = 0.04) were predictive of the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception
      of pyruvate, acute changes of metabolic substrates are not related to cardiac
      performance in HF, regardless of diabetic status. Inhibition of body fat
      depletion, attenuation of stress-related hyperglycaemia, or increasing dynamics
      of plasma pyruvate may represent therapeutic targets in advanced HF.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychiatric symptoms of children equipped with a
      ventricular assist device (VAD) and follow them up for 6 months. With the
      shortage of donor hearts available for the treatment of end-stage heart failure, 
      VADs have been used to provide temporary treatment until a heart becomes
      available. VADs provide external sources of power for mechanical circulatory
      support and are capable of sustaining life over weeks and months. This study
      provides preliminary details about the psychiatric symptoms and disorders of the 
      first eight children equipped with a VAD in Turkey. METHODS: Eight pediatric
      patients who recently underwent VAD implantation, aged 1 to 16 years, were
      evaluated using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia,
      Child Behavior Checklist, Children's Depression Inventory, Beck Depression
      Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and followed up for 6
      months. RESULTS: In the first evaluation, five participants had a psychiatric
      disorder diagnosis. Two patients had adjustment disorder with depressive and
      anxiety symptoms; one had anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; and two had 
      major depressive disorder. The anxiety and depressive symptom levels in
      questionnaires were consistent with psychiatric diagnoses. Two patients had heart
      transplantation during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: To determine and treat 
      psychiatric symptoms and disorders at an earlier stage, it is important for
      children and adolescents with a VAD and those who have undergone heart
      transplantation to be evaluated by a multidisciplinary consultation liaison team 
      including psychiatrists, psychologists, consultant nurses, and counselors.

AB  - End-stage heart failure is an ever-growing and devastating disease. The median
      survival for patients with heart failure on ionotropic support alone is a meager 
      6 months. Historically, the only option for these patients was to be listed for
      heart transplantation. Out of medical necessity, the idea of left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation was born. Since their
      approval by the US FDA, LVADs have quadrupled the survival in patients with heart
      failure. The increase in survival has also been accompanied by decreased
      perioperative morbidity, better biocompatibility and longer device life over
      first-generation LVADs. Undoubtedly, LVADs have changed the landscape of heart
      failure treatment and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. In this
      review, we will highlight the landmark studies that have established LVADs as a
      therapeutic option for heart failure, as well as reviewing the current LVADs
      available and speculating on the advancements that will be made in the upcoming
      years.

TI  - Control strategies for afterload reduction with an artificial vasculature device.
PG  - 353-62
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318256bb50 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been used successfully as a bridge to
      transplant in heart failure patients by unloading ventricular volume and
      restoring the circulation. An artificial vasculature device (AVD) is being
      developed that may better facilitate myocardial recovery than VAD by controlling 
      the afterload experienced by the native heart and controlling the pulsatile
      energy entering into the arterial system from the device, potentially
      reconditioning the arterial system properties. The AVD is a valveless, 80 ml
      blood chamber with a servo-controlled pusher plate connected to the ascending
      aorta by a vascular graft. Control algorithms for the AVD were developed to
      maintain any user-defined systemic input impedance (IM) including resistance,
      elastance, and inertial components. Computer simulation and mock circulation
      models of the cardiovascular system were used to test the efficacy of two control
      strategies for the AVD: 1) average impedance position control (AIPC)-to maintain 
      an average value of resistance during left ventricular (LV) systole and 2)
      instantaneous impedance force feedback (IIFF) and position control (IIPC)-to
      maintain a desired value or profile of resistance and compliance. Computer
      simulations and mock loop tests were performed to predict resulting
      cardiovascular pressures, volumes, flows, and the resistance and compliance
      experienced by the native LV during ejection for simulated normal, failing, and
      recovering LV. These results indicate that the LV volume and pressure decreased, 
      and the LV stroke volume increased with decreasing IM, resulting in an increased 
      ejection fraction. Although the AIPC algorithm is more stable and can tolerate
      higher levels of sensor errors and noise, the IIFF and IIPC control algorithms
      are better suited to maintain any instantaneous IM or an IM profile. The
      developed AVD impedance control algorithms may be implemented with current VADs
      to promote myocardial recovery and facilitate weaning.

TI  - Use of an intrapericardial, continuous-flow, centrifugal pump in patients
      awaiting heart transplantation.
PG  - 3191-200
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.058412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemporary ventricular assist device therapy results in a high rate
      of successful heart transplantation but is associated with bleeding, infections, 
      and other complications. Further reductions in pump size, centrifugal design, and
      intrapericardial positioning may reduce complications and improve outcomes.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a small, intrapericardially positioned,
      continuous-flow centrifugal pump in patients requiring an implanted ventricular
      assist device as a bridge to heart transplantation. The course of investigational
      pump recipients was compared with that of patients implanted contemporaneously
      with commercially available devices. The primary outcome, success, was defined as
      survival on the originally implanted device, transplantation, or explantation for
      ventricular recovery at 180 days and was evaluated for both noninferiority and
      superiority. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of survival between groups 
      and functional and quality-of-life outcomes and adverse events in the
      investigational device group. A total of 140 patients received the
      investigational pump, and 499 patients received a commercially available pump
      implanted contemporaneously. Success occurred in 90.7% of investigational pump
      patients and 90.1% of controls, establishing the noninferiority of the
      investigational pump (P<0.001; 15% noninferiority margin). At 6 months, median
      6-minute walk distance improved by 128.5 m, and both disease-specific and global 
      quality-of-life scores improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: A small,
      intrapericardially positioned, continuous-flow, centrifugal pump was noninferior 
      to contemporaneously implanted, commercially available ventricular assist
      devices. Functional capacity and quality of life improved markedly, and the
      adverse event profile was favorable. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - The profile of the systemic inflammatory response in children undergoing
      ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 426-31
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivs206 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) has been used as a systemic
      inflammatory response (SIR) marker in the critical ill, including children after 
      cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have been
      increasingly used as a bridge support to heart transplantation in children. We
      aimed to examine the profiles of CRP in children receiving VAD support. METHODS: 
      Charts of 13 children receiving Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) from 2005 to 2009 were
      reviewed. The data obtained prior to and during VAD support included: CRP, white 
      blood cells, inotropes and steroid use, VAD mode and duration of VAD support. Ten
      patients received left VAD (LVAD) and 3 biventricular VAD (BiVAD). RESULTS: The
      median duration of VAD support was 59 days (ranged 3-678 days). Pre-VAD CRP was
      35 +/- 51 mg/l and increased to 109 +/- 59 mg/l on days 1-3 after the VAD
      implantation (P = 0.01), then gradually decreased to 28 +/- 28 mg/l by 4 months
      and normalized by 5 months (P < 0.0001). CRP was higher in BiVAD than in LVAD
      patients throughout the study period (P = 0.003). CRP positively correlated with 
      the doses of the epinephrine and norepinephrine and the monocyte counts, and
      negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count. The lymphocyte count was 2.5 +/-
      0.4 x 10(9)/l prior to implantation, and decreased to 2.1 +/- 1.3 x 10(9)/l on
      days 1-3 (P = 0.5) and then to 0.6 +/- 0.1 x 10(9)/l by 6 months (P = 0.08). It
      tended to be lower in BiVAD patients (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: SIR exists in
      children prior to VAD support. VAD implantation is associated with a significant 
      and prolonged increase in CRP and a decrease in lymphocyte count, indicating a
      suppressed immune function, being more pronounced in BiVAD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute refractory cardiogenic shock with early multisystem organ
      failure has a poor outcome without mechanical circulatory support. We review our 
      experience with emergent peripheral cardiopulmonary support as a bridge to
      decision in these patients. METHODS: A retrospective review from January 2009
      through December 2010 was conducted of 26 consecutive adult patients at a single 
      institution with acute refractory cardiogenic shock who underwent salvage
      peripheral cardiopulmonary support. RESULTS: There were 18 men and 8 women with a
      mean age of 54 years (range 18 to 76). Indications for support: acute myocardial 
      infarction (n = 16), decompensated chronic heart failure (n = 2), refractory
      arrhythmic arrest (n = 3), acute valvular pathology (n = 4), and unknown (n = 1).
      Patients with primary postcardiotomy shock were excluded. Median duration of
      support was 3 days (range 1 to 14). Decisions included: withdraw of support (n = 
      4), recovery (n = 5), and bridge to a procedure (n = 17). The procedures were
      percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 4), left ventricular assist device (n =
      9), heart transplantation (n = 1), and miscellaneous cardiac surgery (n = 3).
      Overall survival to discharge was 65%. In the recovery and bridge to a procedure 
      group, 78% were discharged from the hospital and survival at three months was
      72%. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage peripheral cardiopulmonary support is a useful tool to 
      rapidly stabilize acute refractory cardiogenic shock permitting an assessment of 
      neurologic and end-organ viability.

TI  - Recovery of right heart function with temporary right ventricular assist using a 
      centrifugal pump in patients with severe biventricular failure.
PG  - 858-64
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.03.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes of a biventricular assist device (BiVAD) support
      are worse than those of an isolated left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      support. This study evaluated our strategy for right heart failure using a
      temporary right VAD (RVAD) with an extracorporeal centrifugal pump. METHODS: From
      January 2001 to December 2010, 108 patients underwent LVAD implantation at our
      institution and their clinical outcomes were studied. RESULTS: A temporary
      centrifugal RVAD was implanted in 26 patients. Multivariate logistic regression
      revealed pre-operative extracorporeal life support (odds ratio [OR], 37.0),
      central venous pressure (OR, 1.2), mean pulmonary artery pressure (OR, 0.9), and 
      serum total bilirubin (OR, 1.4) were the risk factors for RVAD requirement.
      RVAD-off test was conducted, and 11 of the 26 patients showed significant
      recovery of right heart function and were eventually removed from RVAD support.
      The survival of patients with isolated LVAD was significantly better than those
      with a paracorporeal pulsatile BiVAD (80% vs 11% at 1 year, p < 0.001). However, 
      there was no significant difference between the survival of patients who
      underwent isolated LVAD support and those who were initially implanted with
      temporary BiVAD but underwent the RVAD removal (80% vs 73% at 1 year, p = 0.827).
      CONCLUSION: Our strategy with temporary RVAD for severe acute right heart failure
      was effective in selecting the patients who could be weaned from RVAD support.
      Patient survival was improved by avoiding the long-term support with a
      paracorporeal pulsatile BiVAD.

      medical management.
PG  - 611-7
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.12.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The CentriMag ventricular assist device (VAD) has gained popularity
      in the last several years as rescue support for patients with decompensated heart
      failure. We have used the CentriMag VAD as a bridge to decision device. We
      describe our experience with device placement, use and outcomes. METHODS: This is
      a retrospective study of all patients who underwent CentriMag placement at our
      institution from January 2007 to August 2009. Sixty-three patients had placement 
      of a CentriMag device, with 43% (n = 27) of these being placed due to failure of 
      medical management. These cases were the focus of our study. RESULTS: Primary
      diagnoses were ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 17), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 7)
      or other (n = 3). Mean age was 47.1 (range 7 to 72) years. Prior to implant, 85% 
      of patients were on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, 70% were on
      vasopressors, and 44% were on more than one inotrope. INTERMACS score was 1 in
      67% of patients and 2 in 33% of patients. Six patients were bridged to a
      long-term device, 8 to transplantation and 10 to recovery. Eighty-nine percent
      (24 of 27) of patients survived to explant and 74% (20 of 27) survived to
      hospital discharge, with a 1-year survival of 68%. Thromboembolic complications
      occurred in 10 patients, including 6 strokes. Compared with patients who survived
      to discharge, those who died had a significantly higher body mass index (30.8 vs 
      24.1 kg/m(2), p = 0.003). Survivors to discharge demonstrated significant
      improvements in hepatic and renal function over the course of device support
      while non-survivors did not. CONCLUSIONS: The CentriMag demonstrates promising
      results when used in patients with acute heart failure refractory to medical
      management.

AB  - Use of high-risk or marginal donors is the most viable short-term means to boost 
      the organ supply and bridge the widening gap between the number of patients on
      the waiting list for organ transplantation and the insufficient numbers of organ 
      donors. Expansion of the donor pool requires an understanding of the impact on
      survival likely to result from extending one or more high risk factors. Use of
      extended donor pool results in shorter waiting list times and limits the
      morbidity and mortality associated with long-term mechanical support needed to
      support diseased organs. In this report, we present one such example of expanding
      donor pool in which a pediatric patient donated a solid organ after two heart
      transplants and successful use of ECMO and VAD.

TI  - The ABCs of left ventricular assist device echocardiography: a systematic
      approach.
PG  - 885-99
LID - 10.1093/ehjci/jes090 [doi]
AB  - Echocardiography is an important imaging modality used to determine the
      indication of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation for patients
      with advanced heart failure (HF) and for serial follow-up to make management
      decisions in patient care post-implant. Continuous axial-flow LVAD therapy
      provides effective haemodynamic support for the failing left ventricle, improving
      both the clinical functional status and quality of life. Echocardiographers must 
      develop a systematic approach to echocardiographic assessment of LVAD
      implantation and post-LVAD implant cardiac morphology and physiology. This
      approach must include the evaluation of left and right heart chamber morphology

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is
      associated with a high mortality. This study investigated the effect of
      bloodstream infection on survival of patients with LVAD support and assessed risk
      factors for survival in LVAD patients with bloodstream infection. METHODS:
      Between 1999 and 2010, 109 consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure were
      supported by an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation. Overall survival was
      compared between those with and without a bloodstream infection. Risk factors for
      survival of patients with bloodstream infection were analyzed. RESULTS: A
      bloodstream infection developed in 65 patients (60%) during 584 +/- 389 days of
      LVAD support. Compared with patients without a bloodstream infection, overall
      survival was significantly worse in those with bloodstream infection (68% vs 84% 
      at 2 years after LVAD implantation, p = 0.0117). However, of 22 patients bridged 
      to transplantation, none had bloodstream infection recurrence after
      transplantation, and their 3-year survival rate after transplantation was 100%.
      Cox multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) identified
      postoperative right ventricular failure (2.890 [1.238 to 6.757]; p = 0.0141) and 
      bloodstream infection caused by a pathogen other than gram-positive cocci (3.336 
      [1.390 to 8.006] p = 0.0070) as significant risk factors for death in LVAD
      patients with a bloodstream infection. CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infection had a
      significant effect on survival after LVAD implantation. Our results suggest that 
      urgent cardiac transplantation should be considered for LVAD patients with a
      bloodstream infection based on the causative organism and right ventricular
      function.

TI  - Rapid onset of fulminant myocarditis portends a favourable prognosis and the
      ability to bridge mechanical circulatory support to recovery.
PG  - 379-82
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs242 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock is fatal without
      mechanical circulatory support. Once haemodynamic stability has been established 
      with a ventricular assist device (VAD), the decision to wait for myocardial
      recovery as opposed to listing for an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can be
      difficult. We have undertaken this study to establish the criteria for
      determining the need for heart transplantation following VAD implant for
      fulminant myocarditis. METHODS: A total of 442 VADs were implanted between 1993
      and 2011. Twenty-four VADs were implanted for fulminant myocarditis with
      refractory cardiogenic shock. We retrospectively analysed the variables and the
      pathology for this cohort. Patients who had a full recovery of myocardial
      function and subsequent VAD explant (Explant) were compared with those bridged to
      OHT. There was one acute death. RESULTS: There was no difference in the past
      medical history between the groups. Explant patients had a more acute onset of
      heart failure with a median of 7 days between the onset of symptoms and VAD
      implant, when compared with 22 days for OHT (P = 0.01). A rapid recovery in
      myocardial function was seen in the Explant group, with recovery of myocardial
      function (ejection fraction = 53 +/- 24%) in 14 +/- 7 days. Myocardial function
      was sustained for 5 years following the VAD explant. The female gender favoured
      myocardial recovery and VAD explantability. Two patients had giant cell
      myocarditis, neither of whom had a recovery of function, and they were bridged to
      heart transplant with a VAD. CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant myocarditis is a fatal
      condition without mechanical support. The rapid onset of symptoms is associated
      with a complete recovery of myocardial function and VAD explant. The absence of
      rapid recovery of myocardial function should prompt listing for a heart
      transplant.

      transplantation: a single center's experience.
PG  - 883-5
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.03.023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are limited options for mechanical circulatory support to treat
      end-stage heart failure in pediatric patients. Although extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation is commonly used in infants and children, ventricular assist devices 
      (VAD) provide a longer duration of support with fewer complications before
      recovery or as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx), as described herein.
      METHODS: This retrospective chart review of eight patients transplanted from
      April 2008 to December 2011, after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      implantation due to end-stage heart failure. Their mean age was 12 years (9-15 y)
      and mean body weight, 48 kg (20-78). All were New York Heart Association
      functional class IV with mean left ventricular ejection fractions less than 15%. 
      RESULTS: The six patients (75%) received HTx after a mean LVAD support duration
      of 43.2 days; 2 (25%) died before a suitable heart became available. Their mean
      duration of LVAD support was 30 days. There were 4 (50%) who experienced
      clinically evident thromboembolic events: 3 (37.5%) cerebrovascular with 1
      mortality and 1 (12.5%) as acute limb ischemia. Transient hemodialysis was
      performed in 4 (50%). Bloodstream infection identified in 6 (75%) was controlled 
      with intravenous antibiotics. Driveline infection identified in 4 (50%) was
      treated successfully with local wound dressing changes and intravenous
      antibiotics. One 9-year-old boy died of rejection at 16 months after
      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the organ shortage, pediatric patients
      have a low chance to undergo HTx. VAD provides long-term support for children
      with end-stage heart failure before a suitable heart becomes available. A
      thromboembolic event remains a major complication influencing their survival.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ventricular assist devices have benefited patients with end-stage
      heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). We present our
      experiment of HTx using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with Thoratec 
      pneumatic ventricular assist device (TpVAD). METHODS: From May 1996 to June 2011,
      among 410 patients who underwent HTx 23 required mechanical circulatory support
      (MCS) with implantation of the TpVAD and 15 (65%) of them received grafts.
      RESULTS: The 23 patients included 4 female and 19 male patients of age range 10
      to 80 years. Eighteen (78%) of them needed ECMO before TpVAD implantation. Twelve
      (67%) were implanted with a TpVAD double bridge to HTx. The demand for MCS among 
      patients with acute hemodynamic collapse has led to major improvements in the
      existing systems such as ECMO with double bridge to TpVAD. CONCLUSION: We used
      ECMO as a rescue procedure for acute hemodynamic deterioration. However, during
      ECMO support, left ventricular afterload increased. If prolonged support is
      required, TpVAD might be required: 15 (65%) of patients supported by ECMO with
      TpVAD needed to a wait a suitable donor. We recommend the application of ECMO for
      short-term support (within 1 week), and TpVAD as a bridge for medium- or
      long-term support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recovery of ventricular function during left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) support allowing device explantation occurs infrequently. We
      explored the hypothesis that certain patient profiles are more likely to exhibit 
      LV recovery during LVAD support. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of
      data from the HeartMate II bridge to transplant (BTT) and destination therapy
      (DT) trials was conducted, including 490 BTT, 600 DT, and 18 compassionate-use
      patients. Of the 1,108 patients, 20 (1.8%; 10 BTT, 10 DT) were explanted owing to
      LV recovery. The median age was 33 years, and 12 patients (60%) were <40 years of
      age. History of heart failure was <1 year for 11 patients (61%), and the primary 
      etiology was nonischemic (90%). Of the patients with nonischemic etiologies and
      <1-year history of heart failure, 13% were explanted. Three patients required
      LVAD reimplantation; of the remaining 17, 16 remain alive. At follow-up (median
      510 days), the mean ejection fraction was 42% (20%-67%) and the mean left
      ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 55 +/- 8 mm. At the 2-year follow-up (n = 
      13), patients were New York Heart Association functional class I or II and
      overall survival rate was 85 +/- 11%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study
      suggest that LV recovery is most likely to occur in young patients (<40 years)
      with nonischemic cardiomyopathy of <1 year duration. Two-year postexplant
      survival was excellent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac transplantation in many centers is programmatically limited
      to patients aged younger than 70 years. We investigated the trends and outcomes
      for cardiac transplantation in recipients aged 70 years and older in the United
      States. METHODS: De-identified data were provided by United Network of Organ
      Sharing. Transplant recipients were grouped by age 60-69 years and 70 years and
      older. Univariate comparisons were performed using Student's t-test or the
      Pearson chi-square test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique 
      and compared with the log-rank test. Cox regression was used to determine
      predictors of death after transplant. Statistical significance was assigned to p 
      < 0.05. RESULTS: Between January 1, 1998, and June 15, 2010, 5,807 sexagenarians 
      and 332 septuagenarians received allografts. The septuagenarian cohort had more
      men, less diabetes, was less likely to have a ventricular assist device, and more
      likely to be status II. Donors for septuagenarians were older and died more
      frequently from intracranial hemorrhage. Median unadjusted survival was 9.8 years
      for sexagenarians vs 8.5 years for septuagenarians (p = 0.003). There was no
      difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular accident, length of stay, or
      pacemaker need between groups. Septuagenarians were less likely to be treated for
      rejection the first year (p = 0.001). Age was a multivariate predictor of death
      (hazard ratio, 1.289; 95% confidence interval, 1.039-1.6; p = 0.021).
      CONCLUSIONS: Selected septuagenarians with advanced heart failure can derive
      great benefit from cardiac transplantation, although survival is inferior to that
      of an immediately younger sexagenarian cohort. Most of the mortality risk is seen
      in the first year after transplantation. A reduced incidence of rejection was
      observed and warrants further study.

AB  - Right ventricular (RV) failure remains a major problem in cardiac surgery,
      particularly in the setting of heart transplantation and following institution of
      left ventricular support. Experimental studies have shown that RV function is
      derived from 2 sources: the free wall of the RV and the interventricular septum. 
      Management of RV failure involves not only decreasing RV afterload, but also
      optimizing both contributions to RV function, which is best achieved by
      optimizing developed systemic pressure. Techniques for managing the pulmonary
      circulation and strategies for optimizing RV function in various clinical
      settings are presented.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support for end-stage heart failure in repaired and
      palliated congenital heart disease.
PG  - 102-9
LID - 10.2174/157340311797484222 [doi]
AB  - Approximately one in one hundred children is born with congenital heart disease. 
      Most can be managed with corrective or palliative surgery but a small group will 
      develop severe heart failure, leaving cardiac transplantation as the ultimate
      treatment option. Unfortunately, due to the inadequate number of available donor 
      organs, only a small number of patients can benefit from this therapy, and
      mortality remains high for pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation,
      especially compared to adults. The purpose of this review is to describe the
      potential role of mechanical circulatory support in this context and to review
      current experience. For patients with congenital heart disease, ventricular
      assist devices are most commonly used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation, an 
      application which has been shown to have several important advantages over
      medical therapy alone or support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,
      including improved survival to transplant, less exposure to blood products with
      less immune sensitization, and improved organ function. While these devices may
      improve wait list mortality, the chronic shortage of donor organs for children is
      likely to remain a problem into the foreseeable future. Therefore, there is great
      interest in the development of mechanical ventricular assist devices as potential
      destination therapy for congenital heart disease patients with end-stage heart
      failure. This review first discusses the experience with the currently available 
      ventricular assist devices in children with congenital heart disease, and then
      follows to discuss what devices are under development and may reach the bedside
      soon.

AB  - Heart failure continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Over 
      the past decade, left ventricular assist devices have been shown to improve the
      survival and quality of life. However, it is quite clear that very sick patients 
      do not do as well, and it is therefore imperative to select patients at the
      proper time. In this article, we review both the indications for considering left
      ventricular assist device therapy as well as discuss the considerations and
      therapy that should be done pre-operatively to possibly improve post-insertion
      outcomes.

TI  - Transplant registrants with implanted left ventricular assist devices have
      insufficient risk to justify elective organ procurement and transplantation
      network status 1A time.
PG  - 36-43
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.02.031 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this research was to identify disparities in risk within 
      heart transplant urgency designations. BACKGROUND: Patients with left ventricular
      assist devices (LVADs) are given 30 days of elective status 1A time. This
      allowance may create competition for organs between stable LVAD-supported
      registrants and less stable registrants listed status 1A or 1B. METHODS: The
      Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for all status
      1A and 1B listings between 2005 and 2010. Cox models were used to estimate the
      relative and absolute risk of adverse events (death or delisting as too ill)
      during status 1A or 1B listing. RESULTS: Status 1A registrants supported with
      dual inotropes and right heart monitoring had a higher risk of adverse events
      compared to those supported with implanted LVADs using elective 1A time (hazard
      ratio: 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.8 to 5.7). The 30-day risk of events was
      1% (95% confidence interval: 0.1% to 3%) for implanted LVADs using elective 1A
      time and 6% (95% confidence interval: 4% to 8%) for dual inotrope support.
      Registrants listed with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices had a higher
      risk of adverse events (hazard ratio: 9.1; p < 0.0001) compared with registrants 
      with implanted LVADs using elective 1A time. The odds of transplant were higher
      for implanted LVADs (odds ratio: 1.5; p < 0.0001) compared with dual-inotrope and
      intra-aortic balloon pump support. CONCLUSIONS: The historic allowance for 30
      days of elective status 1A time for implanted LVADs creates disparities in risk
      among status 1A registrants. The allowance of 30 days of elective status 1A time 
      should not be allocated to stable registrants with implanted LVADs. Registrants
      supported with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices should be listed status
      1A indefinitely.

TI  - Incidence and management of gastrointestinal bleeding with continuous flow assist
      devices.
PG  - 1534-40
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.02.035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) have
      emerged as the standard of care for patients in advanced heart failure (HF)
      requiring long-term mechanical circulatory support. Gastrointestinal (GI)
      bleeding has been frequently reported within this population. METHODS: A
      retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from
      January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and
      management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was
      conducted to identify related risk factors. RESULTS: A significant incidence of
      GI bleeding (22.8%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93%) 
      population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from 
      the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37% from
      ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI)
      tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95% CI, 2.2-228.6;
      p=0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9;
      p=0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were
      independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in
      older patients (mean, 70 years; p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60%) rebled
      from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding
      anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide 
      did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates,
      length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct 
      consequence of GI bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors account for GI bleeding
      in patients on CF-VADs. A previous history of bleeding increases risk
      significantly and warrants careful monitoring.

AB  - Pediatric mechanical circulatory support has evolved considerably in the past
      decade. Improvements in device design and availability have led to increased
      short-, medium-, and long-term support options for pediatric patients with heart 
      failure. Most pediatric mechanical circulatory support is utilized as a bridge to

AB  - A ventricular assist device (VAD) is an implantable mechanical device that is
      used to partially or completely replace the circulatory function of a failing
      heart. VADs may serve as a bridge to heart transplantation or as permanent
      circulatory assistance, also referred to as destination therapy. There is a
      paucity of information regarding the nutrition complications in VAD patients, and
      as such, little is presently known of the optimal means of nutrition assessment
      and management of these complex and often critically ill patients. In this
      review, a general overview of the VAD, comparisons of nutrition assessment
      measures, and strategies to meet the nutrition needs of these patients are
      provided using evidence-based information wherever possible. Because there is a
      lack of nutrition studies and assessment guidelines specifically for VAD
      patients, many of the guidelines for care of these patients are currently based
      on the information available for the care of patients with heart failure.
      Although the optimal measure to assess nutrition status remains poorly studied, a
      systematic, thorough nutrition assessment of patients with heart failure and
      heart transplant candidates prior to VAD placement appears to be important to
      identify those at nutrition risk and, with appropriate nutrition therapy,
      decrease their risk for morbidity and mortality. VAD patients with inadequate
      oral intake may require nutrition support to meet their nutrition needs; however,
      feeding the hemodynamically compromised patient provides additional challenges.

TI  - Intra-aortic balloon pump inserted through the subclavian artery: A minimally
      invasive approach to mechanical support in the ambulatory end-stage heart failure
      patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intra-aortic balloon pumps are traditionally inserted through the
      femoral artery, limiting the patient's mobility. We used alternate approaches of 
      intra-aortic balloon pump insertion to provide temporary and minimally invasive
      support for patients with decompensating, end-stage heart failure. The present
      study describes the outcomes with closed-chest, transthoracic intra-aortic
      balloon pumps by way of the subclavian artery. METHODS: During a 3-year period,
      20 patients underwent subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump in the setting 
      of end-stage heart failure. The balloon was inserted through a
      polytetrafluoroethylene graft sutured to the right subclavian artery in 19
      patients (95%) and to the left subclavian artery in 1 patient (5%). The goal of
      support was to bridge to transplantation in 17 patients (85%) and bridge to
      recovery in 3 patients (15%). The primary outcome measure was death during
      subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump support. The secondary outcomes
      included survival to the intended endpoint of bridge to transplantation/bridge to
      recovery, complications during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump
      support (eg, stroke, limb ischemia, brachial plexus injury, dissection, bleeding 
      requiring reoperation, and device-related infection), emergent surgery for
      worsening heart failure, and ambulation during intra-aortic balloon pump support.
      RESULTS: The duration of balloon support ranged from 3 to 48 days (mean, 17.3 +/-
      13.1 days). No patients died during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump
      support. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) were successfully bridged to transplant or 
      left ventricular-assist device. Two patients (10%) required emergent left
      ventricular-assist device for worsening heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: An
      intra-aortic balloon pump inserted through the subclavian artery is a simple,
      minimally invasive approach to mechanical support and is associated with limited 
      morbidity and facilitates ambulation in patients with end-stage heart failure.

LID - 10.1177/1474515111435609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As more patients with cardiac failure are being bridged to
      transplantation with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), more insight into
      the lives of their close relatives is needed. AIMS: To explore the experiences
      and coping strategies of LVAD patients' close relatives during bridge to
      transplantation and to generate theory. METHODS: The study had a qualitative
      design using grounded theory and NVivo version 9 to analyse one paired interview 
      (n=2) and one group interview (n=5) with LVAD patients' close relatives. RESULTS:
      The main finding was the importance of supporting the close relatives who support
      the LVAD patient. The core category was support and self-preservation in close
      relatives. We constructed the support cascade model illustrating support from
      close relatives to the patient (main obligation) and to other family members
      (other obligations), and support from personal and professional relations to the 
      close relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Support from close relatives potentially benefits
      patients, family, healthcare providers, and society in general. Our study
      highlighted the importance of supporting the close relatives supporting the
      patient and we have suggested some modifiable factors to enable social support
      and ease transitions in the illness trajectory. We suggest that awareness of
      social support systems might be beneficial in comprehensive care planning for
      LVAD patients and their close relatives.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The proportion of patients who can be bridged with left ventricular
      assist devices to myocardial recovery and the long-term outcome of these patients
      is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the outcomes of patients bridged to recovery
      compared with those bridged to transplantation. All left ventricular assist
      devices were implanted as a bridge to transplantation with a very proactive
      program of promoting myocardial recovery. A total of 40 patients were bridged to 
      recovery and 52 to transplantation. Of the bridged to recovery (explanted) group,
      33 were men (age, 32.8 +/- 11.8 years), 37 had dilated cardiomyopathy (familial
      in 3, peripartum cardiomyopathy in 3) and 3 had myocarditis. Of the bridged to
      transplantation (transplanted) group, 42 were men (age, 42.3 +/- 12.5 years; P < 
      .0005 vs bridged to recovery). The diagnosis was ischemic heart disease in 24,
      dilated cardiomyopathy in 21 (only 13 received drug therapy), hypertrophic
      obstructive cardiomyopathy in 2, arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 2, 
      myocarditis in 1, and congestive heart disease in 2. RESULTS: The survival rate
      was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%, 78.3, and 78.3% in the explanted and
      transplanted groups at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively. In total, 12 (23%)
      patients bridged transplantation either died from, or required ventricular assist
      device support, for primary graft failure. Of the explanted patients, 4 (10%)
      subsequently required transplantation at 34, 512, 1019, and 1213 days (2 died 25 
      and 1867 days after transplantation and 2 were well after 1523 and 3199 days).
      The rate of transplant or ventricular assist device-free survival less noncardiac
      death for the bridged to recovery and bridged to transplantation groups,
      respectively, was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%, 78.3%, and 78.3% at 1, 3,
      and 7 years. At latest follow-up (1394 +/- 1195 days for the bridged to recovery 
      and 1913 +/- 941 days for the bridged to transplantation group), 5 of the bridged
      to transplantation patients (9.6%) had malignancy, 34 (65.4%) had
      hypercholesterolemia, 25 (48.1%) had hypertension, and 7 (13.5%) had coronary
      disease. The creatinine was 125.5 +/- 43.5 vs 95.2 +/- 16.5 mumol/L for the
      bridged to transplantation and bridged to recovery groups (P < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The outcome after explantation for myocardial recovery is
      comparable, if not better than, after bridge to transplantation.

PG  - 77-82
LID - 10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.02.050 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is common in heart failure (HF) and is associated with improved outcomes,
      a finding often termed the "obesity paradox." Although fat distribution varies by
      gender, the role of obesity in the outcomes of women compared to men with HF has 
      not been well studied. In a cohort of patients with advanced systolic HF followed
      at a single university center, 2,718 patients had body mass indexes (BMIs)
      measured at baseline, and 469 patients with HF had waist circumferences (WCs)
      measured at baseline. Elevated BMI was defined as >/=25 kg/m(2). High WC was
      defined as >/=88 cm in women and >/=102 cm in men. The primary outcome was death,
      urgent heart transplantation, or ventricular assist device placement. The mean
      age was 53.0 +/- 12.4 years, 25% of subjects were women, and the mean left
      ventricular ejection fraction was 22.9 +/- 7.19%. In men, 2-year event-free
      survival was better for high versus normal BMI (63.2% vs 53.5%, p <0.001) and for
      high versus normal WC (78.8% vs 63.1%, p = 0.01). In women, 2-year event-free
      survival was better for elevated versus normal BMI (67.1% vs 56.6%, p = 0.01) but
      similar in the 2 WC groups. In multivariate analyses, normal BMI and normal WC
      were associated with higher relative risk for the primary outcome in men (BMI
      1.34, WC 2.02) and women (BMI 1.38, WC 2.99). In conclusion, in patients with
      advanced HF, high BMI and WC were associated with improved outcomes in both
      genders. Further investigation of the interaction between body composition and
      gender in HF outcomes is warranted.

AB  - Children with heart failure unresponsive to medical therapy are left with few
      options for survival. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are life-saving options
      for such patients, allowing for bridge to transplantation or cardiac recovery.
      Retrospective review of cases from May 2006 to October 2010 was undertaken.
      Fourteen patients underwent implantation of VADs for refractory heart failure.
      Mean age was 9 years (range 1-17 years), and weight was 41 kg (range 9.7-71 kg). 
      Indications for support: end-stage cardiomyopathy (n = 8), myocarditis (n = 3),
      univentricular failure (n = 2), and congenital heart disease/postcardiotomy (n = 
      1). Level of limitation at time of implant included critical cardiogenic shock in
      six (43%) and progressive decline in eight (57%). Extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation was used as a bridge to VAD in five (36%) patients. Preimplant
      variables: 86% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (mean 10.3 days),
      hyperbilirubinemia in 75%, and acute renal insufficiency in 79%. Device selection
      was systemic VAD in 11 (79%) and biventricular assist device in three (21%).
      Berlin Heart EXCOR was used in eight patients, while six patients received a
      Thoratec implantable VAD or paracorporeal VAD. Mean duration of support was 68
      days (range 8-363 days). Overall survival was 79%. Ten patients (71%) were
      successfully bridged to transplantation, three (21%) died while on a device, one 
      remains on support, and no patients were weaned from VAD. Children supported for 
      single ventricle heart failure had a 50% survival with none currently bridged to 
      transplantation. Complications included bleeding requiring reoperation in 21% (n 
      = 3), stroke in 29% (n = 4), and driveline infections in 7% (n = 1). In two
      patients, a total of six pump exchanges were performed for thrombus formation.
      Survival for pediatric patients of all ages is excellent using current device
      technology with a majority of patients being successfully bridged to
      transplantation. Morbidity is acceptably low considering the severity of illness.
      Significant challenges exist with long-term extracorporeal support due to lack of
      donor availability and the high incidence of preformed alloantibodies especially 
      in the failing single ventricle.

TI  - The role of biventricular assistance in primary graft failure after heart
      transplantation.
PG  - 160-2
AB  - A 37-year-old man suffered from systolic heart failure as a result of idiopathic 
      dilated cardiomyopathy since 1995 and was followed up in our cardiology
      department. In June 2006, the patient arrived at our outpatient clinic with an
      acute renal impairment and all manifestations of acute heart failure. He was
      already registered on the waiting list for heart transplantation (Eurotransplant)
      as a highly urgent request. The patient underwent heart transplantation but the
      reperfused allograft was totally akinetic and we decided to place a biventricular
      assist device immediately. The patient fully recovered after seven days of
      biventricular circulatory support and was discharged on the 38th day after the
      transplantation. Three years later, he is in good general condition without any
      manifestation of rejection. We conclude that biventricular assist device
      implantation is a good indication after post-cardiotomy failure and it should be 
      started as early as possible before shock and possible irreversible organ damage.

TI  - Mechanical unloading reverses transverse tubule remodelling and normalizes local 
      Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)release in a rodent model of heart failure.
PG  - 571-80
LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs038 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is critical for contraction in
      cardiomyocytes. The transverse (t)-tubule system guarantees the proximity of the 
      triggers for Ca(2+) release [L-type Ca(2+) channel, dihydropyridine receptors
      (DHPRs)] and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channels [ryanodine
      receptors (RyRs)]. Transverse tubule disruption occurs early in heart failure
      (HF). Clinical studies of left ventricular assist devices in HF indicate that
      mechanical unloading induces reverse remodelling. We hypothesize that unloading
      of failing hearts normalizes t-tubule structure and improves CICR. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Heart failure was induced in Lewis rats by left coronary artery ligation
      for 12 weeks; sham-operated animals were used as controls. Failing hearts were
      mechanically unloaded for 4 weeks by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation 
      (HF-UN). HF reduced the t-tubule density measured by di-8-ANEPPS staining in
      isolated left ventricular myocytes, and this was reversed by unloading. The
      deterioration in the regularity of the t-tubule system in HF was also reversed in
      HF-UN. Scanning ion conductance microscopy showed the reappearance of normal
      surface striations in HF-UN. Electron microscopy revealed recovery of normal
      t-tubule microarchitecture in HF-UN. L-type Ca(2+) current density, measured
      using whole-cell patch clamping, was reduced in HF but unaffected by unloading.
      The variance of the time-to-peak of the Ca(2+) transient, an index of CICR
      dyssynchrony, was increased in HF and normalized by unloading. The increased
      Ca(2+) spark frequency observed in HF was reduced in HF-UN. These results could
      be explained by the recoupling of orphaned RyRs in HF, as indicated by
      immunofluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that mechanical unloading of the
      failing heart reverses the pathological remodelling of the t-tubule system and
      improves CICR.

TI  - Liver dysfunction as a predictor of outcomes in patients with advanced heart
      failure requiring ventricular assist device support: Use of the Model of
      End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and MELD eXcluding INR (MELD-XI) scoring system.
PG  - 601-10
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.02.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver dysfunction increases post-surgical morbidity and mortality.
      The Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) estimates liver function but can be
      inaccurate in patients receiving oral anti-coagulation. We evaluated the effect
      of liver dysfunction on outcomes after ventricular assist device (VAD)
      implantation and the dynamic changes in liver dysfunction that occur during VAD
      support. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 255 patients (147 with pulsatile
      devices and 108 with continuous-flow devices) who received a long-term VAD
      between 2000 and 2010. Liver dysfunction was estimated by MELD and MELD-eXcluding
      INR (MELD-XI), with patients grouped by a score of >/= 17 or < 17. Primary
      outcomes were on-VAD, after transplant, and overall survival. RESULTS: MELD and
      MELD-XI correlated highly (R >/= 0.901, p < 0.0001) in patients not on oral
      anti-coagulation. Patients with MELD or MELD-XI < 17 had improved on-VAD and
      overall survival (p < 0.05) with a higher predictive power for MELD-XI. During
      VAD support, cholestasis initially worsened but eventually improved. Patients
      with pre-VAD liver dysfunction who survived to transplant had lower
      post-transplant survival (p = 0.0193). However, if MELD-XI normalized during VAD 
      support, post-transplant survival improved and was similar to that of patients
      with low MELD-XI scores. CONCLUSIONS: MELD-XI is a viable alternative for
      assessing liver dysfunction in heart failure patients on oral anti-coagulation.
      Liver dysfunction is associated with worse survival. However, if MELD-XI improves
      during VAD support, post-transplant survival is similar to those without prior
      liver dysfunction, suggesting an important prognostic role. We also found
      evidence of a transient cholestatic state after LVAD implantation that deserves
      further examination.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support after paediatric heart transplantation.
PG  - 696-701
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may be required after orthotopic
      heart transplantation (OHTx) in children for the treatment of failure or
      rejection. We review the incidence and outcomes of post-transplant MCS in our
      institution. METHODS: MCS was classified as early (<1 month since transplant) or 
      late (>1 month since transplant) and the support offered was either veno-arterial
      extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) or a ventricular assist device
      (VAD). From 2003 to the present, 100 children (<16 years) underwent OHTx. Fifteen
      (15%) had 17 episodes of MCS. MCS was instituted early in 10 and late in seven
      episodes. Two children required two episodes of support. VA-ECMO was used in 12
      episodes (71%). Two children required VAD support alone (12%). In three (17%)
      episodes ECMO was subsequently converted from VAD. RESULTS: Among 10 children
      with early failure, eight were successfully weaned from support with recovery of 
      graft function. In the late failure group, three of six patients died. All but
      four patients underwent re-transplantation with no perioperative deaths. Overall 
      survival to discharge was 66%. The early failure group shows a better survival
      rate to hospital discharge compared with the late failure group (78 vs 50%; P <
      0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of post-transplant MCS for graft failure in
      our patients was 15%. Early graft failure has a better outcome than late failure.
      Re-transplantation has good mid-term outcomes in children. A stepwise approach
      with a multimodality MCS strategy improves survival in this group of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests patients bridged to heart transplant (BTT)
      have equivalent outcomes as those undergoing conventional orthotopic heart
      transplantation (OHT). However, data on risk factors for early death in BTT
      patients are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the United Network for
      Organ Sharing database of all patients bridged to OHT with a HeartMate II from
      January 2005 to December 2010. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day
      mortality. Additional postoperative outcomes were cerebrovascular accident and
      need for renal replacement therapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival.
      Preoperative variables associated with 90-day death on univariate analysis
      (p<0.2) were included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.
      RESULTS: A HeartMate II was used to bridge 1,312 patients (average age, 52+/-12
      years) to OHT, most commonly for idiopathic cardiomyopathy (50.7%). During the
      study, 171 patients (13.0%) died. The unadjusted 90-day survival was 92.3%. The
      highest annual average center volume in this cohort, examining for BTT recipients
      only, was 28 BTT procedures yearly. Postoperative cerebrovascular accident
      occurred in 29 patients (2.2%), and 106 (8.3%) required renal replacement
      therapy. Cox regression revealed age, glomerular filtration rate, African
      American race, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, serum bilirubin, need for
      mechanical ventilation, donor age, and prolonged ischemia time were associated
      with 90-day death. Early survival was improved for patients who underwent OHT at 
      high-volume centers (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study examining risk factors for 
      early death in patients bridged to OHT using HeartMate II mechanical assistance
      will aid in identifying patients best suited to benefit from this technology.

AB  - An otherwise healthy 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department in
      cardiogenic shock after suffering a massive myocardial infarction due to left
      main occlusion. He was initially supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      and subsequently was converted to paracorporeal support with a Levitronix left
      ventricular assist device. He experienced multiple postoperative complications
      including renal failure, respiratory failure, retroperitoneal hematoma requiring 
      suspension of anticoagulation, and fungal bloodstream infection precluding
      transition to an implantable device. He was reconditioned and successfully
      underwent orthotopic heart transplant 183 days after presentation. A discussion
      of the relevant issues is included.

AB  - Barth syndrome (BTHS) is associated with myocardial disease, frequently left
      ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, which may necessitate cardiac
      transplantation or lead to death in some patients. We report a child with BTHS
      who had an "undulating cardiac phenotype" and ultimately developed decompensated 
      heart failure requiring mechanical circulatory support with a ventricular assist 
      device as a bridge to transplantation. His course was complicated by acute lung
      injury requiring placement of an in-line oxygenator to maintain end-organ
      function. Not only was his course complicated by cardiac and respiratory failure 
      but his BTHS associated comorbidities complicated the management of his therapy
      using mechanical assist device support. He was successfully supported and
      subsequently was transplanted. Here we discuss the management of a child with
      BTHS using mechanical circulatory support and describe the use of an in-line
      oxygenator, Quadrox, with the Berlin Excor device.

TI  - Effects of exercise training on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients
      with a left ventricular assist device: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 729-34
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.02.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A paucity of studies has examined the effect of exercise training
      after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Previous research has
      demonstrated that insertion of the LVAD alone improves exercise capacity and
      quality of life (QOL). This study investigated whether supervised exercise
      training results in a further improvement. METHODS: This prospective, randomized 
      controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and
      intention-to-treat analysis investigated the effect of exercise training on
      exercise capacity and QOL in 14 patients who underwent LVAD insertion as a bridge
      to heart transplantation. Exercise training consisted of 8 weeks of gym-based
      aerobic and strengthening exercises 3 times a week, with a progressive
      mobilization program, compared with the control group that completed mobilization
      alone. Exercise capacity was measured before and after the intervention using
      maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). QOL
      was measured using the Short Form 36-item assessment. RESULTS: No adverse events 
      were reported. There was a trend toward greater improvement in peak oxygen
      consumption (Vo(2)), 6MWD, and QOL in the exercise group (n = 7) compared with
      the control group (n = 7); however, no significant between-group difference was
      detected for improvements in peak Vo(2) [mean difference (exercise--control)] of 
      2.96 ml/kg/min (95% confidence interval, -1.04 to 6.97), 6MWD at 54 meters (-51
      to 159 meters), and QOL scores over time (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise
      training is feasible and safe in patients with a LVAD. Trends toward greater
      improvement in exercise capacity and QOL after exercise training warrant further 
      investigation in a larger trial.

      support.
PG  - 757-63
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.02.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients on left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) support are requiring non-cardiac surgical (NCS) procedures. We reviewed
      our experience with the management of patients on continuous flow (CF) LVAD
      support undergoing NCS. METHODS: From March 2006 through March 2011, 86 patients 
      with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of a HeartMate II (Thoratec
      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD. Clinical records of these patients were reviewed to
      identify patients who underwent NCS while on LVAD support, with a focus on
      peri-operative death, bleeding, thrombosis, and device malfunction, as well as
      management of pre-operative anti-coagulation. RESULTS: While on CF-LVAD support, 
      20 patients underwent 25 NCSs, comprising 13 major and 12 minor procedures.
      Operations were performed electively in 22 and as emergencies in 3. No
      peri-operative deaths, thromboembolic complications, or device malfunctions
      occurred. The incidence of bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood
      cells was 36.0%, including 25% of patients undergoing minor NCSs and 46.2%
      undergoing major NCSs (p = 0.004). All bleeding complications occurred in
      patients on both warfarin and aspirin pre-operatively. The only significant
      differences between patients who did and did not require transfusion were
      pre-operative warfarin use and significantly higher pre-operative international
      normalized ratio in the transfused group (1.9 +/- 0.4 vs 1.4 +/- 0.3; p = 0.008).
      CONCLUSIONS: Non-cardiac operations can be performed safely in patients with
      CF-LVADs. It may possible to reduce peri-operative bleeding by lowering
      pre-operative anti-coagulation goals, especially before major surgery. However,
      additional analysis is required to determine if this can be performed safely.

PG  - 715-8
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.02.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) have
      yielded improved outcomes compared with pulsatile flow devices for patients on
      long-term support. However, significant rates of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) 
      have been observed during CF-LVAD support. METHODS: From March 2006 through March
      2011, 86 patients with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD 
      (HeartMate II; Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Records were reviewed to
      determine the prevalence of post-implant GIB, location of the bleeding site and
      associated morbidity and mortality. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted
      to identify independent predictors of GIB. RESULTS: GIB occurred in 19 patients
      (22.1%) with a duration of support that ranged from 5 to 456 days. Sources of GIB
      included small bowel and rectum in 6 patients each, large bowel in 2 patients and
      stomach in 1 patient. No definite source was identified in 4 patients. There were
      no deaths referable to GIB. Recurrent GIB occurred in 4 patients. History of a
      GIB prior to LVAD implant was the only variable significantly different between
      patients with and without post-implant GIB (21.1% vs 10.4%, p = 0.016), and was
      the only independent predictor of GIB (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 2.121 to 2.435, p =
      0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent source of morbidity 
      for patients on HeartMate II LVAD support but does not significantly impact
      survival. As implantation of CF-LVADs with non-pulsatile flow gains popularity
      for both bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy, a better understanding of 
      the pathophysiology of GIB in these patients will be needed for minimizing this
      complication.

AB  - Systolic heart failure is a problem of substantial magnitude worldwide. Over the 
      last 25 years great progress has been made in the medical management of heart
      failure with the recognition of the benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade,
      modulation of the renin-angiotensin and mineralocorticoid axes and judicious
      diuretic therapy. In addition, cardiac resynchronization therapy and prophylactic
      implantation of cardiac defibrillators have been responsible for measurable
      benefits in terms of functional status and dysrhythmia-related mortality,
      respectively. Unfortunately, progressive cardiac dysfunction often results in
      activity limitation, symptoms at rest, hospital admission, end-organ dysfunction 
      and death despite maximal implementation of standard therapies. Heart
      transplantation has been a dramatic and effective therapy for end-stage heart
      failure, but it remains limited by a shortage of donor organs, strict criteria
      defining acceptable recipients and often unsatisfactory long-term success.
      Mechanical alternatives to support the failing circulation have been sought for
      the last 50 years. The history of device development has been marked in general
      by the slow progress achieved by a few dedicated and persevering pioneers. In the
      past decade, however, evolving technology has dramatically changed the field and 
      broadened the options for the treatment of advanced heart failure. This review
      will detail the important milestones and the current state of the art, with an
      emphasis on implantable devices for intermediate to long term support.

AB  - Advances in mechanical circulatory support, such as the use of ventricular assist
      devices (VADs), have become a means for prolonging survival in end-stage heart
      failure (HF). VADs decrease the symptoms of HF and improve quality of life by
      replacing some of the work of a failing heart. They unload the ventricle to
      provide improved cardiac output and end-organ perfusion, resulting in improvement
      in cardiorenal syndromes and New York Heart Association functional class rating. 
      VADs are currently used asa bridge to heart transplantation, a bridge to recovery
      of cardiac function, or as destination therapy. Complications of VAD include
      bleeding, infections, arrhythmias, multiple organ failure, right ventricular
      failure, and neurological dysfunction. Patients with VAD have unique
      pharmacotherapeutic requirements in terms of anticoagulation, appropriate
      antibiotic selection, and continuation of HF medications. Pharmacists in acute
      care and community settings are well prepared to care for the patient with VAD.
      These patients require thorough counseling and follow-up with regard to
      prevention and treatment of infections, appropriate levels of anticoagulation,
      and maintenance of fluid balance. A basic understanding of this unique therapy
      can assist pharmacists in attending to the needs of patients with VAD.

TI  - Association of pre-operative interleukin-6 levels with Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profiles and intensive care unit stay
      in left ventricular assist device patients.
PG  - 625-33
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.02.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory mechanisms are associated with worse prognosis in
      end-stage heart failure (ESHF) patients who require left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) support. Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
      Support (INTERMACS) profiles describe patient condition at pre-implant and
      outcome. This study assessed the relationship among inflammation patterns and
      INTERMACS profiles in LVAD recipients. METHOD: Thirty ESHF patients undergoing
      LVAD implantation as bridge to transplant were enrolled. Blood and urine samples 
      were collected pre-operatively and serially up to 2 weeks post-operatively for
      assessment of inflammatory markers (plasma levels of interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8,
      IL-10, and osteopontin, a cardiac inflammatory-remodeling marker; and the urine
      neopterin/creatinine ratio, a monocyte activation marker). Multiorgan function
      was evaluated by the total sequential organ failure assessment (tSOFA) score.
      Outcomes of interest were early survival, post-LVAD tSOFA score, and intensive
      care unit (ICU) length of stay. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had INTERMACS profiles 
      1 or 2 (Group A), and 15 had profiles 3 or 4 (Group B). At pre-implant, only IL-6
      levels and the IL-6/IL-10 ratio were higher in Group A vs B. After LVAD
      implantation, neopterin/creatinine ratio and IL-8 levels increased more in Group 
      A vs B. Osteopontin levels increased significantly only in Group B. The tSOFA
      score at 2 weeks post-LVAD and ICU duration were related with pre-implant IL-6
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: The INTERMACS profiles reflect the severity of the
      pre-operative inflammatory activation and the post-implant inflammatory response,
      affecting post-operative tSOFA score and ICU stay. Therefore, inflammation may
      contribute to poor outcome in patients with severe INTERMACS profile.

PG  - 312-8
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs067 [doi]
AB  - The problem of a growing patient population with end-stage heart failure and a
      fixed cardiac donor pool has stimulated the development of novel therapies for
      heart failure. Two therapeutic strategies have emerged with the potential to
      improve the landscape of the clinical management of heart failure. First, left
      ventricular assist device therapy is able to sustain the circulation of patients 
      in end-stage heart failure and may promote cardiac recovery. Secondly, stem cell 
      therapy can potentially be used to induce myocardial regeneration replacing lost 
      or non-functioning native myocardium. In this review, we present evidence that
      these strategies may overlap significantly in their mechanisms of action at the
      systems, organ, tissue and cellular levels. We review the current clinical
      evidence of their combined use.

AB  - We report the implantation of a HeartWare left ventricular assist device in a
      child. A 9-year-old girl presented in cardiogenic shock complicated by an embolic
      stroke. Catheter-based thrombolysis partially reversed the neurologic deficit,
      but worsening cardiac failure prompted consideration of mechanical circulatory
      support (MCS). Limited available pericardial space, anticoagulation requirements,
      and thromboembolic potential favored the use of the HeartWare left ventricular
      assist device (HeartWare International, Inc, Framingham, MA). After device
      implantation and intensive physical rehabilitation, the patient underwent
      successful cardiac transplantation after 60 days of support.

TI  - Multiple biomarkers for risk prediction in chronic heart failure.
PG  - 183-90
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.965020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies have suggested using a panel of biomarkers that measure
      diverse biological processes as a prognostic tool in chronic heart failure.
      Whether this approach improves risk prediction beyond clinical evaluation is
      unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicenter cohort of 1513 chronic systolic
      heart failure patients, we measured a contemporary biomarker panel consisting of 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, B-type natriuretic peptide,
      soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1, troponin I, soluble toll-like
      receptor-2, creatinine, and uric acid. From this panel, we calculated a
      parsimonious multimarker score and assessed its performance in predicting risk of
      death, cardiac transplantation, or ventricular assist device placement in
      comparison to an established clinical risk score, the Seattle Heart Failure Model
      (SHFM). During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, there were 317 outcomes: 187
      patients died; 99 were transplanted; and 31 had a ventricular assist device
      placed. In unadjusted Cox models, patients in the highest tertile of the
      multimarker score had a 13.7-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes compared
      with the lowest tertile (95% confidence interval, 8.75-21.5). These effects were 
      independent of the SHFM (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.80; 95% confidence interval,
      4.18-11.1). Addition of the multimarker score to the SHFM led to a significantly 
      improved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803 versus
      0.756 (P=0.003) and appropriately reclassified a significant number of patients
      who had the outcome into a higher risk category (net reclassification
      improvement, 25.2%; 95% confidence interval, 14.2-36.2%; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      In ambulatory chronic heart failure patients, a score derived from multiple
      biomarkers integrating diverse biological pathways substantially improves
      prediction of adverse events beyond current metrics.

TI  - Peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system as salvage treatment of
      patients with refractory cardiogenic shock: preliminary outcome evaluation.
PG  - E53-61

AB  - The novel Permanent Life Support (PLS; Maquet, Jostra Medizintechnik AG,
      Hirrlingen, Germany) as peripheral veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) support system has been investigated as treatment for patients
      with refractory cardiogenic shock (CS). Between January 2007 and July 2011, 73
      consecutive adult patients were supported on peripheral PLS ECMO system at our
      institution (55 men; age 60.3 +/- 11.6 years, range: 23-84 years). Indications
      for support were failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of
      postcardiotomy (n = 50) and primary donor graft failure (n = 8), post-acute
      myocardial infarction CS (n = 12), and CS on chronic heart failure (n = 3). Mean 
      support time was 10.9 +/- 7.6 days (range: 2-34 days). Overall, 26 (35.6%)
      patients died on ECMO. Among survivors on ECMO, 44 (60.2%) patients were
      successfully weaned from support, and three (4.1%) were switched to a
      mid-long-term ventricular assist device. Thirty-three (45.2%) were successfully
      discharged. The following variables were significantly different if survivors and
      nonsurvivors on ECMO were compared: age (P = 0.04), female gender (P < 0.01),
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ECMO (P < 0.01), lactate level before ECMO
      (P = 0.01), number of platelets, fresh frozen plasma units, and packed red blood 
      cells (PRBCs) transfused during ECMO support (P = 0.03, P = 0.02, and P < 0.01), 
      blood lactate level (P = 0.01), and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) relative
      index 72 h after ECMO initiation (P < 0.001), and multiple organ failure on ECMO 
      (P < 0.01). Stepwise logistic regression identified blood lactate level and CK-MB
      relative index at 72 h after ECMO initiation, and number of PRBCs transfused on
      ECMO as significant predictors of mortality on ECMO (P = 0.011, odds ratio [OR] =
      2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-3.12; P = 0.012, OR = 2.81, 95% CI =
      1.026-2.531; and P = 0.012, OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.02-5.21; respectively).
      Patients with an initial poor hemodynamic status could benefit by rapid
      peripheral installation of PLS ECMO. The blood lactate level, CK-MB relative
      index, and PRBCs transfused should be strictly monitored during ECMO support.

TI  - The relationship of QRS morphology and mechanical dyssynchrony to long-term
      outcome following cardiac resynchronization therapy.
PG  - 2680-91
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehs013 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Because benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) appear to be
      less favourable in non-left bundle branch block (LBBB) patients, this prospective
      longitudinal study tested the hypothesis that QRS morphology and
      echocardiographic mechanical dyssynchrony were associated with long-term outcome 
      after CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-eight consecutive New
      York Heart Association class III and IV CRT patients with QRS >/=120 ms and
      ejection fraction </=35% were studied. The pre-specified primary endpoint was
      death, heart transplant, or left ventricular assist device over 4 years.
      Dyssynchrony assessed before CRT included interventricular mechanical delay
      (IVMD) and speckle-tracking radial strain using pre-specified cut-offs for each. 
      Of 254 with baseline quantitative echocardiographic data available, 128 had LBBB,
      81 had intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), and 45 had right bundle branch
      block (RBBB). Radial dyssynchrony was observed in 85% of the patients with LBBB, 
      59% with IVCD*, and 40% with RBBB* (*P < 0.01 vs. LBBB). Of 248 (98%) with
      follow-up, LBBB patients had a significantly more favourable long-term survival
      than non-LBBB patients. However, non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a more
      favourable event-free survival than those without dyssynchrony: radial
      dyssynchrony hazard ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-4.53 (P =
      0.0008) and IVMD hazard ratio 4.9, 95% CI 2.60-9.16 (P = 0.0007). Right bundle
      branch block patients who lacked dyssynchrony had the least favourable outcome.
      CONCLUSION: Non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a more favourable long-term
      survival than non-LBBB patients who lacked dyssynchrony. Mechanical dyssynchrony 
      and QRS morphology are associated with outcome following CRT.

TI  - Prognosis of right ventricular failure in patients with left ventricular assist
      device based on decision tree with SMOTE.
PG  - 383-90
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2012.2187458 [doi]
AB  - Right ventricular failure is a significant complication following implantation of
      a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which increases morbidity and mortality.
      Consequently, researchers have sought predictors that may identify patients at
      risk. However, they have lacked sensitivity and/or specificity. This study
      investigated the use of a decision tree technology to explore the preoperative
      data space for combinatorial relationships that may be more accurate and precise.
      We retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 patients with initial LVAD
      implantation at the Artificial Heart Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical
      Center, between May 1996 and October 2009. Among those patients, 27 later
      required a right ventricular assist device (RVAD+) and 156 remained on LVAD
      (RVAD-) until the time of transplantation or death. A synthetic minority
      oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to the RVAD+ group to compensate for
      the disparity of sample size. Twenty-one resampling levels were evaluated, with
      decision tree model built for each. Among these models, the top six predictors of
      the need for an RVAD were transpulmonary gradient (TPG), age, international
      normalized ratio (INR), heart rate (HR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
      prothrombin time, and right ventricular systolic pressure. TPG was identified to 
      be the most predictive variable in 15 out of 21 models, and constituted the first
      splitting node with 7 mmHg as the breakpoint. Oversampling was shown to improve
      the senstivity of the models monotonically, although asymptotically, while the
      specificity was diminished to a lesser degree. The model built upon 5X synthetic 
      RVAD+ oversampling was found to provide the best compromise between sensitivity
      and specificity, included TPG (layer 1), age (layer 2), right atrial pressure
      (layer 3), HR (layer 4,7), INR (layer 4, 9), alanine aminotransferase (layer 5), 
      white blood cell count (layer 5,6, &7), the number of inotrope agents (layer 6), 
      creatinine (layer 8), AST (layer 9, 10), and cardiac output (layer 9). It
      exhibited 85% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 0.87 area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (RoC), which was found to be greatly improved
      compared to previously published studies.

AB  - Coexistence of aortic disease is an uncommon finding in end-stage heart failure
      patients requiring left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. A 38-year-old
      man with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted in stage D heart
      failure. Preoperative computed tomography demonstrated multiple saccular
      aneurysms of the ascending aorta and sinus of valsalva. We successfully performed
      complex aortic surgery and the implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD (HeartWare 
      HVAD) (HeartWare International, Framingham, MA). The postoperative course was
      uneventful. The patient is currently listed for heart transplantation.

PG  - 618-24
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.01.863 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients in cardiogenic shock require immediate circulatory support. 
      Outcomes of patients who underwent short-term ventricular assist device (STVAD)
      implantation in a community hospital (CH) as a bridge to a long-term VAD (LTVAD) 
      were compared with those who received both implants at the same tertiary hospital
      (TH). METHODS: Data were retrospectively reviewed for patients with a STVAD who
      were bridged to a LTVAD in a TH from 1997 to 2010. We studied outcomes and
      survival censored for cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients
      (73% male) were identified. Mean age was 52 +/- 16 years, 30% were diabetic, and 
      65% had intra-aortic balloon pump support. Reasons for STVAD implantation were an
      acute myocardial infarction, 38%; post-cardiotomy, 38%, decompensated chronic
      heart failure, 19%; and others, 5%. A STVAD was implanted in a CH in 20 patients 
      (54%), and they had fewer cardiovascular risk factors than those whose STVAD was 
      implanted at the TH. All patients at the CH were at Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 1 compared with 71% at the TH (p =
      0.014). Patients from the CH tended to die sooner after LTVAD implant, although
      long-term survival was similar. At the 1-year follow-up, 65% from the CH were
      alive or had received a transplant vs 60% from the TH. CONCLUSION: Patients with 
      cardiogenic shock in whom a STVAD was implanted in a CH and then were bridged to 
      a LTVAD in a TH had similar long-term survival as those bridged to LTVAD at the
      TH.

AB  - The Fourth Annual Report of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) summarizes and analyzes the first 5 years of
      patient and data collection. With more than 4,000 patients entered into the
      database, the evolution of pump technology, strategy at implant, and pre-implant 
      patient profiles are chronicled. A risk factor analysis of the entire adult
      primary implant population is provided, and the recent composition of patient
      profiles is examined. Current actuarial survival with continuous-flow pumps
      exceeds 80% at 1 year and 70% at 2 years.

TI  - Survival benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in left ventricular
      assist device-supported heart failure patients.
PG  - 140-5
LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2011.10.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) reduce mortality in
      heart failure (HF). In patients requiring a ventricular assist device (VAD), the 
      benefit from ICD therapy is not well established. The aim of this study was to
      define the impact of ICD on outcomes in VAD-supported patients. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We reviewed data for consecutive adult HF patients receiving VAD as a
      bridge to transplantation from 1996 to 2003. The primary outcome was survival to 
      transplantation. A total of 144 VADs were implanted [85 left ventricular (LVAD), 
      59 biventricular (BIVAD), mean age 50 +/- 12 years, 77% male, left ventricular
      ejection fraction 18 +/- 9%, 54% ischemic]. Mean length of support was 119 days
      (range 1-670); 103 patients (72%) survived to transplantation. Forty-five
      patients had an ICD (33 LVAD, 12 BIVAD). More LVAD patients had an appropriate
      ICD shock before implantation than after (16 vs 7; P = .02). There was a trend
      toward higher shock frequency before LVAD implant than after (3.3 +/- 5.2 vs 1.1 
      +/- 3.8 shocks/y; P = .06). Mean time to first shock after VAD implant was 129
      +/- 109 days. LVAD-supported patients with an ICD were significantly more likely 
      to survive to transplantation [1-y actuarial survival to transplantation: LVAD:
      91% with ICD vs 57% without ICD (log-rank P = .01); BIVAD: 54% vs 47% (log-rank P
      = NS)]. An ICD was associated with significantly increased survival in a
      multivariate model controlling for confounding variables (odds ratio 2.54, 95%
      confidence interval 1.04-6.21; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Shock frequency decreases
      after VAD implantation, likely owing to ventricular unloading, but appropriate
      ICD shocks still occur in 21% of patients. An ICD is associated with improved
      survival in LVAD-supported HF patients.

TI  - Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation as right heart support following left
      ventricular assist device placement: a new cannulation technique.
PG  - 218-20
LID - 10.1016/j.hlc.2011.12.003 [doi]
AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an established treatment for acute
      respiratory failure, or low cardiac output syndrome. This can be veno-venous, in 
      which de-oxygenated blood is drained from the venous system and oxygenated before
      being returned to the venous system, and veno-arterial where the re-oxygenated
      venous blood is returned to the arterial system. Haemorrhage, sepsis and
      thrombo-embolism are common and potentially lethal complications. Left
      ventricular assist devices are a continually evolving technology, that may be
      used as a bridge to transplantation or destination therapy in end-stage cardiac
      failure. The VentrAssist left ventricular assist device is a small implantable,
      continuous flow centrifugal pump, that is controlled and powered by a
      percutaneous lead. However, in these patients, right heart failure may present as
      an acute event following weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), or
      post-operatively in the intensive care unit. Patients who do not respond to
      inotropes and pulmonary vasodilators may need a right ventricular assist device
      (RVAD). We report a successful case of right heart assist extra corporeal
      membrane oxygenation used as temporary right heart support in combination with a 
      VentrAssist left ventricular assist device. The use of right heart assist extra
      corporeal membrane oxygenation to help a failing right heart during left
      ventricular assist device placement is not new, however, our technique describes 
      a novel method of cannulation of the femoral vein and pulmonary trunk via a
      tunnelled vascular tube graft, which allows the chest to be closed whilst on
      right heart support, and decannulation to proceed without resternotomy. This
      technique has also been used successfully subsequent to this.

AB  - Morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock remain high despite
      the recent advances in therapy. New temporary ventricular assist devices (VADs)
      that are rapidly applied to normalize cardiac output in patients with severe
      heart failure are being used more frequently. Bridge to decision describes the
      temporary use of a VAD to stabilize critically ill patients until complete
      diagnostic tests are performed and decisions about more definitive therapy are
      made. The CentriMag, TandemHeart, and Impella VADs offer versatility for use in
      many patients and in multiple hospital settings. These VADs provide continuous
      blood flow, altering the usual assessment of arterial blood pressure. Patients
      are usually immobilized during support to prevent dislodgement of cannulas.
      Anticoagulation therapy is commonly required, and bleeding is a frequent
      complication. Infection prevention measures must be used to avoid septic
      complications. In the past 10 years, clinical experience with these devices has
      expanded, but they remain underused.

TI  - Clinical experience with HeartWare left ventricular assist device in patients
      with end-stage heart failure.
PG  - 810-5
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.11.076 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gold standard treatment for end-stage heart failure is cardiac
      transplantation. Because of the increasing number of heart failure patients and
      the limited supply of donor hearts, a ventricular assist device (VAD) is used as 
      a bridge to transplantation, recovery, or decision. Newer generation VADs have
      lower risk of fatal adverse events and are also smaller in size. We present our
      experience with the intrapericardial HeartWare VAD (HeartWare, Framingham, MA)
      and its clinical outcome. METHODS: The clinical outcome of HeartWare VAD
      implantations for end-stage heart failure patients performed at Harefield
      Hospital from March 2007 to June 2011 was studied. The study design was a
      retrospective review of the prospectively collected data. RESULTS: Thirty-four
      patients with a mean age of 51+/-10 years were included in this study.
      Twenty-nine patients were male (85%). The mean duration of mechanical support was
      261+/-64 days. Five patients (15%) were successfully bridged to heart
      transplantation. The overall mortality was 24% (8 patients). There were 1 case of
      mechanical device failure (2%) and 3 cases of device failure due to thrombus
      formation (8%). Postoperative complications included 5 reoperations for bleeding 
      (15%), 12 acute renal failures (36%), 7 respiratory failures (21%), 2 hepatic
      dysfunctions (6%), 3 neurologic dysfunctions (9%), 7 right-side heart failures
      (21%), and 5 driveline infections (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Although cardiac
      transplantation remains the gold standard for treatment of end-stage heart
      failure patients, the HeartWare VAD can be used as a safe alternative with a
      satisfactory clinical outcome.

TI  - The paradox of left ventricular assist device unloading and myocardial recovery
      in end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy: implications for heart failure in the
      elderly.
PG  - 615-33
LID - 10.1007/s10741-012-9300-8 [doi]
AB  - Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common debilitating condition with limited
      therapeutic options besides heart transplantation or palliation. It is
      characterized by maladaptive remodeling of cardiomyocytes, extracellular collagen
      matrix (ECCM) and left ventricular (LV) geometry which contributes to further
      dysfunction. LV assist devices (LVADs) can reverse adverse remodeling in
      end-stage DCM. However, there is a disconnect between the benefits of prolonged
      unloading with LVAD at molecular and cellular levels and the low rate of bridge
      to recovery (BTR). Potential explanations for this paradox include insufficient
      reverse ECCM remodeling and/or excessive reverse cardiomyocyte remodeling with
      atrophy. LVAD therapy is associated with decreased collagen turnover and
      cross-linking and increased tissue angiotensin II (AngII), whereas LVAD combined 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition results in decreased tissue AngII
      and collagen cross-linking, normalizes LV end-diastolic pressure volume
      relationships and is associated with modestly higher rates of BTR. Much remains
      to be learned about ventricular reverse remodeling after LVAD. This can be
      facilitated through systematic collection and comparison of recovered and
      unrecovered myocardium. Importantly, vigilant monitoring for ventricular recovery
      among LVAD patients is needed, particularly in older patients receiving LVAD for 
      destination therapy. In addition, prospective multicenter trials are needed to
      clarify the potential benefit of concomitant heart failure therapy with selective
      beta2 agonism on ventricular recovery.

TI  - Haemodynamic modeling of the cardiovascular system using mock circulation loops
      to test cardiovascular devices.
PG  - 4301-4

AB  - Comprehensive testing and evaluation of cardiovascular device function and
      performance is required prior to clinical implementation. Initial proof of
      concept investigations are conducted within in-vitro mock circulation loops,
      before proof of principle is demonstrated via in-vivo animal testing. To
      facilitate the rapid transition of cardiovascular devices through this
      development period, a testing apparatus was developed that closely models the
      natural human cardiovascular system haemodynamics. This mock circulation system
      accurately replicates cardiac function, coupled to systemic and pulmonary
      circulations. The physiological response produced by a number of clinical
      cardiovascular conditions can be actively controlled by variable parameters such 
      as vascular resistance, arterial/venous compliance, ventricle contractility,
      heart rate, and heart /vascular volumes, while anatomical variations such as
      valve regurgitation and septal defects can be included. Auto-regulation of these 
      parameters was attempted to reproduce the Frank-Starling mechanism, baroreceptor 
      reflex, skeletal muscle pump, and postural changes. Steady state validation of
      loop performance was achieved by replicating the progression of a patient's
      clinical haemodynamics from heart failure, through VAD support, to heart
      transplantation. The system has been used to evaluate pulsatile and non-pulsatile
      ventricular assist devices, counter pulsation devices, non-invasive cardiac
      output monitors and cardiovascular stents. The interaction of these devices with 
      the cardiovascular system was also investigated with regards to physiological
      control strategies and cannula placement. The system is a valuable tool for the
      accelerated progression of cardiovascular device development.

TI  - Experience with more than 100 total artificial heart implants.
PG  - 727-34
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.12.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The SynCardia Total Artificial Heart (SynCardia Systems Inc, Tucson,
      Ariz) has been used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation in 930 patients
      worldwide and in 101 patients in our program. Our experience with SynCardia Total
      Artificial Heart implantation documents its indications, safety, and efficacy.
      METHODS: Data regarding preoperative condition, mortality, and morbidity have
      been reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: From January 1993 to December 2009, 101
      patients had bridge to transplant procedures with the SynCardia Total Artificial 
      Heart. Ninety-one percent of cases were Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support profile 1, and the remaining 9% of cases were
      failing medical therapy on multiple inotropic medications. The mean support time 
      was 87 days (median, 53 days; range, 1-441 days). Pump outputs during support
      were 7 to 9 L/min. Adverse events included strokes in 7.9% of cases and take-back
      for hemorrhage in 24.7% of cases. Survival to transplantation was 68.3%. Causes
      of death of 32 patients on device support included multiple organ failure (13),
      pulmonary failure (6), and neurologic injury (4). Survival after transplantation 
      at 1, 5, and 10 years was 76.8%, 60.5%, and 41.2%, respectively. The longest-term
      survivor is currently alive 16.4 years postimplantation. CONCLUSIONS: These
      patients were not candidates for left ventricular assist device therapy and were 
      expected to die. The SynCardia Total Artificial Heart offers a real alternative
      for survival with a reasonable complication rate in appropriate candidates who
      otherwise might have been assigned to hospice care.

TI  - Increase of ABCG2/BCRP+ side population stem cells in myocardium after
      ventricular unloading.
PG  - 318-24
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.11.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant decrease in mean cardiomyocyte DNA content and
      increased numbers of diploid cardiomyocytes after unloading has been
      demonstrated, suggesting a numerical increase of cardiomyocytes. Despite a
      thorough search in that study, no mitoses explaining a potential net increase of 
      cardiomyocytes has been observed. The heart harbors several stem cell
      populations, including c-kit (CD117)(+) stem cells and side population cells
      (SPC), which may proliferate after unloading and thus contribute to the
      generation of diploid cardiomyocytes. In this study we sought to determine,
      whether there is an increase of ABCG2(+) SPC and CD117(+) stem cells after
      unloading. METHODS: In paired myocardial samples (prior to and after LVAD), the
      number of cells with immunoexpression of ABCG2, c-kit/CD117 and MEF-2 was
      assessed by immunohistochemistry. Their number was morphometrically determined
      and these data were correlated with the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. RESULTS: 
      A significant increase of SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2
      after unloading was observed from 0.00013% in CHF to 0.0011%, and 0.013% to
      0.035%, respectively after unloading (p = 0.001). A significant positive
      correlation between both SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2
      expression was observed (p = 0.007 and 0.01). No correlation was found between
      the number of SPC and the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. CONCLUSIONS: SPC are
      increased significantly in the myocardium after ventricular unloading, suggesting
      a role for stem cell proliferation during "reverse cardiac remodeling." These
      cells might proliferate and commit to different cell lineages, such as
      cardiomyocytes or endothelium, and thus ameliorate cardiac function.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are approved as "destination therapy"
      (permanent use without plans for transplantation) in individuals with advanced
      heart failure who are not candidates for a cardiac transplant; as such, these
      devices are increasingly being used in older adults. Although LVADs have been
      shown to increase quality of life and survival, the associated treatment burdens 
      and complications deserve careful consideration. The current study illustrates
      myriad clinical challenges that can arise during long-term mechanical support
      using an older adult case history. Current data on LVAD use in older adults is
      reviewed, and a discussion of relevant points to consider before LVAD
      implantation in older adults, including advance care planning, assessment of gait
      and cognition, and the potential for substantial caregiver burden, is undertaken.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support for elderly heart failure patients.
PG  - 663-9
LID - 10.1007/s10741-012-9298-y [doi]
AB  - End-stage systolic heart failure is an increasingly common problem in elderly
      patients and is associated with high cost, poor quality of life, and poor
      outcomes. Mechanical circulatory support is a promising therapy as both a bridge 
      to transplantation and destination therapy. Elderly patients are frequently
      ineligible for heart transplantation because of their age and comorbidities, and 
      the application of mechanical circulatory support for destination therapy in this
      population is not well defined. A review of the literature was undertaken to
      better characterize our experience to date with mechanical circulatory support in
      older heart failure populations. Mechanical circulatory support is being employed
      increasingly for destination therapy indications in older patients. The newer
      continuous flow devices appear to have disproportionate advantage in elderly
      patients, which has translated into marked improvement in 1- and 2-year survival.
      The rational implementation of MCS devices in elderly heart failure patients
      needs to focus on (1) continuous flow devices that appear to have particular
      benefit in this population, (2) extensive pre-MCS assessment including variables 
      relating to frailty, and (3) intervening before these patients develop
      cardiogenic shock. More data are needed on the cost-benefit analysis of routine
      use of CF devices as destination therapy in elderly patients with heart failure.

TI  - Perceived quality of life of children after successful bridging to heart
      transplantation.
PG  - 381-6
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.11.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support is increasingly used to bridge
      children with end-stage heart failure to transplant. Quality of life (QoL) has
      not been systematically evaluated in children bridged to heart transplant.
      METHODS: All children transplanted for cardiomyopathy during 2001 to 2008 and
      currently being followed at our center (n = 84) had QoL assessed during 2006 to
      2009, at a median of 3 years post-transplant, using a validated generic measure
      (PedsQL4.0). RESULTS: Twenty-six children, aged 2.7 to 18 (median 7.4) years who 
      were bridged to transplant, were compared with 58 children, aged 2.0 to 18.0
      (median 13.0) years, who were transplanted in the same era without bridging.
      There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any domains of QoL 
      assessed by children or parents, although the small number of bridged patients
      increases the likelihood of a Type II error. Bridged children who were younger (r
      = 0.48, p = 0.02) or more recently transplanted (r = 0.42, p = 0.04) were scored 
      by their parents as having poorer emotional QoL. Regression analysis indicated
      that age at transplant was the only medical or demographic variable associated
      with parent-reported total QoL scores (beta = 0.27, p = 0.01). With few links
      between QoL scores and medical or demographic factors, other subjective
      psychologic factors may be of greater salience in determining QoL. CONCLUSIONS:
      Despite greater severity of illness, children who required mechanical bridging to
      transplantation report a QoL comparable to that of other children undergoing
      heart transplantation. Younger children may require greater psychologic support
      to reach their full potential in terms of QoL.

AB  - There are minimal data regarding chronic management of single-ventricle
      ventricular assist device (VAD) patients. This study aims to describe our
      center's multidisciplinary team management of single-ventricle patients supported
      long term with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric VAD. Patient #1 was a 4-year-old 
      with double-outlet right ventricle with aortic atresia, L-looped ventricles, and 
      heart block who developed heart failure 1 year after Fontan. She initially
      required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and was transitioned to
      Berlin Heart systemic VAD. She was supported for 363 days (cardiac intensive care
      unit [CICU] 335 days, floor 28 days). The postoperative course was complicated by
      intermittent infection including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
      intermittent hepatic and renal insufficiencies, and transient antithrombin,
      protein C, and protein S deficiencies resulting in multiple thrombi. She had a
      total of five pump changes over 10 months. Long-term medical management included 
      anticoagulation with enoxaparin, platelet inhibition with aspirin and
      dipyridamole, and antibiotic prophylaxis using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. She
      developed sepsis of unknown etiology and subsequently died from multiorgan
      failure. Patient #2 was a 4-year-old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who
      developed heart failure 2 years after bidirectional Glenn shunt. At systemic VAD 
      implantation, he was intubated with renal insufficiency. Post-VAD implantation,
      his renal insufficiency resolved, and he was successfully extubated to daytime
      nasal cannula and biphasic positive airway pressure at night. He was supported
      for 270 days (CICU 143 days, floor 127 days). The pump was upsized to a 50-mL
      pump in May 2011 for increased central venous pressures (29 mm Hg). Long-term
      medical management included anticoagulation with warfarin and single-agent
      platelet inhibition using dipyridamole due to aspirin resistance. He developed
      increased work of breathing requiring intubation, significant anasarca, and
      bleeding from the endotracheal tube. The family elected to withdraw support.
      Although both patients died prior to heart transplantation, a consistent
      specialized multidisciplinary team approach to the medical care of our VAD
      patients, consisting of cardiothoracic surgeons, heart transplant team,
      hematologists, pharmacists, infectious disease physicians, psychiatrists,
      specialty trained bedside nursing, and nurse practitioners, allowed us to manage 
      these patients long term while awaiting heart transplantation.

PG  - 195-208
LID - 10.1038/nrcardio.2011.205 [doi]
AB  - This Review explores contemporary circulatory support in profound postinfarction 
      cardiogenic shock. Frequently, death is the only alternative to implantation of a
      blood pump, so prospective randomized trials of device versus medical treatment
      are unacceptable and evidence is derived from clinical experience. Irrespective
      of ACC/AHA and European guidelines, no study has shown survival benefit for the
      intra-aortic balloon pump in patients with established shock. In the past 10
      years, the safety and durability of mechanical blood pumps has improved
      considerably. New temporary and long-term rotary pumps have transformed outcomes 
      for patients with acute heart failure. For urgent resuscitation, outreach
      salvage, and transportation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a
      reliable, but time limited, first step. ECMO decompresses the venous system,
      provides flow, and ensures oxygenation, but does not unload the failing left
      ventricle. Myocardial stunning takes days, and sometimes weeks, to recover.
      Effective ventricular unloading is best achieved by surgical implantation of a
      temporary rotary or volume-displacement pump. After cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation, hemodynamic stabilization allows assessment of cerebral injury and
      prognosis. Published series demonstrate that 50-75% of patients with profound
      shock can be salvaged either through native heart recovery, urgent
      transplantation, or switch to a long-term pump.

TI  - Ventricular assist device implantation in patients on percutaneous extracorporeal
      life support without switching to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass system.
PG  - 1366-70
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezr203 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation using cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB) is an established procedure. However, the well-described
      complications of CPB may exacerbate multiple organ failure and increase blood
      product transfusions especially in end-stage heart failure patients. METHODS: We 
      describe our successful experience in six consecutive patients with profound
      cardiogenic shock, who were provided on an emergency basis with a percutaneous
      extracorporeal life support (ECLS) system via the peripheral vessels. After
      stabilization, a VAD was implanted using ECLS without switching to a conventional
      CPB system to reduce its side effects. We compared the data with those of 11
      patients in whom the VAD was placed with the aid of an additional CPB system.
      RESULTS: The six patients demonstrated a shorter duration of operating room time 
      compared with the patients requiring CPB for device placement. During and after
      surgery, blood loss and blood product transfusions were lower in these patients. 
      The need for mechanical ventilation and inotropic support was shorter and the
      survival rate (100% at 30 days, 83.3% at 3 months and 83.3% at 6 months) was
      higher when compared with patients who were operated upon with CPB. Two patients 
      were successfully bridged to transplantation. One patient died due to cerebral
      bleeding after 7 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that VAD
      implantation using percutaneous ECLS without switching to conventional CPB is a
      safe alternative in the bridge to bridge concept, especially in high-risk
      patients with cardiogenic shock who would benefit from the avoidance of the
      adverse sequels associated with conventional CPB.

TI  - Does listing for heart transplant for longer than 30 days before ventricular
      assist device implantation influence utilization of psychotherapeutic support and
      outcome?
PG  - 1371-6; discussion 1376
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezr233 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies indicate that patients with mechanical ventricular
      assist devices (VADs) experience high psychosocial and emotional distress.
      Listing for transplant may trigger psychosocial adjustment to the transplantation
      as an upcoming critical life-event. We hypothesized that patients could profit
      from this adaptation when implantation of a VAD becomes necessary. METHODS: We
      arbitrarily chose a cut-off at 30 days after being put on the heart
      transplantation (HTX) waiting list. Eighteen patients were listed for HTX for >30
      days (referred to as 'listed') and 26 for shorter periods or not at all
      ('non-listed'). Survival, the occurrence of mental disorders, the number of
      contacts of the patient with the psychologist and times spent on
      psychotherapeutic support for both patient groups and for their families were
      analysed. RESULTS: Survival after VAD implantation (observation time) and mental 
      disorders were comparable for listed and non-listed patients. Mental disorders
      were developed in 80% of all patients irrespective of the listing group. The
      utilization of supportive psychotherapy did not differ between the listed and the
      non-listed group with regard to the number of contacts and to the time needed for
      individual therapy. Moreover, the number of families who requested support did
      not differ between the groups nor did the time spent on family therapy. However, 
      the number of contacts and the time for individual psychotherapeutic support
      correlated with the observation time, whereas the time spent on family therapy
      did not. In contrast, family therapy correlated inversely with age. In addition, 
      we compared bridge-to-transplantation patients with destination therapy patients.
      There were no differences in the occurrence of mental disorders, the number of
      contacts or in the time expenses for individual and for family therapy, neither
      for all patients nor after stratification for listing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      indicate that listing for HTX for >30 days before VAD implantation does not
      reduce the utilization of psychotherapeutic support by VAD patients. We assume
      that structured emotional and psychosocial support by the interdisciplinary VAD
      team, including professional supportive psychotherapy, is indispensable for
      successful coping of VAD patients and their families.

TI  - Prediction of true circulatory decompensation in chronic heart failure for
      optimal timing of mechanical circulatory support: non-invasive
      arterial-ventricular coupling.
PG  - 100-13
LID - 10.3390/jfb3010100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prospective comparative studies to predict the risk of hemodynamic
      deterioration in patients referred for transplantation were performed on the
      basis of standard invasive and non-invasive data and new wave intensity (WI)
      parameters. METHODS AND RESULTS: Study Group 1 consisted of 151 consecutive
      outpatients (age 48.7 +/- 12 years; 110 men) with end-stage dilative
      cardiomyopathy. Group 2, consisting of 11 consecutive patients (age 50 +/- 11
      years; 6 men) with sinus rhythm and "true" decompensation, was used to create
      "critical values" of WI. There were no demographic or somatic (weight and height)
      differences between the groups. The follow-up period of ambulatory patients was
      31 +/- 8 months. Non-invasive WI was studied in the common carotid artery.
      Complete invasive and non-invasive data were also recorded on the day of
      investigation. During follow-up 44 pts were lost; there were 15 cardiac deaths
      (10%), life-saving ventricular assist device implantation in 10 (6.6%) and
      transplantation in 19 (12.7%). For statistical purposes this group was named the 
      "events" Group B (n = 44). A predisposing factor for events (death, "true"
      decompensation and "urgent" transplantation in ambulatory patients) was low first
      peak ("cut-off value" assessed in Group 2 < 4100 mmHg*s(3)) (OR 45.6, CI
      14.5-143.3, p < 0.001). Less powerful predictors of the risk of deterioration
      were pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure
      (PAP) and E/A mitral wave relation (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The new
      ventricular-arterial coupling parameter 1st peak of WI can potentially be used to
      distinguish patients at high risk for true deterioration and death. This
      parameter can be used to predict the need for assist device implantation.

TI  - Safety of Long-Term Mechanical Support With Berlin Heart EXCOR in Pediatric
      Patients.
PG  - 72-6
LID - 10.1177/2150135111417459 [doi]
AB  - Background. The Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatrics is utilized at our center as a
      bridge to transplantation or bridge to recovery. This retrospective study reviews
      our results regarding the safety of long-term support and outcome. Methods.
      Between January 2008 and December 2010, 12 patients (6 females and 6 males)
      underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device. The median weight was 14.2
      kg (range 4.2-51.6 kg) and the median age was 4.12 years (range 0.25-11.83
      years). All patients were on inotropes, five patients required mechanical
      ventilation and three patients experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
      Results. Eight patients received a left ventricular assist device and four
      patients received a biventricular assist device. Of the 12 patients, 8 were
      bridge to heart transplantation, in 2 patients explantation was possible, and 1
      patient died on support. The median support time for these 11 patients was 151
      days (range 4-488 days), with 2124 days of cardiac support. One patient is on
      support. Survival rate was 91.6%. Seven patients had a blood pump change once.
      Four patients had local signs of infection. There was no mediastinitis and
      thromboembolism. One patient had intracerebral hemorrhage. There was no death
      after heart transplantation or after explantation of the device. Conclusions. The
      Berlin Heart EXCOR is effective in bridging children of almost all ages and sizes
      to cardiac transplantation or myocardial recovery. Our experience proved that
      long-term support is possible with a low rate of adverse events.

TI  - Heart transplantations at the Heart Center IKEM, Prague, Czech Republic.
PG  - 135-43
AB  - The heart transplant program at the Institute for Clinical and Experimental
      Medicine in Prague was established on January 31, 1984. Through November 2012,
      881 orthotopic cardiac transplantations have been performed, with an annual rate 
      of about 40 procedures. Current legislation concerning solid organ
      transplantations in the Czech Republic is described. Like other centers, we have 
      noticed an increasing age of donors, and, reflecting the shortage of grafts, we
      have expanded our selection criteria for heart transplantation. The advent of a
      mechanical circulatory support program at our center in April 2003 has given us
      another valuable tool in the management of chronic heart failure patients.
      Currently, around half of our patients are transplanted from mechanical support. 
      Nonischemic etiology of heart failure is a leading cause of transplantation at
      our center, followed by ischemic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart lesions, and
      adult congenital heart diseases. Our current immunosupression protocol, including
      induction therapy, is outlined in detail and survival rates, as well as most
      common complications and our treatment strategies, are also discussed.

AB  - The cardiac transplantation program at Cleveland Clinic has performed 1,627 adult
      orthotopic heart transplants, with a current 1-year survival of 96% and a 3-year 
      survival of 82%. The change in the heart allocation system in 2006 has affected
      our Center by both reducing the number of transplants we perform annually and
      increasing the percentage of recipients on MCS at the time of transplant. Despite
      the increased utilization of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge 
      to transplant, we continue to maintain excellent outcomes. The major clinical
      advances in LVAD technology have allowed us to expand this therapy to ineligible 
      transplant patients, with outcomes that are continually improving. Nevertheless, 
      the field of MCS as permanent therapy is still in its infancy. The number of
      patients who can benefit from this technology in the U.S. alone is in the
      thousands, but refinements in patient selection and management are needed to
      further advance this lifesaving therapy.

TI  - Imaging of left ventricular device complications.
PG  - W35-41
LID - 10.1097/RTI.0b013e318232e5e4 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices have become an increasingly common life-extending
      therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. These devices may be used as a
      bridge to transplant, destination therapy, or to recovery, providing either
      pulsatile or nonpulsatile support. Because of the increasing frequency of left
      ventricular assist device utilization and the improved short-term and long-term
      survival after placement, there has been a parallel increase in the radiologic
      imaging of patients with these devices, mandating radiologists' awareness of the 
      manifestations of common complications, including infection, thrombosis and
      embolism, cannula obstruction, hemorrhage, and complications of adjacent vessels 
      and viscera, all of which will be discussed in this pictorial essay.

TI  - Myocardial G protein receptor-coupled kinase expression correlates with
      functional parameters and clinical severity in advanced heart failure.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2011.10.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In heart failure (HF), sympathetic hyperactivation induces
      deleterious effects in myocardial beta-adrenergic signaling, with receptor
      down-regulation and desensitization mediated by G protein receptor-coupled
      kinases (GRKs). We hypothesised that changes in GRK isoforms may be associated
      with clinical status in advanced HF, using the Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) scale. METHODS: We included
      31 patients with advanced HF undergoing transplantation. According to INTERMACS
      profiles, mRNA and protein levels of GRK isoforms in left ventricular (LV)
      myocardium were analyzed and compared with nonfailing LV samples. RESULTS: In
      failing LV myocardium, GRK2 and GRK5 (but not GRK3) protein was up-regulated
      compared with control samples. Among HF patients, an increase in GRK2 and GRK5
      mRNA and protein abundance was observed in beta-agonist-treated patients (vs
      beta-blockers: P < .05) and in higher-risk INTERMACS status (profiles 2 and 3 vs 
      4 and 5: P < .05). A significant negative correlation of GRK2 expression with LV 
      stroke volume supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Increased GRK2 correlates
      with clinical severity using the INTERMACS scale and LV stroke volume, supporting
      it as a potential target in advanced HF. These changes are paralleled by GRK5
      expression in the failing myocardium, suggesting a relevant role in human HF.

AB  - In this report, we presented a patient who benefited from hemodynamic support
      with the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD; Cardiac
      Assist, Inc) implantation in the setting of early acute graft rejection 2 months 
      after orthotopic heart transplant. The TandemHeart initially had been used for
      temporary hemodynamic assistance during postcardiotomy heart failure and
      high-risk coronary interventions. More recently, its use in patients with
      cardiogenic shock from acute myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis, and
      critical aortic stenosis has been reported. To our knowledge, this is one of the 
      first reported cases in which the TandemHeart pVAD served as a successful device 
      for support during acute cardiac transplant rejection.

TI  - Decision tree for adjuvant right ventricular support in patients receiving a left
      ventricular assist device.
PG  - 140-9
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.11.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) failure is a significant complication after
      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). It is therefore
      important to identify patients at risk a priori. However, prognostic models
      derived from multivariate analyses have had limited predictive power. METHODS:
      This study retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 LVAD recipients between
      May 1996 and October 2009; of these, 27 later required a RVAD (RVAD(+)) and 156
      remained on LVAD only (RVAD(-)) until transplant or death. A decision tree model 
      was constructed to represent combinatorial non-linear relationships of the
      pre-operative data that are predictive of the need for RVAD support. RESULTS: An 
      optimal set of 8 pre-operative variables were identified: transpulmonary
      gradient, age, right atrial pressure, international normalized ratio, heart rate,
      white blood cell count, alanine aminotransferase, and the number of inotropic
      agents. The resultant decision tree, which consisted of 28 branches and 15
      leaves, identified RVAD(+) patients with 85% sensitivity, RVAD(-) patients with
      83% specificity, and exhibited an area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: The decision tree model developed in
      this study exhibited several advantages compared with existing risk scores.
      Quantitatively, it provided improved prognosis of RV support by encoding the
      non-linear, synergic interactions among pre-operative variables. Because of its
      intuitive structure, it more closely mimics clinical reasoning and therefore can 
      be more readily interpreted. Further development with additional multicenter,
      longitudinal data may provide a valuable prognostic tool for triage of LVAD
      therapy and, potentially, improve outcomes.

TI  - Neurocognitive function in destination therapy patients receiving continuous-flow
      vs pulsatile-flow left ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 27-36
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.10.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) improved survival in destination therapy (DT)
      patients during a randomized trial compared with pulsatile-flow LVADs. This study
      documented changes in cognitive performance in DT patients from that trial to
      determine if there were differences between continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow
      support. METHODS: Data were collected in a sub-study from 96 HeartMate II
      continuous-flow and 30 HeartMate XVE pulsatile-flow LVAD patients from 12 of the 
      35 trial sites that followed the same serial neurocognitive (NC) testing protocol
      at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after LVAD implantation. Spatial perception,
      memory, language, executive functions, and processing speed were the domains
      assessed with 10 standard cognitive measures. Differences over time and between
      LVAD type were evaluated with linear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: From 1 to
      24 months after LVAD implantation, changes in NC functions were stable or showed 
      improvement in all domains, and there were no differences between the
      continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow groups. Data at 24 months were only available 
      from patients with the continuous-flow LVAD due to the limited durability of the 
      HeartMate XVE device. There was no decline in any NC domain over the time of LVAD
      support. Missing data not collected from patients who died could have resulted in
      a bias toward inflated study results. CONCLUSIONS: The NC performance of advanced
      heart failure patients supported with continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow LVADs
      shows stabilization or improvement during support for up to 24 months.

      future outlook.
PG  - 332-47

AB  - The increasing global prevalence of congestive heart failure is a major
      healthcare concern, accounting for a high morbidity rate worldwide. In
      particular, isolated right heart dysfunction after cardiotomy has a poor
      prognosis and is associated with a high mortality rate. The occurrence of
      postoperative right heart failure may develop in more than 40% of patients
      undergoing implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and cardiac
      transplantation. To date, mechanical cardiac assistance in the form of VADs has
      become accepted as a therapeutic solution for end-stage patients when a donor
      heart is not available. However, right ventricular (RV) assistance is still in
      the early phase of development when compared with LVAD technology.
      State-of-the-art RVADs, both in clinical use and under development, are reviewed 
      in this manuscript. Clinical RVADs include the extracorporeal pulsatile Abiomed
      BVS 5000 and AB5000, Thoratec PVAD, MEDOS VAD, BerlinHeart Excor, the
      percutaneous continuous flow CentriMag and TandemHeart systems, and the
      implantable Thoratec IVAD. Devices on the horizon, including the wear-free
      implantable DexAide and the minimally invasive Impella RD, are additionally
      reviewed. In addition to the current status of RV assistance, as well as the
      device categorization, the outlook and considerations for successful development 
      of future RVADs were discussed.

TI  - Miniaturization of left ventricular assist devices: the ongoing trend.
PG  - 49-58
LID - 10.1586/ERD.11.62 [doi]
AB  - The shortage of appropriate donor hearts and the expanding pool of patients
      waiting for a heart transplantation have led to growing interest in alternative
      strategies, particularly in mechanical circulatory support. With expanding
      clinical experience and continued technical advances, continuous-flow pumps are
      evolving from bridge to transplantation to destination therapy for advanced heart
      failure. This review describes the clinical use and outcome of currently
      available miniaturized left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). It provides an
      outlook of the ongoing process of the miniaturization of LVADs, new concepts of
      partial support and, furthermore, it commentates on the current challenges with
      LVADs and the 5-year perspective.

AB  - Improvement of heart failure therapy has led to a far better survival and quality
      of life of patients. Treatment of the underlying disease, patient education and
      improvement of compliance and consequent upgrading of medical heart failure
      therapy often delays further progression to an advanced stage of heart failure.
      Nevertheless heart failure remains a chronic progressive disease and it is up to 
      the treating clinician to identify the signs of advanced heart failure in a
      timely manner in order to evaluate patients for further treatment strategies such
      as heart transplantation. This article should help define advanced heart failure 
      and illustrate how patients are evaluated for further therapy. Outcome of heart
      transplantation or mechanically assisted circulatory support is strongly
      associated to proper patient selection and timing.

TI  - Impact of preoperative percutaneous cardiopulmonary support on outcome following 
      left ventricular assist device implantation.
PG  - 88-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of
      preoperative percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) on long-term survival
      following implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, we used implantable (n=12) and paracorporeal
      (n=91) LVADs in 103 consecutive cardiomyopathy patients as a bridge to
      transplantation. Prior to LVAD implantation, all patients received inotropes, and
      25 patients (24%) received PCPS because of cardiogenic shock. Postoperatively,
      there were no early mortalities within 30 days after surgery, and patients
      survived on LVAD for 560+/-391 days, of whom 9 patients recovered and 32
      underwent heart transplantation after 711+/-360 days of LVAD support. More
      patients with preoperative PCPS required nitric oxide inhalation and prolonged
      inotropic support to maintain adequate LVAD flow. In addition, bilirubin level at
      1 month after LVAD implantation was significantly higher in patients with
      preoperative PCPS. Cox regression analysis identified preoperative PCPS support
      as the only significant predictor for death after LVAD implantation and overall
      survival was significantly better in patients without preoperative PCPS.
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite adequate hemodynamic support after LVAD implantation,
      patients with preoperative PCPS had significantly worse survival. LVAD should be 
      used for patients with end-stage heart failure, before PCPS is required for
      hemodynamic support.

AB  - The medical community has seen an explosive rise in the utilization of
      implantable mechanical circulatory support devices for late-stage cardiomyopathy.
      Care for these complex patients requires a basic understanding of device
      physiology and potential complications. This review focuses on an algorithm that 
      incorporates a careful clinical history and examination with diagnostic
      modalities for the evaluation of a patient who is failing therapy with a
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device, as well as the general management
      and optimization of patients implanted with an artificial heart.

TI  - Surgical procedures for patients receiving mechanical cardiac support.
PG  - 1314-7
AB  - Mechanical cardiac support devices are used for patients with cardiopulmonary
      failure. We reviewed our institutional experience with noncardiac surgical
      procedures (NCPs) in patients supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs, n = 
      198) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 165) between July 1998 and
      June 2010. In total, 64 NCPs were performed in 55 VAD patients and 14 NCPs in 14 
      ECMO patients. Thirty-day mortality was higher for the VAD compared with the ECMO
      group (25 vs 86%; P < 0.001) and was greater for emergent compared with
      nonemergent procedures (58 vs 19%; P < 0.001). Excluding tracheostomy, no
      patients died within 30 days of a nonemergent procedure. Kaplan-Meier survival
      showed a trend toward worse survival after NCP in ECMO patients, but NCP did not 
      alter survival in VAD patients. Fewer VAD patients were bridged to heart
      transplantation when NCP was required, and time from device implantation to
      transplant was significantly longer than for patients without NCP. In summary,
      this is the largest series of NCPs on VAD support and the only series on ECMO.
      Mortality is substantial for ECMO patients. Selected procedures can be performed 
      safely in VAD patients but will delay heart transplantation.

TI  - Initial experience of conversion of Toyobo paracorporeal left ventricular assist 
      device to DuraHeart left ventricular assist device.
PG  - 372-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: This report details experience of the conversion of the Toyobo left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD; Nipro, Osaka, Japan) to the DuraHeart LVAD
      (TerumoHeart, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) in patients awaiting heart transplantation.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight patients (4 male, 4 female) with Toyobo paracorporeal 
      LVAD underwent conversion to the third-generation centrifugal (DuraHeart) LVAD.
      The apical cuff of the Toyobo was not exchanged because the size was the same as 
      that of the DuraHeart. All conversion operations were performed safely, but 3
      patients who had infection of the Toyobo LVAD cannulation site prior to
      conversion suffered later pocket infections and 1 patient died because of sepsis.
      One patient underwent heart transplantation and 6 of 8 patients were awaiting
      heart transplantation at home. CONCLUSIONS: Conversions from the Toyobo LVAD to
      the DuraHeart LVAD were performed safely. Considering that implantable LVADs
      provide superior long-term survival and quality of life, conversion is a
      reasonable decision for Toyobo LVAD users in whom there are no infections.

AB  - During the last decade, ventricular assist devices (VADs) have become a precious 
      tool to support children with end-stage heart failure. However, thromboembolic
      events, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. We
      retrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)
      in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in a
      pediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March
      31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),
      median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a left
      VAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwent
      heart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient is
      still on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days of
      assistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of nine
      patients (56%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When compared
      with noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median
      131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care 
      unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and a
      longer length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR
      34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced for
      thromboembolic issues, most of them (67%) in patients with VAD-related
      infections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BH
      endocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,
      12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venous
      catheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinary
      catheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanical
      ventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Of
      the 17 isolated pathogens, 53% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence of
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25%),
      three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50% of all isolated pseudomonads),
      and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients with
      infected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospital
      with increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.

AB  - Anticoagulation of children on mechanical circulatory support presents a
      challenge. We implanted 28 devices in children and infants using a consistent
      anticoagulation protocol. We performed a retrospective review of all children
      implanted in our program with mechanical assist devices since 1997. Heparin,
      dipyridamole, and aspirin were used for anticoagulation and antiaggregation.
      Coagulation monitoring included thromboelastography (TEG), platelet aggregration 
      studies, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and
      platelet count. Twenty-eight children, ages 1 month to 16 years (mean 5.3; median
      2.4 years), were implanted for 3-107 days (mean 27; median 17). Eighteen received
      left ventricular assist devices, seven received biventricular assist devices, and
      three received total artificial hearts. Adverse events during the 720 days of
      device support included the following: six (21%) reoperations for bleeding; seven
      strokes (25%): two fatal, two with a mild residual deficit, and three without
      deficit; and three (11%) visceral emboli: two fatal and one nonfatal. There were 
      eight deaths (29%). Causes of death were embolic (four), graft failure
      post-transplantation (one), preimplant anoxic brain damage (two), and postexplant
      heart failure (one). 24/28 (86%) survived to transplantation or weaning from
      device and 20/28 (71%) were discharged from the hospital, 10 after
      transplantation and 10 after native heart recovery. All 20 early survivors
      survived long term. We describe an anticoagulation protocol based upon TEG and
      platelet aggregation studies and using heparin, aspirin, and dipyridamole.
      Adequate anticoagulation is more difficult in children. However, 71% of the
      patients in our study survived long term.

AB  - Chronic heart failure is a major healthcare problem associated with high
      morbidity and mortality. Despite significant progress in treatment strategies,
      the prognosis of heart failure patients remains poor. The golden standard
      treatment for heart failure is heart transplantation after failure of medical
      therapy, surgery and/or cardiac resynchronisation therapy. In order to improve
      patients' outcome and quality of life, new emerging treatment modalities are
      currently being investigated, including mechanical cardiac support devices, of
      which the left ventricular assist device is the most promising treatment option. 
      Structured care for heart failure patients according to the most recent
      international heart failure guidelines may further contribute to optimal
      decision-making. This article will review the conventional and novel treatment
      modalities of heart failure.

AB  - In severe, acute or chronic heart failure, the heart and the circulation can be
      mechanically supported, if the patient's life is in danger despite maximal drug
      therapy, and other cardiologic or heart surgery treatment options or a suitable
      heart transplant are not available. Long-term prognosis of those treated with
      mechanical support has improved in the 2000's. This is based on technically
      advanced equipment, improved treatment practices, properly targeted patient
      selection and more accurate timing of therapy.

TI  - Markers of extracellular matrix turnover and the development of right ventricular
      failure after ventricular assist device implantation in patients with advanced
      heart failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic and metabolically
      active collagenous network that responds to mechanical strain. The association
      between ECM turnover and right ventricular failure (RVF) development after left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in patients with advanced heart
      failure (HF) was investigated. METHODS: Circulating levels of osteopontin,
      metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MPP-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and
      TIMP-4 were measured in 61 patients at LVAD implantation and explantation and in 
      10 control subjects. RVF was defined as the need for RVAD, nitric oxide
      inhalation > 48 hours and/or inotropic support > 14 days. RESULTS: All ECM
      markers were elevated in patients with HF compared with controls (all p < 0.05). 
      RVF developed in 23 patients (37.7%) on LVAD support. All ECM markers decreased
      on LVAD support in patients without RVF (all p < 0.05), but serum MMP-2, TIMP-1, 
      TIMP-4, and osteopontin remained elevated in RVF patients. Multivariate analysis 
      identified that right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI), circulating B-type
      natriuretic peptide, and osteopontin were associated with RVF (all p < 0.05).
      Osteopontin correlated inversely with RVSWI (r = -0.44, p < 0.001). Osteopontin
      levels > 260 ng/ml discriminate patients who develop RVF from those without RVF
      (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 82%). CONCLUSIONS: Marked elevation of
      osteopontin levels before LVAD placement is associated with RVF development.
      Persistent elevation of circulating ECM markers after LVAD implantation
      characterizes patients who develop RVF. These novel biomarkers would have a
      potential role in the prediction of RVF development in patients undergoing LVAD
      implantation.

AB  - Nonreversible failure of the right ventricle is seen in 0.04% to 0.1% of
      postcardiotomy cases. The incidence of right ventricular dysfunction after left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation that fails to resolve in the
      operating room is reported to be as frequent as 20% to 50% and imposes a
      considerable burden in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Should
      this syndrome supervene, the mortality of an LVAD operation increases from 19% to
      43%. Although most patients can be maintained with prolonged inotropic support,
      10% to 15% may require implantation of a separate right ventricular support
      device.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support using left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) has
      become an accepted mode of therapy for both bridging patients with end-stage
      heart failure to transplant and as a destination therapy. Right ventricular (RV) 
      dysfunction is common after LVAD insertion and is a significant source of
      morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing LVAD placement. Several studies
      have identified clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic
      parameters that may serve as risk factors for RV dysfunction after LVAD
      placement. Furthermore, scoring systems have been established to help
      quantitatively predict the potential need for RV support after LVAD placement.

AB  - Major advances in vascular assist device (VAD) technology and the clinical
      acceptance of destination therapy for patients with contraindications to
      transplant raise the questions of what patient benefit is necessary to recommend 
      VAD implant for long-term support in patients who are transplant candidates. What
      are the appropriate indications for use and timing considerations for long-term
      VAD therapy in patients who qualify for transplant but are unlikely to obtain a
      donor? The authors suggest that VAD implantation for the indication of
      "maintenance therapy" where patients must remain on the VAD for two years before 
      becoming transplant eligible, would constitute an appropriate clinical avenue to 
      study these issues.

AB  - The pathophysiology of heart failure is complex, and downstream effects cause
      decline in multiple systems. Medical therapies intended to slow or reverse
      disease progression have been shown to improve prognosis in prospective trials.
      Improvement in prognosis has also been observed in large cohorts across time
      strata. However, near-term mortality for those with advanced disease remains
      unacceptably high. Prognosis in advanced heart failure may be assessed with the
      appropriate use of clinical prediction tools. Optimal timing of evaluation for
      heart transplantation and/or mechanical circulatory support depends on an
      understanding of these issues.

PG  - 1593-9; discussion 1599-600
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.06.081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) such as the
      HeartMate II have become the therapy of choice in patients with end-stage heart
      failure. The aim of this study is to report the outcomes in patients receiving
      the HeartMate II LVAD at a single center and review the lessons learned from this
      experience. METHODS: From June 2005 to June 2010, 130 consecutive patients
      received the HeartMate II LVAD. Of these, 102 were bridge-to-transplant (BTT), 17
      destination therapy, and 11 exchanges for failed HeartMate XVE. This study
      focuses on the 102 BTT patients. The HeartMate II was approved by the US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) as BTT in April 2008 and 64 patients received this
      device as BTT since that date. We review our experience with the device as BTT
      and report on patient survival and adverse events as well as the impact of FDA
      approval on outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, mean age was 52.6 +/- 12.8 years; 26
      (25.5%) were female. Disease etiology was ischemic in 58, nonischemic in 36, and 
      other in 8. Overall, 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year survival for the BTT patients
      was 95.1%, 83.5%, and 78.8%, respectively. The 6-month survival in 38 patients in
      the clinical trial (pre-FDA) was 88.8% and was not statistically significant
      compared with the 76.2% 6-month survival in the 64 patients in the post-FDA
      approval period (p value = 0.1). Major adverse events among the 102 BTT patients 
      included right ventricular failure in 5 (4.9%), LVAD driveline infections in 25
      (24.5%), neurologic events in 10 (9.8%), and gastrointestinal bleeding in 18
      (17.6%) patients. In addition, 1 patient (0.98%) had pump thrombus requiring
      device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant morbidity, use of the
      HeartMate II LVAD as BTT provides excellent hemodynamic support and is associated
      with excellent survival and low mortality. In addition, there needs to be
      improvement and focused strategies in the areas of gastrointestinal bleeding,
      driveline infections, and adverse neurologic events for these devices to be able 
      to provide a real long-term alternative to heart transplantation.

TI  - Impact of mitral regurgitation on reverse remodeling and outcome in patients
      undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy.
PG  - 21-6
LID - 10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.111.966580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with reduced survival in
      patients with chronic heart failure, but may be improved with cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT). We sought to evaluate the relationship between
      serial measurements of functional MR and reverse remodeling and outcomes in
      patients undergoing CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 266 consecutive patients
      undergoing CRT with available baseline echocardiograms and subsequent clinical
      and echocardiographic follow-up were included in the analysis. Long-term
      follow-up included all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, and implantation
      of a left ventricular (LV) assist device. Temporal changes in MR severity and LV 
      end-systolic volume index (LVESVi) were evaluated by linear mixed-model analysis.
      CRT led to an immediate sustained decrease in MR (P<0.0001), with no significant 
      subsequent change. The amount of MR decrease correlated with a greater decrease
      in LVESVi late (P</=0.0001), but not early (P=0.14), after CRT began. Patients
      with severe MR before CRT experienced a larger LVESVi decrease (P=0.005).
      Although baseline MR severity was not associated with adverse events (P=0.13), a 
      larger MR decrease (P=0.001) and a smaller residual MR after the initial 6 months
      of CRT (P=0.03) were predictive of better outcome in a multivariable model.
      CONCLUSIONS: Early reversal of functional MR was associated with reverse cardiac 
      remodeling and improved outcomes. Patients with moderately severe to severe MR
      before CRT experienced relatively more reverse remodeling than patients with
      lesser degrees of MR.

AB  - Over the last decade, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation has
      emerged as an alternative treatment strategy in patients with advanced heart
      failure irrespective of their transplant eligibility. However, success and
      applicability of this therapy is largely limited by high complication rates
      associated with these devices. Although superior outcomes have been achieved with
      the second-generation continuous-flow LVADs, device-related infections continue
      to be a prevalent complication in this patient population and contribute
      significantly to the financial burden of this therapy due to an increased need
      for hospitalizations and surgical interventions. Patient selection, device design
      and LVAD-induced immune system dysfunction appear to be major risk factors for
      the development of device-related infections. Improvements in device design and
      better patient selection strategies, particularly with respect to identifying
      individuals with genetic susceptibility to device-related infections, may further
      reduce this prevalent complication and improve outcomes in patients with advanced
      heart failure.

AB  - Right ventricular failure (RVF) following implantation of a left ventricular
      assist system (LVAS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality.( 1-4 )
      Numerous centers have reported short-term use of the CentriMag ((R)) Ventricular 
      Assist System (CVAS) (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, MA) for treatment of cardiogenic
      shock, decompensated heart failure and right ventricular failure (RVF) following 
      LVAS implantation.( 5-9 ) The present report reviews the clinical course of a
      patient requiring long-term right ventricular support utilizing the CVAS,
      following a HeartMate ((R)) II LVAS (Thoratec Corp. Pleasanton, CA) implantation.
      Elevated cytotoxic antibody levels complicated the patient's treatment plan by
      precluding orthotropic heart transplantation. The CVAS operated for 304 days
      without mechanical difficulty until replaced with the HeartWare ((R)) Ventricular
      Assist System (HeartWare Inc. Miramar, FL).

AB  - Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are commonly used as
      bridge-to-transplantation or destination therapy for heart failure patients.
      However, non-optimal pumping speeds can reduce the efficacy of circulatory
      support or cause dangerous ventricular arrhythmias. Optimal flow control for
      continuous flow LVADs has not been defined and calls for an implantable pressure 
      sensor integrated with the LVAD for real-time feedback control of pump speed
      based on ventricular pressure. A MEMS pressure sensor prototype is designed,
      fabricated and seamlessly integrated with LVAD to enable real-time control,
      optimize its performance and reduce its risks. The pressure sensing mechanism is 
      based on Fabry-Perot interferometer principle. A biocompatible parylene diaphragm
      with a silicon mirror at the center is fabricated directly on the inlet shell of 
      the LVAD to sense pressure changes. The sensitivity, range and response time of
      the pressure sensor are measured and validated to meet the requirements of LVAD
      pressure sensing.

AB  - The effects of left ventricular assist system (LVAS) implantation on renal
      hemodynamics remains to be fully elucidated. We evaluated renal function and
      intrarenal blood flow in five advanced heart failure patients who had been
      supported with a Toyobo LVAS for bridge to heart transplantation. Renal function 
      expressed as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the
      modified formula of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease. Mean blood velocities 
      in the bilateral segmental arteries during systolic and diastolic perfusion were 
      measured using duplex Doppler sonography, and renal vascular resistance
      (resistive index [RI]) of the segmental arteries was defined as (peak systolic
      velocity [PSV]-end-diastolic velocity [EDV])/PSV. All studies were performed
      before and after implantation (mean duration of support, 15.6+/-10.9 months).
      LVAS implantation significantly improved eGFR (42.7+/-7.9 to 64.1+/-16.3mL/min,
      P<0.05). Beat-by-beat measurements of heart rate did not change significantly.
      Mean PSV decreased significantly (38.2+/-8.9 to 28.3+/-2.2cm/s, P<0.05), and mean
      EDV increased significantly (8.3+/-3.2 to 11.3+/-1.3cm/s, P<0.05), and thus, mean
      RI was significantly improved (0.79+/-0.06 to 0.60+/-0.04, P<0.01). In
      conclusion, in advanced heart failure patients, pulsatile LVAS implantation is
      associated with improved renal function, and this improvement may be mediated in 
      part through an improvement of intrarenal hemodynamics.

AB  - Third-generation continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) provide
      reduced pulsatility flow. We examined the safe working range for LVAD pump speed 
      and the effect on pump output and cardiac function in 13 stable outpatients with 
      VentrAssist-LVAD (Ventracor Ltd, Australia). Pump speed was decreased from a
      baseline mean of 2,073 +/- 86 revolutions per minute (RPM, with corresponding
      mean flow of 5.59 +/- 1.18 L/min, mean +/- standard deviation) to an average
      low-speed of 1,835 +/- 55 RPM (corresponding flow 4.68 +/- 0.99 L/min) and up to 
      high-speed of 2,315 +/- 66 RPM (corresponding flow 6.30 +/- 1.29 L/min). There
      was a strong linear relationship between alteration in speed and flow rates (r(2)
      = 0.89, p < 0.00001) but marked interpatient variation. Downward titration to
      preset minimum 1,800 RPM was achieved in 9/13 (69%) and upward titration to the
      preset maximum 2,400 RPM was achieved in 4/13 (31%). Upward titration was stopped
      due to ventricular suction or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 4/13
      (31%). Ventricular suction or VT (in 4/13) tended to be more common in patients
      with poor right ventricular (RV) function (p = 0.07). In summary, pump flow is
      stable within a relatively small speed range and should not be altered without
      close monitoring due to variation in response between patients, particularly with
      concomitant RV impairment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurologic complications (NCs) are the major adverse events after
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) surgery. Pre-operative and post-operative
      factors associated with NCs in patients with LVADs were investigated. METHODS: We
      reviewed 307 consecutive patients undergoing LVAD surgery (167 HeartMate I and
      140 HeartMate II devices) at Columbia University Medical Center between November 
      2000 and December 2010. Clinical characteristics and hemodynamic and laboratory
      indexes were analyzed. NC was defined according to the Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support definition of neurologic dysfunction,
      including transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic or hemorrhagic
      cerebrovascular accident (CVA). RESULTS: NCs developed in 43 patients (14.0%) at 
      91.8 +/- 116.3 days post-operatively. The frequency of NC development was similar
      in HeartMate I and II patients. Patients with NC showed a higher frequency of
      pre-LVAD CVA history (27.9% vs 15.5%, p = 0.046), lower pre-operative sodium
      (129.0 +/- 7.0 vs 132.1 +/- 8.1 mg/dl, p = 0.018) and albumin concentrations (3.5
      +/- 0.7 vs 3.7 +/- 0.6 mg/dl, p = 0.049), lower post-operative hematocrit (34.9% 
      +/- 5.1% vs 37.8% +/- 6.1%, p = 0.0034), sodium (131.6 +/- 7.7 vs 134.4 +/- 6.4
      mg/dl, p = 0.010) and albumin concentrations (3.7 +/- 0.5 vs 3.9 +/- 0.5 mg/dl, p
      = 0.0016), and higher frequency of post-operative infection (39.5% vs 19.3%, p = 
      0.003) than those without NC. Multiple regression analysis revealed that CVA
      history (odds ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.29; p = 0.011) and
      post-operative infection (odds ratio, 2.99, 95% confidence interval, 1.16-10.49; 
      p = 0.011) were highly associated with NC development. The combination of CVA
      history, pre-operative and post-operative sodium and albumin, and post-operative 
      hematocrit and infection could discriminate patients developing NCs with a
      probability of 76.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Previous stroke, persistent malnutrition and
      inflammation, severity of heart failure, and post-LVAD infections are key factors
      associated with development of NCs after LVAD implantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impella microaxial devices provide circulatory assistance for
      patients with acute decompensated heart failure. This study reviews the
      population-based provincial experience in British Columbia. METHODS: We performed
      a retrospective review of the prospectively maintained database. Impella devices 
      were inserted for acute cardiogenic shock refractory to maximal therapy, as a
      bridge to decision or to long-term mechanical support. RESULTS: Between August
      2007 and September 2009, 35 patients received 37 Impella devices (Impella LP 2,5,
      n=2; Impella LP 5,0, n=29; and Impella RD 5.0, n=6) (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA).
      Devices were inserted in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy (n=13), acute
      myocardial infarction (n=6), postcardiotomy shock (n=6), and other etiologies
      (n=12). Mean age was 53.0+/-13.7 years. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction
      was 19+/-9% at the time of insertion. Nineteen patients required aggressive
      resuscitation, all patients were on inotropic support, 97% of patients were
      intubated, and 46% of patients received mechanical circulatory support prior to
      insertion of the Impella devices. Mean duration of support was 3.7+/-3.0 days. In
      all, 49% were successfully weaned, and 22% were transferred to long-term
      mechanical support. Four patients have subsequently undergone successful cardiac 
      transplantation. The 30-day mortality was 40%, and 6-month mortality was 49%.
      Complications included gastrointestinal bleeding (n=1), hemoptysis (n=1), and
      thrombocytopenia (n=4). There were no cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.
      CONCLUSION: Temporary support with Impella microaxial ventricular assist devices 
      adds a valuable therapeutic option in selected patients with acute decompensated 
      heart failure.

TI  - Update on the Management of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure.
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Treatment goals of acute decompensated heart failure are to
      decrease congestion, afterload, and neurohormonal activation in order to improve 
      hemodynamics and symptoms and, perhaps, reduce in-hospital events,
      re-hospitalizations, and mortality while avoiding toxicities of therapy such as
      hypotension, arrhythmias, and renal dysfunction. Relief of congestion through
      intravenous loop diuretics is a mainstay of therapy. In cases where diuretics are
      not effective, ultrafiltration may be used to achieve euvolemia. Beta-blockers
      should be continued or reduced in dose at admission but should not typically be
      held. In patients with normotensive or hypertensive heart failure, afterload
      reduction with vasodilators should be instituted at presentation. Choice of a
      particular agent such as nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or nesiritide depends on
      patient characteristics such as presence of ischemia, degree of congestion, and
      renal function. Nitroprusside may be preferable in patients with congestion and
      low cardiac output, but with caution in patients with significant hypotension.
      Intravenous inotropes/inodilators, such as dobutamine and milrinone, should be
      limited to hypotensive patients with evidence of poor tissue perfusion. Milrinone
      may be preferable in patients who have significant pulmonary venous hypertension.
      In patients who do not respond to initial medical therapy and who are candidates 
      for either cardiac transplantation or destination left ventricular assist device,
      mechanical circulatory support should be considered early, prior to the
      development of end-organ damage.
