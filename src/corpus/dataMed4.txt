AB  - Heart transplantation keeps its leading position in the treatment of end-stage
      heart failure (HF). Survival rates and functional status following heart
      transplantation are excellent, particularly if compared to medical therapy. The
      process of acute and chronic transplant rejection, however, and the sequelae of
      immunosuppression, such as infection, malignancy and renal insufficiency,
      prevents even better results. Therapy with current mechanical circulatory support
      devices is associated with improving outcome and may become competitive to heart 
      transplantation, at least in selected patients. But long-term results are not yet
      available.
