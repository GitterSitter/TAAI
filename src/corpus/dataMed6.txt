Topic 1: Surgical Issues Impacting Care in
the Immediate Post-operative Period
Introduction
This section deals with surgical issues that may
potentially complicate the immediate post-transplant period.
Many of these issues, particularly ones that arise in patient
assist support devices 
selection can have a very important impact on the immediate
post-operative course of the patient and some can have far
reaching consequences for long-term graft and patient
survival. Donor-recipient matching refers to the avoidance
of size discrepancies that can impair graft function. However,
in the broader sense, donor factors, particularly ones that
might have an adverse impact on graft function, need to be
viewed in the context of the recipientâ€™s condition. These
factors include the urgency of transplantation, the presence of
comorbid disease and the adequacy of physical reserves in the
recipient, which are important considerations in the context of
the recipientâ€™s ability to tolerate a post-operative course that
may be complicated by impaired graft function as the direct
result of transplantation of a marginal donor heart. The
projected ischemic time is another important variable in
decision making regarding the use of a particular donor heart.
The projected ischemic time is also emblematic of an
important axiom in donor selection and matching to a specific
recipientâ€”and that is that factors that may adversely impact
post-operative graft function should not be considered in
isolation. For example, the use of a heart from a donor who
died of toxicity (such as carbon monoxide) should be
considered together with other important factors that have
potentially compounding adverse effects, such as older donor
age and longer rejected ischemic time. Although the
techniques of donor heart procurement and implantation are
standardized, there are factors such as the method of
myocardial preservation and technique of donor heart
implantation (biatrial versus bicaval technique) that may
influence the post-heart transplant (HT) period. Post-operative
complications such as sternal wound infection and pericardial
effusion may cause the patientâ€™s convalescence to be
prolonged.
Donor Heart Selection
Brain death is a hostile environment for the donor heart
that undoubtedly contributes to the occurrence of primary
graft failure (PGF) after HT. Donor heart dysfunction results
from the â€œcatecholamine stormâ€� (hypertension, tachycardia,
and intense vasoconstriction) that produces an increase in
myocardial oxygen demand and potentially myocardial
ischemia. These phenomena may mediate myofibrillar
degeneration, a process characterized by injury and death of
myofibers in a hypercontracted state. After dissipation of this
intense sympathetic activity, there is loss of sympathetic tone
with a massive reduction in systemic vascular resistance,
which may contribute to a second phase of potential
myocardial injury, precipitated by abnormal myocardial
loading conditions and impaired coronary perfusion.
Myocardial injury interacts with other factors such as older
donor age and longer ischemic time, increasing the probability
of post-operative primary graft dysfunction.
Donor Age
Older donor age has been identified as a risk factor for
death from any cause1
 and from early graft failure.2
 and it
compounds the influence of other risk factors for death from
early graft failure such as donor left ventricular (LV)
dysfunction, longer ischemic time, and size mismatch (smaller
donor to a larger recipient). The impact of older donor age is a
reflection of the general decline in myocardial reserves
occurring with advancing age as well as the use of older donor
hearts for marginal recipients. Furthermore, older donor hearts
may be less able to withstand primary graft dysfunction and
early acute HT rejection.
Early in HT the upper donor age limit was 35 years, but
over the ensuing 4 decades it has progressively risen with the
routine use of donors older than 40 years and frequently â‰¥ 50 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 2
years. A safe â€œolder donor ageâ€� has not been established.
Studies usually employ artificial age cutoffs (such as 40 or 50
years) so that assignment of a 41-year-old donor to the â€œolder
groupâ€� may not provide accurate information regarding the
effects of older donor age on post-HT outcomes. Furthermore,
the impact of older donor age cannot be decoupled from
recipient risk factors that can influence early post-HT survival.
Some studies3, 4 demonstrated inferior 1-month survival in
recipients receiving hearts from donors older than 40 or 50
years of age than in those receiving hearts from donors
younger than 40 years. However, other studies5
 showed
similar 30-day or discharge mortality in recipients of donor
hearts older than 50 years versus those and in those receiving
younger donor organs (5% versus 3.5%).
Recommendations on Donor Heart Selection2, 3:
Class IIa:
1. Taking into consideration only the variable of â€œdonor
age,â€� the hearts of donors younger than 45 years will
invariably have sufficient reserves to withstand the rigors
of HT even in settings of prolonged ischemic time,
recipient comorbidities, and multiple previous recipient
operations with hemodynamically destabilizing bleeding.
Hearts from donors between the ages of 45 to 55 years
should probably be used when the projected ischemic
time is â‰¤ 4 hours and the potential recipient does not have
comorbidities or surgical issues where anything less than
robust donor heart performance could prove fatal. The use
of donor hearts > 55 years should only be used if the
survival benefit of HT for a recipient unequivocally
exceeds the decrement in early HT survival due to
transplantation of a heart with limited myocardial
reserves.
Level of Evidence: B.
Transplantation of Hearts from Donors with Infection
The reluctance to use hearts from donors contaminated
with microorganisms, who have died of sepsis or central
nervous system infection, is based on: (1) the potential
transmission of microorganisms to the recipient resulting in
either infection of anastomotic suture lines or systemic
infection, (2) potential transmission of mediators of endotoxic
shock from donor to recipient, and (3) contribution of donor
sepsis to myocardial dysfunction.6-8 Serious complications due
to the transmission of donor infection to a recipient have
included arterial anastomotic rupture in a renal transplant
patient (Staphylococcus aureus9
 and Bacteroides species,10
Escherichia coli10) and recipient entero-abdominal fungal
infection after a pancreatic transplant (Candida albicans11).
Nevertheless, hearts from donors with severe sepsis and death
due to severe infection (meningitis, pneumonia, or septic
shock) without transmission to recipients6, 12, 13 as well as the
use of hearts with bacterial and fungal contamination.14-16 have
been used. Overall the risk of donor to recipient transmission
appears to be very low.
Recommendation on the Transplantation of Hearts
from Donors with Infection6
:
Class IIa
1. Hearts from donors with severe infection can be used
provided that: 1) the donor infection is community
acquired and donor death occurs rapidly (within 96
hours); 2) repeat blood cultures before organ procurement
are negative; 3) pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy is
administered to the donor; 4) donor myocardial function
is normal; and 5) there is no evidence of endocarditis by
direct inspection of the donor heart. If such hearts are
used for transplantation, the recipient should undergo
surveillance blood cultures on the first post-operative day
and pathogen-specific antibiotic therapy should be
administered for an appropriate duration of time.
Level of Evidence: C.
Transplantation of Hearts from Donors with Potential
Drug Toxicities
Cocaine. Toxic effects on the heart include
vasoconstriction, coronary endothelial dysfunction, and
myocardial toxicity. These effects occur through a powerful Î±-
1 adrenergic effect, indirectly through release of
norepinephrine by the sympathetic nervous system, an induced
deficiency of endothelium-derived relaxation factor with the
potential for intravascular thrombosis, and depression of
myocardial contractility.17-21 The most frequently observed
cardiac abnormalities after repeated cocaine abuse are
ventricular hypertrophy and a cardiomyopathy. Since
intravenous (IV) cocaine as compared to non-IV cocaine
abuse is considered more toxic to the heart, the use of hearts
from IV cocaine abusers is discouraged. Use of hearts from
donors with a history of non-IV cocaine abuse appears to be
safe in terms of early post-operative course. Data from the
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) suggest that 1-
year HT mortality is similar for recipients of hearts from nonusers
versus past users (> 6 months) or current users of
cocaine.22-29
Alcohol abuse. Direct toxic effects of ethanol on the heart
include alterations in energy stores reducing the effectiveness
of calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum,23, 24 and
sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity,
and interference with calcium-troponin binding, all of which 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1

attenuate myosin-actin interaction. Transplantation of a heart
from a donor with a history of alcohol abuse may unmask
biochemical abnormalities that may manifest as early graft
failure.25, 26 Survival (including early patient survival and graft
function) has been shown to be inferior27, 28 in recipients of
hearts from donors with a history of alcohol abuse. However,
one report suggests that alcohol use in donors may be
protective after HT with improved outcomes for hearts from
alcoholic versus non-alcoholic donors.29
Carbon monoxide poisoning. As a result of the much
greater affinity of carbon monoxide versus oxygen for
hemoglobin, a leftward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin
dissociation curve occurs with reduced oxygen delivery to the
tissues and impairment of mitochondrial cellular respiration
due to competition of carbon monoxide with oxygen for
cytochrome a3.
30 The myocardium is particularly susceptible
to oxygen deprivation and the resulting myocardial injury may
manifest as PGF in the immediate post-operative period.
Reports on the outcomes of hearts from donors with carbon
monoxide intoxication have yielded conflicting results 31, 32
Other poisonings. There are reports of transplantation of
hearts from donors with a variety of other types of poisonings
including cyanide,33-35 methanol, and ecstasy36 with
satisfactory HT function. The hearts from donors with these
types of poisonings may be considered for HT provided there
is good cardiac function.
Recommendation on the Transplantation of Hearts
from Donors with Potential Drug Toxicities22, 29, 35, 37,
38:
Class IIa:
1. Hearts from donors with a history of past or current nonIV
cocaine abuse can be used for transplantation provided
cardiac function is normal and left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH) is absent.
Level of Evidence: C.
2. In light of current information, the use of hearts from
donors with a history of â€œalcohol abuseâ€� remains
uncertain, but is should probably be considered unwise.
Level of Evidence: C.
3. The use of hearts from donors who have died of carbon
monoxide intoxication can be recommended with caution,
although safety has not been completely established. It is
recommended that these hearts be used provided there is a
normal donor electrocardiogram (ECG) and
echocardiogram, minimal elevation of cardiac markers,
minimal inotropic requirements, a relatively short
ischemic time, a favorable donor to recipient weight ratio,
and a recipient with normal pulmonary vascular
resistance.
Level of Evidence: C.
Use of Donors with Pre-existing Cardiac
Abnormalities
Coronary artery disease. The concern regarding
transplantation of donor hearts with recognized or
unrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) revolves around
the risk of acute graft failure and the subsequent development
of coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV). There is a paucity
of information in the literature to provide guidance as to how
much CAD in a donor heart can be accepted without
increasing the risk of early graft failure.39-41 One report42
suggests that if donor hearts with more than single-vessel
CAD are used, the risk of early graft failure is substantial
(6.3% in donors without CAD, 7.5% in donors with singlevessel
CAD, 42.3% in donor hearts with double- and triplevessel
CAD).
Donor left ventricular hypertrophy. The reluctance to use
donor hearts with LVH is based on the increased risk of early
graft failure and the long-term effects of diastolic heart failure
and suboptimal long-term survival. The probability that LVH
will produce early graft failure is is influenced by other
confounding factors43 such as history of hypertension,
ischemia time, severity of LVH, donor size, and whether or
not LVH is evident on ECG. One small study44 raised
concerns that any degree of donor heart LVHy may result in
early graft failure. A more recent study, however,45 46 found
that mild and even moderate LVH did not increase 30-day
mortality. Early mortality was increased only45 if donor wall
thickness was > 14 mm.
Donor valvular heart disease. The finding of a bicuspid
aortic valve does not contraindicate the use of a donor heart.
In the case valvular disease associated with hemodynamic
abnormalities, the donor heart may still be used for HT. Bench
repair or replacement of a donor aortic valve,38 47 and repair of
an incompetent mitral valve48 has been performed with
favorable outcomes.
Recommendations on the Use of Donors with Preexisting
Cardiac Abnormalities39, 49:
Class I:
1. As far as function is concerned, a donor heart should not
be used in the presence of intractable ventricular
arrhythmias, the need for excessive inotropic support
(dopamine at a dose of 20 Âµg/kg/min or similar doses of
other adrenergic agents despite aggressive optimization of
preload and after load), discreet wall motion 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1

abnormalities on echocardiography, or left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% despite optimization of
hemodynamics with inotropic support.
Level of Evidence: B.
2. A donor heart with a normally functioning bicuspid aortic
valve can be used for HT. Anatomically and
hemodynamically abnormal aortic and mitral valves may
undergo bench repair or replacement with subsequent
transplantation of the heart.
Level of Evidence: C.
Class IIa:
1. The use of donor hearts with obstructive disease in any
major coronary artery should be avoided unless the heart
is being considered for the alternate list recipients with
concomitant coronary bypass surgery.
Level of Evidence: C.
2. It would seem appropriate to use hearts from donors with
LVH provided that it is not associated with ECG findings
of LVH and LV wall thickness is < 14 mm.
Level of Evidence: C.
Donor Cardiac Function
Donor risk factors known to be associated with early graft
failure include higher doses of inotropic support, depressed
systolic function (particularly discreet wall motion
abnormalities), older donor age, and donor-recipient size
mismatch (small female donors to large male recipients).49 In
one study,49 the requirement for dopamine or dobutamine
doses > 20 Âµg/kg/min with or without additional inotropic
agents was an independent risk factor for PGF and early
mortality. However, because high dose inotropic support is
often required to overcome the hemodynamic consequences of
a low systemic vascular resistance, optimization of preload
and afterload should be achieved before declaring that high
dose inotropic agents is a contraindication to the use of a
donor heart. Elevated cardiac markers such as CPK-MB
isoenzyme and troponin should not preclude the use of a donor
heart. If substantial myocardial injury is associated with the
release of cardiac markers, this will usually be manifested by
the echocardiographic finding of either global or discreet wall
motion abnormalities.
Recommendations on Donor Cardiac Function:
Class I:
1. As far as the function is concerned, a donor heart should
not be used in the presence of intractable ventricular
arrhythmias, the need for excessive inotropic support
(dopamine at a dose of 20 Âµg/kg/min or similar doses of
other adrenergic agents despite aggressive optimization of
preload and after load), discreet wall motion
abnormalities on echocardiography or LVEF < 40%
despite optimization of hemodynamics with inotropic
support.
Level of Evidence: B.
Donor-Recipient Size Matching
Oversizing of a donor heart can occur (1) in pediatric HT
when the size of the donor heart for a smaller recipient is
misjudged; (2) when the native heart disease does not result in
cardiomegaly and a larger donor heart is implanted; or (3)
after multiple previous operations resulting in rigidity of the
mediastinum despite maneuvers such as opening the left side
of the pericardium to allow the donor heart to protrude into the
left pleural space. These situations may be associated with
inability to close the chest without hemodynamically
important cardiac compression. Severe undersizing is also an
important issue, since a small donor heart may be unable to
support the circulation of a much larger recipient. Making the
determination of the adequacy of the size of a donor for a
specific recipient and judgment is required. Determination of
donor/recipient size match is complicated by the poor
relationship between echocardiographic adult heart size and
body weight.50 As a general rule, the donor weight should be
within 30% of the recipient weight for adults. However, in
non-urgent recipients survival was not adversely affected by
undersizing of donor hearts up to a donor to recipient body
weight ratio of 0.8.51, 52 In contrast, survival was inferior in
UNOS status 1 recipients, if they received an undersized heart
presumably due to a smaller cardiac reserve. 49 According to a
multivariable analysis, implantation of a smaller female donor
heart into a larger male recipient was an independent risk
factor for early graft failure. Furthermore, the risks of
undersizing a donor heart are compounded by the presence of
other donor risk factors contributing to early graft failure, such
as older donor age, abnormal systolic function of the donor
heart and prolonged ischemic time.
Recommendations on Donor-Recipient Size
Matching51, 52:
Class I:
1. As a general rule the use of hearts from donors whose
body weight is no greater than 30% below that of the
recipient is uniformly safe. Furthermore, a male donor of
average weight (70 kg) can be safely used for any size
recipient irrespective of weight. Use of a female donor
whose weight is more than 20% lower than that of a male
recipient should be viewed with caution.
Level of Evidence: C.

Projected Ischemic Time
Prolongation of the ischemic time in HT adversely
impacts the performance of the donor heart in the immediate
post-operative period. Furthermore, the ischemic time
interacts with a number of other variables including older
donor age, increased inotropic requirements of the donor, and
abnormal donor cardiac function to further increase the
probability of primary graft dysfunction. The upper limit for
ischemic time is unknown and it depends on the relative
weight of other risk factors. For example, a heart of a young
donor with robust performance without inotropic requirements
is likely to tolerate an ischemic time longer than 6 hours with
good post-operative graft function, whereas a donor heart with
impaired function on substantial inotropic support from an
older donor is unlikely to tolerate longer ischemic times.
Recommendations on Ischemic Times49:
Class I:
1. As a general rule the ischemic time should be less than 4
hours. However, there are situations in which ischemic
times longer than 4 hours are anticipated. Donor hearts
with ischemic times longer than 4 hours should only be
accepted when other factors interacting with ischemic
time are ideal, including donor young age, normal cardiac
function and absence of inotropic support.
Level of Evidence: C.
Donor Heart Procurement
The procedure of donor heart procurement is as critical
for the success of HT as implantation, because errors in
assessment, selection, and surgical technique may have
profound repercussions in the immediate post-transplant
period. The procuring surgeon must verify that the function of
the heart is visually satisfactory, that areas of akinesis are
absent on the echocardiogram, and that the size match for the
intended recipient is appropriate. The heart should be carefully
inspected for palpable CAD and evidence of myocardial
contusion so that if these problems are found a decision can be
made about the suitability of the donor heart for the intended
recipient. Post-operative right ventricular (RV) failure can
result in RV distention during the procurement procedure and
significantly complicate recipient management. This can occur
because of overly vigorous fluid infusion in response to blood
and fluid loss during abdominal organ procurement. After
excision, it is important that the heart be thoroughly inspected,
although most abnormalities (such as a patent foramen ovale,
bicuspid aortic valve) do not significantly alter the immediate
post-operative period. Atresia of the coronary sinus ostium
with retrograde drainage through a persistent left superior
vena cava may go unnoticed until inspection or implantation
of the donor heart. Unfortunately, ligation of the left superior
vena cava in the presence of this anomaly is highly likely to
result in irreversible PGF. The procuring surgeon can simply
look into the right atrium to verify the presence of a coronary
sinus ostium.53-55
The adequacy of myocardial preservation, the
biochemical derangements that can be induced during the
ischemic period, and unpredictable myocardial reperfusion
injury may have profound effects on the immediate postoperative
course. It is the complex bioenergetic processes and
their derangement which will frequently underpin PGF. The
primary methods of maintaining cellular and functional
integrity of the myocardium during the ischemic period are
through hypothermia and mechanical arrest of the heart.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is consumed at a low level to
allow breaking of actin-myosin cross bridges even during
mechanical cardiac arrest. Although during the ischemic
period the myocardium can use stored glycogen to produce
ATP by anaerobic glycolysis, irreversible myofiber
contracture will occur if the ATP level falls below a critical
threshold, Preservation must also maintain ion homeostasis.
Although sodium-potassium ATPase activity is markedly
reduced by hypothermia, there is still passive ion movement
down a concentration gradient. Consequently, intracellular
hydrogen ions are exchanged for extracellular sodium ions,
which in turn are exchanged for calcium ions. Accumulation
of calcium ions in the sarcolemma is potentially very
damaging to myofibers upon reperfusion. Reperfusion injury
has several components:
(1) Free radical injuryâ€”these oxygen-derived free radicals
cause direct myocardial injury. They are generated under
normal aerobic conditions but are rapidly neutralized by
intracellular enzymatic scavengers. However, under
conditions of ischemia and reperfusion, they may
accumulate in quantities that overwhelm the natural
scavengers, setting the stage for free radical injury.
(2) Complement activationâ€”activation of the complement
cascade results in the production of potent anaphylatoxins
that mediate increased vascular permeability, leukocyte
chemotaxis, adhesion and activation, and vascular smooth
muscle contraction.
(3) Neutrophil activationâ€”neutrophil activation during
reperfusion involves accumulation of these cells on
endothelial surfaces and promoting the release of
inflammatory molecules.
(4) Endothelial injuryâ€”â€œendothelial cell activationâ€� is a term
used to describe the response of endothelial cells to 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 6
ischemia. It involves promotion of leukocyte adhesion,
smooth muscle proliferation and vasoconstriction.
(5) Cytokine releaseâ€”a number of molecules are released
that amplify inflammatory responses.
(6) Calcium overloadâ€”as indicated earlier, calcium ions can
accumulate in the sarcoplasmic reticulum damaging
myocytes on reperfusion.
The role of myocardial preservation solutions in HT is to
preserve the microvascular, cellular, and functional integrity
of the heart. The ingredients of the flush solution include (1)
hypothermia, (2) potassium to arrest the heart, (3) prevention
of cellular swelling with impermeants such as lactobionate and
raffinose, (4) magnesium to prevent calcium accumulation in
the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and (5) free radical scavengers to
prevent free radical injury. Experimental56 and clinical57 use of
the UW solution, which is an intracellular (high potassium)
solution that includes the above ingredients, have provided
sufficient evidance to support the expectation of excellent
myocardial preservation for at least 6 hours of ischemic time.
Donor Heart Implantation
Implantation of the donor heart is a technically
straightforward procedure. The standard biatrial technique is
increasingly being replaced by the bicaval technique. The
latter may be associated with a lower incidence of sinoatrial
node dysfunction in the early post-operative period and
reduced requirement for permanent pacing at 30 and 90 days
after HT.58
One technical point that requires emphasis is the
importance of accurately cutting the correct length of the
pulmonary artery because excessive length can result in
pulmonary artery kinking and obstruction and, if
unrecognized, this can result in severe RV failure.59 The
conditions of reperfusion of the donor heart are important with
regard to the pressure. Ideally, the heart should be reperfused
at a perfusion pressure of 50 to 70 mm Hg. Very occasionally,
the perfusion pressure can be excessively low (< 50 mm Hg)
despite the infusion of vasoactive agents. Under those
circumstances, the heart may not develop prompt return of
coordinated contraction. If this occurs, controlled aortic root
reperfusion60 may be used. This involves reapplying the aortic
crossclamp and infusing pump blood into the aortic root
through the needle vent to produce a pressure of 70 to 80 mm
Hg until satisfactory cardiac function develops, at which time
the crossclamp can be removed.
Post-operative Surgical Problems
Surgical wound infection. Infection is an important cause
of mortality and morbidity after HT. Bacterial infection
predominates in the early post-transplant period with a peak
incidence in the first post-operative week.61 Although the
incidence of sternal wound infection and mediastinitis after
HT is low ,it can be the cause of serious morbidity and
mortality. The cornerstone of prevention of bacterial infection
and contamination of the surgical wound is application of
strict surgical aseptic techniques. All indwelling lines and
devices should receive similar aseptic care. Protective
isolation has not been proven beneficial in reducing the
incidence of infection in HT recipients.62, 63 Peri-operative
prophylactic antibiotics should be administered. An example
of a commonly used protocol is a pre-operative IV dose of
vancomycin 15 mg/kg and ceftazidime 15 mg/kg both
administered 1 hour before HT to ensure effective circulating
levels before the skin incision. Vancomycin is readministered
at the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at a dose
of 10 mg/kg. Post-operatively, vancomycin (10 mg/kg IV
every 8 hours with adjustment for renal function) and
ceftazidime 1 gm IV every 8 hours are administered for 4
days. At the conclusion of the operation, the surgical wound
may be irrigated with dilute vancomycin solution to decrease
colony counts of gram-positive skin organisms. The surgical
dressing is left in place for 48 hours, and after its removal, the
wound is painted with an iodine containing solution once or
twice daily for several days until the wound is sealed.
Re-entry for bleeding may be required after HT. In most
patients undergoing HT, the operation is performed in the
setting of one or more risk factors for bleeding including
coagulopathy associated with multiple previous operations,
use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), poor tissues due
to the ravages of heart failure, and abnormal coagulation due
to hepatic congestion. Re-entry should be undertaken for
persistent chest tube output (as a general rule 400 mL/hr for 1
hour, > 300 mL/hr for 3 hours, and 200 mL/hr for 4 hours),
any circulatory instability associated with bleeding, or
radiographic or echocardiographic evidence of retained
thrombus.
Frequently, patients undergoing HT have a large
pericardial space in which a much smaller donor heart is
implanted, setting the stage for the accumulation of frequently
large pericardial effusions. This has been described64 in up to
30% of patients. If a pericardial effusion is anticipated given a
large pericardial space and a much smaller heart, a soft drain
such as a Blake drain can be left in the posterior pericardial
space connected to a drainage bulb and can be left for 5 to 6
days (the standard chest tubes are removed at the usual time)
to prevent, as much as possible, collection of fluid in the
pericardium. The Blake drain is removed when the drainage is
< 40 mL/24 hours. If a large pericardial effusion occurs, even

in the absence of echocardiographic evidence of tamponade,
drainage by a subxiphoid approach is recommended.
Topic 2: Early Post-operative Care of the
Heart Transplant Recipient
Introduction
Early post-operative management of the newly
transplanted heart allograft is focused on maintenance of
hemodynamic stability as the allograft restores normal cardiac
function to the chronic heart failure patient. While the graft
begins to support the recipient as soon as separation from CPB
is complete, there is invariably a period of time during which
the allograft and its recipient require active hemodynamic
management and support. The nature and duration of this
support is determined by several factors including the quality
and preservation of the donor heart and pre-operative
condition of the recipient. Recipient factors such as vasomotor
tone, severity and reversibility of pulmonary vascular
hypertension, pulmonary function, degree of pre-operative
fluid overload, renal function, destabilizing post-operative
bleeding, and immunologic compatibility may have a
profound effect upon early post-operative management.
Additional factors such as HT surgical technique (biatrial vs.
bicaval vs. orthotopic vs. heterotopic) and donor/recipient size
matching affect post-operative management strategies.
Peri-operative and Post-operative Monitoring
Hemodynamic Monitoring
Adequate hemodynamic monitoring of the HT recipient at
a minimum includes direct measurement of the arterial
pressure, central venous pressure (CVP) or right atrial pressure
(RAP), and cardiac output (CO). Typically, adult patients are
monitored with an indwelling arterial catheter (femoral, radial,
or both), and a thermodilution or oximetric pulmonary artery
catheter. Less commonly used are surgically placed,
percutaneous right and left atrial catheters, or noninvasive
means of assessing CO. One such method utilizes lithium
chloride as indicator for peripheral thermodilution technique.65
Regardless of the type of catheter used for continuous
hemodynamic monitoring after HT, it is wise to remove the
catheter as soon as possible to minimize the risk of catheterrelated
infections, including sepsis, allograft valvular
endocarditis, or bacterial seeding of the atrial suture lines,
complications which are often fatal.66, 67
Arterial monitoring is similar in pediatric patients, but
CVP monitoring is generally with a line ending in the superior
vena cava or an atrial catheter. Pulmonary artery catheters are
used infrequently in the pediatric population.
Echocardiographic Monitoring
Intra-operative echocardiography has become a standard
procedure during most cardiac surgery, including HT.68
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide
imaging assistance to identify intracardiac thrombi. In
addition, TEE provides real-time assessment of the cardiac
allograft during de-airing, separation from CPB, and after
implantation of the donor heart as the chest is closed.
Ventricular function, valve function, and surgical anastomoses
can be assessed. In the post-operative period, both
transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and TEE may be used to
assess heart allograft function, particularly in the setting of
acute hemodynamic instability arising from allograft
dysfunction due to rejection, RV failure, or tamponade.69-71
When adequate transthoracic imaging is limited by poor
acoustic windows, TEE often overcomes this obstacle. TTE is
generally adequate in the pediatric population in the postoperative
period. It is reasonable to perform a TTE in the first
week after HT. The timing and frequency of additional
echocardiograms depends upon heart allograft function and
the presence of a pericardial effusion.
Electrocardiographic Monitoring
Continuous ECG monitoring is universal. Twelve-lead
recordings are obtained immediately post-operatively and as
needed to assess the cardiac rhythm, conduction system, and
ischemic changes. Several ECG abnormalities are frequently
present following HT. The most frequent abnormalities
include sinus node dysfunction and complete or incomplete
right bundle branch block. Progressive worsening of the
conduction system in the early period after HT is a poor
prognostic sign.72, 73
Continuous Oxygen Saturation Monitoring
Continuous pulse oximetry is indicated in the immediate
post-operative period to insure adequate oxygenation at all
times, particularly because the critically ill early postoperative
patient is at risk for sudden changes in pulmonary
status.
Renal Function
An indwelling urinary catheter is used to monitor renal
function and urine output.
Adequacy of urine output depends upon several factors
including fluid status, heart allograft function, intrinsic renal
function, recent hemodynamic status, and the presence of
nephrotoxic and vasoconstrictive medications such as
calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and vasopressors. Urine output
typically is â‰¥ 30 mL/hour. 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 8
In the pediatric population, adequate urine output is age
and size dependent. Oliguria or anuria are particularly
concerning as they are suggestive of significant acute renal
failure.
Often, higher doses of IV loop diuretics are required after
HT due to pre-existing diuretic resistance. Oliguria refractory
to diuretics is problematic in the immediate post-operative
setting because fluid overload and RV dysfunction can
develop over a few hours unless ultrafiltration and renal
replacement therapies such as continuous veno-venous
hemofiltration or dialysis are employed.
Recommendations on the Post-operative Monitoring
of Heart Transplant Recipients7, 72-89:
Class I:
1. Peri-operative monitoring of heart transplant recipients
should include (1) continuous ECG monitoring; (2) postoperative
12-lead ECG; (3) invasive arterial pressure
monitoring; (4) direct measurement of RAP or CVP; (5)
measurement of left atrial or pulmonary artery wedge
pressure (PAWP); (6) intermittent measurement of CO;
(7) continuous measurement of arterial oxygen saturation;
(8) intra-operative TEE; (9) continuous assessment of
urinary output.
Level of Evidence: C.
Hemodynamic Management
Background
The newly transplanted heart allograft typically displays
excellent LV systolic function. Systolic LV dysfunction is
particularly worrisome as it may suggest poor donor heart
quality, inadequate preservation, or early rejection
(hyperacute, antibody mediated rejection). The frequency and
severity of RV dysfunction after HT is variable and may be
anticipated in patients with risk factors such as elevated
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), excessive bleeding,
pulmonary edema, poor donor heart preservation before
implant, poor RV protection during allograft implantation,
ischemia from air embolization into the right coronary artery,
or significant donor/recipient size mismatch.74
Even heart allografts that display excellent early function
typically experience a functional decline over the first 12 postoperative
hours. This decrease in function is believed to be
due to the effects of ischemia and reperfusion and myocardial
edema, which result in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
Donor heart LVH (wall thickness â‰¥ 1.4 cm) and or prolonged
ischemia times (> 240 min) may also lead to impaired
diastolic function in the early post-operative period. With
intra-operative TEE, it is not uncommon to observe an
increase in LV wall thickness and mass.75, 76, 90-92 Furthermore,
in the early post-operative period after HT, examination of the
mitral inflow pattern by Doppler echocardiography often
reveals a restrictive cardiac filling pattern.77
Diastolic stiffness leads to an increase in intracardiac
filling pressures and reduced stroke volume, whereas systolic
dysfunction leads to a transient decline in CO. These early
restrictive hemodynamic findings are often transient but may
persist for 6 to 8 weeks after HT.78, 93 In the setting of an
excellent hemodynamic status, these changes are of little or no
consequence. However, if the initial CO is marginal, or if the
heart allograft function is obviously impaired, despite
inotropic support, this further, predictable decline in function
may necessitate additional hemodynamic support, including
additional vasoactive drugs, an intraaortic balloon pump
(IABP) or a left and/or right ventricular assist device (VAD).
assist support devices
When deciding the minimum heart allograft function
acceptable before leaving the operating room, considerations
should include, in addition to the cardiac index (CI), the dose
and number of inotropic agents employed to enable separation
from CPB, the independent function of the RV and LV, and
the recipient risks for right heart failure.
Heart rate is variable and ranges from bradycardia to
tachycardia. Factors such as parasympathetic denervation,
surgical trauma, catecholamine administration, and even
genomic variations in the Î²-adrenergic receptor may affect the
sinus node rate.94 Although sinus rhythm is typically observed,
sinus node dysfunction may arise from injury related to donor
cardiectomy or preservation. In this instance, the cardiac
rhythm is usually either junctional or accelerated junctional.
The incidence of sinus node dysfunction is reduced with the
bicaval or total orthotopic HT technique, as compared to the
classic biatrial technique developed by Lower and Shumway.79
Sinus node dysfunction is usually transient but may persist for
several weeks after HT. Sinus node dysfunction requiring a
pacemaker occurs in about 5% of patients undergoing biatrial
anastomoses. Pre-operative use of amiodarone in heart
transplant recipients may increase the risk of sinus node
dysfunction and bradyarrythmias in the early post-operative
period. This may require the use of isoproterenol,
theophylline, or more prolonged temporary atrial pacing. The
need for permanent pacing may increase with donor age.80
Heart rate is generally maintained in the 90 to 110 bpm range
after HT using atrial or atrioventricular (AV) pacing or
chronotropic drugs. This rate contributes to maintaining an
adequate CO and permits adequate cardiac filling in the setting
of decreased stroke volume and diastolic dysfunction
immediately after heart transplantation. In the setting of 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 9
significant donor under sizing with respect to the recipient
(donor weight > 30% below recipient weight), a higher heart
rate may be necessary to account for even lower stroke
volume indices.52, 81, 95
In the pediatric population the heart rate adequate to
maintain an acceptable CO also varies according to both donor
and recipient age.
Reduced myocardial contractility is frequently seen after
HT as a result of donor organ trauma, preservation and
ischemia, catecholamine depletion, and donor brain death. In
addition, myofibrillar degeneration can result from the
sympathetic storm accompaning brain herniation. Infusion of
one or more inotropes in the early post-operative period
usually provides the hemodynamic support needed in the first
few post-operative days as the heart allograft recovers. These
agents are usually weaned over the first post-operative week.
Primary Graft Failure and Right Ventricular Dysfunction
Primary graft failure after HT is the presence of severe
mechanical dysfunction without obvious anatomic (surgical)
or immunologic causes such as hyperacute rejection. Primary
graft failure has been variably defined in the literature as heart
allograft dysfunction requiring 2 or more inotropes, or the
need for mechanical circulatory support, either with an IABP
or a VAD within 24 hours of HT. The true prevalence,
therefore, depends upon the criteria used for diagnosis, but
estimates range from approximately 1.4% to 30.7%.82, 83, 96-100
It is important to recognize that PGF can result in RV, LV, or
biventricular failure.
Isolated RV failure is more common than biventricular
failure. Cardinal features include an elevated RAP > 20 mm
Hg, left atrial pressure < 10 mm Hg, with decreasing CO and
high pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, and a falling mean
arterial pressure, or normal PA pressures with falling CO.101,
102
Heart allograft failure accounts for 40% of the mortality
within the first 30 days after HT and 18% of the mortality for
the second through the twelfth months.98 Thirty-day survival
with PGF has increased over time from 43% during the period
from 1992 to 1997 to 57% during the period from 1998 to
2004.98 In addition to the increased risk of mortality during the
first month, PGF also confers a worse conditional 1-year
survival.81
The pathophysiology that underlies PGF is generally
multifactorial. It includes recipient characteristics such as
pulmonary arterial hypertension and increased PVR, and prior
MCS, donor characteristics and factors such as prolonged
donor ischemia time, poor organ preservation, and
development of reactive oxygen species.82, 84, 97-99, 103
Possible explanations for the association between preoperative
MCS and PGF are that pretransplant VADs may be
a surrogate of prolonged ischemia due to longer explantation
of the native heart or that the longer CPB times associated
with presence of a VAD may trigger a greater inflammatory
response which may increase the risk of PGF.103
Early heart allograft dysfunction has also been associated
with the use of organs from female donors into male
recipients; however, in recent times the results of some studies
have shown that increased body surface area in the recipient or
smaller donor for a larger recipient have not been associated
with worse outcomes.85, 98 There have been concerns that the
use of â€œmarginalâ€� or â€œextendedâ€� donors may lead to an
increased incidence of PGF. There are a number of criteria to
define the â€œextendedâ€� heart donor. These can be grouped into
non-cardiac and cardiac factors. Non-cardiac factors include
advanced donor age, donor size, and ischemic time. In
addition, other comorbidities of the donor, such as positive
viral serologies, diabetes mellitus, or substance abuse would
be considered as non-cardiac risks for suboptimal donor organ
quality. The cardiac criteria for â€œextendedâ€� donors include
LVH, congenital heart abnormalities, high donor
catecholamine requirements, RV and/or LV systolic
dysfunction and CAD.104 Lima et al. conducted a retrospective
study of 260 HT patients with both standard and â€œextendedâ€�
list donors.103 The â€œextendedâ€� list donors most commonly
were older and had diabetes. They reported no difference in
the incidence of PGF, with 23% in the standard group and
26% in the â€œextendedâ€� list. The two factors the authors
identified as risk factors poorer outcomes were length of
ischemia time and pre-operative MCS.
Assessment of graft function can be made by
hemodynamic measurement, TEE, and gross visual inspection
of the heart. The hemodynamic parameters that are suspicious
for graft dysfunction are a CI < 2.0 L/min/m2
, a RAP > 15 mm
Hg and a PCWP >15 mm Hg when on maximal inotropic
support. The RV stroke work (RVSW) or RVSW index
(RVSWI) [RVSWI = (mean pulmonary artery pressure
[MPAP]-CVP)*(SVI)*(0. 0136) (g*m/m2
) where 0.0136
converts mm Hg Hg-liters/beat beat-m2 to g*m/ m2
], which
have been used to assess RV function and likelihood of failure
in a non-transplant VAD population105, 106 may be helpful in
determining the appropriate time for institution of MCS
(Table 1).

Post-operatively, hemodynamically-significant RV
dysfunction is one of the most serious complications that can
occur after HT and it is associated with increased early and
late mortality. Patients should be carefully screened and then
monitored for the development of pulmonary vascular
hypertension while waiting for a suitable donor organ to insure
that the transpulmonary gradient (TPG) and PVR remain
within an acceptable range.107-109 These criteria are detailed in
the 2006 International Society for Heart and Lung
Transplantation (ISHLT) Listing Criteria Guidelines.86
Knowledge of the pre-operative pulmonary hemodynamics
may aid the planning of peri-operative strategies to avoid or
better manage RV dysfunction. Pulmonary artery pressures
may decline rapidly after HT and usually reach a new baseline
by 1 year.87 Even when initially poor, RV function typically
improves over time with proper support. It is during this early
post-operative period when PA pressures are highest and RV
function is poorest that overt RV dysfunction may develop and
lead to cardiogenic shock. Timely and aggressive
hemodynamic support during this time is essential. When
pharmacologic therapy fails, prompt insertion of a right VAD
is indicated and can provide support while RV dysfunction
resolves.88
Several features may be present in patients with postoperative
RV dysfunction after HT. First, there is an increased
PVR that may be due to reversible pulmonary vasoconstriction
as well as chronic changes due to remodeling of the
pulmonary vasculature.110 Second, there is RV dysfunction
due to either graft-related issues, such as ischemia, or PGF.88
Usually LV systolic and diastolic functions are adequate and
thus LV end-diastolic pressure is low. In this instance RV
dysfunction leads to a reduction in the LV stroke volume due 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 11
to inadequate LV filling.88 If significant LV dysfunction is
present, there is the added feature of LV failure complicating
RV failure. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, insertion of
an IABP may effectively reduce LV afterload and improve RV
perfusion.
Therapy, in general, is aimed at reducing RV afterload
while maintaining an adequate but not excessive RV preload
(CVP < 15 mm Hg). Inotropic support of the RV should also
be provided; usually an IV drug with Î²-agonist properties is
selected first. Mean arterial blood pressure must be maintained
not only to insure end-organ perfusion but also to maintain RV
perfusion, which occurs in systole as well as diastole. Mild
RV dysfunction may be treated with inotropic agents and
vasodilators such as nitroglycerine or nitroprusside.88
Systemic vasodilation leading to arterial hypotension or
necessitating the addition of peripheral vasoconstrictors is a
frequent limiting factor in the use of these agents. The ideal
agent should selectively decrease PVR. At least equivalent, if
not superior RV afterload reduction, with less systemic
hypotension is achieved by the administration of
prostaglandins. The only truly selective pulmonary vasodilator
currently available is inhaled nitric oxide (iNO).89
Data have also suggested that concomitant use of a
tricuspid DeVega annuloplasty may help preserve RV function
post-operatively and allow for lower RA pressures.111
Biventricular graft dysfunction can certainly occur with PGF,
and it will be associated with elevated filling pressures for
both ventricles, low CO, and hypotension. Isolated LV failure
is rare after HT. When this occurs, CAD in the donor heart
should be ruled out, and if needed, coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) performed.
Other Cardiac Abnormalities
Tricuspid Regurgitation
Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most common valvular
abnormality after orthotropic HT.112 Its reported incidence
varies between 19% and 84%, depending on the definition of
significant TR, time of diagnosis, and the surgical
transplantation technique.112 The incidence and severity of TR
may increase over time and progression to significant TR has
been associated with increased morbidity and mortality.112
Although the majority of patients do well with medical
therapy, a small proportion eventually requires surgical
intervention. The TR occurring in the early peri-operative
period is, for the most part, functional. The regurgitant jet is
typically central and caused by geometric distortion of the AV
annular ring and dilation, and malcoaptation of the valve
leaflets. Causes include biatrial anastomoses, allograft
rejection with RV dysfunction, or mismatch between donor
heart and recipient atrial size. In 166 patients undergoing HT
with a modified biatrial surgical technique, patients without
TR (67%) had a donor to recipient (D/R) ratio of < 1, whereas
those with moderate to severe TR had a D/R ratio of > 1.113
Compared to 88 patients with the bicaval approach, 161
recipients of the biatrial technique had an increased
occurrence and progression of TR (15% at 1 month, 30% at 24
months vs. 41% at 1 month, 52% at 24 months)114 This lends
strong support to the belief that preservation of atrial and
tricuspid annulus geometry is crucial in preventing
development of significant TR.
Other factors influencing atrial remodeling and
enlargement, including allograft rejection > ISHLT Grade 2
and pre-operative pulmonary hypertension independently
predict early TR development.112 The majority of patients with
moderate to severe TR are asymptomatic. However, adverse
clinical consequences have been reported, such as progressive
RV dysfunction and failure with debilitating symptoms of
dyspnea and peripheral edema, use of high diuretic doses,
deteriorating functional status, renal dysfunction, and even
decreased survival. The effects of sub-clinical TR remain
controversial. One report described a benign clinical course
for HT recipeints with less than moderate TR.115 In contrast,
Burgess et al observed that 9% of patients with TR diagnosed
during the fourth post-operative week had a 90% chance of
developing RV failure at a mean follow-up period of 5 years,
leading to an increased mortality (28% vs. 20%, p < 0.001).116
Progressive RV cavity enlargement, with disproportionate
elongation of the mid-minor axis, elevated right-sided
pressures and more advanced functional class, was associated
with more severe TR.112, 117 Up to 76% of patients with TR
had overt right-heart failure in the immediate post-operative
period, and this correlated with pulmonary hypertension after
HT.112 Lewen et al found that 13 of 14 (93%) patients with
moderate to severe TR after HT had RV volume overload and
higher PVR.118 Williams et al noted higher RAP (mean 10 vs.
6 mm Hg, p < 0.05), lower CI (mean 2.0 vs. 2.5 L/min/m2
, p <
0.05) and greater right-side cardiac dimensions in 23 of 72
patients with moderate to severe TR.119
With longer follow-up duration, the severity and clinical
impact of TR worsens. Among 238 patients who survived â‰¥ 1
year after HT, Aziz et al observed persistent higher mean
RAP, PA systolic pressure and RV dimensions among patients
with clinical TR. Clinically, 35% of patients complained of
fatigue, 61% had chronic fluid overload, 78% had lower
extremity edema, and 29% had liver congestion. Furthermore,
renal function and physical capacity were inferior in the same
group.120 Progression of TR has also been correlated with
change in RV diastolic area and tricuspid annulus, and intra-
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 12
operative TR severity showed a strong correlation with RV
dysfunction, peri-operative mortality and odds of late
survival.112, 120, 121
The mainstay of therapy for symptomatic severe TR is
use of diuretics. In refractory cases, surgical intervention with
tricuspid valve annuloplasty, repair or replacement, should be
considered, depending on the anatomic abnormality of the
tricuspid valve apparatus. In tricuspid annular dilation,
application of an annuloplasty ring may be sufficient to reduce
the effective regurgitant orifice. In contrast, surgical repair or
replacement is required with leaflet or chordal damage to
restore a functional AV valve apparatus in the right heart.
Overall, various reports have cited tricuspid valve replacement
(TVR) incidence rates between 4% and 6% in HT recipients,
with a mean lag time of 12 to 21 months.112, 122, 123 In another
series, however, only 5/526 (0.95%) HT recipients later
required tricuspid valve surgery due to severe TR.124 If
replacement is performed, the best results are achieved before
RV function deteriorates due to severe TR.125 Most patients
have shown a reduction in their furosemide dose and lower
serum creatinine levels, as well as significantly improved
albumin and total bilirubin values, implying relief of hepatic
congestion.112, 123 Prophylactic tricuspid valve annuloplasty
(TVA) on the donor heart at the time of transplantation has
been shown to reduce TR immediately after HT as well as on
long-term follow-up. Sixty patients undergoing orthotopic HT
with bicaval anastomosis were randomized to either
concomitant DeVega TVA or no intervention on the donorâ€™s
TV. At 5 years of follow up, compared to patients without TV
intervention, recipients of the DeVega TVA had lower perioperative
cardiac mortality [3 (10%) vs, 7 (23%); p < 0.05],
average amount of TR (0.5Â± 0.4 vs. 1.5Â± 1.3; p < 0.05),
percentage of patients with TR â‰¥ 2+ (0 vs. 34%; p < 0.05),
serum creatinine (sCr) (1.8Â±0.7 vs. 2.9Â±2.0 mg/dL; p < 0.05)
and change in sCr from baseline (0.7Â±0.8 vs. 2.0 Â± 2.1 mg/dL;
p < 0.05).111 These benefits did not result in significant
differences between groups in 5 year survival. Other studies
yielded similar results.126
Mitral Regurgitation
Mitral regurgitation (MR) can occur in > 50% of all HT
recipients in the peri-operative period.115, 127 It typically occurs
in the absence of donor heart structural pathology, but in some
cases it results from incomplete mitral leaflet coaptation due to
atrial enlargement.
Other less common causes of MR include asynchronous
atrial contraction due to donor and recipient sinus node
discharge, papillary muscle ischemia, or LV outflow
obstruction. In most cases, MR is mild and asymptomatic.68-71,
128-131 The need for mitral valve repair or replacement is very
rare.
Recommendations on the Management of Perioperative
Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation111, 112:
Class I:
1. Tricuspid valve regurgitation identified intra-operatively
and estimated to be moderate or severe (> 2+), should be
re-evaluated by TTE or TEE within 24 hours of HT and
closely monitored for the first few post-operative days.
The frequency of subsequent follow up should be guided
by clinical and hemodynamic variables.
Level of Evidence: C.
Class II:
1. DeVega annuloplasty of the donor TV can be considered
to maintain the normal size of the TV annulus.
Level of Evidence: C.
Pericardial Effusion
The development of pericardial effusion has been shown
to occur in more than 20% of HT recipients.132 Nonetheless,
pericardial effusions are rarely associated with hemodynamic
instability and typically resolve spontaneously by the fourth
post-operative week.133, 134 Moreover, it is uncommon for
pericardial effusions to progress to cardiac tamponade.135 In
fact, large but slowly accumulating pericardial effusions
usually cause little hemodynamic impairment in HT
recipients. However, the development of a loculated
hematoma or mediastinal bleeding, which can develop rapidly
in the early post-operative period, may result in tamponade
physiology.136 Occasionally, there is isolated RV tamponade
that may be difficult to distinguish from primary RV failure.
Echocardiography is important for recognition and timely
return to the operating room for exploration and evacuation of
the hematoma to improve RV mechanics and function.
Although early reports identified an association between acute
heart allograft rejection and the development or rapid increase
of post-operative pericardial effusions, this finding was not
confirmed in newer retrospective studies.132
In a recent retrospective analysis of 203 HT recipients, the
three factors that predicted the development of post-operative
pericardial effusion were absence of a previous cardiac
surgery, the intra-operative use of aminocaproic acid, and
lower recipient weight. The reasons for the association of
these factors with pericardial effusions occurring after heart
transplant remain unclear.137

Recommendations on the Management of Perioperative
Pericardial Effusions132, 137:
Class I:
1. Pericardial effusions occurring after HT should be
monitored by echocardiogram.

the pericardial effusion causes hemodynamic
compromise.
Level of Evidence: C.
Class IIa:
1. Pericardial effusions that are not hemodynamically
compromising do not require drainage unless there is a
strong suspicion of an infectious etiology.
Level of Evidence: C.
Pharmacologic Management of Primary Graft Failure
and Right Ventricular Dysfunction
The pharmacologic management of PGF and RV heart
allograft dysfunction includes the use of high-dose inotropic
agents and/or pulmonary vasodilators.
Intravenous Vasoactive Medications
Vasoactive medications are selectively employed in the
immediate post-operative period (including the period leading
to separation from CPB) to achieve several specific goals: (1)
inotropic support of the RV and/or LV; (2) chronotropic
support; (3) increase of pulmonary blood flow/pulmonary
vasodilation; and (4) peripheral arterial vasodilation or
vasoconstriction.
Frequently, agents are chosen for their ability to increase
both contractility and heart rate while decreasing pulmonary
and systemic vascular resistance. As a potent chronotrope,
inotrope, and vasodilator, isoproterenol is in many respects the
ideal agent for hemodynamic support after HT, particularly in
the setting of bradycardia or sinus node dysfunction. It has
been a commonly used agent since the early days of HT.78
However, tachycardia can limit its usefulness, particularly in
bicaval and total HT, where the incidence of sinus node
dysfunction is lower than with the biatrial surgical technique.
Whereas the dose range for isoproterenol is usually 2 to 10
Âµg/min, this drug can be titrated to achieve a target heart rate
of 90 to 110 bpm. Atrial pacing combined with dobutamine
achieves results similar to those of isoproterenol.
Combined infusion of low-dose dobutamine and
dopamine (both at starting doses of 2.5-5 Âµg/kg/min) is
another commonly used inotropic regimen after HT.138 This
combination of inotropes may be titrated to achieve the
desired hemodynamic effects. Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor with inotropic and vasodilatory properties, may also
be considered for hemodynamic support, particularly in the
setting of pulmonary vascular hypertension, high systemic
vasomotor tone or if there is evidence of heart allograft
dysfunction upon separation from CPB.139
In some instances, peripheral arteriolar vasoconstrictors
may be required to counteract the vasodilation seen during or
after CPB and maintain a systemic arterial pressure adequate
for the perfusion of vital organs. While the etiology of this
vasodilation is unclear, several hypotheses invoked to explain
its occurrence include the release during CPB of cytokines,
which may produce a systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS), the effects of pre-operative medications
such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or
relative/absolute deficiency of vasopressin. Septic shock
arising from an occult intra-abdominal catastrophe must also
be considered, especially if there is lactic acidosis that persists
beyond 6 hours after HT.140 The range of vasodilation seen in
the post-operative period ranges from mild and responsive to
the infusion of a low dose of a single Î±-adrenergic agent to
quite profound and refractory to high levels of multiple
vasoconstrictors. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene
blue has been successfully used for the treatment of
catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia after CPB.141 It has been
demonstrated that an infusion of low-dose arginine
vasopressin can improve vasomotor tone (and thus arterial
pressure) and permit reduction or discontinuation of high-dose
catecholamines in patients receiving left VADs.142 Arginine
vasopressin has also been shown to prevent hypotension after
CPB in patients undergoing CABG or valve surgery

Pulmonary Vasodilators
Prostanoids
The prostanoids are naturally occurring substances that
produce vasodilation by inducing smooth muscle relaxation.
They have short half-lives, on the order of minutes, and are
potent pulmonary vasodilators. Of the prostanoids,
prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and epoprostenol or prostacyclin are
given IV whereas iloprost is sdministered by inhalation.
Prostaglandin E1
The use of continuous infusion PGE1 for RV dysfunction
due to pulmonary hypertension after HT has been described in
numerous case reports.143, 144, 151 PGE1 is metabolized in the
first pass through the pulmonary circulation and, therefore, the
risk of systemic arterial vasodilatation is reduced but not
completely eliminated. Kieler-Jensen, et al. compared the
systemic and pulmonary vasodilating effects of PGE1 with
iNO and IV prostacyclin. This increased CO more than either
PGE1 or iNO, but iNO reduced PVR more and was the only
pulmonary selective vasodilator and thus preferred in the
setting of systemic hypotension.89, 152
Prostacyclin
Intravenous prostacyclin (PGI2) is an approved therapy
for pulmonary arterial hypertension (World Health
Organization Group I). Pascual et al. reported a series of 9
patients who developed RV dysfunction early after HT despite
inotropic and vasodilator infusions. Prostacyclin infusion,
started at 0.5 ng/kg/min and titrated to 5.0 ng/kg/min, resulted
in an increased CI with reduced RAP and mean PA pressures.
Therapy was maintained for 48 hours and weaned over 24
hours.145 Comparative studies have shown more pulmonary
vasodilator effects and more pronounced peripheral
vasodilation with PGI2 than with nitroprusside and
nitroglycerine.89
Continuous inhaled PGI2 has also been used in the
treatment of RV dysfunction after HT and cardiac surgery.
Haraldsson, et al. reported its use in 9 patients (2 of whom
were HT recipients) with pulmonary hypertension and an
increased PVR. Inhalation of PGI2, at 10 Âµg/mL, produced
reductions in mean pulmonary artery pressure and PVR
without affecting systemic vascular resistance. No change in
CO was noted.153 The use of the intermittently inhaled
prostacyclin analogue, iloprost, has also been reported.146
Inhaled Nitric Oxide
Nitric oxide (iNO), also previously known as endothelialderived
relaxation factor, causes vasodilation by activating
guanylate cyclase and increasing the production of cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which then activates a
cGMP protein kinase leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
When inhaled in doses up to 80 ppm, it causes selective
pulmonary vasodilation leading to reduced PVR, increased
pulmonary blood flow, and reduced RV afterload. It reacts
readily with oxyhemoglobin to yield methemoglobin and
nitrate, thus, its activity outside the pulmonary vasculature is
limited and, generally, systemic vasodilation does not occur.
Nitric oxide has been shown to reduce PVR, increase RV
stroke work, and reduce the incidence of RV dysfunction. It
also appears to be safe with a very low incidence of
methemoglobinemia with proper monitoring. In addition,
because iNO produces vasodilation in the areas of the lung
that are well ventilated, theoretically it should not exacerbate 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 15
ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching. Consequently, it
would seem to be the optimal selective pulmonary
vasodilator.154
However, despite its theoretical advantages, the clinical
use of iNO remains somewhat controversial. In the United
States, its only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved indication is for hypoxic respiratory failure in the
newborn. Studies in adult respiratory distress syndrome have
identified no consistent benefit. Its use in managing RV
dysfunction after left VAD implantation has been described.155
Data in HT is limited to small case series and anecdotal
reports.89, 147, 148, 156, 157 There have been no adequately
powered trials to critically assess mortality or other outcomes.
Sildenafil
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is an
evolving therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension that may
have a role in the treatment of RV dysfunction after HT.
Michelakis et al. demonstrated in 13 patients referred for heart
and lung transplantation that a single dose of sildenafil was as
effective and selective as iNO for pulmonary vasodilation.158
Case reports and small anecdotal studies suggest sildenafil
may attenuate the rebound pulmonary hypertension sometimes
noted with withdrawal of iNO and reduce PA pressure after
cardiac surgery.159-161 In a series of 13 patients with RV
dysfunction and low CO despite therapy with dobutamine,
isoproterenol, PGE1, and iNO during the first post-operative
day (1-18 hours) after HT, oral sildenafil at 3 mg/kg to a
maximum of 250 mg/day resulted in immediate hemodynamic
improvement.149 Although an oral form is widely available, an
IV formulation is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.

Mechanical Circulatory Support
The use of MCS for PGF has its origin in the use of MCS
for postcardiotomy shock since the 1960s.163 Most if not all
VADs have been used, from extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) circuits, to axial flow pumps,
centrifugal pumps and pulsatile devices, with a small literature
dominated by case series.83, 96, 97, 101, 102, 106, 163-172
IABP is the least invasive form of MCS and is used as the
first option for PGF after pharmacologic means.163 In most
reports of MCS and PGF, there is concurrent use of IABP and
other devices. Use of IABP alone is up to 66% to 70% in some
reports,101, 103 with use of other VADs of 22% to 29% and
ECMO in 7% to 10% of patients.
ECMO has been used to support patients with PGF who
fail to wean from CPB. Some recommend ECMO as the first
line of support because it makes separation from CPB
possible.102, 171 However, more recent publications have not
agreed with this recommendation.
Ventricular assist devices that have been used for
recovery in PGF include Pierce-Donachy VAD,167 Delphin
centifugal VAD,168 ABIOMED 5000 BVS,82, 96, 166, 169, 170 Biomedicus
centrifugal pump,82, 85, 101, 164-166 Novacor,83
Thoratec,82, 83, 101, 166 HeartMate LVAD,96 and Levitronix.84, 173
Newer percutaneous devices such as the TandemHeart have
anecdotally been used for PGF. In rare circumstances, a
Thoratec device can be implanted as an right VAD to allow
for patient physical therapy and ambulation while waiting for
graft recovery. Although the choice of device is influenced by
anatomical considerations, hemodynamic stability, and
surgeon preferences, VADs suited for temporary circulatory
support should be preferred. The VAD for PGF should be easy
to prime, implant, manage, and remove. In addition, it should
be less expensive than devices designed for long-term support
and require little anticoagulation for the first 24 hours postoperatively.
With the advances in MCS technology, the
smaller devices can now provide substantial support, with less
cost and less physical manipulation of the transplanted heart.
The Levitronix Centrimag is a magnetically levitated
centrifugal extra-corporeal pump that can provide flows of 5
to 7 L/min, and can be used for left, right, and bi-ventricular
support.173 The TandemHeart is an extracorporeal axial flow 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1

pump that has been used support cardiac function in
postcardiotomy shock.174 Flows of 4 L/min can be maintained,
and these VADs can also be used to support the LV, RV or
both. Oxygenators can be inserted into the circuit of these
VADs, if needed, which decreases the appeal for ECMO in
adults. An IABP can be used concurrently with a VAD for
PGF to facilitate afterload reduction and to maintain some
pulsatile flows. The Impella Recover LD/LP 5.0 has also been
used to support patients with postcardiotomy shock.175

Because of immunosuppression and the risks of infection,
the shortest possible duration of support is preferred.
However, once a VAD is implanted, it is often best to delay
weaning attempts for 36 to 48 hours. Evidence of heart
allograft recovery can be seen on TTE, although often TEE is
needed because of poor transthoracic acoustic windows.
Decreased requirement for inotropic support also signifies
graft recovery. Hemodynamic parameters such as a decrease
in RAP or RV end diastolic pressure may be helpful, but this
will depend on the configuration of MCS. Increased pulsewave
amplitude on arterial waveforms can also be a sign of
graft recovery.
Survival with PGF has improved over the past 15 years.98
Coupled with the recognition that early retransplantation
within 6 months of primary HT is associated with poorer
survival, there is now increasing consensus that bridging to
recovery results in better survival.84, 101, 176 Patient survival
rates to hospital discharge after MCS for PGF ranges from 0%
to 71% depending on the report and the type of MCS used.82-
84, 96, 101, 102, 163, 166, 177, 178 However, these data are based on
small case series or case reports. Causes of death include
sepsis, hemorrhage, neurologic complications, or multisystem
organ failure, specifically renal failure, and liver failure
associated with RV failure.

Pediatric Considerations
In the setting of acute RV failure in the peri-operative
period, it is imperative that any potential residual anatomic
lesions be investigated and rectified if present. This is
especially important in the child with complex congenital
heart disease who has undergone pulmonary artery
reconstruction. The associated abnormalities may be amenable
to intervention in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Less
commonly, the size of the left atrial anastamosis may be a
problem. If stenosis is hemodyamically significant and not
recognized intra-operatively by TEE, it is likely to cause
hemodynamic instability in the immediate post-operative
period and require a return to the operating room for revision.
Rarely, progressive pulmonary vein stenosis can be a problem.
The complication of high PVR leading to acute RV
failure, and the principles of post-operative management are
similar in children and adults. However, in the literature, with
studies showing variable outcomes with varying levels of PVR
or transpulmonary gradient elevation,179-184 have been reported
and there is no consensus regarding relative or absolute cutoff
values for HT candidacy. Even the values of parameters (PVR,
PVR indexed (PVRi), systolic PA pressure, and TPG) whose
properative measurement is deemed imprtant for risk
stratification remain controversial.88, 183, 184 Responses of
pulmonary arterial hypertension to vasodilators are also felt to
be of variable significance in terms of an accurate prediction
of outcomes.184 In addition, determination of PVR is difficult,
especially in infants with complex congenital heart disease.185,
186
In an early pediatric series of 6 patients with resting PVR
values between 7 and 15 Wood Units,187 5 underwent HT after
demonstration of a decrease in PVR in response to IV
nitroprusside and 4 were long-term survivors.187 Correlation of
PVR and PVRi values with outcomes after HT in 82 patients
aged 4 to 61 years showed188 that 33% of patients with a PVRi
of > 6 Wood Units developed RV failure with a mortality of
15%, wherease no patient with a PVRi below this value
developed RV failure. The results also confirm that high PVR
is not an absolute contraindication to HT as 28 of 33 patients
with a PVRi of > 6 Wood Units and 10 of 12 patients with a
PVRi of > 9 Wood Units were successfully transplanted.

The infant population with either congenital heart disease
predisposing to systemic pulmonary vascular pressures (duct
dependent single ventricle physiology) or cardiomyopathy
have a low incidence of significant post-operative
complications due to pulmonary vascular hypertension. Of
139 consecutive infant HT recipients up to 12 months of age,
only 1 death occurred as a result of pulmonary vascular

Class IIa, Level of Evidence C.
Arrhythmias
Heart rate is variable and ranges from bradycardia to
tachycardia. Factors such as parasympathetic denervation,
surgical trauma, catecholamine administration, and even
genomic variations in the Î²-adrenergic receptor may affect the
sinus node rate.94
Bradycardia
Most HT recipients display normal sinus rhythm upon
reperfusion. A complete or incomplete right bundle branch
block may be present in 14% to 60% of patients.190, 191 PR and
QT intervals remain normal, despite the bundle branch block.
However, the incidence of bradyarrhythmias ranges from 8%
to 64%.192-194 Sinus node dysfunction in the immediate postoperative
period may be related to surgical trauma, sinus node
ischemia, and recipient medical therapy and donor age and
ischemic time.195 In addition, the donor heart has an increased
sensitivity to and production of adenosine, which may
contribute to some peri-operative bradycardia.196, 197 Absolute
or relative bradycardia typically occurs within the first 2
weeks.198
Rates of sinus node dysfunction and the need for
permanent pacing have decreased with the adoption of the
bicaval Wythenshawe technique, and the total heart technique
that has separate anastamoses of the pulmonary and caval
veins, to replace the standard biatrial technique pioneered by
Lower and Shumway.192, 196, 199 In a randomized study of
surgical techniques, 36 of 41 patients with the bicaval
approach had sinus rhythm in the operating room, with the rest
returning to sinus rhythm in a few days. In contrast, the
biatrial method resulted in only 20 of 40 patients with
spontaneous sinus rhythm and 5 patients in whom sinus
rhythm never returned.200 In another report the rate of
temporary pacing was up to 38% in the standard biatrial
approach to transplantation and only 20% with the bicaval
technique.201 More recent data suggest that hospital length of
stay and need for pacing are also lower with the bicaval
technique.202
With modern surgical techniques, 18% to 27% of HT
recipients require temporary pacing.194, 203 Sinus node
depression is usually corrected by chronotropic support with
isoproterenol, dobutamine, or dopamine, which are routinely
used (see section on Pharmacologic management posttransplant).
Other pharmacologic agents that have been used
for bradycardia after HT are theophylline and terbutaline. As
there is invariably some diastolic dysfunction and a reduced
stroke volume in the post transplant heart, maintaining heart
rate is crucial to maintaining CO.
Tachyarrhythmias
Sinus tachycardia is the most common heart rhythm after
HT. With loss of vagal innervation and parasympathetic input,
the transplanted heart will assume the automatic sinus rate,
which should be < 130 bpm. However, both ventricular and
atrial tachyarrhthymias may occur in the post-operative
period.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are
common in the post-operative period. Studies have suggested
an incidence of 7% to 25% for arrhythmias lasting longer than
1 hour or leading to hemodynamic compromise.190, 204-206
Within the first 2 weeks after HT, AF is more common than
AFL, occurring in 5% to 24% of patients, although more
contemporary estimates are lower (6%-10%). The incidence of
AF after HT, may be less than that occurring after
conventional cardiac surgery.190, 207 When AF occurs within 2
weeks of transplantation, it does not appear to be associated
with rejection.204, 206 In contrast, later AF may be associated
with rejection and an increase in overall mortality.208 The
likelihood of AF after HT is greater with older donor and
recipient age. The incidence of AF in the post-operative period
does not appear to be affected by the surgical technique. A
large retrospective study showed that bicaval and total HT are
associated with a lower incidence of AFL201, 206 due to the
physical reduction of left atrial size by these procedures. The
development of atrial tachyarrhythmias may also be due to
conduction abnormalities in the donor heart. Accessory
pathways and re-entrant circuits have been described, in
addition to standard AFL macro-reentrant circuits. These can
be treated with radio-frequency ablation.207 Although
adenosine administration can help to clarify the diagnosis of
atrial arrhythmias in the HT recipient, the dose should be
reduced by one-half to one-third 209 because of an increased
sensitivity to its effects. Premature ventricular contractions 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 19
can be seen in as many as 95% of HT recipients in the
immediate post-operative period. 204 Non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia (VT) occurs in less than 2% of HT recipients, 190
and it is triggered by increased sensitivity to catecholamines
and longer ischemic times.
Pharmacologic management of tachyarrythmias is limited
because the donor heart is denervated. Digoxin will not be
effective for rate control. Î²-blocker therapy can lower heart
rates through direct effect on cardiac Î² receptors. The nondihydropyridine
calcium channel blockers, verapamil and
diltiazem, can help control heart rate, but should be used
judiciously because they can have negative inotropic effects
and inhibit the metabolism of CNI. Amiodarone can safely be
used after HT for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Sotalol
can be used in patients without significant renal dysfunction.
Dofetlide has many drug interactions and should be avoided if
possible unless there are no other antiarrhythmic options for
rate control.

may be used in HT recipients for rate control.
Level of Evidence: B.
Renal Function and Fluid Status Management
There are many insults to the kidneys in HT recipients.
The renal function of many chronic heart failure patients is
impaired due to chronic low output states, high venous filling
pressures, and upregulation of the renin-aldosteroneangiotensin
system leading to salt and water retention.210
Volume overload persisting after donor HT can acutely
distend the more sensitive, ischemically injured, pressure
overloaded RV and aggravate post-operative RV
dysfunction.225, 226
Cardiac cachexia and hypoalbuminemia can result in low
plasma oncotic pressures, ascites, peripheral edema, and
poorer outcomes.211 The cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic
resistance typical of advanced heart failure complicates postoperative
management of HT recipeients. Early institution of
CNI can further reduce responsiveness to diuretics due to the
renal vasoconstrictive properties of these drugs.
Patients receiving successful MCS can be better
nourished and euvolemic to even mildly hypovolemic at the
time of HT. The end-organ sequelae of chronic heart failure
are often resolved in these patients. Whereas renal function
and nutritional status are improved, the risk of peri-operative
bleeding and resulting hypovolemia may be increased.212
The use of blood products and management of
coagulopathy in HT recipients is discussed elsewhere in these
guidelines.

After HT, renal function may be a marker of cardiac
function. As RAP rise above 15 to 20 mm Hg, there is
increased renal venous pressure and decreased perfusion
pressure.213-215 Perfusionists can perform ultrafiltration during
CPB to reduce volume overload. Adequate CO can be
maintained using pharmacologic support or MCS if needed. If
oliguria develops, loop diuretics can be used. If urine output is
< 1 mL/kg/min, appropriate interventions should be initiated.
If preload is low, with RAP < 10 to 12 mm Hg, volume
replacement should be considered. If the RAP is high, then
continued use of diuretics or ultrafiltration should be
considered to reduce renal preload and improve renal
function.216, 217 In the heart failure and cardiorenal literature,
volume overload has been recognized as a risk factor for
worsening renal function.218, 219 Ultrafiltration can be
performed with either standard dialysis platforms, or with the
smaller continuous ultrafiltration machines. The smaller
machines can provide substantial rates of ultrafiltration with
limited effect on the mean arterial pressure, and do not require
the placement of dialysis catheters.220
The incidence of renal failure requiring hemodialysis after
HT ranges from 1% to 15%217, 221-224 and is associated with
increased mortality up to 50% compared with 1.4% to 4.2% in
patients not requiring renal replacement therapy.211, 222, 223 The
use of dialysis in the immediate post-transplant setting can be
transient.223 Risk factors for the development of renal failure
are longer bypass time, diabetes mellitus, and low serum
albumin levels, but not pre-operative sCr.223
For patients requiring MCS, ultrafiltration or dialysis can
be performed into the circuit in some systems, and should be
considered earlier in the setting of RV failure.169
If renal failure occurs in the immediate post-operative
period after HT, the addition of monoclonal or polyclonal
antibodies to delay initation of CNI should be considered. In
2007, 51% of HT recipients received mono- or polyclonal
antibody therapy, 28% with an anti-CD 25 (IL-2) receptor
antagonist, and 20% with anti-thymocyte globulin.225.
226-229
The use of both anti-thymocyte globulin and the IL-2 receptor
antagonist, basiliximab, to delay CNI initiation led to
improved renal function early after HT.230 231 More recently, a
single-center comparison of anti-thymocyte globulin with
basiliximab suggested that induction with anti-thymocyte
globulin confers better renal protection than basiliximab with
sustained benefits to 6 months after HT.232 Strategies to delay
the initiation of CNI, should be considered when there is preoperative
renal dysfunction, or a post-operative worsening of
sCr > 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 umol/L).

Peri-operative and Post Operative Metabolic Issues
Management of Diabetes Mellitus and Non-diabetic
Hyperglycemia
Hyperglycemia, which commonly complicates the clinical
course after HT, may be due to peri-operative exacerbation of
pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM), stress-related metabolic
derangements, or peri-operative corticoid (CS) therapy.
Studies have shown that tight glycemic control (80-110
mg/dL) in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients is
associated with reduced hospital mortality, bloodstream
infections, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and
transfusion requirements.233 In one study continuous insulin
infusions in diabetic patients undergoing CABG reduced
mortality and the incidence of deep sternal wound
infections.234, 235 High dose CSs, such as methylprednisolone
administered at the time of CPB, have been shown to
exacerbate hyperglycemia and impair glycemic control in the
post-operative period.236
A variety of protocols have been developed for postoperative
glycemic management. In addition to the goal of
achieving tight glycemic control, it is also imperative to avoid
dangerous hypoglycemia. In a recent trial of intensive glucose
control (glucose target range 81-108 mg/dL) versus
conventional control (glucose < 180 mg/dL) in 6104 medical
intensive care patients found that the higher mortality rate in
the intensive control was attributable to hypoglycemic
events.237 Many protocols include a concomitant dextrose
infusion to minimize this risk. Although no randomized trials
support the use of one protocol over another, a review of 12
regimens has shown that while 238 target ranges for blood
glucose are variable, levels < 200 mg/dL are consistently
associated with reduced surgical site infections.239
Diabetics should be monitored for the development of
diabetic ketoacidosis, because even Type II diabetics may
develop ketosis in the setting of stress such as surgery.
As a general rule, oral hypoglycemics should be
discontinued pre-operatively and not used in the immediate
post-operative period as they may be associated with
complications such as lactic acidosis (metformin), or fluid
retention (thiazolidinediones).240 The oral hypoglycemics may
be safely re-introduced during the first week after HT when
glucose levels have become stable. Insulin-dependent
diabetics should be converted back to intermittent
subcutaneous insulin when it is safe to do so.

Prophylaxis Against Infection in the Early Postoperative

Anti-infective agents are administered early after HT to
prevent post-operative and opportunistic infections, and to
continue treatment of pre-existing chronic infections (such as
chronic VAD-related bacterial infections).241 Specific
guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic
infections will be provided in separate guidelines. It is
important to recognize that antimicrobial regimens should be
tailored to the pathogens prevaling in the transplant center. For
example, if a hospital has a high incidence of aspergillosis in
the ICU, it might be appropriate for patients undergoing HT at
that institution to receive inhaled anti-fungal agents.

addition, infants with an open chest and/or requiring ECMO
support are a particularly high-risk group for invasive fungal
infection with a mortality of nearly 50% within the Pediatric
Heart Transplant Study.246 Therefore, it is common practice to
use an IV anti-fungal agent such as fluconazole for
prophylaxis in this group. In addition, in a large multicenter
registry, Pneumocystis jiroveci has been shown to occur at a
low incidence of 1% but associated with increased mortality,

Topic 3: Evaluation of Allosensitization,
Approaches to Sensitized Heart Transplant
Candidates, Hyperacute and Delayed
Antibody Mediated Rejection
Introduction
Serum antibodies directed against human leukocyte
antigens (HLA) have been associated with allograft rejection,
dysfunction, and loss. This was first demonstrated by Patel
and Terasaki, who documented poor survival of renal
allografts in recipients whose serum caused lysis of donor
leukocytes in an in vitro crossmatch test.248 This cell lysis was
later proven to be due to the presence of alloantibodies in the
recipientâ€™s serum directed against donor HLA antigens.249
Since then, various modifications of crossmatch testing, in
which recipientâ€™s serum is combined with donor cells, have
been routinely used to determine donor-recipient
compatibility. The crossmatch test helps clinicians avoid
transplantation of an organ into a recipient with donor specific
antibodies.
Methods for the Detection of Anti-HLA Antibodies
The detection of anti-HLA antibodies requires the
recipientâ€™s serum as the source of â€œunknownâ€� anti-HLA
antibodies and cells or materials bearing â€œknownâ€� HLA
antigens. These panel reactive antibody (PRA) tests, which
determine the percentage of possible donor HLA antigens
targeted by the recipientâ€™s preformed circulating antibodies, is
routinely used to assess the likelihood of a recipient to reject a
donor organ (Table 4).
The target HLA antigens may be constitutively expressed
antigens on the cell membranes of T-cells (Class I HLA
antigens) and of B cells (Class I and II HLA antigens).
Antibodies directed against these antigens may be detected in
a number of ways:
(1) The complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) method
evaluates target (donor) cell lysis occurring in the
presence of antibody-antigen complex and complement
activation and it is detected by the addition of a dye that
penetrates only into the lysed cells. This method has been
for the most part superseded by flow-cytometry
techniques.
(2) Complement-independent flow-cytometry enables the
detection of the primary anti-HLA antibody after target
(donor) cells are incubated with the recipientâ€™s serum and
a secondary fluorescent-labeled antiglobulin (AHG).

Adapted from Betkowski AS, et al.250
Briefly, these PRA tests consist of adding the recipientâ€™s
serum to HLA-antigen-bearing cells (lymphocytes) obtained
from a panel of random individuals from the local population
(usually 30-60) who are felt to be representative of the
potential donor pool. The PRA result represents the percentage
of the panel of cells which undergo lysis in the presence of the
recipientâ€™s serum. This PRA measurement does not specify the
HLA antigens against which the recipient has antibodies; it
simply estimates the percentage of the local donor pool that
will be incompatible. At most transplantation centers a percent
PRA â‰¥10% is the threshold above which virtual or real time
prospective crossmatch should be done to determine if the
recipient antibodies are actually directed against donor tissue
(see below).250 The correlation between preformed antibodies
directed against HLA antigens and poor outcomes after HT
has been demonstrated with both cytotoxicity and flow
cytometry methods.251 In both these cell-based assays,
recipient antibodies not specific for donor HLA antigens may
also bind to target cells and cause their lysis. The CDC assay
requires larger amounts of blood for antibody screening than
complement-independent assays, an important consideration
in pediatric HT candidates.
(3) Solid-phase assays permit identification of specific HLAantibodies
because individual HLA antigens are mounted 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 24
onto an artificial support such as plastic plates for ELISA,
microbeads for flow cytometry or the multiplex platform
Luminex.
The common denominator of these methods is the
presence of a high-affinity, clinically available anti-IgG
antibody coupled with an enzyme which produces a
assist support devices
colorimetric reaction when exposed to specific substrates
(ELISA) or fluorochromes (flow cytometry).
Evaluation of antibody specificity using panels of cells
can be difficult, especially in highly sensitized patients, even
after cumbersome adsorption/elution techniques to remove
non-HLA antibodies. Furthermore, the HLA types on the
panel cells used for screening should reflect the antigenic
frequency in the regional population of the transplant center.
The availability of single antigen-coated plates/beads greatly
facilitates the evaluation of antibody specificity. In highly
sensitized recipients, these assays can provide valuable
information regarding the specific HLA antigens not targeted
by recipient antibodies and therefore considered acceptable
donor/recipient pairs.
The availability of single-antigen assays also permits the
identification of rare or infrequently expressed HLA antigens.
For example, the less recognized anti-HLA class II DP
alloantibodies may mediate chronic humoral rejection in renal
transplant recipients.252 In addition, solid-phase PRA tests
enable one to distinguish a positive cytotoxic result due to
binding of anti-HLA antibodies to HLA antigens from cell
lysis due to binding of antibodies to non-HLA molecules also
expressed on the surface of T and B cells.251 It is important to
note that solid-phase assays can be altered by various
preparations containing HLA-Ab (IV Ig) or non-HLA
antibodies (antiplastic-antibodies, especially in patients with
hemodialysis or MCS).
Ideally more than 1 PRA screening method should be
performed on more than 1 occasion (separated by at least 2
weeks) for accurate assessment of the recipientâ€™
allosensitization status.252 The number of patients at risk for
developing antibodies against donorsâ€™ HLA antigens is
increasing due to previous transplants, use of homograft
materials in cardiac surgery, exposure to paternal HLA
antigens during pregnancy and transfusion of blood products.
Although the use of MCS devices may be associated with
elevated PRA levels, the antibodies which develop in this
setting may not be directed against HLA antigens and the
crossmatch may be negative.252There is no universally
accepted definition of a PRA threshold above which a real
time or virtual prospective crossmatch should be done.250
In a real-time prospective crossmatch, the donorâ€™s
lymphocytes are directly exposed to the recipientâ€™s serum and
observed for lysis prior to accepting the donor for transplant.
Real-time prospective crossmatch cannot be prospectively
performed in the absence of readily available donor cells or
when a short organ ischemia time is essential for successful
transplantation. This is the case in HT, particularly when the
donor heart is geographically distant from the recipientâ€™s
hospital. The predominant practice has been to accept only
organs from local donors for immunologically sensitized HT
candidates (candidates with serum antibodies directed against
HLA antigens), so that a prospective donor/recipient
crossmatch can be performed. The need for a prospective
crossmatch limits the pool of potential donors, and thus results
in longer waiting times, and higher waiting list mortality
while.253-255 As described above, assays that use HLA antigencoated
solid-phase matrices are capable of identifying HLAspecific
antibodies with high sensitivity and accuracy.
256
These methods have been used to predict immune
compatibility between donor and recipient by comparing the
potential recipientâ€™s HLA-specific antibodies with the HLA
type of the prospective donor, an approach called the virtual
crossmatch.257 The use of the virtual crossmatch in kidney
allocation is currently being debated.258, 259 Thus far, in kidney
transplantation the availability of virtual crossmatch has not
eliminated the need for a serologic prospective crossmatch. If
this demonstrates donor/recipient incompatibility, the organ is
reallocated to a different recipient.257

Donor/Recipient Histocompatibility250-253, 255, 256, 259:

Risk-Assessment and Prophylaxis Strategies for
Allosensitized Heart Transplant Candidates
Pre-transplant Strategies for Sensitized Patients
Several therapeutic regimens have been used to reduce
allosensitization before HT or to treat antibody-mediated
rejection (AMR). These therapies, however, have not been
tested in randomized, controlled clinical trials. The two main
strategies that have been employed to reduce allosensitization
include high-dose IV immunoglobulin (IV Ig) and
plasmapheresis (PP) combined with IV Ig or low-dose CMV
hyperimmune globulin (CMVIg). There are several agents and
interventions that can augment the potency of these treatment
modalities, including splenectomy, anti-CD20 antibody
therapy, and clinically available immunosuppressive
modalities (Table 2).252
High-dose IV Ig
The initial mechanism of action of IV Ig may be
neutralization/elimination of preformed antibodies by antiidiotypic
antibodies present in IV Ig. The IV Ig is believed to
diminish circulating antibodies levels, to inhibit B-cell
antibody synthesis and to attenuate complement-mediated
endothelial cell injury. This treatment modality can be used to
desensitize patients waiting for transplantation or used postoperatively
for treatment of AMR, is easily administered and
is less expensive than plasmapheresis. Treatment with IV Ig
does not uniformly reduce allosensitization, requires
administration of a large volume of fluid, results in a less rapid
antibody removal than plasmapheresis and effectiveness varies
from batch to batch. Its effectiveness has not been proven in
assist support devices

patients with a high titer of donor specific antibodies. In
addition for a period of time after IV Ig administration donor
specific antibody levels must be determined with alternative
methods. The IV Ig is given at a dose of 2 g/kg over 4 hours
and this dose is repeated monthly 4 times.
Plasmapheresis
Plasmapheresis rapidly reduces anti-HLA or isoagglutinin
antibodies levels. This reduction permits immunomodulation
at a lower IV Ig dose and induces donor-specific
unresponsiveness. Plasmapheresis has predictable kinetics, is
effective in patients with high donor-specific antibodies titers,
which can be easily monitored during therapy. The long-term
effectiveness of plasmapheresis is limited by the recurrence of
donor-specific antibodies if transplant does not immediately
follow this desensitization therapy. Performance of
plasmapheresis requires central access and the procedure is
expensive.
Plasmapheresis with Low-dose CMVIg
This procedure may be considered for patients requiring
urgent transplantation both pre-and post-operatively. Each
plasmapheresis session is followed by the administration of
CMVIg at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Inadequate availability of
CMVIg limits the delivery of this therapy.
Anti-CD20 (Rituximab)
The use of rituximab results in rapid and sustained
ablation of the B cell compartment, but it has no effect on
plasma cells or on circulating antibody levels. Rituximab
inhibits CD-20+
 B-cells proliferation and induces apoptosis in
these cells by antibody- and complement-dependent
cytotoxicity. Circulating antibodies levels may be more
effectively reduced when rituximab is combined with
plasmapheresis or IV Ig. Rituximab can be used pre- and postoperatively,
is generally well tolerated and it associated with
little toxicity. Rituximab does not eliminate plasma cells in the
spleen and bone marrow, it cannot independently reduce
donor-specific antibody titers, it may have immunosuppressive
effects which persist for months and it is very costly.
Rituximab is given at a dose of 375 mg/m2
 weekly for four
weeks and its effects are monitored with the performance of
CD-20+ cell count in the peripheral blood.260 Reconstitution of
normal B cells typically begins 6 to 9 months after termination
of rituximab.
Immunoabsorption
This therapy removes IgG 1, 2, and 4 subclasses, but not
the complement-binding IgG3. Immunoabsorption can be
carried out pre- and post-operatively and it is effective in
patients with high donor-specific antibodies titers, which can
be easily monitored during and after therapy. Therapy is
continued until IgG and PRA levels have been significantly
reduced compared to baseline. The disadvantages of
immunosabsorption include a high cost and an increased risk
of infections. This modality is generally not totally effective
when used alone.
Splenectomy
Splenectomy, which can now be performed with
minimally invasive techniques, is associated with a reduction
in plasma cells and precursor B cells. It may produce more 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 26
effective antibody reduction when combined with
plasmapheresis or IV Ig. The main limitations of splenectomy
are its inability to independently reduce donor-specific
antibodies titers and the life-long risks of sepsis from
encapsulated bacteria.258

Methods for Monitoring Allosensitization Status of
Patients before and After Heart Transplantation
Currently, there are no universally accepted standards for
the pre-operative monitoring of anti-HLA antibodies,
circulating immunoglobulins or lymphocyte subpopulations in
allosensitized patients. The presence of anti-HLA antibodies is
regularly monitored in allosensitized patients undergoing
desensitizing therapies until a compatible heart allograft
becomes available.250 In ambulatory, non-sensitized HT
assist support devices
candidates, it is reasonable to screen for anti-HLA antibodies
every 6 months. In HT candidates requiring blood
transfusions, anti-HLA antibody level determination should be
repeated 2 to 4 weeks later and prospective donor recipient
crossmatch is required if a suitable donor organ becomes
available in the interim period. No uniform recommendations
exist as to the frequency of antibody monitoring after an
infection or during MCS (Table 3).
As stated in the section pertaining to desensitization
therapies, circulating immunoglobulins are measured before
and after immunoabsorption and plasmapheresis, and
lymphocyte subpopulations before and after the use of
rituximab.
In addition to the post-operative retrospective crossmatch,
donor-specific antibodies levels should be obtained when
AMR is suspected or confirmed by EMB.
Although some reports suggest a correlation between
increased levels of soluble HLA class I molecules (sHLA-I)
and HT rejection, their determination is not routinely done in
the clinical setting.261
Measurement of donor-specific antibodies level should be
done if the finding of positive C4D staining in EMB tissue
suggests the presence of AMR.261 In addition, monitoring
donor-specific class I and class II HLA antibodies after
transplantation has been used as a diagnostic/prognostic tool
for AMR.254, 258

Hyperacute Rejection and Delayed AntibodyMediated
Rejection
Hyperacute rejection occurs in the presence of a positive
crossmatch and high levels of donor-specific antibodies that
are preformed and circulating in the recipient that leads to
immediate and overwhelming heart allograft failure shortly
after reperfusion. It is characterized by a cytotoxic
complement mediated antibody reaction and most often occurs
in the setting of preformed antibodies directed against epitopes
of the HLA system or ABO system. Allosensitized patients
who are sensitized may avoid hyperacute rejection by
desensitization strategies (described above) and, most
commonly, by acceptance only of donors with â€œacceptable
antigensâ€� and/or low level or â€œweakâ€� antibody responses.
Despite manoeuvres to avoid hyperacute rejection sensitized
recipients have a lower survival than those with PRA < 10%
and appear to experience delayed AMR associated with
elevated titers of donor specific antibodies.252

Acute AMR is observed in allosensitized patients and is
associated with inferior HT survival. The incidence may be up
to 15% in the first year after HT and the clinical presentation
has no pathognomonic features. Histological features include
myocardial capillary injury with endothelial-cell swelling and
intravascular macrophage accumulation. If these pathologic
abnormalities occur in the presence of unexplained HT
dysfunction, with or without symptoms of hemodynamic
compromise, immunostaining can be performed to look for
capillary deposition of immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM and/or
IgA) plus complement (C3d, C4d and/or C1q) by
immunofluorescence on frozen sections, CD68 staining of
macrophages within capillaries (CD31- or CD34-positive) by
immunohistochemistry, and C4d staining of capillaries by
paraffin immunohistochemistry.262
It is recommended that patients with hemodynamic
compromise undergo assessment for circulating antibodies.
Although screening is not currently advocated, every EMB
should undergo histologic evaluation for features suggestive of
AMR. If these are seen, the diagnosis of AMR should be
confirmed via immunohistochemistry, either
immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase, using antibodies
directed against CD68, CD31, and C4d, and a serum sample
should be tested for donor-specific antibodies. If these markers
are positive, a diagnosis of AMR can be made. Patients who
have several episodes of documented AMR should be
evaluated with at least 1 of these immunohistochemical
methods in each EMB and monitored for the production of
donor-specific antibodies. It is also recognized that acute
cellular rejection and AMR can co-exist, but further studies
are needed to determine the frequency and clinical
significance of this finding.262

Allosensitization in Pediatric Heart Transplant
Recipients
The frequency of HLA sensitization is increasing in the
pediatric population due to the greater number of patients with
complex congenital heart disease undergoing palliative
surgical procedures with exposure to blood products and
valved or non-valved allograft materials. These can induce a
strong HLA class I and class II antibody response that can
persist for up to 8 years after allograft implantation.242, 264, 265
In addition, the increasing application of pediatric MCS
technology for end-stage heart failure has led to an
unprecedented occurrence of allosensitization in children with
cardiomyopathy.243
The requirement of a negative prospective crossmatch in
critically ill children can negatively impact survival because it
inevitably prolongs the waiting time for a donor organ. A
retrospective analysis of HT candidates since 1990 (n=252),
for which CDC allo-antibodies data were available,
demonstrated that allosensitization influences both pre- and
post-HT outcomes.244 Of 252 subjects, 38 (15%) had preoperative
allosensitization, defined as a PRA > 10%. At 1 year
after listing, sensitized subjects had a hgher mortality than
non-sensitized subjects (22% vs. 8.4% p=0.055). Survival at
all time points after listing (regardless of transplantation) was
worse for sensitized subjects (p = 0.04).
Although no statistically significant differences in postoperative
graft or patient survival were noted, allosensitization

before HT was associated with decreased freedom from CAV
(hazard ratio 2.76, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 6.45;
p = 0.019). Because of the high wait-list mortality for
sensitized pediatric HT recipients, protocols for peri-operative
antibody removal without a prospective crossmatch have been
developed and utilized in some centers with reasonable
success. In 31 pediatric procedures, HT recipients with a
positive CDC crossmatch, the median B- and T-cell PRA
were, respectively, 76% and 52%. Almost 50% of the
recipients were older than 1 year of age at HT. Therapies in
most cases were intra-operative plasma exchange/
plasmapheresis, post-HT plasmapheresis, and drug therapy
using TAC, MMF, CS, and IV Ig. Survival rates at 1 year
were 84%, and probability of survival at 3 and 5 years were,
respectively, 79%, and 70%, similar to the overall US
transplant survival rates (www.unos.org). More than 70% of
the subjects experienced acute rejection events. However, the
frequency of rejection with hemodynamic compromise varied
widely (0-60%) between centers. Most acute rejection
episodes developed early, and C4d or C3d positivity generally
disappeared after the first few months. Evaluation of incidence
of CAV is ongoing, but survivors have normal graft function.
Age did not influence outcomes.245, 266
Data on the impact of desensitization strategies are even
more limited in the pediatric than in the adult population.
Results of desensitization procedures in children remain
inconclusive, because antigenic stimuli, such as devices and
allograft materials remain in place during therapy. Given the
inability to predict the timing of donor organ availability, the
potential morbidities associated with the available
desensitization therapies and the acceptable intermediate
outcomes of HT despite a positive crossmatch, most centers
do not practice desensitization strategies in highly sensitized
pediatric patients.

Topic 4: Management of Abo
â€œIncompatibleâ€� Pediatric Heart Transplants
Overview
When compared to older recipients, infants with severe
congenital cardiac malformations or cardiomyopathies
awaiting HT are known to be at greater risk of dying due to
the paucity of appropriately sized organ donors. This small
pool has provided compelling motivation to challenge
previous mandates against the usage of certain donors, such as
those of incompatible blood groups.267
Among potential HT candidates, infants are particularly
suited for this approach because of an immature immune
system that precludes T-cell independent responses.268 Taking
advantage of this natural lag in immune responsiveness, the
Toronto group reported a protocol in which infants
intentionally received ABO-incompatible heart allografts.
None of the infants received aggressive pre-operative
immunosuppression for antibody removal, and those who had
positive antibody titers underwent plasma exchange using the
CPB circuit at the time of HT. Short-term outcomes were
excellent, without a single patient developing hyperacute
rejection.269 Since the original report, centers have
increasingly adopted the practice of ABO-incompatible HT
with short-term results similar to those of the original Toronto
cohort.270-275 At the present time, intermediate-term results
appear equivalent to those reported for ABO compatible
pediatric HT recipients.271, 276
The safety and feasibility of pediatric ABO-incompatible
HT with the use of intra-operative plasma exchange has been
established.269 This strategy improved the likelihood of HT
and reduced infant waiting list mortality.271, 275, 277 These data
led to a UNOS policy change in September 2006 allowing the
listing for HT of infants across the ABO blood group
barrier.278
For neonates and infants undergoing ABO-incompatible
HT, in addition to the routine peri-operative management,
further attention must be paid to issues related to blood
product transfusion. Every effort must be made to avoid blood
products that may contain donor-specific antibodies, as this
may lead to AMR.
Patient Selection
assist support devices
Suitability for ABO-incompatible HT is ultimately based
on the stage of immunologic maturation of the candidate at the
time of evaluation. While age may correlate with the time of
development of isohemagglutins, it is the titers of these
antibodies that become critical in patient selection. There are
several reports in the literature of successful ABO-
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 30
incompatible HT beyond the infancy period in patients who
were 2, 3.5, and 5 years of age and who lacked
isohemagglutinins.270, 279 However, age itself is clearly not the
primary risk indicator, and serves only as a surrogate marker
for an individualâ€™s ability to produce isohemagglutinins. Even
for infants who have begun to produce isohemagglutinins, the
absolute titer above which HT is contraindicated remains
unclear. Successful HT even in children with donor-specific
isohemagglutinin titers as high as 1:64 has been reported.271
Five patients in the Toronto cohort with pre-operative
isohemagglutinin titers ranging from 1:8 to 1:128 underwent
successful HT without AMR and minimal re-accumulation of
anti-donor antibodies after HT. Therefore, the absolute upper
limit of age or isohemagglutinin titers remain unclear.

Intra-operative Management
Intra-operative management of ABO-incompatible infant
HT recipeints remains the same as initially described in the
original Toronto cohort.269 Briefly, all patients should have
isohemagglutinin testing before surgery. The CPB circuit is
primed with plasma as appropriate for the particular donorrecipient
blood group combination (Table 7). Approximately 2
to 3 times the total body plasma volume is exchanged during
the initiation of CPB to remove donor-specific
isohemagglutinins, which are remeasured before the release of
the aortic cross-clamp to ensure a negative or low donorspecific
titer (<1:4). With the utilization of pre-operative
plasma exchange, there have been no reported cases of
hyperacute rejection.

Titers of isohemagglutinins are measured with standard

period. ABO-incompatible heart transplant
recipients who develop rising titers of isohemagglutinins postoperatively
should be assessed for evidence of graft
dysfunction (e.g., hemodynamics, echocardiography, biopsy
as per institutional protocol, and/or clinical suspicion). In the
short-term, most patients do not develop rising titers of
isohemagglutinins. In the few that do, concern and/or evidence
for AMR have been very rare. In the 2 patients with reported
AMR in the Toronto cohort, management similar to that of the
sensitized population with a course of plasmapheresis and
augmentation of immunosuppression was successful.276, 278

Blood Product Management Following ABOincompatible
Transplantation
For children receiving blood products at any time postoperatively
it is mandatory to avoid blood products containing
antibodies that would be detrimental to both donor and
recipient. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully select plasma
products and platelets of the appropriate blood group, as these
preparations contain large quantities of immunoglobulins.280
Table 7 provides the reader with the appropriate matching of
blood products to specific recipient and donor combinations.
Whole blood transfusions must be avoided in a recipient of an
ABO-incompatible HT, and the families of these children
should be instructed to inform future medical care providers
that in case of surgeries and emergencies any blood product
must appropriately match to the childâ€™s situation. Parents can
easily understand and rememberthe information that group O
red blood cells and group AB blood elements are safe for
every blood group combination of heart donor and recipient.
The childrenâ€™s families can be provided with written
instructions than can be shared with the health care provider to
minimize the likelihood of errors.
Platelet preparations require special attention because the
handling of these blood elements is more similar to that of
plasma products rather than to that of red blood cells
(Table 7). The reason for this practice is because platelet
preparations contain very low levels of ABH antigens and
large amounts of plasma.280

and (c) CSs.269-275, 281, 282 All except 1 report have included the
use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as an induction agent in
the peri-operative period.275 The CSs are administered prior to
cross-clamp removal, and are weaned quickly over the course
of days to weeks. The results of all intermediate-term reports
confirm that immunosuppression in infant recipients of an
ABO-incompatible HT should not differ from that of all other
pediatric HT recipients, including CS-free maintenance
immunosuppression.269-276

Topic 5: Coagulopathies with Heart
Transplant Surgery
Introduction
Coagulopathy in Cardiac Surgery
Coagulopathies are common after all types of cardiac
surgery. It is estimated that blood transfusions are needed in
80% of all cardiac surgery patients. Nearly 15% of all blood
products in the US are used in association with cardiac
surgery.284, 285 Of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 20%
are prone to peri-operative hemostatic abnormalities that
require surgical revision in 2% to 6% of all patients.286-289
assist support devices
Cardiac surgery-related factors that contribute to
coagulopathies include platelet consumption and dysfunction,
hemodilution with consumption of clotting factors,
hypothermia, activation of the inflammatory cascade, and
fibrinolysis.290 Different studies consistently find advanced
age, increased pre-operative sCr level, small body surface
area, emergency surgery, low temperature during CPB,
assist support devices
duration of extracorporeal circulation (> 150 minutes),
combined valvular revascularization surgery, number of
bypass grafts (â‰¥ 5), reoperative surgery, and pre-operative
antiplatelet therapy to be risk factors for bleeding in cardiac
surgery.285, 286, 289, 291-293
Coagulopathy in Heart Transplantation
HT recipients have additional risk factors for perioperative
bleeding including recipientâ€™s coagulopathy, need
for repeat median sternotomy, and a prolonged CPB.294
Various factors contribute to a recipientâ€™s coagulopathy. First,
many patients are on anticoagulation pre-operatively for poor
LV function, AF, mechanical valves, or MCS. In the pediatric
population, patients with complex congenital heart disease
after multiple corrective procedures with or without allograft
material, patients being transplanted from ECMO, and
chronically cyanotic patients with extensive collaterals are
often very challenging in terms of peri-operative hemostasis.
Hepatic or renal dysfunction associated with heart failure can
also contribute to coagulopathies. Amiodarone-treated HT
recipients have greater peri-operative bleeding.295 Many HT
recipients have greater bleeding because native heart
explantation is complicated by adhesions due to prior
surgeries.
As therapies for advanced heart failure evolve, a greater
number of patients receive MCS as a bridge to HT. With the
exception of the Jarvik VAD which is placed through a
thoracotomy, most VADs are implanted through a sternotomy
and the resulting scarring remains a major source of HT
surgical bleeding. In addition, except for patients with the
HeartMate XVE, recipients of MCS require warfarin
anticoagulation, which is intensified if VAD-related clotting
problems occur. However, in some retrospective studies, the
use of warfarin has not been shown to increase the risk of
operative bleeding.296
Coagulation
Bleeding in cardiac surgery can be broadly divided into 2
categories: surgical bleeding (at an anastomotic site, from a
vessel, or at a suture line) or non-surgical bleeding
(coagulopathy). This review is mainly focused on non-surgical
bleeding. Hemostasis has been described in detail
elsewhere.297, 298 Briefly, the coagulation cascade consists of
an extrinsic system activated by a tissue factor
(thromboplastin), an intrinsic system activated by contact with
surfaces, and a common pathway. The complexity of the
coagulation cascade is further enhanced by the discoveries of 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 33
tissue factor expressing cells and platelets in a hemostatic
process that include initiation, amplification and
propagation.299 From the initial steps of homeostasis, both
platelets and coagulation activation are amplified. Thrombin is
a key activator of clotting through pathways that include
platelet activation and the formation of a fibrin clot as well as
the clot dissolving aspect with thrombomodulin and the
release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The final
product of this cascade is thrombus at the site of vascular
injury, limitation of clot propagation, and a time delayed
process of vessel recanalization.
Coagulopathy With Cardiopulmonary Bypass
In cardiac surgery, the use of the extracorporeal surface of
the CPB circuit disrupts the normal homeostatic mechanisms
that maintain blood fluidity. During extracorporeal circulation,
a decrease of coagulation factors and platelets as well as an
activation of fibrinolysis is observed. First, the hemodilution
caused by priming of the extracorporeal circuit can contribute
to this decrease. Further, there is activation and denaturation
of these coagulant proteins by the artificial surfaces.
Thrombin, which is continuously generated during CPB, can
be measured intra-operatively despite administration of high
heparin doses being administered.300-302 Platelets are activated
by the thrombin, fibrinogen bound to the circuit, and the shear
forces of contacting the surface. In addition, the circuit has no
endothelial cells that normally continuously suppress platelets
activation. With activation during CPB, platelets become
refractory to subsequent stimuli and are dysfunctional after
CPB.303-305 Approaches to reduce platelet activation include
controlled use of suction, avoidance of air bubbles, and use of
heparin-coated bypass materials or more biocompatible
extracorporeal circuits. Further, pro-inflammatory proteins
such as kallikrein and complement also become activated by
the extracorporeal circuit, which leads to the activation of
leucocytes, endothelial cells and the systemic release of
cytokines. This cascade results in inflammation that promotes
abnormal hemostasis and increases the risk of multi-organ
failure.306
Fibrinolysis, also activated by CPB, ceases with
discontinuation of the circuit. Perhaps increased fibrinolysis is
induced by the coagulation factors via activation of factor XII
and thrombin which in turn stimulate the release of tissue
plasminogen activator from the endothelium.
Hypothermia can also alter the clotting mechanisms.
Changes in platelet aggregation in patients undergoing
hypothermic CPB at 27Â°C to 28Â°C have been seen.307-309
assist support devices
Conventional tests of the hemostatic mechanisms are done at
37 C, which limits the detection of some of the clotting defects
during hypothermia.
Thus, IV heparin is used to prevent the catastrophic
clotting that can occur in an extracorporeal circuit. Heparin is
a heterogeneous glycosaminoglycan closely related to the
endogenous heparan present on the surface of endothelial cells
and in the extracellular matrix. This compound binds to
antithrombin with high affinity. This complex results in a
thousand-fold increase in binding affinity to thrombin and
factor Xa.310 High-dose heparin (300 to 400 U/kg) is routinely
used to anticoagulate patients before initiation of CPB.
Heparin dosing has been empirically established from the
activated clotting time (ACT) as the dose at which clotting no
longer occurs in the circuitry.311 Thus, many surgical teams
strive to keep an ACT > 400 seconds even though lower levels
may be effective.312 The main advantage of heparin is that its
anticoagulant effects can be reversed with the use of
protamine, which combines with heparin into a complex
devoid of anticoagulant effects. The efficacy is dependent on
the heparin-protamine ratio of 1:1 to 1:3. High doses of
protamine can cause inhibition of coagulation and platelet
aggregation and can paradoxically increase the risk of
bleeding.313 In addition, rapid injection of protamine can cause
histamine release and hypotension. It can also produce lifethreatening
pulmonary hypertension. Thus, minimization of
protamine dosage is preferred. The ACT is used to gauge
reversal of heparin effects. The goal is usually to achieve a
level < 130 seconds or within 10% of the pre-CPB value.
Testing to Evaluate Hemostasis in Cardiac Surgery
Pre-operative evaluation of hemostasis must include
knowledge of the patientâ€™s renal and hepatic function and
treatment with platelet inhibitors and oral anticoagulants. Preoperative
evaluation should include determination of the
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin
time (PT).314 This evaluation, however, falls short of
accurately predicting the risk of bleeding with cardiac
surgery315, 316 and of detecting defects of primary hemostasis,
such as von Willebrand disease and platelet dysfunction.286
At a minimum, intra-operative assessment of hemostasis
should include measurement of ACT due to its ability to
monitor high heparin concentrations used during CPB.
Limitations of ACT testing include variability of
commercially available devices and alterations in values with
the administration of aprotinin. The use of
thromboelastography, which measures the physical strength of
the fibrin clot during the coagulation process, has been shown
to improve diagnosis of intra-operative bleeding and to reduce
the need for blood transfusions.317-320 However, pre-operative 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 34
thromboelastography has limited ability to predict blood loss
during cardiac surgery.
Platelet function is the other important determinant of
operative bleeding. Platelet counts > 100,000/uL are generally
considered adequate for surgical hemostasis. Although platelet
aggregometry is the â€œgold-standardâ€� test of platelet function,
easier point of care assays, such as the one using the platelet
function analyzer-100 (PFA-100) are typically employed
during cardiac surgery. In these assays, whole blood is used to
test the time required for platelets to plug a hole in a collagencoated
cartridge through which blood is forced to flow. The
ability of these assays to predict the risk of intra-operative
bleeding is uncertain.319, 321, 322
Tests of fibrinolysis include fibrinogen levels and Ddimer
values. Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin in
route to becoming a clot. Levels can be directly measured,
with normal values being in the range of 150 to 400 mg/dL. A
fibrinogen level > 100 mg/dL is adequate for hemostasis.
Fibrinolysis is a process in which plasmin cleaves cross-linked
fibrin to produce dimeric units (D-dimer). Values of D-dimer
values correlate with the level of fibrinolysis present in the
surgical patient and with the risk of bleeding after cardiac
surgery.323
Most tests of hemostasis have not been evaluated in
randomized clinical trials. Assay values considered significant
are derived from clinical bleeding but not specifically from
that occurring during cardiac surgery.

in Heart Transplant Recipients314:

Reversal of Anticoagulation before Heart
Transplantation
In patients chronically anticoagulated with warfarin
undergoing cardiac surgery, including HT, the risk of bleeding
is likely to be increased when the international normalized
ratio (INR) is â‰¥ 1.5. Therefore, it is reasonable to reduce the
INR to this level at the time of surgery.324 Several therapies
are available for the reversal of oral anticoagulation, and these
include oral or IV vitamin K, human fresh frozen plasma
(FFP), prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), and
recombinant active factor VII (rFVIIa).325 Vitamin K alone is
inappropriate if rapid normalization of the INR is required,
because the onset of action is 4 to 6 hours after IV
administration and at least 24 hours after oral
administration.324 Therefore, when rapid reversal of warfarin
is needed, vitamin K at doses of 2.5 to 5 mg should be
administered IV in conjunction with FFP, PCCs, or rFVIIa.325
The PCCs are concentrates of essential coagulation
factors, often including factors II, VII, IX, and X.326 Whereas
in the US, PCCs and rFVII are not approved by the FDA for
reversal of anticoagulation, in Europe these substances are
approved specifically for this indication. The PCCs are
appropriate for emergency reversal of oral anticoagulation
because of their rapid onset of action. A dose of 500 U
(typically approximately 7 U/kg) is effective for rapid
correction of an INR < 5, but higher doses (up to 50 U/Kg)
may be necessary in patients with INR values above this
level.327
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 35
Comparative studies have demonstrated that PCCs are
more effective than FFP for correcting patientsâ€™ INRs. In one
such study, the mean post-treatment and lowest INR values in
patients receiving 4 units of FFP were, respectively 2.3 and
1.6, compared with 1.3 in patients receiving PCC at a dose of
25 to 50 U/kg.328-332 Also, post-treatment levels of factor IX
were much lower in the FFP group than in the PCC group (19
vs. 68.5 U/dL). Similarly, in a second study, only 1 of 6
patients receiving 4 units of FFP achieved a safe INR level <
1.5, compared with 5 of 6 patients receiving PCC (50 U/kg).325
In this study, the mean correction time was 41 minutes with
PCC, significantly shorter than the 115 minutes observed with
FFP. The time required for INR correction was reported to be
4 to 5 times shorter with PCC. Another advantage of PCCs
over human plasma is that smaller volumes of PCCs are
required to reverse anticoagulation, because the concentration
of clotting factors in PCCs is approximately 25 times higher
than that in human plasma.326, 332 Although human plasma is
often administered at doses approximately 15 mL/kg, double
human plasma doses or 2.4 L in an 80-kg patient, are required
to reverse anticoagulation in critically ill patients.325 In
contrast to FFP, recommended doses of PCC can be delivered
at a volume of 1 to 2 mL/kg. With PCCs the smaller volumes
minimize the risk of worsening fluid overload and shorten
infusion time.325 Compared to FFP, PCCs can be prepared
faster, can be stored at room temperature, avoiding the need
for thawing and warming, and do not require crossmatching
before administration. Thus the time from patient presentation
to correction of INR is much shorter with PCCs than with FFP
(15 min vs. 1-2 hr).326 The PCCs may also be associated with
lower risks of viral or prion contamination and of transfusionrelated
acute lung injury (TRALI), a major cause of death after
transfusion.325 The PCCs have been associated with a modest
risk of thrombogenic events.
Although preliminary studies have demonstrated the
safety and efficacy of rFVIIa for anticoagulation reversal, this
modality is not yet approved in either the US or Europe.
Advantages of rFVIIa over FFP are similar to those of PCCs,
including low infusion volume and rapid administration time,
but comparative studies are lacking.325, 333

Recipients with Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immunemediated
disorder characterized by the formation of antibodies
against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. The frequency
of HIT ranges from 0.2% to 5.0% in patients exposed to
heparin for more than 4 days. In addition to duration of
therapy, the 3 factors most strongly associated with the
development of HIT include use of unfractionated rather than
low-molecular-weight heparin, surgical rather than medical
setting, and female gender.334
assist support devices
There are a number of anticoagulants that can be used
instead of heparin in patients with HIT including a direct
thrombin inhibitor such as lepirudin (recombinant hirudin),
bivalirudin, or argatroban; or danaparoid. To date, no
prospective randomized studies have compared the relative
efficacy and toxicity of the available agents. However,
because of their different modes of excretion and inactivation,
patients with HIT and renal insufficiency are usually treated
with argatroban, whereas those with hepatic impairment are
typically given lepirudin.
Lepirudin (RefludanÂ®) is a recombinant hirudin approved
by the FDA for the treatment of HIT complicated by
thrombosis. A starting dose of lepirudin â‰¤ 0.10 mg/kg/hr has
been recommended in patients with serum creatinine < 1
mg/dL. Because the drug undergoes renal clearance and
anticoagulant effect is not easily reversed, doses must be
decreased in patients with renal insufficiency and the aPTT
must be closely monitored to avoid drug accumulation.335
Bivalirudin (Angiomax), a hemodialyzable direct
thrombin inhibitor and hirudin analog has been successfully
employed in patients with HIT, with reduced doses safely
employed in patients with combined hepatic and renal failure.
It is approved by the FDA for patients with, or at risk of, HIT
who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The
recommended initial dose of bivalirudin for HIT is
approximately 0.15 mg/kg/hour, adjusted to achieve an aPTT 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 36
of 1.5 to 2.5 times the baseline value. Doses of 0.14
mg/kg/hour in patients with hepatic dysfunction and 0.03 to
0.05 mg/kg/hour in patients with renal or combined hepatic
and renal dysfunction have been successfully employed. The
development of anti-hirudin antibody formation can occur
with longer treatment.
Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor with a short in
vivo plasma half-life of 24 minutes; and its effect is monitored
by the aPTT. In patients with normal hepatic function, the
standard starting dose is 2 Âµg/kg/min by continuous IV
infusion, adjusted to maintain the aPTT at 1.5 to 3 times the
baseline value. Due to hepatobiliary elimination, a lower
starting dose (0.5-1.2 Âµg/kg/min) is appropriate in patients
with hepatic dysfunction, combined hepatic/renal dysfunction,
heart failure, or anasarca.335 In such patients, the aPTT should
be checked at 4-hour intervals after drug initiation or dose
change to ensure that the desired level of anticoagulation is
present. An even lower starting dose of argatroban (0.2
Âµg/kg/min) may be appropriate in critically ill patients with
multiple organ dysfunction and HIT.335
Danaparoid (OrgaranÂ®) is a heparinoid that includes
predominantly dermatan sulfate and low-sulfated heparan
sulfate. It is available in many countries but not in the US.
It has been given to patients with HIT or a history of HIT
who require CPB. The recommended dose includes an initial
IV bolus of 2250 U, modified up or down according to body
weight, followed by an IV infusion of 400 U/hr for 4 hours,
300 U/hr for the next 4 hours, and 200 U/hr thereafter. Doses
are adjusted to achieve anti-Xa levels of 0.5 to 0.8 U/mL.
Disadvantages of danaparoid include the need to measure antifactor
Xa levels, its long half-life (25 Â± 100 h), renal
elimination, and the absence of an antidote.335
Other approaches, including plasmapheresis, are not
effective for the treatment of HIT and should not be used in
place of the compounds described above.
Patients with a history of HIT who require CPB have been
successfully anticoagulated with a brief course of
unfractionated heparin without complications. This approach
is based on the theory that a secondary immune response after
re-exposure to heparin is unlikely to occur until at least 3 days
later. Thus, a brief exposure to heparin during CPB should not
immediately elicit HIT antibodies. Furthermore, because
heparin is rapidly cleared after the procedure, even if
antibodies appeared, they would not be thrombogenic in the
absence of heparin. In a report of 3 patients with HIT
requiring urgent HT, re-exposure to unfractionated heparin in
the absence of heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA)
was uneventful.336 Heparin was discontinued and a direct
thrombin inhibitor (agatroban or lepirudin) was used for a few
hours post-operatively in all 3 cases to prevent recurrence of
thrombosis due to the re-exposure to heparin. Another report
yielded similar results.337

Pharmacologic Management of Bleeding
Aprotinin
Aprotinin is a potent inhibitor of the serine proteases
including plasmin, thrombin, kallikrein, and activated protein
C. The safety and efficacy of aprotinin in reducing bleeding
during cardiac surgery has been demonstrated in several metaanalyses
but has not been tested in large-scale randomized
trials.338-341 In a cohort of HT recipients, aprotinin was found
to significantly reduce bleeding in those with previous
sternotomies but not in patients without prior surgeries.294 In
addition,342, 343 a recent large observational study has shown an
increased risk of renal failure, myocardial infarction or heart
failure, and stroke or encephalopathy with the use of aprotinin
in heart surgery patients.344 The results of this study triggered 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 37
a FDA warning regarding the risks of aprotinin. This drug
should not be used in HT surgery.
Tranexamic Acid and Epsilon-aminocaproic Acid
Tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid are lysine
analogues with antifibrinolytic activity. Both agents
competitively inhibit the binding of plasmin to fibrinogen and
t-PA to plasmin via lysine recognition sites required for
fibrinolysis. Tranexamic acid is almost 10 times more potent
than epsilon-aminocaproic acid.345 In contrast to aprotinin,
neither agent is associated with an increased risk of end-organ
damage.344, 346, 347 Epsilon-aminocaproic acid has been
compared to aprotinin and found to have similar efficacy.340
Lysine analogues are indicated for the treatment of bleeding in
a number of conditions but are not approved by the FDA for
assist support devices
use in CPB despite evidence that their administration before
CPB is associated with a 30% reduction in bleeding and blood
transfusion requirement.348-351 Epsilon-aminocaproic acid is
given as a loading dose of 75 to 150 mg/kg at the beginning of
surgery followed by a continuous infusion at 10 to 15
mg/kg/hr. The dosage of tranexamic acid is 1/10 of epsilonaminoproic
acid.
Desmopressin
Desmopressin, a vasopressin analogue with minimal
vasopressor activity, stimulates the release of factors VIII:C
and von Willebrand from the endothelium. Desmopressin only
modestly reduces bleeding and its use is not routinely
recommended.339, 352, 353
assist support devices
Transfusion Strategies for Bleeding
Appropriate levels of coagulation factors are necessary
for adequate surgical hemostasis. FFP administration should
be guided by coagulation tests and measured deficiencies.340
No evidence exists for the prophylactic use of FFP to prevent
bleeding.341 Goals of FFP administration should be to achieve
1.5 times the control mean of both the prothrombin time and
the aPTT.342 Fibrinogen infusion is also important in massive
bleeding. Levels drop with massive bleeding and subsequent
red cell transfusions. Substitution should be done to maintain a
level higher than 1 g/L.342
Although platelet transfusions are common in cardiac
surgery, few randomized trials support their routine use.
Guidelines support the use of platelet transfusion when there is
clinical evidence of microvascular bleeding in conjunction
with excessive blood loss.343 A transfusion threshold of
50,000/uL is generally recommended.342 Prophylactic platelet
transfusions during cardiac surgery are not useful in
preventing bleeding and may be associated with an increase in
pulmonary vascular resistance.344
Recombinant FVIIa is not approved for bleeding during
cardiac surgery, although case reports and small series have
shown some efficacy in cases of excessive or refractory
bleeding345-347 occurring during implant or explant of VADs
and HT.348-350 Recombinant FVIIa combines with tissue factor
at the site of injury and activates the coagulation cascade.
However, because tissue factor is also expressed on
monocytes and atherosclerotic blood vessels, it may have
prothrombotic effects in cardiac surgery patients.351 Despite
the potential efficacy of rFVIIa seems to have, prospective
randomized trials with rFVIIa still do not confirm the efficacy
or safety of this costly agent in cardiac surgery.
Gaps in Evidence
Transfusion stragtegies are not well studied. Consensus
opinion drives the decision of when to transfuse blood
products. Expert opinions on which clinical situations require
transfusions are highly variable. Recombinant FVIIa has not
been tested in controlled clinical trials and therefore there is
little evidence to support its use in a bleeding cardiac surgery
patient. Tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid have not been
evaluated in a definitive randomized study. Very few studies
have been performed specifically in HT recipients. Thus, the
recommendations for HT are extrapolated from evidence
regarding achievement of hemostasis in general cardiac
surgery.

Conclusion
Compared to patients undergoing general cardiac surgery,
HT recipients have a greater incidence of coagulopathies due
to multiple factors that include greater severity of illness in
heart failure patients, more frequent use of anticoagulants, and
protracted extracorporeal circulation in patients undergoing
MCS explantation. There are several laboratory and point of
care tests to assess the severity of the coagulopathy present in
individual patients. The application of a combination of intraoperative
surgical techniques, pharmacologic therapies, as
well as transfusion strategies are needed to control the
bleeding commonly occurring during HT.
Topic 6: Documentation and
Communication with the Multidisciplinary
Team
Multidisciplinary Team
A HT center should identify a multidisciplinary team
(composed of individuals from surgery, medicine, nursing,
nutrition, social services, physical therapy, and pharmacology)
with each member having specific responsibilities. In addition
to cardiology and cardiac surgery, medical specialties that
should be represented in the cardiac transplant team include
infectious diseases, nephrology, pulmonary with respiratory
therapy support, pathology, immunology, anesthesiology,
physical therapy, and rehabilitation medicine. The Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the
United States, the British Transplant Society (BTS), and the
European Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT) have
recommendations for the multi-disciplinary approach to
HT.354, 355
As with the evaluation and discussion that accompanies
listing a patient for transplantation, a similar approach is
useful in dealing with the HT recipient. In addition to
physicians and transplant nurse coordinators, the team should
include the following:
a. Social work/social services personnel have a
multifunctional and undisputed role in transplant
centers.356 One important function is the pre-operative
screening for psycho-social conditions that might
adversely affect recipient outcome, such as depression,
and adherence to medical treatment regimens.357, 358
b. Psychiatry/psychology specialists diagnose psychiatric
illnesses, manage pharmacologic therapy, 359 and identify
personality traits that may allow the transplant team to
improve the patientâ€™s understanding and adherence to
their medical therapy.360, 361 Qualified social work
counselors often subsume the functions of these
specialists.
c. In the US, clinical pharmacists can play a pivotal role in
the management of HT recipients. In European countries,
this role is often fulfilled by transplant physicians. There
are numerous interactions among medications and
between medications and food and other nutritional
supplements requiring both monitoring and education of
patients and care givers on the complexities of
pharmacological therapyin HT recipients. These patients
often have other chronic diseases, and management of a
complex poly-pharmacy is crucial for long-term allograft
and patient survival. In the outpatient management of
kidney transplant recipients, the involvement of a
transplant pharmacist led to improved patient compliance
with medications at the end of 1 year (95.1% in those
patients who interacted with pharmacists vs. 81.6% with
those who did not).362, 363 In addition, the inclusion of
pharmacy input led to an increase in â€œtherapeuticâ€� drug
concentrations from 48% to 64%.363.
d. Dieticians play an important during both the pre- and
post-HT periods. Pre-operatively, HT recipients are often
malnourished and cachectic as a consequence of longstanding
heart failure. Better nutrition at this point
improves operative survival. Post-operatively, HT
assist support devices
recipients often need education on avoidance of weight
gain associated with the use of CSs and hyperglycemia
control. Weight loss while waiting for HT is often
necessary because obesity in the HT recipient is
associated with poorer short-term outcomes.
e. Physical and occupational therapy are equally important
in the pre-and post- HT periods. Cardiac rehabilitation
should begin in the hospital and continue after discharge.
Supervised exercise may also facilitate adherence to a
long-term exercise program.
f. Infectious disease specialists with a focus on
immunocompromised patients are invaluable in the 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 39
management of HT recipients in terms of diagnois and
therapy of community acquired and opportunistic
infections and the development of protocols for infection
prophylaxis against invasive fungi and CMV.
g. In those countries without a socialized or national medical
system, financial counselors should be part of the
multidisciplinary team to help HT candidates or recipients
with insurance claims and health care coverage or private
fund raising.
Communication
Meetings should be scheduled at regular intervals to
facilitate discussion of HT candidates, recipients, and
programmatic concerns. Telecommunication or electronic
conferencing can be used to allow for collaborations between
geographically distant groups. These meetings should include
scheduled internal quality assessments by physicians, nurses,
and the other allied health professionals.364

Topic 7: Use of Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation for the Management of
Primary Graft Failure in Pediatric Heart
Transplant Recipients
Primary Heart Allograft Failure
The ISHLT defines PGF as severe dysfunction of the
cardiac allograft in the absence of any anatomic or
immunological cause.365 Huang defined it as â€œcirculatory
insufficiency within the first 24 hours after HT requiring MCS
or the use of 2 inotrope/vasopressor agents.â€�85 As such, PGF is
a diagnosis of exclusion, and reversible causes should be
exhaustively sought and corrected prior to making the
diagnosis of PGF. This condition accounts for the highest
proportion of deaths (20%) in the pediatric population within
the first 30 post-operative days.366 In a report from the
Pediatric Heart Transplant Study, early heart allograft failure
was the commonest cause of early death in infants.367 Finally,
mortality due to PGF is higher in recipients with than in those
without congenital heart disease (5% vs. 1%), and as high as
10% in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.368 Table
1 summarizes potential causes of PGF after pediatric HT.365
If the recipient cannot be weaned off CPB, MCS should
be instituted. Urgent re-transplantation may be considered but
it is associated with a high mortality.96, 366, 369
ECMO and Primary Graft Failure in Pediatric Heart
Transplantation
Since the first reported neonatal survivor in the 1970s, the
ECMO portion of the Extracorporeal Life Support
Organization (ELSO) Registry contains a total of 386 ECMO
therapies for pediatric HT with survival ranging from 31% in
newborns to 57% in older children.370, 371 Registry indications
for ECMO after HT include pulmonary disease and acute
rejection. Requirements for ECMO support in pediatric HT
recipients range between 10% and 60% and subsequent
survival after PGF varies between 20% and 75%. Some
favorable outcomes have been achieved with ECMO as a
bridge to recovery and this type of support is available at
many pediatric HT centers. Using the definition noted above,
Huang reported PGF in 33% of pediatric HT recipients, 44%
of whom required MCS.85 There was an 18% early mortality
rate in the PGF group. Of 4 children with acute HT failure that
were supported with ECMO, 2 survived, 1 after retransplantation.369
Kirschbom reported ECMO support in 9 of
12 children, only 2 of whom (22%) survived.372 Chou reported
a 9% ECMO use rates for PGF, including 4 children, 3 of
whom survived.373 Fenton reported 15 children (9% of their
transplant series) who required ECMO within 6 weeks of HT 
ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1
 40
and 58% of these survived.374 Finally, the Denver group
reported that 8 of 14 infants (57%) undergoing HT for
hypoplastic left heart syndrome required ECMO after HT and
were discharged alive.375 Survivors were likely to be weaned
within 84 hours of ECMO support.
Indications for ECMO Support after Pediatric Heart
Transplantation
Failure of Separation from Cardiopulmonary Bypass
If the recipient cannot be weaned from CPB, the standard
measures should be instituted after assessment of residual
anatomic lesions, ventilatory and pharmacologic support,
hematologic and biochemical profile, and fluid status. Once
these measures have been optimized and hyperacute rejection
has been excluded, then a diagnosis of primary PGF can be
made and ECMO support can be considered.
Inadequate Post-operative Cardiac Function
Existing or progressively poorer post-operative allograft
function, evidence of a low cardiac output, and poor systemic
oxygen delivery unresponsive to escalating medical therapy
may also warrant consideration of ECMO support in the ICU.
Again, all appropriate measures should be undertaken to
optimize support and exclude a correctable cause for the poor
allograft function as outlined above.376-379
Cardiac Arrest
Emergency cannulation for ECMO during cardiac arrest
is increasingly common. Many units now have the capability
of rapidly putting children on ECMO during a cardiac arrest
and survival can be achieved.380, 381

Class IIa:
1. The use of ECMO should be considered when there is
failure to separate from CPB after all correctable causes
of such failure have been excluded.

heart allograft dysfunction occurs post-operatively.

Conduct of Cardiac Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation
There are varying practices for the implementation and
management of pediatric ECMO support in the post-operative
period to achieve the goal of adequate perfusion and oxygen
delivery.382, 383 Peripheral cannulation may diminish blood loss
and yet provide adequate drainage and flows in children
weighing < 15 kg. Cannulae placed directly into the aorta and
the atria may be associated with improved flows but may be
less stable. Direct cannulation may be used in the case of
hemodynamic instability or technical difficulties. Approaches
including cannulation, technique, equipment, flows,
monitoring, and anticoagulation are center specific.
Left Heart Distension on Cardiac Extracorporeal
Membrane Oxygenation
A left-sided vent is not required if cardiac ejection is
sufficient to prevent LV over-distension. Distension of the LV
will result in increased wall tension, decreased LV perfusion,
and ischemia, which may impair the ability to improve heart
allograft function. In addition, LV distension may have
detrimental effects on pulmonary function. If pulmonary
assist support devices
edema develops or LA/LV distension is detected by
echocardiography, a vent should be inserted through the
pulmonary vein or directly into the left atrium.382
Alternatively, if the chest wound has been closed, an atrial

septostomy is performed.384, 385 If it is anticipated that a patient
will require ECMO after HT, the atrial septum may be
fenestrated at the time of implantation.
Recommendations for the Conduct of
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support in
Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients:382, 384
Class IIa:
1. The amount of circulatory support provided by ECMO
should be sufficient to achieve adequate systemic
perfusion and oxygen delivery while waiting for the
myocardium to recover.
Level of Evidence: C.
2. Left heart distension during ECMO support should be
aggressively treated as it will compromise pulmonary
function and impede LV recovery.
Level of Evidence: C.
Duration of Support after Heart Transplantation
The purpose of ECMO is to maintain the systemic
circulation and end-organ function while investigating the
cause of heart allograft failure, and waiting for myocardial
recovery. The literature suggests that cardiac recovery can be
expected within 3 to 7 days after HT and this time interval is
sufficient to assess severity and reversibility of end-organ
damage and to consider other options, including weaning of
support due to allograft recovery, implantation of a VAD as a
bridge to re-transplantation, or treatment withdrawal.85, 96, 369,
372, 375, 386-388
Timing of Discontinuation of Extracorporeal
Membrane Oxygenation Support in the Setting of
Primary Graft Failure
Weaning ECMO should be considered when there is
evidence of improved cardiac function on echocardiography
and evidence of ejection in the arterial tree. Case reports
support recovery if there are signs of improvement within 3 to
7 days, but primarily within the first 3 days of support.85, 369,
370, 373, 376, 379, 387
Recommendations for the Timing of Discontinuation
of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support in
the Setting of Primary Graft Failure386:
Class IIa:
1. Clinical and echocardiographic variables should be
serially assessed to determine if myocardial recovery is
occurring.
Level of Evidence: C.
2. Objective signs of recovery should lead to weaning and
discontinuation of ECMO support.
Level of Evidence: C.
Class IIb:
1. Lack of objective evidence of myocardial recovery within
3 to 5 days should prompt consideration of either
institution of long term MCS as a bridge to recovery or
HT or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.
Level of Evidence: C.
Gaps in Evidence:
1. The optimal modality for surveillance of adverse
neurological events during ECMO support for PGF is
unknown.
2. Optimal infection prophylaxis in the immunosuppressed
patient receiving ECMO support for PGF is unknown.
3. Optimal renal-sparing immunosuppression protocol(s) in
patient receiving ECMO support for PGF is unknown.
4. The duration of time waiting for recovery of myocardial
function in the setting of PGF beyond which recovery is
unlikely is unknown.
5. The role of more intermediate and long-term MCS in
patients with myocardial recovery insufficient to allow
separation from ECMO within 5 to 7 days is unknown.
6. Risk factors for poor outcomes after re-transplantation in
ECMO-supported HT recipients are unknown.
