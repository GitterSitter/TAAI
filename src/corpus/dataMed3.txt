TI  - Incidence and Predictors of Cognitive Decline in Patients with Left Ventricular
      Assist Devices.
LID - CIRCOUTCOMES.115.001856 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement for advanced
      heart failure, increased cerebral perfusion should result in improved cognitive
      function. However, stroke (a well-known LVAD complication) and subclinical
      cerebral ischemia may result in transient or permanent cognitive decline. We
      sought to describe the incidence and predictors of cognitive decline after LVAD
      using a valid, sensitive assessment tool. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 4419
      patients in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
      Support who underwent LVAD implantation between May 2012 and December 2013,
      cognitive function was assessed in 1173 patients with the Trail Making B Test
      before LVAD and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The test detects several forms of
      cognitive impairment, including subclinical stroke. Cognitive decline was defined
      as a clinically important increase during follow-up using a moderate Cohen d
      effect size of 0.5xbaseline SD (32 s). The cumulative incidence of cognitive
      decline in the year after LVAD implantation, treating death and transplantation
      as competing risks, was 29.2%. In adjusted analysis, older age (>/=70 versus <50 
      years; hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.46-3.44; Ptrend<0.001) and
      destination therapy (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.92) were
      significantly associated with greater risk of cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cognitive decline occurs commonly in patients in the year after LVAD and is
      associated with older age and destination therapy. These results could have
      important implications for patient selection and improved communication of risks 
      before LVAD implantation. Additional studies are needed to explore the
      association between cognitive decline and subsequent stroke, health status, and
      mortality in patients after LVAD.
