AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells
      (hiPSCs) have the capacity to differentiate into any specialized cell type,
      including cardiomyocytes. Therefore, hESC-derived and hiPSC-derived
      cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs and hiPSC-CMs, respectively) offer great potential for
      cardiac regenerative medicine. Unlike some organs, the heart has a limited
      ability to regenerate, and dysfunction resulting from significant cardiomyocyte
      loss under pathophysiological conditions, such as myocardial infarction (MI), can
      lead to heart failure. Unfortunately, for patients with end-stage heart failure, 
      heart transplantation remains the main alternative, and it is insufficient,
      mainly because of the limited availability of donor organs. Although left
      ventricular assist devices are progressively entering clinical practice as a
      bridge to transplantation and even as an optional therapy, cell replacement
      therapy presents a plausible alternative to donor organ transplantation. During
      the past decade, multiple candidate cells were proposed for cardiac regeneration,
      and their mechanisms of action in the myocardium have been explored. The purpose 
      of this article is to critically review the comprehensive research involving the 
      use of hESCs and hiPSCs in MI models and to discuss current controversies,
      unresolved issues, challenges, and future directions.

AB  - The use of mechanical circulatory support devices to keep patients alive until
      transplantation has become essential in the face of an increasing organ shortage.
      We report successful heart transplantations after 841 days of left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) support in a child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and
      after 547 days of biventricular assist device (BVAD) support in another child
      with cardiomyopathy. To our knowledge, this report is the first on the
      longest-term (841 days) LVAD and the longest-term (547 days) BVAD support in
      children who were mobile and awake during the support, as a most effective bridge
      to heart transplantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Temporary right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) may be required to
      support patients with perioperative refractory right ventricular failure (RVF).
      We report on our experience using a different technique of RVAD implantation that
      does not necessitate resternotomy at the time of RVAD removal. METHODS: Patients 
      with perioperative RVF who underwent temporary RVAD implantation between January 
      2010 and February 2014 were reviewed. A dacron graft was attached to the
      pulmonary artery and passed through a subxiphoid exit, where the RVAD outflow
      cannula was inserted. The inflow cannula was percutaneously cannulated in the
      femoral vein, and the sternum was primarily closed. On the day of RVAD
      explantation, the outflow graft of the RVAD was pulled and ligated, and the
      insertion site was secondarily closed. The RVAD inflow cannula was removed, and
      direct pressure was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (age 58 +/- 14 years)
      were supported. Seventeen patients (81%) had RVF after left ventricular assist
      device implantation, and 4 patients developed postcardiotomy RVF. The median
      duration of RVAD support was 9 days (range: 2-88 days). Eleven patients (52%)
      were successfully weaned from the RVAD. Two patients were bridged to
      transplantation. Eight patients died on left ventricular assist device and/or
      RVAD support. The survival rates to discharge or heart transplantation, and to
      1-year, were 62% and 52%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No technical issues were
      encountered in this large series of RVAD implantations using the described
      technique for various forms of postoperative RVF. Extended support duration and
      reduction of resternotomy risks may be the main advantages of this technique
      compared with conventional RVAD implantation methods.

TI  - Non-transplant surgical therapy options of heart failure.
PG  - 481-96
AB  - Congestive heart failure (CHF) results from damage to the myocardium and has a
      broad etiology ranging from ischemic to non-ischemic etiology. It is one of the
      leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and carries a 5-year
      mortality of 50%, estimated by WHO to represent 30% of deaths in the United
      States. Costs related to the care of patients with CHF have increased
      substantially over the past 2 decades partly owing to increased frequency of
      hospitalization, implantation of costly novel devices and, as the disease
      progresses, consideration for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory
      support, and end-of-life care. CHF progression is accompanied by changes within
      the myocardium, collectively referred to as left ventricular remodeling, which
      can be categorized into changes in the cardiomyocytes and changes that occur in
      the volume and composition of the extracellular matrix. Since remodeling in heart
      failure is progressive and detrimental, the majority of treatment strategies are 
      aimed at stopping or possibly reversing this process. Some successful methods
      include medical management, long-term or destination mechanical circulatory
      support, cardiac resychronization therapy, and biventricular pacemakers. During
      the last few decades, the management of heart failure has evolved tremendously
      with the introduction of new therapies and assist devices. Advances in mechanical
      support, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and total artificial heart have
      significantly reduced mortality in patients awaiting transplantation. This
      manuscript is an overview of non-transplant surgical options in the management of
      CHF.

AB  - The management of end stage heart failure patients is only possible by heart
      transplantation or by the implantation of artificial hearts as a bridge for later
      transplantation. However, these therapeutic strategies are limited by a lack of
      donor hearts and by the associated complications, such as coagulation and
      infection, due to the used artificial mechanical circulatory assist devices.
      Therefore, new strategies for myocardial regenerative approaches are under
      extensive research to produce contractile myocardial tissue in the future to
      replace non-contractile myocardial ischemic and scarred tissue. Different
      approaches, such as cell transplantation, have been studied intensively. Although
      successful approaches have been observed, there are still limitations to the
      application. It is envisaged that myocardial tissue engineering can be used to
      help replace infarcted non-contractile tissue. The developed tissue should later 
      mimic the aligned fibrillar structure of the extracellular matrix and provide
      important guidance cues for the survival, function and the needed orientation of 
      cardiomyocytes. Nanostructured surfaces have been tested to provide a guided
      direction that cells can follow. In the present study, the cellular
      adhesion/alignment of human cardiomyocytes and the biocompatibility have been
      investigated after cultivation on different laser-patterned nanowires compared
      with unmodified nanowires. As a result, the nanostructured surfaces possessed
      good biocompatibility before and after laser modification. The laser-induced
      scalability of the pattern enabled the growth and orientation of the adhered
      myocardial tissue. Such approaches may be used to modify the surface of potential
      scaffolds to develop myocardial contractile tissue in the future.

AB  - We investigated the utility of comprehensive scoring systems for organ failure
      compared with the duration of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in predicting
      survival after heart transplantation. From November 2004 to August 2013, 25 adult
      patients ultimately underwent heart transplantation while on ECLS. We did not
      include patients who were younger than 18 years old or patients with
      extracorporeal ventricular assist devices. Seven patients (28%) died within 1
      year after transplantation. The areas under the curve (receiver operating
      characteristics (ROC), optimal cut-off value) of the sequential organ-failure
      assessment and the model for end-stage liver disease score modified by the United
      Network for Organ Sharing scores were 0.794 (13) and 0.825 (24), respectively. In
      multivariate analysis, the model for end-stage liver disease score modified by
      the United Network for Organ Sharing score was independently prognostic
      regardless of the duration of ECLS and sequential organ-failure assessment score.

AB  - Despite the significant contribution of the Fontan procedure to the therapy of
      complex congenital heart diseases, many patients progress to failure of their
      Fontan circulation. The use of ventricular assist devices to provide circulatory 
      support to these patients remains challenging. In the current study, a continuous
      axial-flow pump was used to support a univentricular Fontan circulation. A
      modified Fontan circulation (atrio-pulmonary connection) was constructed in six
      Yorkshire piglets (8-14 kg). A Dacron conduit (12 mm) with two branches was
      constructed to serve as a complete atrio-pulmonary connection without the use of 
      cardiopulmonary bypass. The Impella pump was inserted into the conduit through an
      additional Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft in five animals. Hemodynamic data
      were collected for 6 hours under the supported Fontan circulation. The control
      animal died after initiating the Fontan circulation independent of resuscitation.
      Four pump supported animals remained hemodynamically stable for 6 hours with pump
      speeds between 18,000 rpm and 22,000 rpm (P1-P3). Oxygen saturation was
      maintained between 95% and 100%. Normal organ perfusion was illustrated by blood 
      gas analysis and biochemical assays. A continuous axial-flow pump can be used for
      temporal circulatory support to the failing Fontan circulation as "bridge" to
      heart transplantation or recovery.

PG  - 593-609
LID - 10.2217/fca.14.47 [doi]
AB  - The medical/surgical management of advanced heart failure has evolved rapidly
      over the last few decades. With better understanding of heart failure
      pathophysiology, new pharmacological agents have been introduced that have
      resulted in improvements in survival. For those patients that fail to improve,
      mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices and total
      artificial hearts (TAHs) have served as a beneficial bridge to transplantation.
      The TAH has continued to play a significant role as a bridge to transplantation
      in patients with biventricular failure and more selected indications that could
      not be completely helped with left ventricular assist devices. Improved survival 
      with the TAH has resulted in more patients benefiting from this technology.
      Improvements will eventually lead to a totally implantable device that will
      permanently replace the failing human heart.

AB  - Cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction, postcardiotomy syndrome
      following cardiac surgery, or manifestation of heart failure remains a clinical
      challenge with high mortality rates, despite ongoing advances in surgical
      techniques, widespread use of primary percutaneous interventions, and medical
      treatment. Clinicians have, therefore, turned to mechanical means of circulatory 
      support. At present, a broad range of devices are available, which may be
      extracorporeal, implantable, or percutaneous; temporary or long term. Although
      counter pulsation provided by intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and comprehensive 
      mechanical support for both the systemic and the pulmonary circulation through
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain a major tool of acute care in
      patients with cardiogenic shock, both before and after surgical or percutaneous
      intervention, the development of devices such as the Impella or the Tandemheart
      allows less invasive forms of temporary support. On the other hand, concerning
      mid-, or long-term support, left ventricular assist devices have evolved from a
      last resort life-saving therapy to a well-established viable alternative for
      thousands of heart failure patients caused by the shortage of donor organs
      available for transplantation. The optimal selection of the assist device is
      based on the initial consideration according to hemodynamic situation,
      comorbidities, intended time of use and therapeutic options. The present article 
      offers an update on currently available mechanical circulatory support systems
      (MCSS) for short and long-term use as well as an insight into future
      perspectives.

TI  - Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during implantation of left
      ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are non-specific: 13-year-experience at a
      German Heart Center.
PG  - 5549-56
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have become an established
      therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. The two main reasons for this 
      development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing
      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTX). Furthermore, the
      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience
      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term
      patient outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) implantation at our Erlangen Heart Center during January 2000-July 
      2013. The main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the
      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. From all patients, we created a
      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and
      described the overall outcome. RESULTS: VAD implantation was performed in 266
      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2% of the total of 12254 cardiac
      surgical operations in that period). From these patients, 223 underwent LVAD or
      biventricular (BVAD) implantation; the remaining received a right (RVAD)
      implantation. The most frequent underlying clinical diagnoses were dilated (n =
      84, 37.7%, DCM) or ischemic (n = 61, 27.4%, ICM) cardiomyopathy. The pathological
      findings in the apex biopsy were generally non-specific and showed variable
      interstitial myocardial fibrosis with evidence of fibre loss, fatty degeneration 
      and variable irregular atrophy of muscle fibres, consistent with dilated and
      ischemic cardiomyopathies as the most frequent causes of heart failure in these
      patients. Only a few cases showed other specific features such as myocarditis and
      AL-amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during
      LVAD implantation are rather non-specific and they generally reflect the late
      stage or consequences of chronic myocardial damage in cases of dilated or
      ischemic cardiomyopathies. Variable patchy chronic inflammatory changes may be
      observed in cardiomyopathies as a non-specific reaction caused by myocardial
      fiber damage and should not lead to misinterpretation as evidence of myocarditis 
      or revision of original diagnosis.

TI  - The effect of the sequential therapy in end-stage heart failure (ESHF)--from
      ECMO, through the use of implantable pump for a pneumatic heart assist system,
      Religa Heart EXT, as a bridge for orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). Case study.
PG  - 537-40
LID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments for
      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right time
      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for
      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and
      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient
      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood
      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),
      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa
      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant
      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function 
      of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,
      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.
      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the
      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular
      afterload. The experimental implantation of an innovative Religa Heart EXT
      prosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. Too short time
      of Religa Heart EXT implantation in the discussed patient prevented the
      possibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications and
      infections compared to the documented complications of POLVAD implanted until
      now. OHT is a safe and efficacious method of treatment of patients previously
      supported by ECMO and Religa Heart EXT.

TI  - Thrombosis in continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices: pathophysiology,
      prevention, and pharmacologic management.
PG  - 79-98
LID - 10.1002/phar.1501 [doi]
AB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices reduce short-term mortality and
      improve quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Unfortunately, 
      device-related complications remain common, with many patients experiencing
      adverse events within the first year. New literature suggests that rates of
      device-related thrombosis may be increasing since 2011, which is particularly
      troublesome given that this pathology can result in a disabling stroke, organ
      damage, and death. In 2013, a group of practitioners in the field of mechanical
      circulatory support published a treatment algorithm based on their expert
      opinion. However, a comprehensive review of the pharmacotherapy of this condition
      is lacking. A search of the literature revealed 20 separate publications of case 
      reports or case series describing outcomes associated with the use of drug
      therapy for suspected pump thrombosis. Each of these experiences was limited by
      small sample size, nonrandomized treatment allocation, and nonstandardized
      medication dosing. Data describing the outcomes of surgical versus medical
      management of device thrombosis are also sparse, with only three published
      reports identified. Based on the review of this limited literature, surgical
      management appears to be the preferred treatment modality, especially in those
      with organ hypoperfusion or hemodynamic instability. In patients ineligible for
      surgery, pharmacotherapy options remain limited. Use of all drug classes
      described in the literature for the HeartMate II device-fibrinolytics,
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors-was hindered by 
      either marginal efficacy or bleeding. Based on historical experience with
      unfractionated heparin in patients under HeartMate II support, we recommend this 
      agent as a possible option for those with suspected pump thrombosis in lieu of
      surgical device exchange. For the HeartWare HVAD, limited data suggest that
      direct intraventricular administration of alteplase may be an acceptable
      treatment alternative. Additional research is clearly needed to further delineate
      the role of pharmacotherapy and to identify the optimal agent for managing this
      potentially life-threatening condition.

      objective was to characterize the scope and quality of available LVAD educational
      materials. METHODS AND RESULTS: In July 2013, we performed a cross-sectional
      search of Internet, print, and multimedia resources available to patients
      considering LVAD. Written materials <10 sentences, videos <2 minutes, and
      materials clearly directed to healthcare professionals were excluded.
      Seventy-seven materials met inclusion criteria. Potential benefits of LVAD
      therapy were discussed in all (n=77), whereas less often mentioned were risks
      (n=43), lifestyle considerations (n=29), surgical details (n=26), caregiver
      information (n=9), and hospice or palliative care (n=2). Of the 14 materials that
      recognized a decision or alternate treatment option, 7 used outdated statistics, 
      12 scored above an eighth grade reading comprehension level, and 12 met <50% of
      International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. In the survey participants
      rated all but one as biased toward accepting LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      many resources exist for patients considering an LVAD, the content is suboptimal.
      Benefits of LVADs are often presented in the absence of risks, alternative
      options, and caregiver considerations. Most materials use outdated statistics,
      are above the reading level of average Americans, and are biased toward accepting
      LVAD therapy. There is no tool that would qualify as a formal decision aid.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the development of continuous-flow ventricular assist devices
      (CF-VAD) has improved the reliability of these devices, VAD exchange is still
      occasionally necessary. The focus of this study was to analyze our institution's 
      entire experience with primary CF-VAD implants, evaluate the baseline variables, 
      determine which factors predict the need for exchange, and evaluate the impact of
      exchange on survival and event-free survival. METHODS: We retrospectively
      reviewed the data of all patients in a single center who received a primary
      CF-VAD implant between December 1999 and December 2013. All CF-VAD exchanges were
      reviewed; demographics, indications, preoperative and operative data, and
      clinical outcomes were summarized. Univariate and multivariable regression
      analyses were performed to ascertain predictors for exchange. Time-to-event and
      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: We identified 469 patients who
      underwent 546 CF-VAD implantations. Of these patients, 66 (14%) underwent 77
      exchanges from one CF-VAD to another. The primary indications included hemolysis 
      or thrombosis (n = 49; 63.6%), infection (n = 9; 11.7%), or other causes (n = 19;
      24.7%). Survival was not significantly different between the exchange and
      nonexchange groups. Multivariable regression analysis identified a history of
      cerebrovascular events as a significant predictor for exchange. Among exchange
      patients, 11 underwent heart transplantation, 3 had their CF-VADs explanted, 26
      had ongoing support, and 26 died during device support. CONCLUSIONS: In our
      series of contemporary CF-VAD exchanges, a history of previous cerebrovascular
      events was a significant predictor for exchange. Exchange did not affect early or
      late survival. Our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment of
      pump-related complications with exchange is safe and justified.

TI  - Myocardial atrophy and chronic mechanical unloading of the failing human heart:
      implications for cardiac assist device-induced myocardial recovery.
PG  - 1602-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2014.05.073 [doi]
LID - S0735-1097(14)05775-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In animal models of heterotopic transplantation, mechanical unloading
      of the normal, nonhypertrophic heart results in atrophy. Primarily on the basis
      of these animal data, the notion that chronic left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD)-induced unloading will result in atrophy has dominated the clinical heart 
      failure field, and anti-atrophic drugs have been used to enhance the cardiac
      recovery potential observed in some LVAD patients. However, whether
      unloading-induced atrophy in experimental normal heart models applies to failing 
      and hypertrophic myocardium in heart failure patients unloaded by continuous-flow
      LVADs has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: The study examined whether mechanical
      unloading by continuous-flow LVAD leads to myocardial atrophy. METHODS: We
      prospectively examined myocardial tissue and hemodynamic and echocardiographic
      data from 44 LVAD patients and 18 untransplanted normal donors. RESULTS:
      Cardiomyocyte size (cross-sectional area) decreased after LVAD unloading from
      1,238 +/- 81 mum(2) to 1,011 +/- 68 mum(2) (p = 0.001), but not beyond that of
      normal donor hearts (682 +/- 56 mum(2)). Electron microscopy ultrastructural
      evaluation, cardiomyocyte glycogen content, and echocardiographic assessment of
      myocardial mass and left ventricular function also did not suggest myocardial
      atrophy. Consistent with these findings, t-tubule morphology, cytoplasmic
      penetration, and distance from the ryanodine receptor were not indicative of
      ongoing atrophic remodeling during LVAD unloading. Molecular analysis revealed no
      up-regulation of proatrophic genes and proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome
      system. CONCLUSIONS: Structural, ultrastructural, microstructural, metabolic,
      molecular, and clinical functional data indicated that prolonged continuous-flow 
      LVAD unloading does not induce hypertrophy regression to the point of atrophy and
      degeneration. These findings may be useful in designing future investigations
      that combine LVAD unloading and pharmaceutical therapies as a bridge to recovery 
      of the failing heart.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support improves diabetic control in patients with
      advanced heart failure.
PG  - 1120-4
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.166 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly being used as
      life-saving therapy for end-stage advanced heart failure. Diabetes is prevalent
      in advanced heart failure patients. In this study, we sought to investigate the
      effects of mechanical circulatory support on diabetic parameters with LVAD
      implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, data on 244 LVAD 
      recipients between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Patients without history of
      diabetes, death within the first 3 months after LVAD implantation, heart
      transplantation after LVAD, or LVAD explantation were excluded from the study.
      Baseline demographic, laboratory, and echocardiographic information prior to LVAD
      placement and 6-month follow-up were obtained. Laboratory values indicative of
      diabetic control were found to improve significantly at 6 months post-LVAD
      implantation (glycated haemoglobin, 7.2 vs. 6.1%, P < 0.0001; serum fasting
      glucose, 141 vs. 122 mg/dL, P = 0.003; mean daily insulin dose, 30 vs. 24 IU/day,
      P = 0.02). Additionally, the use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was
      successfully discontinued in six patients at 6 months post-LVAD implantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term LVAD therapy is associated with improvement in diabetic
      control which is probabvly due to improvements in cardiac output and
      normalization of biochemical derangements resulting from diabetes.

TI  - Clinical outcomes after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 1003-13
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conveying the complex trade-offs of continuous-flow left ventricular 
      assist devices is challenging and made more difficult by absence of an evidence
      summary for the full range of possible outcomes. We aimed to summarize the
      current evidence on outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007 
      to December 2013, supplemented with manual review. Three reviewers independently 
      assessed each study for saliency on patient-centered outcomes. Data were
      summarized in tabular form. Overall study characteristics encouraged inclusion of
      all indications (destination therapy and bridge to transplant) and prevented
      meta-analysis. The electronic search identified 465 abstracts, of which 50 met
      inclusion criteria; manual review added 2 articles in press. The articles
      included 10 industry-funded trials and registries, 10 multicenter reports, and
      the remainder single-center observational experiences. Estimated actuarial
      survival after continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ranged from 56% to
      87% at 1 year, 43% to 84% at 2 years, and 47% at 4 years. Improvements in
      functional class and quality of life were reported, but missing data complicated 
      interpretation. Adverse events were experienced by the majority of patients, but 
      estimates for bleeding, stroke, infection, right heart failure, arrhythmias, and 
      rehospitalizations varied greatly. CONCLUSIONS: The totality of data for
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices show consistent improvements in
      survival and quality of life counterbalanced by a range of common complications. 
      Although this summary should provide a practical resource for healthcare
      provider-led discussions with patients, it highlights the critical need for
      high-quality patient-centered data collected with standard definitions.

AB  - Heart transplantation remains the gold standard treatment for patients with
      terminal end-stage heart failure. Although results reported have been excellent, 
      older recipients and donors associated with significant comorbidities are now the
      rule rather than the exception. Moreover, heart failure has become a significant 
      public health problem with a growing population of patients in countries unable
      to answer the demand for transplantation. An emerging answer to this dilemma
      comes from results reported with the use of continuous flow pumps where patient
      survival approaches 80% one and 2 years after implantation in selected patients. 
      Is it time to triage patients to continuous flow pumps? Should we recommend
      continuous flow pump implantations in patients with various comorbidities, and
      offer transplantation to a selected group of patients who will reach the
      long-term benefit of the procedure?

TI  - Hypertension: an unstudied potential risk factor for adverse outcomes during
      continuous flow ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 317-22
LID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]
AB  - In end-stage heart failure, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) represent an 
      exciting new frontier in which post-device implantation survival approaches that 
      of heart transplant. However, expansion of this technology is still limited by
      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential to
      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor 
      may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditional
      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may 
      also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.
      Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to 
      outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base to
      support these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not
      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potential
      predictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely a
      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive
      techniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,
      recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements and
      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting of
      CF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) consider
      potential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTN
      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new
      reliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research and
      management possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the 
      CF-LVAD patient population move forward.

TI  - Non-transplant surgical therapy options of heart failure.
AB  - Congestive heart failure (CHF) results from damage to the myocardium and has a
      broad etiology ranging from ischemic to non--ischemic etiology. It is one of the 
      leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and carries a 5--year
      mortality of 50%, estimated by WHO to represent 30% of deaths in the United
      States. Costs related to the care of patients with CHF have increased
      substantially over the past 2 decades partly owing to increased frequency of
      hospitalization, implantation of costly novel devices and, as the disease
      progresses, consideration for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory
      support, and end--of--life care. CHF progression is accompanied by changes within
      the myocardium, collectively referred to as left ventricular remodeling, which
      can be categorized into changes in the cardiomyocytes and changes that occur in
      the volume and composition of the extracellular matrix. Since remodeling in heart
      failure is progressive and detrimental, the majority of treatment strategies are 
      aimed at stopping or possibly reversing this process. Some successful methods
      include medical management, long--term or destination mechanical circulatory
      support, cardiac resychronization therapy, and biventricular pacemakers. During
      the last few decades, the management of heart failure has evolved tremendously
      with the introduction of new therapies and assist devices. Advances in mechanical
      support, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and total artificial heart have
      significantly reduced mortality in patients awaiting transplantation. This
      manuscript is an overview of non--transplant surgical options in the management
      of CHF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of alternatives to intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation
      in the treatment of anticipated and established acute circulatory failure is
      growing. Despite the clinical importance and significant cost of short-term
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, the state of their present use has 
      not been analyzed on a national scale. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was 
      to characterize the demographics, treatment practices, survival rates, and cost
      of short-term MCS. METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed all
      adult patients receiving short-term MCS in the United States from 2004 to 2011 by
      using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
      Project. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, use of percutaneous devices for short-term
      MCS increased by 1,511% compared with a 101% increase in nonpercutaneous devices.
      Mortality rates declined over this period (p for trend = 0.027) from 41.1% in
      2004 to 2007 to 33.4% in 2008 to 2011. A similar trend was observed for the
      subset of patients with cardiogenic shock, decreasing from 51.6% to 43.1% (p for 
      trend = 0.012). Hospital costs also declined over this period (p for trend =
      0.011). Multivariable analysis revealed balloon pumps (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 2.52), coagulopathy (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.88 to 
      2.94), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR: 3.50; 95% CI: 2.20 to 5.57) before 
      short-term MCS were among the most significant predictors of mortality.
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-term MCS in the United States has increased rapidly,
      whereas rates of in-hospital mortality have decreased. These changes have taken
      place in the context of declining hospital costs associated with short-term MCS.
