Medical Technology in the U.S.
 Largest producer and consumer of medical technology
worldwide: 40% of the global market
 American healthcare is expensive: 17% of the GDP
 $100 billion market in 2010; $38 billion in exports
 Electromedical (pacemakers, MRI, ultrasound)
 Radiation (CT, diagnostic imaging)
 Surgical supplies (orthopedic joints, stents)
 Investment in medical device R&D doubled in the 1990s
 Focus on: Medical Technology therapies in Heart Failure
 Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs)
Definition and Epidemiology of Heart Failure
 Systemic perfusion inadequate to meet the body’s metabolic demands due to impaired cardiac function
 Most common cause is left ventricular (LV) dysfunction
 Coronary artery disease / Ischemic cardiomyopathy
 Dilated cardiomyopathy
 Valvular heart disease
 Hypertensive heart disease
 5.8 million Americans in 2006 (2% of the U.S. population)
 550,000 new cases diagnosed annually
 23 million individuals worldwide (est.)
 Over time
 decreased quality of life and more frequent admissions
 One million hospital admissions and $28 billion annually
 Cardiac transplant: well-accepted treatment for end-stage heart failure
 Severe organ shortage

Heart Failure Signs and Symptoms
 As the stage of heart failure progresses (I
IV), mortality
increases
 Treatment options for end-stage heart failure are limited
 The significant morbidity and mortality of heart failure led to exploration of mechanical cardiac support devices for end-stage heart failure

Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs)
 A mechanical circulatory device used to partially or completely
replace cardiac function
 Mechanical support and ventricular unloading enables:
 Hemodynamic stabilization
 Organ recovery (reverse remodeling, normalization of chamber geometry)
 Improved contractile performance
 May replace the right, left, or both ventricles
 Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) most common
 Most commonly used in end-stage heart failure
 More than 4000 HeartMate II implanted since 2008
 1700 devices per year in the U.S.
 430 per year in Europe
Heart Mate II
LVAD Function
• Inflow cannula
connected to LV apex
• Outflow cannula
connected to aorta
• Intracorporeal pump
with continuous axial
flow rests below
diaphragm
• Device mechanically
pumps blood
• Up to 15,000
rotations/min = 8-
10L/min blood flow
Surgical Implantation
Patient Selection
 Bridge to cardiac transplant
 Most frequent indication worldwide
 Bridge to recovery
 Mechanical support during reverse remodeling
 Acute MI, graft failure, postpartum cardiomyopathy
 Destination therapy
 Not a transplant candidate (age, comorbidities, noncompliance)
 USA, Canada, Germany, Austria
 Bridge to decision (short-term LVAD)
 Emergency cardiogenic shock (Acute MI, fulminant myocarditis)
 Immediate stabilization for days-weeks during further evaluation
 Candidates must:
 Be on maximal inotropic support +/- intraortic balloon pump (IABP)
AND
 Systolic BP < 80 AND Cardiac index < 2.0 OR PCWP > 20
 No irreversible secondary end-organ damage
Complications
 Infection: 28% at 3 mo
 Especially of driveline and pocket; Fatal sepsis in 25%
 Bleeding: 42% at 6 mo
 Perioperative
 Postoperative anticoagulation: target INR 2.5-3.5
 Stroke and peripheral thromboembolism
 Incidence lower with newer devices
 RV failure
 RV function must be optimized prior to implantation
 May require postoperative vasopressors
 Arrhythmia
 Monomorphic VT
 Hemolysis
 Acquired von Willebrand syndrome
 Device failure: 0 at 1 yr; 35% at 2 yr
 Complications limit the ability of the technology to provide indefinite support
REMATCH Trial: NEJM 2001
 129 patients assigned to LVAD vs optimal medical therapy
 Survival 52 vs 25% at 1 yr; 23 vs 8% at 2 yr = 48% reduction in mortality
 Significantly improved quality of life at one year
HeartMate II: Bridge to Therapy
 One study of 133 patients receiving HeartMate II
demonstrated:
 Primary outcome of cardiac recovery, cardiac transplant, or
survival occurred in 75%
 68% survival at one year
 Significant improvements in NYHA functional class, 6 minute
walk, and quality of life at 3 mo
LVAD: Long-Term Outcomes
 Medicare database analysis of 1476 LVAD recipients
 55% were discharged alive
 Of these,
 56% readmitted within 6 months
 21% underwent heart transplant at one year
 Overall one-year survival 52%
 Mean Medicare payment $ 178,714 for one year
 INTERMACS study showed survival 56% at one year
The Growing LVAD Market
 In the US, 50-60,000 patients annually could benefit from
heart transplant
 1,897 transplants performed in 2003
 LVADs designed to fill the gap
 Market analysis estimates 54,000 annual LVAD candidates
in the developed world
 US: 20,000 destination therapy, 1500 bridge to transplant
 Similar rates estimated in Europe
 Rates expected to increase as more patients are placed on
transplant list and eligibility criteria increase in flexibility

LVAD in Japan
 113 patients underwent cardiac transplant 1999-2011
 Longest waiting period of all available countries, > 2. 5 years
 Law change regarding brain death in 2010; 30 transplants in 2010
 90% of transplant candidates require LVAD
 Mean wait time 877 days
 Internationally, 27% require LVAD with 50 day wait time
 Japan Social Reimbursement System approved Nipro LVAD
(1st gen)
 In 2011, approved Evaheart and Duraheart (2nd gen.)
 More common LVADs anticipated approval soon
Financial Considerations
 Extensive debate regarding high LVAD costs versus
potential benefits in US healthcare politics
 Cost estimates vary
 Initial hospitalization costs $200,000
 Fully functional HeartMate XVE costs $100,000
 Outpatient costs after discharge $13,200
 Quality-adjusted life year (QALY)
 Initial estimates $800,000 per QALY
 More recent analyses estimate $100,000-150,000 per QALY
 Assumption that costs will fall over time as technology
becomes more widespread
