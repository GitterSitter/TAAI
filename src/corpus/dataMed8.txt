CHAPTER 1 4
HEART FAILURE
ROBERT SOUFER, M.D.
The heartâ€™s primary function is to pump blood to all
parts of the body, bringing nutrients and oxygen to heart 
the tissues and removing waste products. When the
body is at rest, it needs a certain amount of blood to
achieve this function. During exercise or times when
greater demands are placed on the body, more blood
is required. To meet these variable demands, the
heartbeat increases or decreases, and blood vessels
dilate to deliver more blood or constrict during times
when less blood is required.
When a person is diagnosed with heart failure, it
assist support devices 
does not mean the heart has stopped working, but
assist support devices 
rather that it is not working as efficiently as it should.
In other words, the term â€œfailureâ€� indicates the heart
is not pumping effectively enough to meet the bodyâ€™s
needs for oxygen-rich blood, either during exercise
or at rest. The term congestive heart failure (CHF) is
often synonymous with heart failure but also refers
to the state in which decreased heart function is accompanied
by a buildup of body fluid in the lungs
and elsewhere. Heart failure may be reversible, and
people may live for many years after the diagnosis is
made. (See box, â€œClassifications of Heart Failure.â€�)
Heart failure may occur suddenly, or it may develop
gradually. When heart function deteriorates
over years, one or more conditions may exist, (See
box, â€œEffects of Heart Failure.â€�) The strength of muscle
contractions may be reduced, and the ability of
the heart chambers to fill with blood may be limited
by mechanical problems, resulting in less blood to
pump out to tissues in the body. Conversely, the
pumping chambers may enlarge and fill with too
much blood when the heart muscle is not strong
enough to pump out all the blood it receives. In addition,
as the architecture of the heart changes as it
enlarges, regurgitation of the mitral valve may develop,
making the heart failure even worse.
WHO DEVELOPS HEART FAILURE?
There are an estimated 2 million people in the United
States with heart failure. The incidence of chronic
congestive heart failureâ€”the number of new cases
developing in the given population each yearâ€”has
increased in recent years. This is possibly a result of
the overall decline in deaths from coronary (ischemic)
heart disease, an improvement attributed to medical
advances and the fact that people are living longer.
The most common cause of congestive failure is
coronary artery diseaseâ€”narrowing of the arteries
supplying blood to the heart muscle. Although coronary
disease often starts at an early age, congestive
failure occurs most often in the elderly. Among people
more than 70 years old, about 8 out of 1,000 are
diagnosed with congestive heart failure each year.
The majority of these patients are women, probably
because men are more likely to die from coronary
artery disease before it progresses to heart failure.
Heart failure is also associated with untreated
hypertension, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse (primarily
cocaine and amphetamines) at any age. Hyperthyroidism
and various abnormalities of the heart
valves (particularly aortic and mitral) are among the

Classifications of Heart
Failure
The New York Heart Association developed a
â—�
â—�
â—�
â—�
system that has been used for manyâ€� years to
provide a standardized set of criteria for the
classification of heart failure based on the
severity of the condition. This is evaluated by
symptoms and ability to function.
Class I: no undue symptoms associated with
ordinary activity and no limitation of physical
activity
Class II: slight limitation of physical activity;
patient comfortable at rest
Class III: marked limitation of physical activity;
patient comfortable at rest
Class IV: inability to carry on any physical
activity without discomfort; symptoms of
cardiac insufficiency or chest pain possible
even at rest
Effects of Heart Failure
â—� Strength of muscle contractions is reduced.
â—� Ability of the heart chambers to fill with blood
is limited, so there is less blood to pump out to
tissues in the body.
â—� The pumping heart chambers fill with too much
blood; the heart muscle is not strong enough to
pump out all the blood it receives.
other disorders that can cause heart failure. In addition,
viral infection or inflammation of the heart
(myocarditis) or primary heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy),
and in rare instances, extreme vitamin
deficiencies, can result in heart failure. (See Chapters
13 and 15.)
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Depending on the underlying causes, heart failure
can be either acute (intense but not long-lasting) or
chronic (protracted over a long time), When heart
failure occurs, the forward flow of blood is slowed
down, the quantity of blood pumped is less than adequate,
and the pressure rises in the chambers of the
heart, causing blood that is returning to the heart to
back up in the lungs or veins. Excessive fatigue may
bean early symptom. (See box, â€œSymptoms of Heart
Failure.â€�) Some excess fluid may be forced out of the
blood vessels into the bodyâ€™s tissues. It then settles
in the feet, ankles, and legs, and sometimes also in
the abdomen and liver.
Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, resulting from
increased pressure, fluid, or both in the lungs, is a
common symptom of congestive heart failure. Although
breathlessness is most likely to be noticed
during exercise (known as dyspnea on exertion, or
DOE), it can also be a problem at rest, particularly
when the patient is lying down (when it is known as
orthopnea). Individuals with orthopnea find that the
condition feels worse when they are in a reclining
position because the backflow of fluid and buildup in
pressure from the heart interferes directly with the
free flow of oxygen in the lungs.
Normally, oxygen is easily exchanged through the
thin spongy tissue of the lungs. (See Figure 14.1.) If
this tissue becomes waterlogged, as it does in heart
failure, less oxygen can be transferred to the blood.
If there is not enough oxygen, certain reflexes stimulate
faster breathing. People with lung congestion
as a result of heart failure usually have to prop themselves
up with extra pillows in order to sleep. The
number of pillows used may indicate to a physician
the extent of the heart failure. When an individual
wakes at night because of shortness of breath from

cases fluid accumulation in the abdomen

fluid settling in the lungs, the condition is known as
paroxysmal (intermittent) nocturnal dyspnea. A person
suffering from this typically will wake up short
of breath about two to three hours after going to
sleep, Standing or sitting often relieves symptoms.
One of recent history's most noted patients with
heart failure was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
He had severe hypertension that led to an enlarged
heart and eventually to heart failure. For
months, he was unable to lie flat in bed, so he slept
in a chair. He was told that he had bronchitis, allergies,
and the flu. Finally, the right diagnosis was made
and treatment started. However, this was before the
development of effective drugs to lower blood pressure
and to treat advanced heart failure. At the time
of President Rooseveltâ€™s death of a massive stroke on
April 12, 1945, his blood pressure ranged between
180/110 and 230/130.
The infiltration of the body with fluid can cause
more than breathing problems and sleepless nights.
Patients may weigh more, because of the excess
water retention, and they may have edema (swelling)
of the skin and soft tissues, usually in the feet, ankles,
or legs, and sometimes in the lower back. This swelling
is characterized by a gradual filling out after the
area is depressed with a finger. (See Figure 14.2.) In
extreme cases, fluid will accumulate in the abdomen.
This is called ascites and is caused when swelling of
the gastrointestinal tract forces fluid through the capillaries
into the abdominal cavity. Ascites usually occurs
only in severe chronic heart failure.
When a marked excess of fluid accumulates in the
lungs, it is known as pulmonary (lung) edema. This
condition is often, but not always, acute and is frequently
associated with coughing up blood-tinged,
pinkish-colored sputum.
Inefficient circulation may also manifest itself as
fatigue, weakness, and an inability to exert oneself
physically or mentally because less blood and oxygen
reach the brain. Older people in particular may suffer
from confusion and impaired thinking ability.
LEFT SIDE OR RIGHT SIDE?
The particular symptoms that an individual experiences
are determined by which side of the heart is
involved in the heart failure. (See box, â€œSymptoms of
Left-Side and Right-Side Heart Failure.â€�) For example,
the left atrium (upper chamber) receives oxygenFigure
14.2
Edema is swelling of the extremities caused by excess fluid buildup.
A sign of edema in the ankles is an indentation that remains
momentarily when a finger is pressed into the skin and then
removed.

ated blood from the lungs and passes it onto the left
ventricle (lower chamber), which pumps it to the rest
of the body. When the left side isnâ€™t pumping efficiently,
blood backs up in the vessels of the lungs,
and sometimes fluid is forced out of the lung vessels
and into the breathing spaces themselves. This pulmonary
congestion causes shortness of breath. The
other major symptoms of left-sided heart failure are
fatigue, dyspnea (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea), and the sputum production (sometimes
bloody) that comes from pulmonary congestion.
Right-sided failure occurs when there is resistance
to the flow of blood from the right heart structures
(right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary or lung artery)
into the lungs or when the tricuspid valve, which
separates the right atrium from the right ventricle,
fails to work properly. This results in a backup of fluid
and pressure in the veins that empty into the right
side of the heart. Pressure then builds up in the liver
and the veins in the legs. The liver enlarges and may
become painful; swelling of the ankles or legs occurs.
The major symptoms of right-sided heart failure
are edema and nocturia (excessive urination at night
caused by fluid redistribution while a person is lying
down). The different types of edema possible are dependent
(edema that travels by gravity to the lowest
portions of the body), edema that results in enlargement
or swelling of the liver (called hepatomegaly),
ascites, and edema of the skin or soft tissues (only in
some cases).
Because congestive heart failure causes the body
to fill with excess fluids, the kidneys may not be able
to dispose of the extra sodium (a component of salt)
and water, a condition known as kidney failure.
(Again, the term â€œfailureâ€� implies that the kidneys
have failed and will not recover. However, as in the
case of heart failure, the kidney changes maybe temporary,
and proper treatment may correct much of
the problem.) Sodium that would normally be eliminated
through the urine remains in the body, causing
it to retain even more water, thereby aggravating the
problem of excess fluid associated with congestive
heart failure.
DIAGNOSIS
A stethoscope can be used to detect rales, crackling
noises that are caused by the movement of excess
fluid in the lungs. This can help locate where fluid
has accumulated. By listening to breathing sounds or
thumping the chest, a physician can usually tell when
fluid from the lungs has leaked (pleural effusion) into
the chest cavity. The fluid will also appear as a cloudy
area on X-rays. The stethoscope can also detect the
sounds of the heart chambers filling and emptying
and the heart valves opening and closing throughout
the cardiac cycle. Abnormal variations in these
sounds can aid the physician in diagnosing and monitoring
heart failure, because the condition is associated
with one or two abnormal sounds in addition
to the two sounds usually heard with the healthy
heart. Another symptom, blueness of the skin (called
cyanosis) accompanied by coolness and moisture,
most often in the fingers and toes, indicates low levels
of oxygen in the blood (called hypoxia). Edema is
detected by pressing the finger against the ankle or
skin and noting how long it takes the depression to
refill. Liver enlargement is felt by examining the abdomen.
The neck vein may also be distended. (See
box, â€œSigns of Heart Failure During an Examination.â€�)
A number of sophisticated diagnostic techniques
may also be employed to diagnose and monitor heart
failure and heart function. The two main noninvasive

techniques for this purpose are the echocardiogram
and the radionuclide angiocardiogram. (See Chapter
10.) Both tests can quantify the level of heart dysfunction
and distinguish between generalized as opposed
to regional dysfunction.
In cardiac catheterization, a thin tube is introduced
through a vein or artery into the heart. The procedure
determines whether there are blockages in the blood
vessels and measures pressures in various chambers
of the heart. (See Chapter 10.)
The electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a graphic
record of the heartâ€™s electrical impulses; it can detect
increased wall thickness (called hypertrophy), heart
enlargement, or various rhythm changes in heart failure.
The ECG may also be used to monitor the effects
of drug treatments on the heart. Chest X-rays can
also detect an enlarged heart.
CAUSES
An array of different problems can cause congestive
heart failure. (See box, â€œCauses of Congestive Heart
Failure.â€�) Among them is coronary (ischemic) heart
disease resulting from insufficient blood flow to the
HEART FAILURE
myocardium, or heart muscle. This is usually caused
by atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty substances or
plaque on the walls of the arteries that carry blood
to the heart muscle. The heartâ€™s ability to perform
decreases because ischemia results in the delivery of
less oxygen and fewer nutrients to the heart muscle.
A heart attack may also cause congestive failure.
During a heart attack, the heart muscle is deprived
of oxygen, resulting in tissue death and scarring. The
development of heart failure depends on the extent
and location of scarring. (See Chapter 15.)
Long-standing high blood pressure is another
common cause of heart failure. Because there is
greater resistance against which the heart must
pump, the heart muscle works harder. This results in
an enlargement of the heart muscle, especially of the
left ventricle, the heartâ€™s main pumping chamber.
Eventually, this enlarged muscle tissue weakens, setting
the stage for heart failure, especially if the pumping
ability of the enlarged chamber greatly decreases.
Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) can lead to
heart failure, but they usually have to be severe and
prolonged, with a rapid rate of more than 140 beats
per minute, and must often occur in the presence of
an already weakened heart. They change the pattern
of filling and pumping of blood from the heart. This
condition may also lower output of blood to the point
of heart failure. (See Chapter 16.)
Diseased heart valves are another cause of heart
failure, which results when a narrowed or leaking
valve fails to direct blood flow properly through the
heart. The problem may be congenital (inborn) or due
to an infection such as endocarditis or rheumatic fever.
This increases the heartâ€™s workload, thereby inCauses

creasing risk of developing heart failure. (See

Cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle itself,
can also lead to heart failure. Causes of cardiomyopathy
include infection, alcohol abuse, and
cocaine abuse. When heart failure seems to have no
known causes, it is known as idiopathic heart failure.
(See Chapter 15.)
HOW THE BODY TRIES
TO PROTECT ITSELF
When one system of the body is not functioning optimally,
other systems may attempt to take over to
make up for the problem. In the case of heart failure,
several types of compensation are possible.
First, the heart chambers may enlarge, and the
heart may beat more forcefully to pump out more
blood for the bodyâ€™s needs. In time, the overworked
heart muscle enlarges (much as skeletal muscles grow
larger during weight muscle training), creating increased
muscle fibers with which the heart can pump
more forcefully.
Second, the heart may be stimulated to pump more
often, thereby increasing its output.
Third, a compensation mechanism called the
renin-angiotensin system maybe initiated. When the
lack of blood volume coming from the heart (cardiac
output) results in a decrease in the amount passing
through the kidneys, the kidneys respond by stimulating
the system to secrete hormones that prompt
the kidneys to retain salt and water, and thereby increase
blood volume. This is an attempt to compensate
for the decrease in output of the heart. This leads
to a rise in blood pressure as the body attempts to
circulate the extra fluid volume and also ensures that
adequate oxygen reaches the brain, kidneys, and
other vital organs.
These compensation mechanisms keep the failing
heart functioning almost normally in the early stages
of heart failure. As the disease progresses, however,
compensation mechanisms cannot maintain proper
circulation. It may take years for a heart to go through
the stages of enlarging, working harder, and finally
breaking down. In many cases, as when a person has
hypertension, heart failure is preventable if blood
pressure is treated adequately.
TREATMENT
Whenever possible, the best treatment of congestive
heart failure is one of prevention. This includes diagnosing
and treating high blood pressure and attempting
to prevent atherosclerosis. Other important
preventive steps include not smoking, using alcohol
in moderation if at all, and abstaining from cocaine
and other illicit drugs. A prudent diet, regular exercise,
and weight control are also important.
When a patient is diagnosed as having heart failure,
the first treatment is often restriction of dietary
sodium. Drugs may be prescribed as well. Diuretics,
available since the 1950s, are often used to help the
kidneys get rid of excess water and sodium, thereby
reducing blood volume and the heartâ€™s workload.
(See Chapter 23.)
Digitalis, a drug that has been used since the 18th
century, is still a component of modern therapy. It is
prescribed to strengthen the heartâ€™s pumping action.
Patients taking both diuretics and digitalis may need
to supplement their levels of potassium.
Newer drugs for the treatment of heart failure include
vasodilators, which cause the peripheral arteries
to dilate, or open up. This reduces the work of the
heart by making it easier for blood to flow. Among
the newest vasodilators used for heart failure are the
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
which may be used, along with diuretics, in patients
with mild-to-moderate or severe congestive failure.
ACE inhibitors, which include captopril (Capoten)
and enalapril (Vasotec), block the production of a substance
called angiotensin II, a potent constrictor of
blood vessels. If blood vessels are dilated, the amount
of work needed for the heart to pump blood forward
is decreased.
Other drugs used in the treatment of heart failure
include calcium-channel blockers, which dilate blood
vessels; beta blockers, which slow the heart (used
only in unusual circumstances); and medications that
affect various heartbeat irregularities. Most cases,
however, respond to diuretics and digitalis, especially
when ACE inhibitors are added.
Sometimes, surgery proves effective. When heart
failure is due to valvular disease, surgical implantation
of an artificial heart valve or valve repair may
alleviate the problem. Surgery may also be helpful in
correcting congenital heart defects that can lead to
heart failure. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery
and catheterization using a balloon to flatten fatty
HEART FAILURE
deposits (called angioplasty) are among the therapeutic
techniques used to prevent and treat heart failure
caused by occluded, or blocked, arteries.
Heart transplant are a last resort in treating severe
heart failure caused by diseased heart muscle.
Although the success rate of heart transplants has
significantly improved, the cost of the operation and
the shortage of donor organs makes it impractical
except as a last resort.
PROGNOSIS
The outlook for most people with heart failure is dependent
upon the cause of the heart failure and the
overall degree of cardiac dysfunction. An estimated
50 percent survive more than five years after diagnosis.
That figure, however, is an average of all patients
with varying levels of severity of the disease.
The prognosis for a specific person with heart failure
depends to a large degree on effects of the disease,
such as the level of blood output of the left ventricle,
or his or her ability to exercise, as well as other factors,
including age, overall health, and other medical
conditions. The sooner heart failure is diagnosed and
action is taken to control the problem, the better.
In many cases, heart failure can be effectively
treated to prevent or slow the progression of the disease
and to alleviate its symptoms. Therapy can
achieve several goals: It can improve the performance
of the left ventricle, prevent further deterioration of
heart function, improve a patientâ€™s ability to exercise,
and improve quality of life.
In addition, it is possible that in selected instances,
early, effective treatment may increase a personâ€™s
likelihood of improved survival.
