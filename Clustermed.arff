The CUPID 2 (Calcium Up-Regulation by Percutaneous      Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease Phase 2b) trial is designed to       evaluate whether increasing SERCA2a activity via gene therapy improves clinical      outcome in these patients. BACKGROUND: Intracoronary delivery of recombinant      adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1)/SERCA2a improves intracellular Ca(2+)      handling by increasing SERCA2a protein levels and, as a consequence, restores      systolic and diastolic function. In a previous phase 2a trial, this therapy      improved symptoms, functional status, biomarkers, and left ventricular function,       and reduced cardiovascular events in advanced heart failure patients. METHODS:      CUPID 2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational,      multicenter, randomized event-driven study in up to 250 patients with      moderate-to-severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New York      Heart Association functional class II to IV symptoms despite optimal therapy.      Enrolled patients will be at high risk for recurrent heart-failure      hospitalizations by virtue of having elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic      peptide/BNP (>1,200 pg/ml, or >1,600 pg/ml if atrial fibrillation is present)      and/or recent heart failure hospitalization. The primary endpoint of      time-to-recurrent event (heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence      of terminal events [all-cause death, heart transplant, left ventricular assist      device implantation or ambulatory worsening heart failure]) will be assessed      using the joint frailty model. This ongoing trial is expected to complete      recruitment in 2014, with the required number of 186 recurrent events estimated      to occur by mid 2015. RESULTS: Available data indicate that calcium up-regulation      by AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy is safe and of potential benefit in advanced heart      failure patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CUPID 2 trial is designed to study the effects      of this therapy on clinical outcome in these patients.

The United      Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the       predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton,      CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed to      compare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program.      METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Base      were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomes      were time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences of      HT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistate      economic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was from      the NHS, discount rates were 3.5\\\%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years      (QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB pound) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs       HM II. RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulative      incidence of HT was low for both groups (11\\\% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued      4.99 lifetime QALYs costing pound258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84       QALYs costing pound231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for       HW vs HM II were pound23,530 ($37,349) and pound20,799 ($33,014), respectively.      CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a better      clinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was more      cost-effective.

Despite significant advancements in drug therapy,      mortality of the disease remains excessively high, as heart transplant remains      the gold standard treatment for end-stage HF when no contraindications subsist.      Traditionally, implanted Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) have been employed in       order to provide circulatory support to patients who cannot survive the waiting      time to transplantation, reducing the workload imposed on the heart. In many      cases that process could recover its contractility performance. OBJECTIVES: The      SensorART platform focuses on the management and remote treatment of patients      suffering from HF. It provides an interoperable, extendable and VAD-independent      solution, which incorporates various hardware and software components in a      holistic approach, in order to improve the quality of the patients\\ treatment and      the workflow of the specialists. This paper focuses on the description and      analysis of Specialist\\s Decision Support System (SDSS), an innovative component       of the SensorART platform. METHODS: The SDSS is a Web-based tool that assists      specialists on designing the therapy plan for their patients before and after VAD      implantation, analyzing patients\\ data, extracting new knowledge, and making      informative decisions. RESULTS: SDSS offers support to medical and VAD experts      through the different phases of VAD therapy, incorporating several tools covering      all related fields; Statistics, Association Rules, Monitoring, Treatment,      Weaning, Speed and Suction Detection.

We isolated      mitochondria from fresh LV wall tissue of patients with heart failure and reduced      systolic function undergoing heart transplant or left ventricular assist device      placement, and compared their function to mitochondria isolated from the      non-failing LV (NFLV) wall tissue with normal systolic function from patients      with pulmonary hypertension undergoing heart-lung transplant. We performed      detailed mitochondrial functional analyses using 4 substrates: glutamate-malate      (GM), pyruvate-malate (PM) palmitoyl carnitine-malate (PC) and succinate. NFLV      mitochondria showed preserved respiratory control ratios and electron chain      integrity with only few differences for the 4 substrates. In contrast, HF      mitochondria had greater respiration with GM, PM and PC substrates and higher      electron chain capacity for PM than for PC. Surprisingly, HF mitochondria had      greater respiratory control ratios and lower ADP-independent state 4 rates than      NFLV mitochondria for GM, PM and PC substrates demonstrating that HF mitochondria      are capable of coupled respiration ex vivo. Gene expression studies revealed      decreased expression of key genes in pathways for oxidation of both fatty acids      and glucose. Our results suggest that mitochondria from the failing LV myocardium      are capable of tightly coupled respiration when isolated and supplied with ample       substrates. Thus energy starvation in the failing heart may be the result of      dysregulation of metabolic pathways, impaired substrate supply or reduced      mitochondrial number but not the result of reduced mitochondrial electron      transport capacity.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Muscle injury and subsequent activation of myogenic progenitor cells is      associated with oxidative stress. Cytoglobin is a hemoprotein expressed in      response to oxidative stress in a variety of tissues, including striated muscle.       In this study, we demonstrate that cytoglobin is up-regulated in activated      myogenic progenitor cells, where it localizes to the nucleus and contributes to      cell viability. siRNA-mediated depletion of cytoglobin from C2C12 myoblasts      increased levels of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death both at      baseline and in response to stress stimuli. Conversely, overexpression of      cytoglobin reduced reactive oxygen species levels, caspase activity, and cell      death. Mice in which cytoglobin was knocked out specifically in skeletal muscle      were generated to examine the role of cytoglobin in vivo. Myogenic progenitor      cells isolated from these mice were severely deficient in their ability to form      myotubes as compared with myogenic progenitor cells from wild-type littermates.      Consistent with this finding, the capacity for muscle regeneration was severely      impaired in mice deficient for skeletal-muscle cytoglobin.

However, the supply of      donor hearts is diminishing and demand greatly exceeds supply. Ventricular assist      devices (VADs) are surgically implanted pumps used as an alternative to      transplant (ATT) or as a bridge to transplant (BTT) while a patient awaits a      donor heart. Surgery and VADs are costly. For the NHS to allocate and deliver      such services in a cost-effective way the relative costs and benefits of these      alternative treatments need to be estimated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate for      patients aged >/= 16 years with advanced HF eligible for HT: (1) the clinical      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation VADs used as      BTT compared with medical management (MM); and (2) the clinical effectiveness and      cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation VADs used as an ATT in      comparison with their use as BTT therapy. DATA SOURCES: Searches for clinical      effectiveness studies covered years from 2003 to March 2012 and included the      following data bases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations,       EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of       Reviews of Effects (DARE), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), HTA      databases [NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD)], Science Citation      Index and Conference Proceedings (Web of Science), UK Clinical Research Network      (UKCRN) Portfolio Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health      Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and National Library of Medicine (NLM) Gateway,      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Current Controlled      Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked,      and VAD manufacturers\\ websites interrogated. For economic analyses we made use      of individual patient data (IPD) held in the UK Blood and Transplant Database      (BTDB). REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of evidence on clinical effectiveness       and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation US Food and Drug      Administration (FDA) and/or Conformite Europeenne (CE) approved VADs.      Publications from the last 5 years with control groups, or case series with 50 or      more patients were included. Outcomes included survival, functional capacity      (e.g. change in New York Heart Association functional classification), quality of      life (QoL) and adverse events. Data from the BTDB were obtained. A discrete-time,      semi-Markov, multistate model was built. Deterministic and probabilistic methods       with multiple sensitivity analyses varying survival, utilities and cost inputs to      the model were used. Model outputs were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios      (ICERs), cost/quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and cost/life-year      gained (LYG). The discount rate was 3.5\\\% and the time horizon varied over 3      years, 10 years and lifetime. RESULTS: Forty publications reported clinical      effectiveness of VADs and one study reported cost-effectiveness. We found no      high-quality comparative empirical studies of VADs as BTT compared with MM or as       ATT compared with BTT. Approximately 15-25\\\% of the patients receiving a device      had died by 12 months. Studies reported the following wide ranges for adverse      events: 4-27\\\% bleeding requiring transfusion; 1.5-40\\\% stroke; 3.3-48\\\% infection;       1-14\\\% device failure; 3-30\\\% HF; 11-32\\\% reoperation; and 3-53\\\% renal failure. QoL       and functional status were reported as improved in studies of two devices      [HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) and HeartWare (HW;      HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA)]. At 3 years, 10 years and lifetime, the      ICERs for VADs as BTT compared with MM were pound122,730, pound68,088 and      pound55,173 respectively. These values were stable to changes in survival of the       MM group. Both QoL and costs were reduced by VADs as ATT compared with VADs as      BTT giving ICERs in south-west quadrant of the cost effectiveness plain (cost      saving/QALY sacrificed) of pound353,467, pound31,685 and pound20,637 over the 3      years, 10 years and lifetime horizons respectively. Probabilistic analyses      yielded similar results for both research questions. LIMITATIONS: Conclusions      about the clinical effectiveness were limited by the lack of randomised      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of different VADs for BTT or      comparing BTT with any alternative treatment and by the overlapping populations      in published studies. Although IPD from the BTDB was used to estimate the      cost-effectiveness of VADs compared with MM for BTT, the lack of randomisation of      populations limited the interpretation of this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 years,      10 years and lifetime the ICERs for VADs as BTT compared with MM are higher than       generally applied willingness-to-pay thresholds in the UK, but at a lifetime time      horizon they approximate threshold values used in end of life assessments. VADs      as ATT have a reduced cost but cause reduced QALYs relative to BTT. Future      research should direct attention towards two areas. First, how any future      evaluations of second- or third-generation VADs might be conducted. For ethical      reasons a RCT offering equal probability of HT for each group would not be      feasible; future studies should fully assess costs, long-term patient survival,      QoL, functional ability and adverse events, so that these may be incorporated      into economic evaluation agreement on outcomes measures across future studies.      Second, continuation of accurate data collection in the UK database to encompass       QoL data and comparative assessment of performance with other international      centres.

The lack of alternative treatment options has prompted the development of      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, first as bridge to heart transplant      and subsequently as destination therapy as a valid alternative to transplant.      Last generation MCS devices are mechanically reliable and their management has      become increasingly less complex. Nowadays, medium-term survival does not      significantly differ between MCS and heart transplant recipients. MCS management       programs require a multidisciplinary team to optimize the pathway leading to      rehabilitation and improved quality of life and decrease the frequent occurrence       of complications. However, in the near future with the growing number of      implants, the chances for clinical cardiologists to come across a MCS recipient      will increase. The management of general or acute problems will no longer be      limited to tertiary implanting centers. A key issue to improve patient outcomes      is the provision of a smooth and careful transition from the hospital environment      to home care. The aim of this review is to start this process by providing basic       notions and general indications through several scenarios of MCS recipients      presenting to the emergency room for acute clinical problems.FAU -

patients with advanced heart failure refractory to optimal medical treatment have      a high mortality and a poor quality of life with frequent hospital admissions.      the lack of alternative treatment options has prompted the development of      mechanical circulatory support (mcs) devices, first as bridge to heart transplant      and subsequently as destination therapy as a valid alternative to transplant.      last generation mcs devices are mechanically reliable and their management has      become increasingly less complex. nowadays, medium-term survival does not      significantly differ between mcs and heart transplant recipients. mcs management       programs require a multidisciplinary team to optimize the pathway leading to      rehabilitation and improved quality of life and decrease the frequent occurrence       of complications. however, in the near future with the growing number of      implants, the chances for clinical cardiologists to come across a mcs recipient      will increase. the management of general or acute problems will no longer be      limited to tertiary implanting centers. a key issue to improve patient outcomes      is the provision of a smooth and careful transition from the hospital environment      to home care. the aim of this review is to start this process by providing basic       notions and general indications through several scenarios of mcs recipients      presenting to the emergency room for acute clinical problems.fau -

This      may be a disadvantage to their priority for organ allocation. We sought to      determine the relationship between VAD implantation and successful      transplantation among patients listed for heart transplant. METHODS: Adults with       CHD patients (N = 1,250) were identified from the United Network for Organ      Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2010 and compared to patients without      congenital etiology for heart failure (N = 59,606). VAD use at listing, listing      status, status upgrades and reasons for upgrade prior to transplant were trended       at 5-year intervals and appropriate statistical comparisons were made between      groups. RESULTS: Since 1985, VAD use prior to transplant has increased      significantly in patients without CHD, but not in CHD patients (17\\\% vs 3\\\% in 2006      to 2010, p < 0.0001). CHD patients were more likely to be listed as Status 2,      compared to those without (66\\\% vs 40\\\%, p < 0.001 for 2006 to 2010), and less      likely to be upgraded to Status 1 after listing (43\\\% vs 55\\\%, p = 0.03). Among      those upgraded to Status 1, CHD patients were less likely to have a VAD at      transplant than those without (3\\\% vs 18\\\%, p = 0.005). VAD use was more likely to       result in death in CHD patients. CONCLUSIONS: VAD use is less common in CHD      patients than in patients without CHD, both at the time of listing and      transplantation. Reduced VAD use appears to contribute to lower listing status      and organ allocation. These differences have grown more disparate over time.

Recently, continuous flow VAD (CVAD) has emerged as an attractive      clinical option for long-term mechanical support of HF patients, with      bridge-to-transplant outcomes comparable with pulsatile flow VAD (PVAD).      Continuous flow VADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than the      first-generation PVAD. Despite the widespread clinical use, CVAD support has been      associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, and aortic valve       insufficiency. Speculation that diminished arterial pressure pulsatility      associated with continuous flow devices may be contributing to these      complications has sparked much debate over CVAD support. Studies comparing      pulsatile flow and continuous flow (CF) support have presented conflicting      findings, and the relevance to CVAD as DT is uncertain due to variations in      device operation, support duration, and the criteria used to quantify      pulsatility. Currently, there is interest in developing control algorithms for      CVAD to increase the delivered pulsatility as a strategy to mitigate adverse      event risks associated with CVAD therapy.

This      project aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a bridge-to-transplantation      (BTT)-VAD approach relative to direct heart transplantation in      transplant-eligible patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was used to      evaluate survival benefits and costs for BTT-VAD versus nonbridged heart      transplant recipients. Three different scenarios were considered according to      severity of patients\\ baseline hemodynamic status (high, medium, and low risk).      Results are presented in terms of survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratio.       Sensitivity analyses were used to analyze uncertainty in model estimates. Over a       20-year time horizon, BTT-VAD therapy increased survival at an increased cost      relative to nonbridged heart transplant recipients: $100 841more in costs and      1.19 increased life years (LYs) in high-risk patients ($84 964/LY), $112 779 more      in costs and 1.14 more LYs ($99 039/LY) in medium-risk patients, and an      additional cost of $144 334 and incremental clinical benefit of 1.21 more LYs      ($119 574/LY) in low-risk patients. The sensitivity analysis estimated a 59\\\%,      54\\\%, and 43\\\% chance of BTT-VAD therapy being cost-effective for high-, medium-,      and low-risk patients at a willingness-to-pay level of $100 000/LY. Subgroup      analyses indicated that risk of post-VAD and transplantation complications,      waiting time, renal dysfunction, and patient age substantially affected the      cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSIONS: BTT-VAD therapy is associated with      improved survival and increased costs.

Mechanical      circulatory support using VADs has been an essential therapeutic tool for      patients with severe heart failure waiting for a heart transplant in clinical      site. Adaptive control of VADs that automatically adjust the pump output with      changes in a patient state is one of the important approaches for enhanced      therapeutic efficacy, prevention of complications and quality of life      improvement. However adaptively controlling a VAD in the realistic situation      would be difficult because it is necessary to model the whole including the VAD      and the cardiovascular dynamics. To solve this problem, we propose an application      of attractor selection algorithm using stochastic behavior to a VAD control      system. In this study, we sought to investigate whether this proposed method can       be used to adaptively control of a VAD in the simple case of a continuous flow      VAD. The flow rate control algorithm was constructed on the basis of a      stochastically searching algorithm as one example of application. The validity of      the constructed control algorithm was examined in a mock circuit. As a result, in      response to a low-flow state with the different causes, the flow rate of the pump      reached a target value with self adaptive behavior without designing the detailed      control rule based on the experience or the model of the control target.FAU - Ohnuma, KentaroAU  - Ohnuma KFAU - Sumikura, HirohitoAU  - Sumikura HFAU - Homma, AkihikoAU  - Homma AFAU - Tsukiya, TomonoriAU  - Tsukiya TFAU - Mizuno, ToshihideAU  - Mizuno TFAU - Takewa, YoshiakiAU  - Takewa YFAU - Tatsumi, EisukeAU  - Tatsumi ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tPL  - United StatesTA  - Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol SocJT  - Conference proceedings : ...

This study investigates whether these therapeutic advances      have translated into improvement in outcomes for patients with advanced HF      referred to a heart transplant center. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HF      (n=2507) referred to a single university center were analyzed in three 6-year      eras during which medical and device therapies were evolving: 1993 to 1998 (era      1), 1999 to 2004 (era 2), and 2005 to 2010 (era 3). Impaired hemodynamics and      comorbidities were more frequent at time of referral in later eras, whereas other      HF severity parameters where similar or improved. Successive eras had greater      usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers,       beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, implantable cardioverter defibrillators,       and cardiac resynchronization therapy, consistent with evolving evidence and      guideline recommendations over the study period. All-cause mortality and sudden      death were significantly lower in era 2 and 3 compared with era 1. After      multivariable risk adjustment, era 3 had significantly decreased 2- and 3-year      all-cause mortality risk and significantly decreased 1- and 3-year sudden death      risk compared with era 1.

The continuing simplification of      design along with continued reduction in size of the devices, plus eventual      elimination of the external drive line will make the use of VADs a superior      option to heart transplant and even to medical management in many patients.

Studies have suggested that outcomes after VAD implantation may be      dependent on institutional procedural volume, and outcome data from      non-transplant centres are lacking. This study reviews the outcomes of patients      who received a long-term VAD at our centre to determine if these devices can be      safely implanted at tertiary care, low-volume, non-transplant centres. METHODS:      We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study, examining the clinical      outcomes of consecutive patients who received a long-term VAD over a 42-month      period. RESULTS: During the study period 73 patients required MCS, of whom 16      received a long-term VAD. This select group had a mean Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile of 1.6 (0.9) and      before implantation 94\\\% required at least 1 inotropic medication, 69\\\% had      suffered a cardiac arrest, 63\\\% required an intra-aortic balloon pump, 69\\\%      required mechanical ventilation, and 44\\\% required short-term MCS. The primary      outcome of survival to transplant or ongoing MCS at 1 year was achieved in 75\\\% of      patients. Operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital survival were 100\\\%,      88\\\%, and 81\\\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term VADs can be implanted at      low-volume, nontransplant centres with survival rates comparable with      contemporary clinical trials. Availability of a specialty trained      multidisciplinary team with expertise in short-term and long-term MCS options      facilitates appropriate patient selection and might be more important than      institutional volume in determining outcomes after implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

While in      hospital, patients with a VAD have traditionally been taught by an educator nurse      with VAD expertise in preparation for discharge. In 2004, our centre implemented       a successful competency-based patient education program in post-heart transplant       patients and thought that a similar program may provide increased confidence for       bedside nurses to actively participate in VAD patient education prior to      discharge. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to create a      competency-based education program that would provide consistency in patient      teaching. A questionnaire was developed and completed by 13 bedside nurses. This       pre-test questionnaire indicated the need for a systematic and organized approach      to VAD patient teaching. Furthermore, adequate resources, consistency in teaching      methods, and feedback were seen to be essential. A pilot competency-based program      was designed to lead bedside nurses and patients through a series of learning      phases and has successfully been implemented. Since its implementation, the      questionnaire has been repeated with results reflecting satisfaction with the      revised competency-based program.

The natural long-term trajectory of survival      free of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant in patients      with ambulatory class IV symptoms who underwent CRT has not been established. We       extracted clinical data on 723 consecutive patients with NYHA class III or      ambulatory class IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction </=35\\\%, and      a QRS duration >/=120 ms who underwent CRT from September 30, 2003, to August 6,       2007. Chart notes immediately before CRT were reviewed to confirm NYHA class      status before CRT. Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox proportional      hazards model were constructed to determine long-term survival free of heart      transplant and LVAD based on NYHA class status. Of the 723 patients, 52 had      ambulatory class IV symptoms. Over a mean follow-up of 5.0 +/- 2.5 years      controlling for many possible confounders, ambulatory NYHA class IV status was      independently associated with poor long-term outcomes. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and      5-year survival free of LVAD or heart transplant for class III versus ambulatory       class IV patients was 92.0\\\%, 84.0\\\%, 75.0\\\%, 68.1\\\%, and 63.2\\\% versus 75.0\\\%, 61.5\\\%,       52.0\\\%, 45\\\%, and 40.4\\\%, respectively. Although patients with ambulatory class IV      heart failure receiving CRT have inferior long-term outcomes compared with those       with class III symptoms, survival in class IV patients continues to parallel      class III patients over an extended follow-up. At 5 years, survival free of LVAD       or heart transplant in ambulatory class IV patients receiving CRT is 40\\\%.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, many Japanese candidates have not received its benefits      due to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. The heart transplant waiting period       in Japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the Organ      Transplantation Law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900      days because of the increase in candidates. According to the Japanese Transplant       Registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (BTT)      with a ventricular assist device (VAD), and the average duration of BTT is around      800 to 900 days. The excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in Japan even       with such a prolonged BTT duration with VADs is confirmation of the excellent      clinical results of VAD support. Until April 2011, only the paracorporeal Nipro      VAD for BTT was covered by Japanese national health insurance. Analysis of the      clinical outcome of 303 patients who received a Nipro VAD (for left ventricular      [LV] drainage) as BTT showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days      (average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68      patients (22\\\%) required ongoing VAD support. Thus the Nipro VAD is an excellent      paracorporeal device. The 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials       of four types of implantable rotary blood pump LVADs (Evaheart, DuraHeart, Jarvik      200, HeartMate II) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of BTT using      implantable LVADs. Only 36 patients in seven Japanese heart centers have received      implantable LVADs, and this small number corresponds to the initial learning      curve. Therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use of      commercially available implantable LVADs becomes more widespread. The long      waiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellent      clinical outcomes of VAD therapy in Japan.FAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SAD  - Department of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, The University of Tokyo      Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.LA  - jpnPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - JapanTA  - Nihon Geka Gakkai ZasshiJT  - Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshiJID - 0405405SB  - IMMH  - EuropeMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*utilizationMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2012/06/20 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/22 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/20 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 2012 May;113(3):292-6.- 22708386own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120619dcom- 20120821is  - 0301-4894 (print)is  - 0301-4894 (linking)vi  - 113ip  - 3dp  - 2012 mayti  - [end-stage heart failure].pg  - 292-6ab  - the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure patients is cardiac      transplantation. however, many japanese candidates have not received its benefits      due to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. the heart transplant waiting period       in japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the organ      transplantation law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900      days because of the increase in candidates. according to the japanese transplant       registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (btt)      with a ventricular assist device (vad), and the average duration of btt is around      800 to 900 days. the excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in japan even       with such a prolonged btt duration with vads is confirmation of the excellent      clinical results of vad support. until april 2011, only the paracorporeal nipro      vad for btt was covered by japanese national health insurance. analysis of the      clinical outcome of 303 patients who received a nipro vad (for left ventricular      [lv] drainage) as btt showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days      (average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68      patients (22\\\%) required ongoing vad support. thus the nipro vad is an excellent      paracorporeal device. the 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials       of four types of implantable rotary blood pump lvads (evaheart, duraheart, jarvik      200, heartmate ii) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of btt using      implantable lvads. only 36 patients in seven japanese heart centers have received      implantable lvads, and this small number corresponds to the initial learning      curve. therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use of      commercially available implantable lvads becomes more widespread. the long      waiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellent      clinical outcomes of vad therapy in japan.fau - kyo, shuneiau  - kyo sad  - department of therapeutic strategy for heart failure, the university of tokyo      hospital, tokyo, japan.la  - jpnpt  - english abstractpt  - journal articlepl  - japanta  - nihon geka gakkai zasshijt  - nihon geka gakkai zasshijid - 0405405sb  - immh  - europemh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart-assist devices/*utilizationmh  - humansmh  - japanmh  - united statesedat- 2012/06/20 06:00mhda- 2012/08/22 06:00crdt- 2012/06/20 06:00pst - ppublishso  - nihon geka gakkai zasshi. 2012 may;113(3):292-6.'

Once haemodynamic stability has been established       with a ventricular assist device (VAD), the decision to wait for myocardial      recovery as opposed to listing for an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can be      difficult. We have undertaken this study to establish the criteria for      determining the need for heart transplantation following VAD implant for      fulminant myocarditis. METHODS: A total of 442 VADs were implanted between 1993      and 2011. Twenty-four VADs were implanted for fulminant myocarditis with      refractory cardiogenic shock. We retrospectively analysed the variables and the      pathology for this cohort. Patients who had a full recovery of myocardial      function and subsequent VAD explant (Explant) were compared with those bridged to      OHT. There was one acute death. RESULTS: There was no difference in the past      medical history between the groups. Explant patients had a more acute onset of      heart failure with a median of 7 days between the onset of symptoms and VAD      implant, when compared with 22 days for OHT (P = 0.01). A rapid recovery in      myocardial function was seen in the Explant group, with recovery of myocardial      function (ejection fraction = 53 +/- 24\\\%) in 14 +/- 7 days. Myocardial function      was sustained for 5 years following the VAD explant. The female gender favoured      myocardial recovery and VAD explantability. Two patients had giant cell      myocarditis, neither of whom had a recovery of function, and they were bridged to      heart transplant with a VAD. CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant myocarditis is a fatal      condition without mechanical support.

This protocol permitted the rendering of safe and effective dental      care in this setting and did not result in near-term (1-30 days) excessive      hemorrhage, local and systemic infection, or contamination of the VAD. STUDY      DESIGN: This descriptive cross-sectional study by the University of California,      Los Angeles, Hospital Dental Service examined the dental care of 9 patients (mean      age, 50 +/- 12.9 years) with class IV stage D heart failure. RESULTS: Nine      patients, 22 days (mean) after VAD placement, received dental treatment after      intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and maintenance of prior anticoagulation,      antiplatelet, or antithrombin regimen. Eight patients had extractions (mean, 4;      range, 1-12), and one of them also required scaling and root planing (SRP) of the      remaining teeth. A ninth individual only required SRP of 4 quadrants. No adverse       outcomes developed.

Quality of life (QoL) has      not been systematically evaluated in children bridged to heart transplant.      METHODS: All children transplanted for cardiomyopathy during 2001 to 2008 and      currently being followed at our center (n = 84) had QoL assessed during 2006 to      2009, at a median of 3 years post-transplant, using a validated generic measure      (PedsQL4.0). RESULTS: Twenty-six children, aged 2.7 to 18 (median 7.4) years who       were bridged to transplant, were compared with 58 children, aged 2.0 to 18.0      (median 13.0) years, who were transplanted in the same era without bridging.      There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any domains of QoL       assessed by children or parents, although the small number of bridged patients      increases the likelihood of a Type II error. Bridged children who were younger (r      = 0.48, p = 0.02) or more recently transplanted (r = 0.42, p = 0.04) were scored       by their parents as having poorer emotional QoL. Regression analysis indicated      that age at transplant was the only medical or demographic variable associated      with parent-reported total QoL scores (beta = 0.27, p = 0.01). With few links      between QoL scores and medical or demographic factors, other subjective      psychologic factors may be of greater salience in determining QoL. CONCLUSIONS:      Despite greater severity of illness, children who required mechanical bridging to      transplantation report a QoL comparable to that of other children undergoing      heart transplantation. Younger children may require greater psychologic support      to reach their full potential in terms of QoL.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of       life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of our      pediatric patients while supported with a VAD. DESIGN: In this prospective study,      pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement, and their parents, were      administered a generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then      periodically until heart transplant or death. Their final scores while on support      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.      RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VAD      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was       10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.      Eleven (85\\\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\\\%) patient remaining      alive on support. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was       1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total      and physical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups.      Self-reported psychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy      controls only. Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all      three comparison groups for all three categories (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A large       deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patients supported by a VAD compared      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant      patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group with more severe heart      failure. Improvements in QoL must be made, as time spent with a VAD will likely      continue to increase.CI  - (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Miller, Jacob RAU  - Miller JRAD  - Section of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of      Medicine, St. Louis, Mo, USA.FAU - Boston, Umar SAU  - Boston USFAU - Epstein, Deirdre JAU  - Epstein DJFAU - Henn, Matthew CAU  - Henn MCFAU - Lawrance, Christopher PAU  - Lawrance CPFAU - Kallenbach, JacobAU  - Kallenbach JFAU - Simpson, Kathleen EAU  - Simpson KEFAU - Canter, Charles EAU  - Canter CEFAU - Eghtesady, PiroozAU  - Eghtesady PLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150410TA  - Congenit Heart DisJT  - Congenital heart diseaseJID - 101256510OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart FailureOT  - PediatricOT  - Quality of LifeOT  - Ventricular Assist DeviceEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00PHST- 2015/03/16 [accepted]AID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Congenit Heart Dis. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.- 25864509own - nlmstat- publisherda  - 20150413lr  - 20150414is  - 1747-0803 (electronic)is  - 1747-079x (linking)dp  - 2015 apr 10ti  - pediatric quality of life while supported with a ventricular assist device.lid - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]ab  - objective: ventricular assist devices (vads) have emerged as an important      treatment option for bridging pediatric patients with heart failure to      transplant. vads have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of       life (qol) while on vad support is unknown. we aimed to evaluate the qol of our      pediatric patients while supported with a vad. design: in this prospective study,      pediatric patients who underwent vad placement, and their parents, were      administered a generic pediatric quality of life inventory (pedsql) 4.0 pre-vad      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then      periodically until heart transplant or death. their final scores while on support      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.      results: from january 2008 to july 2014, 13 pediatric patients required vad      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a pedsql. the mean age at implant was       10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.      eleven (85\\\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\\\%) patient remaining      alive on support. the median duration of support prior to their final pedsql was       1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. patients self-reported significantly (p < .05) lower total      and physical qol scores when compared with all three comparison groups.      self-reported psychosocial qol scores were significantly lower than healthy      controls only. parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all      three comparison groups for all three categories (p < .05). conclusions: a large       deficit exists in the total qol of pediatric patients supported by a vad compared      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant      patients; however, vad patients do represent a group with more severe heart      failure. improvements in qol must be made, as time spent with a vad will likely      continue to increase.ci  - (c) 2015 wiley periodicals, inc.fau - miller, jacob rau  - miller jrad  - section of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery, washington university school of      medicine, st. louis, mo, usa.fau - boston, umar sau  - boston usfau - epstein, deirdre jau  - epstein djfau - henn, matthew cau  - henn mcfau - lawrance, christopher pau  - lawrance cpfau - kallenbach, jacobau  - kallenbach jfau - simpson, kathleen eau  - simpson kefau - canter, charles eau  - canter cefau - eghtesady, piroozau  - eghtesady pla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20150410ta  - congenit heart disjt  - congenital heart diseasejid - 101256510oto - notnlmot  - heart failureot  - pediatricot  - quality of lifeot  - ventricular assist deviceedat- 2015/04/14 06:00mhda- 2015/04/14 06:00crdt- 2015/04/14 06:00phst- 2015/03/16 [accepted]aid - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]pst - aheadofprintso  - congenit heart dis. 2015 apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.'

METHODS AND      RESULTS: We compared metabolomic, gene transcript, and protein data from 6 paired      samples of failing human left ventricular tissue obtained during left ventricular      assist device insertion (heart failure samples) and at heart transplant      (post-left ventricular assist device samples). Nonfailing left ventricular wall      samples procured from explanted hearts of patients with right heart failure      served as novel comparison samples. Metabolomic analyses uncovered a distinct      pattern in heart failure tissue: 2.6-fold increased pyruvate concentrations      coupled with reduced Krebs cycle intermediates and short-chain acylcarnitines,      suggesting a global reduction in substrate oxidation. These findings were      associated with decreased transcript levels for enzymes that catalyze fatty acid       oxidation and pyruvate metabolism and for key transcriptional regulators of      mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated      receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1A, 1.3-fold) and estrogen-related receptor      alpha (ERRA, 1.2-fold) and gamma (ERRG, 2.2-fold). Thus, parallel decreases in      key transcription factors and their target metabolic enzyme genes can explain the      decreases in associated metabolic intermediates. Mechanical support with left      ventricular assist device improved all of these metabolic and transcriptional      defects. CONCLUSIONS: These observations underscore an important pathophysiologic      role for severely defective metabolism in heart failure, while the reversibility       of these defects by left ventricular assist device suggests metabolic resilience       of the human heart.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Gupte, Anisha AAU  - Gupte AAAD  - From the Methodist Diabetes and Metabolism Institute, Houston Methodist Research       Institute, Houston, TX (A.A.G., D.J.H., C.J.L., W.A.H.); Department of Systems      Medicine and Bioengineering, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX      (Z.Y., S.T.C.W.); Center for Biostatistics, Houston Methodist Research Institute,      Houston, TX (L.E.P.); Department of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital,      Houston, TX (D.J.H., W.A.H.), Department of Radiology, Houston Methodist      Hospital, Houston, TX (S.T.C.W.); Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute,      Houston, TX (A.M.C.-R., K.A.Y., J.D.E., M.L., G.T.-A.); Weill Cornell Medical      College, New York, NY (A.A.G., D.J.H., A.M.C.-R., K.A.Y., Z.Y., J.D.E., M.L.,      L.E.P., C.J.L., S.T.C.W., G.T.-A., W.A.H.); Sarah W.
