The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy ofstandard adult VADs in adolescents and children as well as report our earlyexperience with miniaturized VADs in small children.METHODS: A 15-year retrospective review was performed on all patients youngerthan 18 years of age undergoing insertion of a pulsatile VAD at our institution.RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent VAD placement during the study period. Themean age was 12 (range, 6 months to 18 years), with a mean body surface area of1.48 (range, 0.25 to 2.3 m2). Diagnoses included dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 15),myocarditis (n = 2), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure (n = 1). Ten childrenunderwent insertion of biventricular VADs, and 8 had implantation of leftventricular VADs. The mean support duration was 57 days (range, 2 to 175 days).Complications included bleeding requiring reoperation (n = 4), stroke (n = 5),and device-related infection (n = 2). Outcomes of VAD support were as follows:VAD explantation in 1 case, death while receiving mechanical support in 3patients, and successful transplantation in 14 patients (77\\\%). Survival at 6months after orthotopic heart transplantation was 93\\\% with 1-year and 5-yearsurvival rates of 83\\\%.CONCLUSIONS: Currently available VADs are applicable for use as a bridge toorthotopic heart transplantation or in rare instances for myocardial recovery.The increasing accessibility of miniaturized devices allow for long-term support in smaller children and infants while awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation. Although the perioperative morbidity and mortality of VAD placement is notinsignificant, survival for those who receive a heart transplant is excellent.: 16937036  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1363. ann thorac surg. 2006 sep;82(3):926-32.ventricular assist device support in children and adolescents as a bridge toheart transplantation.sharma ms(1), webber sa, morell vo, gandhi sk, wearden pd, buchanan jr, kormosrl.author information: (1)department of cardiothoracic surgery, the university of pittsburgh school ofmedicine, children\\s hospital of pittsburgh, pittsburgh, pennsylvania 15213, usa.sharmams@upmc.educomment in    ann thorac surg. 2006 sep;82(3):933.comment on    ann thorac surg. 2006 sep;82(3):917-24; discussion 924-5.background: mechanical circulatory support using ventricular assist devices(vads) is a life-saving option for children in heart failure refractory tomaximal medical management. the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy ofstandard adult vads in adolescents and children as well as report our earlyexperience with miniaturized vads in small children.methods: a 15-year retrospective review was performed on all patients youngerthan 18 years of age undergoing insertion of a pulsatile vad at our institution.results: eighteen patients underwent vad placement during the study period. themean age was 12 (range, 6 months to 18 years), with a mean body surface area of1.48 (range, 0.25 to 2.3 m2). diagnoses included dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 15),myocarditis (n = 2), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure (n = 1). ten childrenunderwent insertion of biventricular vads, and 8 had implantation of leftventricular vads. the mean support duration was 57 days (range, 2 to 175 days).complications included bleeding requiring reoperation (n = 4), stroke (n = 5),and device-related infection (n = 2). outcomes of vad support were as follows:vad explantation in 1 case, death while receiving mechanical support in 3patients, and successful transplantation in 14 patients (77\\\%). survival at 6months after orthotopic heart transplantation was 93\\\% with 1-year and 5-yearsurvival rates of 83\\\%.conclusions: currently available vads are applicable for use as a bridge toorthotopic heart transplantation or in rare instances for myocardial recovery.the increasing accessibility of miniaturized devices allow for long-term support in smaller children and infants while awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation. although the perioperative morbidity and mortality of vad placement is notinsignificant, survival for those who receive a heart transplant is excellent.'

Our strategy for this entity is theHeartMate left ventricular assist device (LVAD) VELVAS, an electrically drivenimplantable LVAD. Herein we report our initial experience.METHODS: The medical records of all the patients who received HeartMate LVAS atour institution were reviewed.RESULTS: From January 1997 through May 2004, 19 patients received a HeartMate.The mean age was 39 (15 to 61) years and 84\\\% were men. The diagnoses were:dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 8), ischemic heart disease (n = 6), myocarditis (n = 3), congenital heart disease (n = 1), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 1).Mean time on LVAD was 113 (10 to 353) days. Ten patients were discharged from thehospital to their homes awaiting transplant or recovery. Three patients showedrecovery of heart function and were subsequently weaned from mechanical support. Thirteen patients underwent heart transplantation. Three patients died duringLVAD treatment. Major adverse events occurred in nine patients, including severe right heart failure (n = 3), severe bleeding (n = 3), stroke (n = 1), hepaticfailure (n = 1), and septicemia (n = 2).

Epub 2004 Mar 1.Left ventricular assist devices: an evidence-based analysis.Health Quality Ontario.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this health technology policy assessment was todetermine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using implantableventricular assist devices in the treatment of end-stage heart failure.HEART FAILURE: Heart failure is a complex syndrome that impairs the ability ofthe heart to maintain adequate blood circulation, resulting in multiorganabnormalities and, eventually, death. In the period of 1994 to 1997, 38,702individuals in Ontario had a first hospital admission for heart failure. Despite reported improvement in survival, the five-year mortality rate for heart failure is about 50\\\%. For patients with end-stage heart failure that does not respond to medical therapy, surgical treatment or traditional circulatory assist devices,heart transplantation (in appropriate patients) is the only treatment thatprovides significant patient benefit. HEART TRANSPLANT IN ONTARIO: With ashortage in the supply of donor hearts, patients are waiting longer for a hearttransplant and may die before a donor heart is available. From 1999 to 2003, 55to 74 people received a heart transplant in Ontario each year. Another 12 to 21people died while waiting for a suitable donor heart. Of these, 1 to 5 deathsoccurred in people under 18 years old. The rate-limiting factor in hearttransplant is the supply of donor hearts. Without an increase in available donor hearts, attempts at prolonging the life of some patients on the transplant waitlist could have a harmful effect on other patients that are being pushed down thewaiting list (knock on effect). LVAD TECHNOLOGY: Ventricular assist devices[VADs] have been developed to provide circulatory assistance to patients withend-stage heart failure. These are small pumps that usually assist the damagedleft ventricle [LVADs] and may be situated within the body (intracorporeal] oroutside the body [extracorporeal). Some of these devices were designed for use inthe right ventricle [RVAD] or both ventricles (bi-ventricular). LVADs have beenmainly used as a \\\"bridge-to-transplant\\\" for patients on a transplant waitinglist. As well, they have been used as a \\\"bridge-to-recovery\\\" in acute heartfailure, but this experience is limited. There has been an increasing interest inusing LVAD as a permanent (destination) therapy. REVIEW OF LVAD BY THE MEDICALADVISORY SECRETARIAT: The Medical Advisory Secretariat\\s review included adescriptive synthesis of findings from five systematic reviews and 60 reportspublished between January 2000 and December 2003. Additional information wasobtained through consultation and by searching the websites of Health Canada, theUnited Network of Organ Sharing, Organ Donation Ontario, and LVAD manufacturers.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS: Previous HTAs and current Level 3 evidence from prospective non-randomized controlled studies showed that whencompared to optimal medical therapy, LVAD support significantly improved thepre-transplant survival rates of heart transplant candidates waiting for asuitable donor heart (71\\\% for LVAD and 36\\\% for medical therapy). Pre-transplantsurvival rates reported ranged from 58\\\% to 90\\\% (median 74\\\%). Improved transplant rates were also reported for people who received pre-transplant LVAD support(e.g. 67\\\% for LVAD vs 33\\\% for medical therapy). Reported transplant rates forLVAD patients ranged from 39\\\% to 90\\\% (median 71\\\%). Patient\\s age greater than 60 years and pre-existing conditions of respiratory failure associated withsepticemia, ventilation, and right heart failure were independent risk factorsfor mortality after the LVAD implantation. LVAD support was shown to improve the New York Heart Association [NYHA)] functional classification and quality of life of patients waiting for heart transplant. LVAD also enabled approximately 41\\\% -49\\\% of patients to be discharged from hospitals and wait for a heart transplantat home. However, over 50\\\% of the discharged patients required re-hospitalizationdue to adverse events. Post-transplant survival rates for LVAD-bridged patientswere similar to or better than the survival rates of patients bridged by medical therapy. LVAD support has been associated with serious adverse events, including infection (median 53\\\%, range 6\\\%-72\\\%), bleeding (8.6\\\%-48\\\%, median 35\\\%),thromboembolism (5\\\%-37\\\%), neurologic disorders (7\\\%-28\\\%), right ventricularfailure (11\\\%-26\\\%), organ dysfunction (5\\\%-50\\\%) and hemolysis (6\\\%-20\\\%). Bleedingtends to occur in the first few post-implant days and is rare thereafter. It isfatal in 2\\\%-7\\\% of patients. Infection and thromboembolism occurred throughout theduration of the implant, though their frequency tended to diminish with time.Device malfunction has been identified as one of the major complications.Fatalities directly attributable to the devices were about 1\\\% in short-term LVAD use. However, mechanical failure was the second most frequent cause of death inpatients on prolonged LVAD support. Malfunctions were mainly associated with the external components, and often could be replaced by backed up components. LVADhas been used as a bridge-to-recovery in patients suffering from acutecardiogenic shock due to cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiotomy. The survival rates were reported to be lower than in bridge-to-transplant (median 26\\\%). Someof the bridge-to-recovery patients (14\\\%-75\\\%) required a heart transplant orremained on prolonged LVAD support. According to an expert in the field,experience with LVAD as a bridge-to-recovery technology has been more favourable in Germany than in North America, where it is not regarded as a major indication since evidence for its effectiveness in this setting is limited. LVAD has alsobeen explored as a destination therapy. A small, randomized, controlled trial(level 2 evidence) showed that LVAD significantly increased the 1-year survivalrate of patients with end-stage heart failure but were not eligible for a hearttransplant (51\\\% LVAD vs 25\\\% for medical therapy). However, improved survival was associated with adverse events 2.35 times higher than medically treated patients and a higher hospital re-admission rate. The 2-year survival rate on LVADdecreased to 23\\\%, although it was still significantly better compared to patientson medical therapy (8\\\%). The leading causes of deaths were sepsis (41\\\%) anddevice failure (17\\\%). The FDA has given conditional approval for the permanentuse of HeartMate SNAP VE LVAS in patients with end-stage heart failure who arenot eligible for heart transplantation, although the long-term effect of thisapplication is not known. In Canada, four LVAD systems have been licensed forbridge-to-transplant only. The use of LVAD support raises ethical issues because of the implications of potential explantation that could be perceived as awithdrawal of life support. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE TRANSPLANT WAITING LIST: Withthe shortage of donor hearts for adults, LVAD support probably would not increasethe number of patients who receive a heart transplant. If LVAD supportedcandidates are prioritized for urgent heart transplant, there will be a knock on effect as other transplant candidates without LVAD support would be pushed down, resulting in longer wait, deterioration in health status and die before asuitable donor heart becomes available. Under the current policy for allocatingdonor hearts in Ontario, patients on LVAD support would be downgraded to Status 3with a lower priority to receive a transplant. This would likely result in anexpansion of the transplant waiting list with an increasing number of patients onprolonged LVAD support, which is not consistent with the indication of LVAD useapproved by Health Canada. There is indication in the United Kingdom that LVADsupport in conjunction with an urgent transplant listing in the pediatricpopulation may decrease the number of deaths on the waiting list without aharmful knock-on effect on other transplant candidates.CONCLUSION: LVAD support as a bridge-to-transplant has been shown to improve the survival rate, functional status and quality of life of patients on the hearttransplant waiting list. However, due to the shortage of donor hearts and thecurrent heart transplant algorithm, LVAD support for transplant candidates of allage groups would likely result in an expansion of the waiting list and prolonged use of LVAD with significant budget implications but without increasing thenumber of heart transplants. Limited level 4 evidence showed that LVAD support inchildren yielded survival rates comparable to those in the adult population. The introduction of LVAD in the pediatric population would be more cost-effective andmight not have a negative effect on the transplant waiting list.PMCID: PMC3387736: 14721801  [pubmed - indexed for

effectiveness in this setting is limited. lvad has alsobeen explored as a destination therapy. a small, randomized, controlled trial(level 2 evidence) showed that lvad significantly increased the 1-year survivalrate of patients with end-stage heart failure but were not eligible for a hearttransplant (51\\\% lvad vs 25\\\% for medical therapy). however, improved survival was associated with adverse events 2.35 times higher than medically treated patients and a higher hospital re-admission rate. the 2-year survival rate on lvaddecreased to 23\\\%, although it was still significantly better compared to patientson medical therapy (8\\\%). the leading causes of deaths were sepsis (41\\\%) anddevice failure (17\\\%). the fda has given conditional approval for the permanentuse of heartmate snap ve lvas in patients with end-stage heart failure who arenot eligible for heart transplantation, although the long-term effect of thisapplication is not known. in canada, four lvad systems have been licensed forbridge-to-transplant only. the use of lvad support raises ethical issues because of the implications of potential explantation that could be perceived as awithdrawal of life support. potential impact on the transplant waiting list: withthe shortage of donor hearts for adults, lvad support probably would not increasethe number of patients who receive a heart transplant. if lvad supportedcandidates are prioritized for urgent heart transplant, there will be a knock on effect as other transplant candidates without lvad support would be pushed down, resulting in longer wait, deterioration in health status and die before asuitable donor heart becomes available. under the current policy for allocatingdonor hearts in ontario, patients on lvad support would be downgraded to status 3with a lower priority to receive a transplant. this would likely result in anexpansion of the transplant waiting list with an increasing number of patients onprolonged lvad support, which is not consistent with the indication of lvad useapproved by health canada. there is indication in the united kingdom that lvadsupport in conjunction with an urgent transplant listing in the pediatricpopulation may decrease the number of deaths on the waiting list without aharmful knock-on effect on other transplant candidates.conclusion: lvad support as a bridge-to-transplant has been shown to improve the survival rate, functional status and quality of life of patients on the hearttransplant waiting list. however, due to the shortage of donor hearts and thecurrent heart transplant algorithm, lvad support for transplant candidates of allage groups would likely result in an expansion of the waiting list and prolonged use of lvad with significant budget implications but without increasing thenumber of heart transplants. limited level 4 evidence showed that lvad support inchildren yielded survival rates comparable to those in the adult population. the introduction of lvad in the pediatric population would be more cost-effective andmight not have a negative effect on the transplant waiting list.pmcid: pmc3387736'

Conventional implantable systems have inherentlimitations that increase morbidity during support. In contrast, small,efficient, axial-flow pumps, which have been under development for the pastdecade, have the potential to improve the length and quality of life in patients with severe heart failure. Methods and Results- To assess the safety and clinicalutility of the Jarvik 2000, we implanted this device in 10 transplant candidates (mean age 51.3 years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV. Implantationwas achieved through a left thoracotomy during partial cardiopulmonary bypass.The mean support period was 84 days. Within 48 hours postoperatively, the cardiacindex increased 43\\\%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased 52\\\%, systemicvascular resistance decreased significantly, and inotropic support becameunnecessary. Eight patients underwent physical rehabilitation and returned toNYHA class I. Their left ventricular dimensions, cardiothoracic ratios, andpressure-volume loop analyses showed good left ventricular unloading. Sevenpatients underwent transplantation and 3 died during support. No devicethrombosis was observed at explantation.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 functions as a true assist device by partiallyunloading the left ventricle, thereby optimizing the patient\\s hemodynamics.

Indications for support were:failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy(n=118) and primary donor graft failure (n=37); postacute myocardial infarctionCS (n=27); acute myocarditis (n=6); and CS on chronic heart failure (n=40). Aperipheral ECMO setting was established in 126 (55.2\\\%) patients while it wasestablished centrally in 102 (44.7\\\%). Overall mean support time was 10.9Â±9.7 days(range: 1-43 days). Eighty-four (36.8\\\%) patients died on ECMO. Overall successrate, in terms of survival on ECMO (n=144), weaning from mechanical support(n=107; 46.9\\\%), bridge to mid-long-term ventricular assist device (n=6; 2.6\\\%),and bridge to heart transplantation (n=31; 13.5\\\%), was 63.1\\\%.

Long-term implantable cardiac assist devices for smaller adolescentpatients are not yet available in the United States.METHODS: This study reviews the experience with patients less than 21 years oldthat received HeartMate LVADs (TCI) at our institution. Twelve patients wereimplanted with 13 LVADs. The patients ranged in age from 11 to 20 years (mean 16 years). Body surface area ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 m2 (mean 1.8 m2). Patients were selected for LVAD placement based on eligibility for heart transplant andevidence of end-organ dysfunction.

No patient receivedsystemic anticoagulation.RESULTS: The duration of LVAD support ranged from 0 to 397 days (mean 123 days). Seven of the 8 patients eligible for discharge from the hospital with avented-electric LVAD were supported at home while awaiting transplantation.Outcomes of LVAD support were: LVAD explantation in 2 cases (15\\\%), expirationwith LVAD in place in 3 cases (23\\\%), and successful transplantation in 8 cases(62\\\%). Complications included 4 patients with systemic infection, 3 re-operationsfor hemorrhage, 1 embolic event, and 1 intraoperative air embolus that provedfatal.

De Gasperis Center, NiguardaHospital, Milan, Italy.BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure refractory to optimal oral pharmacologic therapy have a dismal short term prognosis. Heart transplantation is the onlytherapy shown to improve survival in these patients. Unfortunately, due to thecritical shortage of donor organs, approximately 30\\\% of listed patients withend-stage heart failure die before a suitable donor heart becomes available. The principal aim of this study was to determine whether intravenous pharmacologiccirculatory support favorably influences the clinical course of heart transplant candidates or whether mechanical circulatory support should be instituted in thishigh risk patient population.METHODS: Data from 154 consecutive hospitalizations in 125 patients 49+/-12 yearswere retrospectively reviewed. The product limit method was used to estimatesurvival. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the clinicaland hemodynamic variables that independently predict outcome after each admissionin which heart transplantation did not occur.RESULTS: One year survival for the study population was 65\\\%. This survival issignificantly lower than the 91\\\% 1 year survival in similarly ill patientsundergoing heart transplantation. The Cox proportional hazard method identifiedserum bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum sodium levels and right atrial pressure as independent prognostic indices. Serum bilirubin, BUN levels andduration of intravenous pharmacologic circulatory support were associated with a poor outcome. A composite index including serum bilirubin and BUN levelspredicted outcome with a sensitivity and specificity of 79\\\% and 77\\\%,respectively. The addition of pharmacologic support duration increased themodel\\s sensitivity to 95\\\%, but did not significantly alter specificity that was 74\\\%.

Approaching an alternative forend-stage heart failure. Implantable LVAD Study Group.McCarthy PM(1), James KB, Savage RM, Vargo R, Kendall K, Harasaki H, Hobbs RE,Pashkow FJ.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cleveland ClinicFoundation, Ohio 44195.BACKGROUND: The implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was designed toprovide circulatory support as an alternative to heart transplantation or tocontinued medical therapy of end-stage heart failure. Initial experience with theimplantable LVAD used as a bridge to heart transplantation provides a clinicalopportunity to study the function of the device and adaptation by the patient.METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen heart transplant candidates (mean age, 50 years; 17males) underwent insertion of the HeartMate LVAD as a bridge to hearttransplantation from December 1991 to November 1993. All patients were incardiogenic shock on inotropes, and 16 (84\\\%) were on an intra-aortic balloonpump. Three patients died because of multiple organ failure; all had rightventricular (RV) dysfunction (2 required RV assist devices). Sixteen patients(84\\\%) improved markedly and were rehabilitated to New York Heart Associationfunctional class I-II. Three patients are still on support. Significantimprovements in hemodynamic function (based on analysis of the percent changefrom pre-LVAD condition to pretransplantation) were observed: cardiac index rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.9 L/min per m2 (P = .0002), left atrial pressurefell from 22.9 +/- 9.5 to 8.0 +/- 5.5 mm Hg (P = .003), RV ejection fractionincreased from 19.8 +/- 11.3\\\% to 40.8 +/- 8.9\\\% (P = .0004), pulmonary vascularresistance decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 Wood units (P = .004).Thirteen patients had successful transplants after a mean duration of 66 days on the LVAD (range, 22 to 101 days). There were no thromboembolic events while thepatients were on the LVAD. Only aspirin with dipyridamole was given foranticoagulation during a total of > 1100 patient days of support.CONCLUSIONS: Bridge to transplant implantable LVAD experience indicates thathemodynamic improvement should be significant after insertion of the devices and that the risk of thromboembolic events with the HeartMate LVAD should beextremely low. Rehabilitation and quality of life should be markedly improved.Limitations of extrapolating this clinical experience to the permanentimplantable LVAD include that these patients were hospitalized (permanentimplants will be outpatients); the \\\"vented-electric\\\" HeartMate LVAD was nottested (it is a portable, battery-powered device), and true \\\"chronic\\\" LVADsupport (> 1 year) was not tested, so questions regarding long-term devicereliability and the chronic risk of infection are unknown.: 7955291  [pubmed - indexed for medline]2008. circulation. 1994 nov;90(5 pt 2):ii83-6.implantable left ventricular assist device. approaching an alternative forend-stage heart failure. implantable lvad study group.mccarthy pm(1), james kb, savage rm, vargo r, kendall k, harasaki h, hobbs re,pashkow fj.author information: (1)department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, cleveland clinicfoundation, ohio 44195.background: the implantable left ventricular assist device (lvad) was designed toprovide circulatory support as an alternative to heart transplantation or tocontinued medical therapy of end-stage heart failure. initial experience with theimplantable lvad used as a bridge to heart transplantation provides a clinicalopportunity to study the function of the device and adaptation by the patient.methods and results: nineteen heart transplant candidates (mean age, 50 years; 17males) underwent insertion of the heartmate lvad as a bridge to hearttransplantation from december 1991 to november 1993. all patients were incardiogenic shock on inotropes, and 16 (84\\\%) were on an intra-aortic balloonpump. three patients died because of multiple organ failure; all had rightventricular (rv) dysfunction (2 required rv assist devices). sixteen patients(84\\\%) improved markedly and were rehabilitated to new york heart associationfunctional class i-ii. three patients are still on support. significantimprovements in hemodynamic function (based on analysis of the percent changefrom pre-lvad condition to pretransplantation) were observed: cardiac index rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.9 l/min per m2 (p = .0002), left atrial pressurefell from 22.9 +/- 9.5 to 8.0 +/- 5.5 mm hg (p = .003), rv ejection fractionincreased from 19.8 +/- 11.3\\\% to 40.8 +/- 8.9\\\% (p = .0004), pulmonary vascularresistance decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 wood units (p = .004).thirteen patients had successful transplants after a mean duration of 66 days on the lvad (range, 22 to 101 days). there were no thromboembolic events while thepatients were on the lvad. only aspirin with dipyridamole was given foranticoagulation during a total of > 1100 patient days of support.conclusions: bridge to transplant implantable lvad experience indicates thathemodynamic improvement should be significant after insertion of the devices and that the risk of thromboembolic events with the heartmate lvad should beextremely low. rehabilitation and quality of life should be markedly improved.limitations of extrapolating this clinical experience to the permanentimplantable lvad include that these patients were hospitalized (permanentimplants will be outpatients); the \\\"vented-electric\\\" heartmate lvad was nottested (it is a portable, battery-powered device), and true \\\"chronic\\\" lvadsupport (> 1 year) was not tested, so questions regarding long-term devicereliability and the chronic risk of infection are unknown.'

However, due to the limitedavailability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patientswith refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with theHeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as abridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was aretrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVADimplantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-hearttransplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 yearsold (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heartdisease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], andchemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwentHMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery(21.7\\\%), mediastinal infection (21.7\\\%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinalcollection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1\\\%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0\\\%), and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3\\\%). All patients were dischargedfrom hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced drivelineinfections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to thefollowing conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0\\\%), gastrointestinalbleeding (13.0\\\%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0\\\%), transient ischemic attack(8.7\\\%), arrhythmia (8.7\\\%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aorticregurgitation (8.7\\\%), right ventricular failure (4.3\\\%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3\\\%),and hematuria (4.3\\\%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally NewYork Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient wassuccessfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were twomortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to beeffective in our Asian population.

This study assessed the usefulness of the INTERMACS scale to predict outcomes in advanced heart failure patients undergoing mechanicalcirculatory support (MCS).METHODS: Fifty-four patients underwent MCS implantation from 2001 to 2007. Group A included 27 patients at INTERMACS level 1 and 2. Group B included 27 atINTERMACS level 3 and 4. Patient characteristics pre-MCS implant, incidence ofcomplications during support, and survival between groups were compared.RESULTS: Before MCS implantation, Group A had significantly lower cardiac index, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic pulmonary pressure, higher central venous pressure, and lower urine output (p < .05). After MCS, Group A had a lowerincidence of infections (17\\\% vs 46\\\%; odds ratio [OR], 0.25, 95\\\% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.06-0.6) and a higher incidence of liver injury (39\\\% vs 11\\\%; OR5, 95\\\% CI, 1.15-25).

However, there are only limited data on MV support among children after ventricular assist device(VAD) implantation. We report the duration of MV after VAD placement, indicationsfor respiratory support in the postimplantation period, and associated patientfactors.METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 43 consecutive children (aged <18 years) with end-stage heart failure who were supported with a VAD as a bridge to transplantation from January 2005 to December 2011. Multivariableanalysis was performed using the multiple Poisson regression model for theduration of MV.RESULTS: Overall, 33\\\% (nÂ = 14) remained on MV until heart transplant or death. Ofthose requiring pre-VAD extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, 63\\\%(nÂ = 12 of 19) remained on MV until heart transplant or death compared with 8\\\%(nÂ = 2 of 24) among those not on ECMO before VAD (p < 0.001). Patients withmoderate or severe mitral regurgitation while on VAD support had 1.7-times moreMV days compared with those with none or trivial on-VAD mitral regurgitation. In addition, previous support on ECMO, those with moderate or severe tricuspidregurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants had an increased risk ofprolonged MV.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VAD recipients previously supported onECMO, those with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, moderate or severetricuspid regurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants had an increasedrisk of prolonged MV.

We report on our experience in the pediatric population.METHODS: Retrospective review of 27 consecutive children offered mechanicalsupport with Berlin Heart as a bridge to heart transplant, and Jarvik 2000 as adestination therapy from February 2002 to October 2011.RESULTS: The median patient age was 4.8 years (range = 75 days to 20.5 years).The median patient weight was 18.6 kg (range = 2.9-63 kg). We divided thepatients in two groups, including in group I patients assisted for bridging toheart transplantation and in group II patients with Duchenne\\s dystrophy assistedas destination therapy. In the group I, 11 patients required biventricularmechanical support (BVAD), but in all other cases, a single left VAD provedsufficient (56\\\%). The median duration of VAD support was 48 days (1 to 192 days).The median pre-VAD pulmonary vascular resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5to 14.4 WU/m(2)). Twelve patients (48\\\%) were successfully bridged to hearttransplantation after a median duration of mechanical support of 63 days (range =2-168 days). Ten deaths occurred (40\\\%), three for neurological complications, twofor sepsis, two for multiorgan failure, and three other for devicemalfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our patients has increased from 33\\\% to 75\\\%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from 89\\\% to 23\\\%. In the group II,two patients with mean age of 15.3 years were assisted with Jarvik 2000, and bothof them are alive in a follow-up of 10.4 months. In two patients with Rpi > 10WU/m(2), unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilatator therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2 WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of BVAD support, respectively. Six patients (32\\\%) required at least one pump change. Of 12 patients undergoing hearttransplantation, five developed an extremely elevated (>60\\\%) panel-reactiveantibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed by Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of rejection in the first month afterheart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The survival rate after hearttransplantation was 100\\\% with a median follow-up of 34.4 months (45 days to 8.7years).CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in children with end-stage heart failure is aneffective strategy as a bridge to heart transplantation with a reasonablemorbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer an additional means to reverseextremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.

These devices have clear advantages over extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and are often used in adults. They are only recently being commonly used in the pediatric age group. As the use of LVADs becomes more mainstream in children, it is important to determine the complication profileassociated with these devices. Furthermore, with the increasing application ofLVADs in children, pediatric neurosurgeons are seeing a correlative increase inassociated neurological complications. In this study, the authors reviewed theincidence of neurological complications due to LVAD use in the pediatric agegroup and the role of neurosurgery in treatment.METHODS: The authors examined data regarding patients with LVADs from the TexasChildren\\s Hospital Heart Center database (July 01, 2007, to June 30, 2011) andrecorded neurological complications requiring neurosurgical consultation. Theyidentified 2 children who underwent craniotomies during LVAD treatment.RESULTS: Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3 (6.5\\\%) of the 46 patients treated with an LVAD at the authors\\ institution. Of these patients, 2 were treated with craniotomies for life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages. The 3 patients in theneurosurgical cohort presented with cerebral infarction, decreased level ofconsciousness, and/or seizure. At the last follow-up (286, 503, and 550 days), 1 patient (case 2) had no decline in neurological status, underwent a successfulheart transplant, and was discharged home; 1 patient (case 1) died of refractory cardiac failure; and 1 patient (case 3) was on an LVAD for destination therapy(that is, the LVAD is not a bridge to transplantation but rather the finaltreatment). This patient was discharged from the hospital, but he died ofoverwhelming fungemia at 286 days while on VAD support.CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious and feared complication of LVADtreatment. While the surgical risk is substantial due to systemic anticoagulationand significant medical comorbidities, neurosurgical evacuation of hemorrhageplays an important life-saving role that can yield successful and acceptableoutcomes.: 22942362  [pubmed - indexed for medline]575. j neurosurg pediatr. 2012 nov;10(5):370-5. doi: 10.3171/2012.7.peds12161. epub2012 aug 31.neurosurgical complications of left ventricular assist devices in children.mayer rr(1), hwang sw, reddy gd, morales dl, whitehead we, curry dj, bollo rj,luerssen tg, jea a.author information: (1)division of pediatric neurosurgery, department of neurosurgery, texaschildrenâs hospital, baylor college of medicine, houston 77030, usa.object: left ventricular assist devices (lvads) are continuous or pulsatile flow devices that could potentially be life-saving measures for patients withend-stage heart failure. these devices have clear advantages over extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) and are often used in adults. they are only recently being commonly used in the pediatric age group. as the use of lvads becomes more mainstream in children, it is important to determine the complication profileassociated with these devices. furthermore, with the increasing application oflvads in children, pediatric neurosurgeons are seeing a correlative increase inassociated neurological complications. in this study, the authors reviewed theincidence of neurological complications due to lvad use in the pediatric agegroup and the role of neurosurgery in treatment.methods: the authors examined data regarding patients with lvads from the texaschildren\\s hospital heart center database (july 01, 2007, to june 30, 2011) andrecorded neurological complications requiring neurosurgical consultation. theyidentified 2 children who underwent craniotomies during lvad treatment.results: intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3 (6.5\\\%) of the 46 patients treated with an lvad at the authors\\ institution. of these patients, 2 were treated with craniotomies for life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages. the 3 patients in theneurosurgical cohort presented with cerebral infarction, decreased level ofconsciousness, and/or seizure. at the last follow-up (286, 503, and 550 days), 1 patient (case 2) had no decline in neurological status, underwent a successfulheart transplant, and was discharged home; 1 patient (case 1) died of refractory cardiac failure; and 1 patient (case 3) was on an lvad for destination therapy(that is, the lvad is not a bridge to transplantation but rather the finaltreatment). this patient was discharged from the hospital, but he died ofoverwhelming fungemia at 286 days while on vad support.conclusions: intracranial hemorrhage is a serious and feared complication of lvadtreatment. while the surgical risk is substantial due to systemic anticoagulationand significant medical comorbidities, neurosurgical evacuation of hemorrhageplays an important life-saving role that can yield successful and acceptableoutcomes.'

Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 2012 May;113(3):292-6.[End-stage heart failure].[Article in Japanese]Kyo S(1).Author information: (1)Department of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.The ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure patients is cardiactransplantation. However, many Japanese candidates have not received its benefitsdue to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. The heart transplant waiting period in Japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the OrganTransplantation Law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900days because of the increase in candidates. According to the Japanese Transplant Registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (BTT)with a ventricular assist device (VAD), and the average duration of BTT is around800 to 900 days. The excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in Japan even with such a prolonged BTT duration with VADs is confirmation of the excellentclinical results of VAD support. Until April 2011, only the paracorporeal NiproVAD for BTT was covered by Japanese national health insurance. Analysis of theclinical outcome of 303 patients who received a Nipro VAD (for left ventricular[LV] drainage) as BTT showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days(average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68patients (22\\\%) required ongoing VAD support. Thus the Nipro VAD is an excellentparacorporeal device. The 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials of four types of implantable rotary blood pump LVADs (Evaheart, DuraHeart, Jarvik200, HeartMate II) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of BTT usingimplantable LVADs. Only 36 patients in seven Japanese heart centers have receivedimplantable LVADs, and this small number corresponds to the initial learningcurve. Therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use ofcommercially available implantable LVADs becomes more widespread. The longwaiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellentclinical outcomes of VAD therapy in Japan.: 22723614  [pubmed - indexed for medline]616. nihon geka gakkai zasshi. 2012 may;113(3):292-6.[end-stage heart failure].[article in japanese]kyo s(1).author information: (1)department of therapeutic strategy for heart failure, the university of tokyo hospital, tokyo, japan.the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure patients is cardiactransplantation. however, many japanese candidates have not received its benefitsdue to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. the heart transplant waiting period in japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the organtransplantation law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900days because of the increase in candidates. according to the japanese transplant registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (btt)with a ventricular assist device (vad), and the average duration of btt is around800 to 900 days. the excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in japan even with such a prolonged btt duration with vads is confirmation of the excellentclinical results of vad support. until april 2011, only the paracorporeal niprovad for btt was covered by japanese national health insurance. analysis of theclinical outcome of 303 patients who received a nipro vad (for left ventricular[lv] drainage) as btt showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days(average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68patients (22\\\%) required ongoing vad support. thus the nipro vad is an excellentparacorporeal device. the 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials of four types of implantable rotary blood pump lvads (evaheart, duraheart, jarvik200, heartmate ii) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of btt usingimplantable lvads. only 36 patients in seven japanese heart centers have receivedimplantable lvads, and this small number corresponds to the initial learningcurve. therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use ofcommercially available implantable lvads becomes more widespread. the longwaiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellentclinical outcomes of vad therapy in japan.'

Once haemodynamic stability has been established with a ventricular assist device (VAD), the decision to wait for myocardialrecovery as opposed to listing for an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can bedifficult. We have undertaken this study to establish the criteria fordetermining the need for heart transplantation following VAD implant forfulminant myocarditis.METHODS: A total of 442 VADs were implanted between 1993 and 2011. Twenty-fourVADs were implanted for fulminant myocarditis with refractory cardiogenic shock. We retrospectively analysed the variables and the pathology for this cohort.Patients who had a full recovery of myocardial function and subsequent VADexplant (Explant) were compared with those bridged to OHT. There was one acutedeath.RESULTS: There was no difference in the past medical history between the groups. Explant patients had a more acute onset of heart failure with a median of 7 days between the onset of symptoms and VAD implant, when compared with 22 days for OHT(P = 0.01). A rapid recovery in myocardial function was seen in the Explantgroup, with recovery of myocardial function (ejection fraction = 53 Â± 24\\\%) in 14 Â± 7 days. Myocardial function was sustained for 5 years following the VADexplant. The female gender favoured myocardial recovery and VAD explantability.Two patients had giant cell myocarditis, neither of whom had a recovery offunction, and they were bridged to heart transplant with a VAD.CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant myocarditis is a fatal condition without mechanicalsupport. The rapid onset of symptoms is associated with a complete recovery ofmyocardial function and VAD explant.

We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwentimplantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile(HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and theeffect on body mass index (BMI).METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30Â kg/m(2) who underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for weight change. In the 30-daysurvivors, end points of the study were continued LVAD support, heart transplant,or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass surgery and was excluded.RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria, BMI was 35.6 Â±4.4Â kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 Â± 5.5Â kg/m(2) (mean BMIchangeÂ -2.5Â kg/m(2); PÂ = .063), with a mean follow-up time of 301.6 Â± 255.5 days.The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9Â kg/m(2) (PÂ = .016 vsbaseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1Â kg/m(2) increase in BMI.BMIÂ <30Â kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\\\%), 5 of 19 (26\\\%) inXVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\\\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 XVE, 2 HMII) or50\\\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was 4.6Â kg/m(2)(PÂ = .003).CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30Â kg/m(2) provided significantweight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in recipients of the continuousflow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a heart transplant after LVADinsertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6Â kg/m(2) (PÂ = .003). LVAD implantationprovides a period of hemodynamic support for obese patients with advanced heartfailure, during which time opportunity may be available for weight loss.Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater weight loss thannonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may be necessary toachieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous flow LVAD.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to describe ourcenter\\s multidisciplinary team management of single-ventricle patients supportedlong term with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric VAD. Patient #1 was a 4-year-old with double-outlet right ventricle with aortic atresia, L-looped ventricles, and heart block who developed heart failure 1 year after Fontan. She initiallyrequired extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and was transitioned toBerlin Heart systemic VAD. She was supported for 363 days (cardiac intensive careunit [CICU] 335 days, floor 28 days). The postoperative course was complicated byintermittent infection including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,intermittent hepatic and renal insufficiencies, and transient antithrombin,protein C, and protein S deficiencies resulting in multiple thrombi. She had atotal of five pump changes over 10 months. Long-term medical management included anticoagulation with enoxaparin, platelet inhibition with aspirin anddipyridamole, and antibiotic prophylaxis using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Shedeveloped sepsis of unknown etiology and subsequently died from multiorganfailure. Patient #2 was a 4-year-old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome whodeveloped heart failure 2 years after bidirectional Glenn shunt. At systemic VAD implantation, he was intubated with renal insufficiency. Post-VAD implantation,his renal insufficiency resolved, and he was successfully extubated to daytimenasal cannula and biphasic positive airway pressure at night. He was supportedfor 270 days (CICU 143 days, floor 127 days). The pump was upsized to a 50-mLpump in May 2011 for increased central venous pressures (29âmmâHg). Long-termmedical management included anticoagulation with warfarin and single-agentplatelet inhibition using dipyridamole due to aspirin resistance. He developedincreased work of breathing requiring intubation, significant anasarca, andbleeding from the endotracheal tube. The family elected to withdraw support.Although both patients died prior to heart transplantation, a consistentspecialized multidisciplinary team approach to the medical care of our VADpatients, consisting of cardiothoracic surgeons, heart transplant team,hematologists, pharmacists, infectious disease physicians, psychiatrists,specialty trained bedside nursing, and nurse practitioners, allowed us to manage these patients long term while awaiting heart transplantation.Â© 2012, Copyright the Authors.

However, thromboembolicevents, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. Weretrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in apediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a leftVAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwentheart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient isstill on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days ofassistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of ninepatients (56\\\%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When comparedwith noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and alonger length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced forthromboembolic issues, most of them (67\\\%) in patients with VAD-relatedinfections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BHendocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venouscatheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinarycatheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanicalventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Ofthe 17 isolated pathogens, 53\\\% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence ofPseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3\\\%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25\\\%),three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50\\\% of all isolated pseudomonads),and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiactransplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients withinfected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospitalwith increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.Â© 2011, Copyright the Authors.

We analyzed our center\\s resultsfollowing implantation of a biventricular assist device (BVAD).METHODS: We implanted 39 BVADs between September 2001 and January 2009. Allpatients were qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organavailable at time of BVAD implantation. Fifteen patients without a history ofchronic cardiomyopathy suffered from acute BV failure (group 1), whereas theother 24 suffered from severe chronic cardiomyopathy (group 2). The indicationfor BVAD implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degreeof end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was a candidate for bridge to recovery.RESULTS: Both groups were similar regarding their preoperative hemodynamics,intraoperative and early postoperative findings, and adverse events. Patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37Â±17 years) than those in group 2 (51Â±12 years). Mean duration of support in group 1 was 137Â±109 days, and 65Â±61 days in group 2. In group 1, 33\\\% (5/15) were weaned off the device and 53\\\% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24 patients (42\\\%) in the chronic group weretransplanted. Group 1\\s mortality on the device was lower than that of group 2(13\\\% vs 67\\\%). Furthermore, 11 patients of group 1 survived for 1 year comparedwith four in group 2 (73\\\% vs 17\\\%).CONCLUSION: Implantation of a BVAD in patients with chronic heart failure andacute decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate.

The effectiveness of hearttransplantation and medical therapy is limited, resulting in the emergence ofmechanical circulatory support as a primary treatment for end-stage heartdisease. Left ventricular assist devices that use rotary pumps are small anddurable, which might reduce morbidity and mortality during support.METHODS: Fifty heart transplant candidates with New York Heart Associationfunctional class IV symptoms were supported at 5 international centers by theHeartWare System for 180 days, until heart transplant, myocardial recovery anddevice explant, or death. Patients who continue to be supported have beenfollowed for a minimum of 2 years.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 20 (40\\\%) received transplants, 4 (8\\\%) had the pumpexplanted after myocardial recovery, and 17 (34\\\%) continue support at 2 years.Nine (18\\\%) patients died during support from sepsis (n = 3), multiple organfailure (n = 3), or hemorrhagic stroke (n = 3). The actual survival at 6, 12, and24 months was 90\\\%, 84\\\%, and 79\\\%, respectively. In the survivors, measures ofquality of life showed a significant improvement over baseline values.Significant improvements were found for recognition memory at 3 months afterimplant (p = 0.006). The most frequent adverse events were infection andbleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with end-stage heart failure can be safely and effectively supported by the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System with improved quality oflife and neurocognitive function.Copyright Â© 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Epub 2010 Jun 19.Initial clinical experience with a novel left ventricular assist device with amagnetically levitated rotor in a multi-institutional trial.Wieselthaler GM(1), O Driscoll G, Jansz P, Khaghani A, Strueber M; HVAD Clinical Investigators.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, ViennaGeneral Hospital, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria.georg.wieselthaler@meduniwien.ac.atBACKGROUND: Third-generation rotary blood pumps have magnetically levitatedrotors that eliminate mechanical wear over the years. Together with theirpotential for miniaturization, these pumps seem suitable for long-term support ofpatients with a wide range of body surface areas (BSA). Recently, the novel HVAD pump (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA), a miniaturized centrifugal pump with ahydrodynamic, magnetically levitated rotor, became ready for clinicalapplication.METHODS: In a multi-institutional trial in Europe and Australia, 23 patients(mean age, 47.9 Â± 12 years) in end-stage heart failure were enrolled in 5centers. The primary end point of the bridge-to-transplant study was survival to heart transplant or survival to 180 days on the device, whichever occurred first.Follow-up data at 1 year are presented. The small size of the device allows forintrapericardial placement of the pump.RESULTS: Implant procedures were generally fast and uneventful. Mean duration of support was 167 Â± 143 days (range, 13-425 days), and mean blood flow provided by the pump was 6.1 Â± 1.1 liters/min. At the 180-day end point, 2 patients hadundergone successful transplant at 157 and 175 days, 2 patients died while on thedevice, and 19 patients continued pump support for more than 180 days. Actuarial survival after 6 months was 91\\\% and was 86\\\% at the 1-year follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The design of the HVAD pump enables a quick and less invasiveimplantation.
