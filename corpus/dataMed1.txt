AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Rapid improvement in antineoplastic therapy is increasing not 
      only cancer survivorship but also the incidence of end-stage heart failure among 
      breast and childhood cancer survivors. Anthracyclines and newer targeted
      therapies, including trastuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are important
      agents implemented in clinical practice that carry cardiotoxic risk. While acute 
      heart failure is often self-limited and reversible, delayed-onset heart failure
      significantly reduces survival. Extremes of age, renal dysfunction, pre-existing 
      coronary artery disease, HER2 positivity, and multi-drug therapy are predictors
      of irreversible heart failure after chemotherapy. Left ventricular assist device 
      (LVAD) implantation and cardiac transplantation can be performed safely in
      patients with end-stage heart failure (HF) from chemotherapy. However,
      co-existing right ventricular dysfunction, hepatic congestion, and increased risk
      of bleeding make LVAD therapy challenging and dependent on careful patient
      selection. Cardiac transplantation in patients with chemotherapy-induced heart
      failure can be performed with good 10-year survival, but requires 5 years of
      cancer freedom and post-transplant infections remain a problem. Improvements in
      LVAD therapy and the expanding role of the total artificial heart and other
      durable biventricular support devices will likely provide more reliable surgical 
      options for the management of end-stage HF after chemotherapy.
