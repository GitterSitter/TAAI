AB  - After implantation of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD),
      exercise capacity in heart failure patients remains reduced with peak oxygen
      uptake (peak VO2) values averaging from 11 to 20 ml/kg/min. Total cardiac output 
      in CF-LVAD patients during exercise is predominantly determined by pump speed,
      the pressure difference across the pump, and in some cases ejection through the
      aortic valve. Fixed pump speed utilized in CF-LVADs may provide insufficient
      support, resulting in a moderate cardiac output increase during increased
      physical strain. Ongoing studies are evaluating whether pump speed changes in
      response to varied loading conditions may enable LVADs to provide sufficient
      support even during strenuous exercise. In the currently used devices, evidence
      suggests that focus on optimizing non-cardiac peripheral parameters is vital.
      Extra-cardiac potentially reversible factors are anemia with low oxygen-carrying 
      capacity, obesity and general deconditioning with low muscle mass. In addition,
      exercise training in CF-LVAD patients can improve peak VO2. To design
      interventions to improve functional capacity in patients treated with modern
      durable LVADs, a detailed understanding of exercise physiology in a
      continuous-flow circulatory system is necessary. In this review we address the
      different components of exercise physiology in LVAD patients and point out
      potential solutions or areas of future research.

TI  - Extracorporeal life support as a bridge to bridge: a strategy to optimize
      ventricular assist device results.
LID - ezu516 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) devices provide temporary
      mechanical circulatory assistance and are usually implanted under emergency
      conditions in critical patients. If weaning off ECLS is not possible, heart
      transplantation or implantation of long-term mechanical circulatory support
      (LTMCS) is required. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the
      bridge-to-bridge (BTB) concept. METHODS: Between 1 January 2004 and 1 August
      2010, 97 patients were assisted by LTMCS. The implantation was the first-line
      intervention in 48 patients (the bridge group), and was performed after a period 
      of ECLS support in 49 others (the BTB group). RESULTS: The long-term survival
      rate was 51.6%, with a mean follow-up of 30.7 months, and there were no
      differences for biological parameters between the two groups. Patients in the BTB
      group whose condition was initially more severe, improved under ECLS support, and
      those in whom biological parameters did not revert to normal died after LTMCS.
      Risk factors for mortality in the BTB group were total bilirubin and lactate
      before LTMCS, and alkaline phosphatase before ECLS support. CONCLUSIONS: The BTB 
      concept allows the implementation of LTMCS in severe patients, for whom it was
      not originally envisaged, with the same long-term survival as in first-line
      settings. ECLS in the evolution of patients is predictive of survival after
      LTMCS.

TI  - Use of right ventricular support with a centrifugal pump in post-valve surgery
      right ventricular failure: a case series.
PG  - 38-42
AB  - The optimal treatment method for right ventricular failure after valve surgery
      complicated by a low cardiac output has not been determined, although several
      case reports have been published on patients with ventricular failure and
      arrhythmia who were bridged to cardiac transplantation using biventricular or
      left ventricular assist devices. This case series illustrates successful
      circulatory support of 4 patients with prolonged low cardiac outputs and right
      ventricular failure and arrhythmias after valvular heart surgery with or without 
      severe pulmonary hypertension. In-hospital death occurred in one patient and 3
      patients were discharged from the hospital with good general condition. At two
      years' follow-up, 2 patients were in functional class one but another patient
      underwent laparotomy for multiple splenic abscesses and died from multiple organ 
      failure.

TI  - Why pulsatility still matters: a review of current knowledge.
PG  - 609-20
AB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become standard
      therapy option for patients with advanced heart failure. They offer several
      advantages over previously used pulsatile-flow LVADs, including improved
      durability, less surgical trauma, higher energy efficiency, and lower
      thrombogenicity. These benefits translate into better survival, lower frequency
      of adverse events, improved quality of life, and higher functional capacity of
      patients. However, mounting evidence shows unanticipated consequences of
      continuous-flow support, such as acquired aortic valve insufficiency and acquired
      von Willebrand syndrome. In this review article we discuss current evidence on
      differences between continuous and pulsatile mechanical circulatory support, with
      a focus on clinical implications and potential benefits of pulsatile flow.

TI  - Ventricular assist device selection: which one and when?
PG  - 596-9
AB  - Advances in mechanical circulatory support have significantly expanded the
      treatment options for patients with heart failure, whether acute or chronic.
      There are numerous devices available that offer patients short-, intermediate-,
      and long-term duration of support depending on their clinical needs and cardiac
      recovery. Each device has its own technical considerations and the decision which
      device to use depends on several factors, including what is available, the degree
      of support required, and expected duration of support. Additional issues that
      need to be considered in choosing level of support include right heart function, 
      respiratory failure, and multi-organ derangements. A widespread availability of
      short-term ventricular assist devices and timely institution for effective
      hemodynamic support will translate into improved patient outcomes whether that is
      successful transfer to a tertiary care facility or recovery of inherent cardiac
      function. Implantable ventricular assist devices have and will continue to evolve
      into smaller and more durable devices, and the future for patients with advanced 
      heart failure looks ever-more promising.

TI  - Around and around the merry-go-round: multiple implantations of short- and
      long-term ventricular assist devices in a patient with severe heart failure.
AB  - Multiple implantations of left ventricular assist devices over a period of three 
      years were performed in a 17-year-old gentleman with non-ischaemic dilated
      cardiomyopathy and congestive cardiac failure. The first device (HeartMate II)
      was implanted as a bridge to transplantation. However, after few months of
      support the patient showed signs of myocardial recovery and the device was
      successfully explanted. After 2 years of uneventful follow-up, the patient's
      condition deteriorated requiring further mechanical support. Due to the elevated 
      risk associated with a redo full-support LVAD implantation, we decided to implant
      a partial support device (Synergy(R) CircuLite). Because of recurrent pump
      thrombosis requiring device exchange, the final weeks to transplantation were
      bridged with CentriMag(R) short-term LVAD. After successful cardiac
      transplantation the patient required further temporary extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation support which was weaned off and explanted on the fourth
      postoperative day. After further uncomplicated postoperative recovery the patient
      was discharged and has been doing well for 1 year of follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The evolution of pharmacologic therapies and mechanical support
      including ventricular assist devices (VADs) has broadened the scope of care
      available to children with advanced heart failure. At the present time, there are
      only limited means of quantifying disease severity or the concomitant morbidity
      for this population. This study describes the development of a novel pediatric
      treatment intensity score (TIS), designed to quantify the burden of illness and
      clinical trajectory in children on VAD support. METHODS: There were 5 clinical
      domains assessed: nutrition, respiratory support, activity level, cardiovascular 
      medications, and care environment. A scale was developed through expert
      consensus. Higher scores indicate greater morbidity as reflected by intensity of 
      medical management. To evaluate feasibility and face validity, the TIS was
      applied retrospectively to a subset of pediatric inpatients with VADs. The
      Bland-Altman method was used to assess limits of agreement. RESULTS: The study
      comprised 39 patients with 42 implantations. Bland-Altman interobserver and
      intraobserver comparisons showed good agreement (mean differences in scores of
      0.02, limits of agreement +/-0.12). Trends in TIS were concordant with the
      overall clinical impression of improvement. Scores remained >/=0.6 preceding VAD 
      implantation and peaked at 0.71 3 days after VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: We
      describe a pediatric VAD scoring tool, to assess global patient morbidity and
      clinical recovery. We demonstrate feasibility of using this TIS in a test
      population of inpatients on VAD support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular failure (RVF) is associated with significant
      morbidity after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) surgery. Hemodynamic,
      clinical, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic variables poorly discriminate
      patients at risk of RVF. We examined the utility of 3-dimensional
      echocardiography (3DE) right ventricular (RV) volumetric assessment to identify
      patients at risk for RVF. METHODS AND RESULTS: RVF was defined as the need for
      inotropic infusion for >14 days after LVAD surgery or the need for biventricular 
      assist device support. Preoperative RV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were
      measured, blinded to clinical data, from transthoracic 3DE full volume data sets 
      in 26 patients. Baseline variables and 3DE RV indices were compared between
      patients with and without RVF. Twenty-four patients received continuous-flow
      LVADs, and 2 required biventricular support devices. Ten patients required
      prolonged inotropes after LVAD placement. Baseline characteristics associated
      with RVF included higher right atrial pressure, higher right atrial pressure to
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio, and lower cardiac index and RV stroke
      work index (RVSWI). Echocardiographic indices associated with RVF included 3DE
      indexed RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDVI and RVESVI) and RV
      ejection fraction (RVEF). The relationship between 3DE quantification of RV
      volumes and the development of RVF was independent from RVSWI: RVEDVI: odds ratio
      (OR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.33 (P = .04); RVESVI: OR 1.14, 95%
      CI 1.01-1.28 (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 3DE is a promising method for
      pre-LVAD RV assessment. RV volumes assessed by 3DE are predictive of RVF in LVAD 
      recipients independently from hemodynamic correlates of RV function.

AB  - Although heart transplantation remains the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart
      failure, its epidemiological impact is limited by donor organ availability.
      Surgical and device-based approaches have been introduced with the aim of
      increasing systemic perfusion and in some circumstances promoting left
      ventricular recovery by inducing reverse remodelling. Innovative counterpulsation
      devices based on the established principle of the intra-aortic balloon pump have 
      been developed, and of these, the CardioVad and the C-Pulse System have been
      introduced in clinical practice with convincing evidence of haemodynamic
      efficacy. The evolution from pulsatile to continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      devices has been associated with improved survival rates during the first 2 years
      of support with the potential of matching heart transplantation outcomes.
      However, blood contact with the device remains a significant challenge despite
      the highly sophisticated technology currently available. Innovative
      extra-vascular counterpulsation devices have been shown to overcome the
      limitations of the intra-aortic balloon pump and rend the device suitable for
      prolonged support. Monitoring of the performance of these novel devices is
      essential, and carotid Doppler ultrasonography is of utility in assessing the
      haemodynamic performance of the devices in a clinical setting. Computational
      modelling has played a role in the simulation of these devices and should
      continue to assist with their optimisation and implementation in clinical
      practice.

AB  - Due to shortages in donor organ availability, advanced heart-failure patients are
      at high risk of further decompensation and often death while awaiting
      transplantation. This shortage has led to the development of effective mechanical
      circulatory support (MCS). Currently, various implantable ventricular-assist
      devices (VADs) are able to provide temporary or long-term circulatory support for
      many end-stage heart-failure patients. Implantation of a total artificial heart
      (TAH) currently represents the surgical treatment option for patients requiring
      biventricular MCS as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT).
      However, the clinical applicability of available versions of positive
      displacement pumps is limited by their size and associated complications.
      Application of advanced technology is aimed at solving some of these issues,
      attempting to develop a new generation of smaller and more effective TAHs to suit
      a wider patient population. Particular targets for improvement include
      modifications to the biocompatibility of device designs and materials in order to
      decrease hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. Meanwhile, new systems to 
      power implanted driving units which are fully operational without interruption of
      skin barriers represent a potential means of decreasing the risk of infections.
      In this review, we will discuss the history of the TAH, its development and
      clinical application, the implications of the existing technological solutions,
      published outcomes and the future outlook for TAHs.

TI  - Comparison of continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow left ventricular assist devices:
      is there an advantage to pulsatility?
PG  - 573-81
LID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CFVAD) are currently
      the most widely used type of mechanical circulatory support as
      bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy for end-stage congestive heart
      failure (HF). Compared to the first generation pulsatile-flow left ventricular
      assist devices (PFVADs), CFVADs have demonstrated improved reliability and
      durability. However, CFVADs have also been associated with certain complications 
      thought to be linked with decreased arterial pulsatility. Previous studies
      comparing CFVADs and PFVADs have presented conflicting results. It is important
      to understand the outcome differences between CFVAD and PFVAD in order to further
      advance the current VAD technology. METHODS: In this review, we compared the
      outcomes of CFVADs and PFVADs and examined the need for arterial pulsatility for 
      the future generation of mechanical circulatory support. RESULTS: CVADs offer
      advantages of smaller size, increased reliability and durability, and subsequent 
      improvements in survival. However, with the increasing duration of long-term
      support, it appears that CFVADs may have specific complications and a lower rate 
      of left ventricular recovery associated with diminished pulsatility, increased
      pressure gradients on the aortic valve and decreased compliance in smaller
      arterial vessels. PFVAD support or pulsatility control algorithms in CFVADs could
      be beneficial and potentially necessary for long term support. CONCLUSIONS: Given
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of CFVADs and PFVADs, the ultimate
      solution may lie in incorporating pulsatility into current and emerging CFVADs
      whilst retaining their existing benefits. Future studies examining physiologic
      responses, end-organ function and LV remodeling at varying degrees of pulsatility
      and device support levels are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are becoming an increasingly 
      viable alternative therapy for heart failure, either as a bridge to heart
      transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy (DT). The latter has become
      increasingly popular in recent years, in the face of a donor organ shortage and a
      rise in elderly patients ineligible for heart transplants. For these patients in 
      particular, device durability is a key contributor to survival, morbidity, and
      quality of life. This systematic review aimed to assess the long-term durability 
      of current continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched
      from their dates of inception to August 2014 for original studies reporting on
      patients receiving continuous-flow LVADs. LVAD failure was defined as device
      malfunction necessitating exchange or explantation, or causing patient mortality.
      Pooled averages were calculated for outcomes and rates of device failure were
      reconstructed from digitized graph curves using the software, WebPlotDigitizer
      v3.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective observational studies with a total of 5,471
      patients were included for analysis. The mean duration of LVAD support was 504.7 
      (range, 303-568) days, and the overall weighted incidence of device failure was
      3.9% (range, 1-11.3%). On average, pump thrombosis was the most common cause of
      device failure (50.5%), followed by lead or cable damage (21.7%), mechanical pump
      failure (11.6%), device-related infection (11.1%), and surgical complications
      from implantation (2.5%). Long-term device failure rates at 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 
      24-months post-implantation were 0.5%, 1.8%, 2.9%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: With the expected rise in LVAD usage for end-stage heart failure,
      particularly as a DT, the steady minority of patients experiencing device failure
      is likely to increase. Further investigation is required into the incidence and
      mechanism of major causes of failure, as well as design improvements that may
      address these complications. There is currently a lack of guidelines and large
      randomized studies reporting on the etiology and outcomes of LVAD failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are currently no well-defined, evidence-based guidelines for
      management of end-stage heart failure in patients over 65, and the decisions to
      use mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist device (LVAD),
      either as a bridge to transplantation or destination therapy, or isolated heart
      transplantation (HTx) remain controversial. We aimed to compare the outcomes
      after the implementation of three heart replacement strategies in this high-risk 
      population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients
      between the ages of 65 and 72 receiving a continuous-flow LVAD as bridge to
      transplantation or destination therapy or isolated HTx at our center between 2005
      and 2012. The patients were stratified according to treatment strategy into three
      groups: group D (destination LVAD, n = 23), group B (bridge to transplantation
      LVAD, n = 43), and group H (HTx alone, n = 47). The primary outcomes of interest 
      were survival to discharge and 2-year overall survival. RESULTS: The patients in 
      group D were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of ischemic
      cardiomyopathy, and had a higher pulmonary vascular resistance than did patients 
      in groups B or H. There were no significant differences between groups in
      survival to discharge (87% D vs 83.7% B vs 87.2% H, p = 0.88) or 2-year overall
      survival (75.7% D vs 68.7% B vs 80.9% H, log-rank p = 0.47). The incidence rates 
      of readmission were 1.1 events/patient.year in group D and 0.5
      events/patient.year in group H. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference 
      in perioperative, short-term, and medium-term survival between the treatment
      groups. However, the LVAD patients had a higher incidence of readmission. Larger 
      trials are needed to refine differences in long-term survival, quality of life,
      and resource utilization for elderly patients requiring heart replacement
      therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In obese patients with heart failure, weight reduction may be
      difficult due to physical restrictions, but may be necessary to achieve heart
      transplant candidacy. We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwent
      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile
      (HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and the
      effect on body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) who
      underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for
      weight change. In the 30-day survivors, end points of the study were continued
      LVAD support, heart transplant, or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass
      surgery and was excluded. RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria,
      BMI was 35.6 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 +/- 5.5
      kg/m(2) (mean BMI change -2.5 kg/m(2); P = .063), with a mean follow-up time of
      301.6 +/- 255.5 days. The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9
      kg/m(2) (P = .016 vs baseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1 kg/m(2)
      increase in BMI. BMI <30 kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21%), 5
      of 19 (26%) in XVE group, and 1 of 9 (11%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 
      XVE, 2 HMII) or 50% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was
      4.6 kg/m(2) (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30
      kg/m(2) provided significant weight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in
      recipients of the continuous flow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a
      heart transplant after LVAD insertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6 kg/m(2) (P =
      .003). LVAD implantation provides a period of hemodynamic support for obese
      patients with advanced heart failure, during which time opportunity may be
      available for weight loss. Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater
      weight loss than nonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may
      be necessary to achieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous
      flow LVAD.

LID - 10.7182/pit2014684 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Understanding the experience of caring for an adult with a
      left-ventricular assist device as a destination therapy (LVAD-DT) remains in its 
      infancy. OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: A hermeneutic-phenomenological inquiry guided by van
      Manen's methods was used to explore the LVAD-DT family caregiving
      experience.Participants/Setting-Seven family caregivers (1 man and 6 women) 50 to
      74 years old who cared for an adult with an LVAD-DT in home settings. Recruitment
      and data collection occurred in an outpatient mechanical circulatory support
      center in the Midwest. METHODS: Data were collected by means of face-to-face
      interviews using open-ended questions and 1 follow-up interview. Interviews were 
      audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis consisted of writing, 
      rewriting, and reflecting across participants' data, which produced themes
      illustrating the experience and meaning of caring for an adult with an LVAD-DT.
      Themes were consensually validated. Procedures for trustworthiness are described.
      RESULTS: Five main themes were identified from participants' experiences: (1)
      advanced heart failure is a life-changing event, (2) self-doubt about LVAD
      caregiving improves over time, (3) lifestyle adjustments come with time, (4)
      persistent worry and stress, and (5) caregiving is not a burden-it's a part of
      life. These main themes were elucidated by 8 subthemes in which participants
      described a process of adjustment despite persistent worry and stress and
      eventually accepted caregiving as part of their lives. Future studies are needed 
      to explore caregiver burden, adaptation, and the effects of caregiving outcomes, 
      such as emotional and physical health and overall quality of life.

TI  - Post-heart transplantation outcome of HeartMate II-bridged recipients requiring
      unplanned concomitant temporary right ventricular mechanical support.
PG  - 372-8
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivu408 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Second-generation axial-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) 
      have become an established therapy in bridging end-stage heart failure patients
      to cardiac transplantation. Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,
      some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We 
      sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II
      (HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure 
      and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD. METHODS:
      This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patients transplanted during 
      2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were divided into two groups
      according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) or required
      additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were compared for
      early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major early
      post-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival. RESULTS: Early graft
      loss was 10.7% in isolated HMII and 25% in HMII + RVAD patients (P = 0.26). There
      were no observed differences in the rates of primary graft dysfunction (7.3 vs
      0%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25%, P =
      0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary artery resistance (odds ratio: 3.286,
      95% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant
      predictor for adverse outcome of mechanically-bridged heart transplant
      recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 +/- 5% in isolated HMII and 75 
      +/- 15% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate
      that heart transplant recipients who required unplanned RV mechanical support
      after LVAD implantation achieved comparable rates of early graft loss,
      post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged
      with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-year graft survival was
      equivalent between those two groups. Given the small sample size, further studies
      involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.

AB  - Continuous-flow (CF) left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become the
      standard of care for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to optimal
      medical therapy. The goal of this study was to review our 7 year single
      institutional experience with CF LVADs. Mean age was 50.4 + 12.5 (17-69) years
      for bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) patients and 57.6 + 10.4 (31-81) years for
      destination therapy (DT) patients (p < 0.001). Overall, 38 patients (26%) were
      female and 58 (41%) were African American. Etiology of heart failure was ischemic
      in 54 patients (37%) and nonischemic in 93 patients (63%). Overall survival at 30
      days, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years was 93%, 89%, 84%, and 81%, respectively. 
      Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) was the most common complication (24%), followed 
      by stroke (18%), right ventricular (RV) failure (18%), ventilator-dependent
      respiratory failure (10%), reoperation for bleeding (10%), and driveline
      infection (9%). These data demonstrate excellent survival with low mortality for 
      both BTT and DT patients on long-term LVAD support. However, for LVAD therapy to 
      become the gold standard for long-term treatment of end-stage heart failure and a
      plausible alternative to heart transplantation, we need to continue to improve
      the incidence of frequent postoperative complications, such as RV failure,
      driveline infections, strokes, and GIB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare left ventricular assist device (HVAD; HeartWare Inc,
      Framingham, MA) was first implanted in Canada in 2010. We performed a multicentre
      analysis of the real world outcomes associated with its use. METHODS: Between May
      2010 and January 2013, 4 Canadian centres inserted a total of 72 HVADs in 71
      patients. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively for the 
      1-year estimate of the principal outcome of transplant, explant for recovery, or 
      death in patients who had a bridge to transplantation indication. Adverse event
      rates were estimated as events per patient-year (PPY). RESULTS: In the 67
      patients who received the HVAD with the indication of bridge to transplant, 26
      (38.8%) received a successful transplant, 2 (3%) received an explant for
      recovery, and 10 (14.9%) patients died during support. Median follow-up time with
      the HVAD was 6.9 months (range, 2 days to 30.4 months). Despite having 74% of the
      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 
      (INTERMACS) scores of level 1 and 2 at the time of implantation, the rate
      estimate for survival at 1 year was 86.3% (95% confidence interval, 76.7-93.3).
      With 48.2 total patient years of support, the rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic
      strokes were 0.21 and 0.19 events PPY, respectively. Women made up 40% of the
      cohort and an adverse neurologic event occurred with an event rate of 0.38 PPY in
      women. CONCLUSIONS: The HVAD adequately supports acutely ill heart failure
      patients until the time of transplant or recovery. A high incidence of adverse
      neurologic outcomes might be related to the large percentage of female patients, 
      the high INTERMACS levels, or unknown factors; further surveillance is required.

      a total of 248 transplantation procedures were carried out, bringing the time
      series to a total of 7023 transplantations. The temporal analysis confirms a
      significant deterioration in the clinical profile of the recipients (higher
      percentage of older patients, severe renal failure, insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus, previous heart surgery, mechanical ventilation), of the donors (higher 
      proportion of older donors and greater weight mismatch), and of the procedure
      (higher percentage of emergency transplantations which, in 2013, reached 49%, and
      with ischemia times > 240min). There was a marked increase in the use of
      circulatory assist devices prior to transplantation which, in 2013, were employed
      in 25.2% of all the patients. The survivals at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 76%,
      65%, 52%, and 37%, respectively, and have remained stable since 1995.
      CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation activity in Spain remains stable in recent
      years, with around 250 procedures a year. Despite the clear deterioration in the 
      clinical characteristics of the donors and recipients, and lengthening of the
      operative times, the results in terms of mortality continue to be comparable to
      those reported in our neighboring countries, and a growing use of circulatory
      assist devices prior to transplantation is confirmed.

AB  - The discrepancy between the number of patients on the waiting list and available 
      donor hearts has led to the successful development of left ventricular assist
      devices (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation. The conventional LVADs are
      designed to provide full hemodynamic support for the end-stage failing heart.
      However, full-support LVAD implantation requires major surgery, sternotomy and
      cardiopulmonary bypass in majority of cases. The Synergy Micro-pump is the
      smallest implantable LVAD and provides partial flow support up to 3 l/min. It was
      shown that early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits
      to patients with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support
      LVAD. Due the small dimensions it can be implanted without cardiopulmonary bypass
      or a sternotomy. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical use of the
      Synergy Micro-pump as partial hemodynamic support.

AB  - Advanced heart failure is an increasing problem worldwide. Nowadays, mechanical
      circulatory support devices (MSCD) are an established therapeutic option for
      terminal heart failure after exhaustion of medical and conventional surgical
      treatment, and are becoming a realistic alternative to heart transplantation
      (HTX). There are a number of different treatment options for these patients, such
      as bridge to transplantation (BTT), bridge to candidacy (BTC), bridge to recovery
      (BTR) and the destination therapy (DT) option. The latter option has become more 
      frequent throughout the last years, due to a donor organ shortage and an
      increasing number of older patients with terminal heart failure who are not
      eligible for HTX. These factors have led to a rapidly increasing number of LVAD
      implantations as well as centers which perform these procedures. This has also
      been due to improved LVAD survival rates and quality of life following the
      introduction of smaller, intrapericardial and more durable continuous flow left
      ventricular devices. The most common complications for these patients are
      device-related problems, such as coagulation disorders, gastrointestinal
      bleeding, device related infection, pump thrombosis or cerebrovascular accidents.
      However, some questions still remain unanswered or under debate, such as the
      exact time-point for LVAD implantation. In addition, aspects such as better
      biocompatibility for LVADs remain a major challenge. This review will concentrate
      on DT for terminal heart failure and provide an overview of the current evidence 
      for LVAD implantation in this patient group, with particular emphasis on
      indication and time-point of implantation, choice of LVADs, and long term
      outcomes and quality of life.

AB  - There is no reliable published data on the overall prevalence or incidence of
      heart failure (HF) in children. However, the success of mechanical circulatory
      support (MCS) in management of HF has raised the prospect of a previously
      unavailable treatment modality. Orthotopic heart transplant (OHTx) remains the
      gold standard treatment, but the number of patients requiring this treatment far 
      outweighs the donor availability. It is therefore not surprising to see the
      popularity of various MCS modalities, with different devices ranging from
      veno-arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) to ventricular
      assist devices (VADs), which are either para-corporeal or intra-corporeal, with
      pulsatile or continuous flow. Indication, timing and the choice of the type of
      mechanical support are crucial so in order to avoid potential lethal
      complications such as hemorrhage, thrombo-embolism and infections. In the
      pediatric population, MCS is used mainly as bridge to transplantation but can be 
      used as bridge to recovery in patients with acute myocarditis or following
      open-heart surgery. Active research is currently underway to develop newer and
      more durable devices that will assist the pediatric population across all age
      groups. This research will support different pathologies that have lower
      incidences of major morbidities, particularly as greater durations of MCS are
      expected due to a paucity of donors for OHTx. The combined experience developed
      through the usage of different devices in pediatric and adult populations has led
      to the to the application of MCS in some subgroups of grown-up congenital heart
      diseases (CHDs) patients, particularly those with systemic right ventricular
      failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly being used
      to treat patients in end-stage heart failure (HF) as bridge-to-transplantation,
      lifetime support or destination therapy. However, the importance of this newer
      technique for chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still 
      open to discussion. To date, there are few studies that extensively explore the
      psychological and cognitive profiles of patient with ventricular assist devices
      (VADs). METHODS: We studied the psychological aspects, quality of life (QOL) and 
      cognitive profiles of 19 patients with HF before VAD implantation and then at
      two, five and 16 months post-implantation. RESULTS: Our results showed that after
      VAD implantation, patients did not show any psychopathological problems such as
      anxiety and/or depression. More interestingly, despite the constant risk of
      neurological events determined by the continuous-blood-flow pump (CBFP),
      patients' cognitive functioning did not worsen. In fact, significant enhancements
      were observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and cognitive deficits are
      common in advanced HF and often worsen over time. Appropriately designed and
      randomized studies are needed to demonstrate whether earlier VAD implantation is 
      warranted to arrest cognitive decline and encourage better post-implantation
      adaptation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential for myocardial reconditioning and device explantation
      after long-term continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support
      presents an opportunity to delay or avoid transplantation in select patients.
      METHODS: Thirty of 657 patients with end-stage heart failure supported with
      continuous-flow LVADs were assessed for device explantation. Each patient
      underwent an individualized process of weaning focused on principles of
      ventricular unloading, gradual reconditioning, and transition to medical therapy.
      RESULTS: After varying reconditioning periods, 27 patients (16 men, 11 women;
      age, 39 +/- 12 years) underwent LVAD explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman;
      age, 22 +/- 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. The
      duration of LVAD support was 533 +/- 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for the
      explant cohort and 1,097 +/- 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explant
      cohort. The LV end-diastolic dimension, LV ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary 
      artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort were
      significantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). Two late deaths occurred 
      after LVAD explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1
      patient required resumption of LVAD support 2.7 years after device removal. The
      remaining explant patients remain in New York Heart Association classes I to II
      with medical management alone (mean survival post-explant, 1,172 +/- 948 days).
      The 3 candidates who could not be weaned ultimately underwent transplantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: The potential for recovery of native LV function after long-term
      continuous-flow LVAD support should encourage a more aggressive approach to
      ventricular reconditioning with the goal of device explantation and a return to
      medical management, particularly in young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Does pulsatility matter in the era of continuous-flow blood pumps?
LID - S1053-2498(14)01347-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.09.012 [doi]
AB  - Despite significant improved survival with continuous flow left ventricular
      assist devices (LVADs), complications related to aortic valve insufficiency,
      gastrointestinal bleeding, stroke, pump thrombosis, and hemolysis have dampened
      the long term success of these pumps. Evolution has favored a pulsatile heart
      pump to be able to deliver the maximum flow at different levels of systemic
      vascular resistance, confer kinetic energy to the flow of blood past areas of
      stenosis and generate low shear stress on blood elements. In this perspective, we
      suggest that lack of pulsatility may be one factor that has limited the success
      of continuous flow LVADs and suggest that research needs to focus on methods to
      generate pulsatility either by the native heart or by various speed modulation
      algorithms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with the HeartMate II 
      (HMII) left ventricular assist device (LVAD), but the impact of AF on clinical
      outcomes is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of
      AF on outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD. METHODS: Records of 106 patients
      who underwent HMII implantation at a single center were reviewed. The
      associations of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and persistent atrial
      fibrillation (PeAF) with survival, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, bleeding, 
      and thromboembolism were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox
      proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 56.6 +/- 11.4 years, 87.7%
      of the implants were intended as a bridge to transplantation, and median length
      of support was 217 days (range: 1 to 952 days). AF was present in 55 patients
      (51.9%); 36 patients (34.0%) had PAF and 19 (17.9%) had PeAF. Twenty-one patients
      (19.8%) died, and 18 (17.0%) were hospitalized for HF. There were 0.75 major
      bleeding events and 0.28 thromboembolic events per patient year of follow-up. PAF
      was not associated with increased mortality, HF hospitalization, bleeding, or
      thromboembolism. PeAF, however, was an independent predictor of the composite
      endpoint of death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 3.54; 95% confidence
      interval: 1.52 to 8.25; p < 0.01). Although there was no increase in bleeding or 
      thromboembolism, patients with AF had thromboembolic events at higher
      international normalized ratios (INRs). CONCLUSIONS: Although PAF is not
      associated with worse outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD, PeAF may be
      associated with increased mortality and HF hospitalization. Patients with AF also
      may have thromboembolic events at higher INR levels.

TI  - Polymeric heart valves for surgical implantation, catheter-based technologies and
      heart assist devices.
PG  - 6-25
AB  - Efficient function and long-term durability without the need for anticoagulation,
      coupled with the ability to be accommodated in many different types of patient,
      are the principal requirements of replacement heart valves. Although the clinical
      use of valves appeared to have remained steady for several decades, the evolving 
      demands for the elderly and frail patients typically encountered in the developed
      world, and the needs of much younger and poorer rheumatic heart disease patients 
      in the developing world have now necessitated new paradigms for heart valve
      technologies and associated materials. This includes further consideration of
      durable elastomeric materials. The use of polymers to produce flexible leaflet
      valves that have the benefits of current commercial bioprosthetic and mechanical 
      valves without any of their deficiencies has been held desirable since the mid
      1950s. Much attention has been focused on thermoplastic polyurethanes in view of 
      their generally good physico-chemical properties and versatility in processing,
      coupled with the improving biocompatibility and stability of recent formulations.
      Accelerated in vitro durability of between 600 and 1000 million cycles has been
      achieved using polycarbonate urethanes, and good resistance to degradation,
      calcification and thrombosis in vivo has been shown with some polysiloxane-based 
      polyurethanes. Nevertheless, polymeric valves have remained relegated to use in
      temporary ventricular assist devices for bridging heart failure patients to
      transplantation. Some recent studies suggest that there is a greater degree of
      instability in thermoplastic materials than hitherto believed so that significant
      challenges remain in the search for the combination of durability and
      biocompatibility that would allow polymeric valves to become a clinical reality
      for surgical implantation. Perhaps more importantly, they could become candidates
      for use in situations where minimally invasive transcatheter procedures are used 
      to replace diseased valves. Being amenable to relatively inexpensive mass
      production techniques, the attainment of this goal could benefit very large
      numbers of patients in developing and emerging countries who currently have no
      access to treatment for rheumatic heart disease that is so prevalent in these
      areas. This review discusses the evolution and current status of polymeric valves
      in wide-ranging circumstances.

TI  - Durable ventricular assist device support for failing systemic morphologic right 
      ventricle: early results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The systemic morphologic right ventricle (RV) in congenitally
      corrected transposition of the great arteries or after atrial switch for
      transposition of the great arteries is associated with late ventricular failure. 
      Although the role of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in supporting the 
      failing LV is established, the indications and outcomes of using LVAD in a
      systemic RV remain unclear. We assessed the role of a third-generation LVAD for
      systemic RV support. METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 36 years) received the
      HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) VAD for systemic RV
      failure (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries in 1 and
      after atrial switch in 6). Four patients (57%) had severe subpulmonic LV failure,
      and aggressive perioperative diuresis with or without hemofiltration was used to 
      offload the subpulmonic LV. The indications of VAD were (1) bridge to transplant 
      in 3 and (2) bridge to decision for a high transpulmonary gradient in 4.
      Transplantation outcome was compared with systemic RV failure without VAD bridge 
      in 19 patients (years 1989 to 2013). RESULTS: Systemic RV support alone was
      achieved in all patients, with no early deaths (</=30 days). Overall, 6 (86%)
      returned home, 3 (44%) received a transplant, 2 (28%) died of noncardiac causes, 
      and 2 (28%) continue on VAD support (median support, 232 days). Repeat
      catheterization (n = 4) showed an improved median transpulmonary gradient in 3
      patients (median 18.5 mm Hg pre-VAD vs 8.0 mm Hg post-VAD). Two
      bridge-to-decision patients received transplants at 640 and 685 days. The stroke 
      rate on VAD support was 43% (2 thromboembolic and 1 hemorrhagic; 3 with
      satisfactory recovery). De novo aortic regurgitation was 29% (n = 2; 1 valve
      replacement). All patients (n = 3) survived transplantation (vs 10.5% early
      mortality without VAD bridge; p = 1.00) and were well at follow-up (range, 53 to 
      700 days). CONCLUSIONS: The third-generation VAD provides durable support for
      systemic RV failure as a bridge to transplant and as a strategy to reduce
      pulmonary vascular resistance. Although concomitant subpulmonic LV failure is
      common, systemic RV support alone was achieved in all patients.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices have become standard therapy for patients with
      advanced heart failure either as a bridge to transplantation or destination
      therapy. Despite the functional and biologic evidence of reverse cardiac
      remodeling, few patients actually proceed to myocardial recovery, and even fewer 
      to the point of having their device explanted. An enhanced understanding of the
      biology and care of the mechanically supported patient has redirected focus on
      the possibility of using ventricular assist devices as a bridge to myocardial
      recovery and removal. Herein, we review the current issues and approaches to
      transforming myocardial recovery to a practical reality.
