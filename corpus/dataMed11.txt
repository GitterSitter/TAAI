TI  - Manipulation of SR Ca -release in heart failure through mechanical intervention.
LID - 10.1113/JP270446 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) were developed as a means of temporary
      circulatory support, but the mechanical unloading they offer also results in
      significant reverse remodeling. In selected patients, these improvements are
      sufficient to allow ultimate device explantation without requiring
      transplantation; this represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of
      heart failure. Like heart failure itself, LVADs influence multiple biological
      systems. The transverse tubules are a system of membrane invaginations in
      ventricular cardiomyocytes which allow rapid propagation of the action potential 
      throughout the cell. Through their dense concentration of L-type Ca2+ channels in
      close proximity with intracellular Ryanodine receptors, the t-tubules enable
      synchronous Ca2+ release throughout the cell. The t-tubules' structure appears to
      be specifically regulated by mechanical load, such that either the overload of
      heart failure (or the spontaneously hypertensive rat model (Song et al., 2006))
      or the profound unloading in a chronically unloaded heart result in impaired
      t-tubule structure, with ineffective Ca2+ release. While there are multiple
      molecular pathways which underpin t-tubule regulation, Tcap appears to be
      important in regulating the effect of altered loading on the t-tubule system.

TI  - Lung Procurement from a Donor on ECMO Support.
AB  - We report the case of a 50 year-old man with congestive heart failure who became 
      a candidate for organ donation following anoxic brain injury after CPR who was on
      a Veno-Arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (VA ECMO). On
      visualization the donor's lung was acceptable for lung transplantation to a 68
      year-old male patient with a chronic history of pulmonary fibrosis. Right single 
      lung implantation was successfully performed in the recipient. We herein report a
      case that highlights our institution's result suggesting that the use of a lung
      previously on ECMO support can safely and potentially expand the donor lung pool 
      in carefully selected patients.

TI  - Advanced Strategies for End-Stage Heart Failure: Combining Regenerative
      Approaches with LVAD, a New Horizon?
PG  - 10
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010 [doi]
AB  - Despite the improved treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the population with
      end-stage heart failure (HF) is progressively growing. The scarcity of the gold
      standard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.
      For patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been of
      great benefit on survival. To allow explantation of the assist device and obviate
      heart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.
      However, explant rates so far are low. Combining mechanical circulatory support
      with regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might 
      give rise to improved long-term results. Although synergistic effects are
      suggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in both
      preclinical and clinical setting is lacking. This review focuses on advanced and 
      innovative strategies for the treatment of end-stage HF and furthermore appraises
      clinical experience with combined strategies.

      device patients.
PG  - 124-30
LID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509 [doi]
AB  - Nonischemic cardiomyopathy can complicate antineoplastic therapy and lead to
      irreversible heart failure. We evaluated structural changes at the time of left
      ventricular assist device implantation in heart failure patients who had been
      exposed to anthracycline, and we correlated those changes with clinical
      presentation. We retrospectively studied left ventricular core samples taken at
      implantation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device in 12 heart
      failure patients (mean age, 46 +/- 16 yr) who had histories of anthracycline
      exposure. We evaluated those samples for hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and fibrosis.
      Histopathologic findings showed moderate-to-severe myocyte hypertrophy, moderate 
      myocytolysis, and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis with areas of
      replacement fibrosis. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked decreases in
      myofibrils, diffuse mitochondrial swelling, and disorganization of the
      sarcoplasmic reticulum. The interval between anthracycline therapy and heart
      failure was a mean of 6.8 +/- 5.7 years; duration of heart failure symptoms, 38
      +/- 47 months; and duration of device support, 414 +/- 266 days. Four patients
      are continuing on device support, 3 have undergone transplantation, 3 have
      undergone device explantation, and 2 have died. The time of heart failure onset
      and the duration of symptoms did not correlate with the severity and extent of
      the histopathologic changes. The histopathologic findings and the clinical course
      varied in heart failure patients with anthracycline exposure. No correlation was 
      observed between anthracycline therapy and the development or duration of heart
      failure symptoms, severity of histopathologic changes, or outcomes.

TI  - Use of HeartWare Ventricular Assist System for Systemic Ventricular Support of a 
      Pediatric Patient After Mustard Procedure.
PG  - 339-41
LID - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System is indicated to provide
      mechanical circulatory support of patients with intractable heart failure as a
      bridge to cardiac transplantation. We describe the use of this device to support 
      the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York Heart
      Association class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustard
      procedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. CASE REPORT: A
      HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a
      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema
      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and
      pulmonary edema. RESULTS: The patient's edema and acute kidney injury resolved
      after device placement. She was discharged home and successfully underwent device
      removal with heart transplant five months later. CONCLUSION: The HeartWare device
      may be used for extended support as a systemic RV in a pediatric patient. It is
      feasible to consider using the device in this patient population.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Comparison of Pediatric and Adult Reverse Remodeling With 
      Ventricular Assist Devices.
LID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist device (VAD) support induces reverse remodeling of failing
      myocardium that leads to occasional functional recovery of the adult heart. While
      there have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage
      cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has
      increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the 
      setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardium
      also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to
      its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets 
      of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to
      summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery
      following VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric
      myocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients.
      Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions of
      their cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of information
      about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to
      determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or
      just recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult gene
      expression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40% of genes to be
      oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.
      These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling 
      specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical
      strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.

TI  - Pediatric Quality of Life while Supported with a Ventricular Assist Device.
LID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have emerged as an important
      treatment option for bridging pediatric patients with heart failure to
      transplant. VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of 
      life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of our
      pediatric patients while supported with a VAD. DESIGN: In this prospective study,
      pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement, and their parents, were
      administered a generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD
      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then
      periodically until heart transplant or death. Their final scores while on support
      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,
      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.
      RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VAD
      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was 
      10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.
      Eleven (85%) patients survived to transplant with one (8%) patient remaining
      alive on support. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was 
      1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total
      and physical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups.
      Self-reported psychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy
      controls only. Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all
      three comparison groups for all three categories (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A large 
      deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patients supported by a VAD compared
      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant
      patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group with more severe heart
      failure. Improvements in QoL must be made, as time spent with a VAD will likely
      continue to increase.

TI  - A single German center experience with intermittent inotropes for patients on the
      high-urgent heart transplant waiting list.
AB  - AIM: Currently, more than 900 patients with end-stage heart failure are listed
      for heart transplantation in Germany. All patients on the Eurotransplant
      high-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be
      relisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated with
      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospective
      analysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated with
      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 117
      consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure 
      unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 %) were stabilized and
      delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),
      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,
      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient's specific characteristics. 
      After initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as
      possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a
      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 %
      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary
      due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 %) needed a left- or
      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 %) died while waiting and 87 (84 %) 
      received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. Cumulative 3 and 12 months
      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 %, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to
      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These data provide the
      basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropes in patients

TI  - Imaging in patients after cardiac transplantation and in patients with
      ventricular assist devices.
AB  - The field of cardiac imaging and the management of patients with severe heart
      failure have advanced substantially during the past 10 years. Cardiac
      transplantation offers the best long-term survival with high quality of life for 
      the patients with end stage heart failure. However, acute cardiac rejection and
      cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) can occur post cardiac transplantation and
      these problems necessitate regular surveillance. The short-term success of
      mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD), such as ventricular assist devices
      (VADs), in improving survival and quality of life has led to a dramatic growth of
      the patient population with these devices. The development of optimal imaging
      techniques and algorithms to evaluate these advanced heart failure patients is
      evolving and multimodality non-invasive imaging approaches and invasive
      techniques are commonly employed. Most of the published studies done in the
      transplant and VAD population are small, and biased based on the strength of the 
      particular program, and there is a relative lack of published protocols to
      evaluate these patient groups. Moreover, the techniques of echocardiography,
      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear cardiology have
      all progressed rapidly in recent years. There is thus a knowledge gap for
      cardiologists, radiologists, and clinicians, especially regarding surveillance
      for CAV and ideal imaging approaches for patients with VADs. The purpose of this 
      review article is to provide an overview of different noninvasive imaging
      modalities used to evaluate patients after cardiac transplantation and for
      patients with VADs. The review focuses on the role of echocardiography, CT, and
      nuclear imaging in surveillance for CAV and rejection and on the assessment of
      ventricular structure and function, myocardial remodeling and complications for
      VAD patients.

TI  - Regional differences in use and outcomes of left ventricular assist devices:
      Insights from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
      Support Registry.
LID - S1053-2498(15)00009-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2015.01.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined whether characteristics, implant strategy, and outcomes
      in patients who receive continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD)
      differ across geographic regions in the United States. METHODS: A total of 7,404 
      CF-LVAD patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) from 134 participating institutions were analyzed
      from 4 distinct regions: Northeast, 2,605 (35%); Midwest, 2,210 (30%); West, 973 
      (13%); and South, 1,616 (22%). RESULTS: At baseline, patients in the Northeast
      and South were more likely to have INTERMACS risk profiles 1 and 2. A
      bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy was more common in the Northeast (31.7%;
      West, 18.5%; South, 26.9%; Midwest, 25.5%; p < 0.0001). In contrast, destination 
      therapy (DT) was more likely in the South (40.6%; Northeast, 32.3%; Midwest,
      27.3%; West, 27.3%; p < 0.0001). Although all regions showed a high 1-year
      survival rate, some regional differences in long-term mortality were observed.
      Notably, survival beyond 1 year after LVAD implant was significantly lower in the
      South. However, when stratified by device strategy, no significant differences in
      survival for BTT or DT patients were found among the regions. Finally, with the
      exception of right ventricular failure, which was more common in the South, no
      other significant differences in causes of death were observed among the regions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in clinical profile and LVAD strategy exist in 
      the United States. Despite an overall high survival rate at 1 year, differences
      in mortality among the regions were noted. The lower survival rate in the South
      may be attributed to patient characteristics and higher use of LVAD as DT.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support nowadays represents an important option in the
      treatment of patients with advanced heart insufficiency. Once developed as a
      bridging to heart transplantation, it is now a valuable option for permanent
      support in patients for whom a heart transplantation is not possible due to
      contraindications or a lack of available organs. Furthermore, it can be used as a
      bridging to myocardial recovery and explantation. The number of implantations of 
      left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) has clearly increased in recent years and 
      approximately one half of these implantations is already carried out in centers
      not specialized in transplantations. This development necessitates that every
      practicing physician is aware of the basic principles of mechanical circulatory
      support and with the possible complications. This article gives a summary of the 
      current state of the technology and treatment of patients with long-term VADs.

TI  - Simulation of Ventricular, Cavo-Pulmonary, and Biventricular Ventricular Assist
      Devices in Failing Fontan.
LID - 10.1111/aor.12434 [doi]
AB  - Considering the lack of donors, ventricular assist devices (VADs) could be an
      alternative to heart transplantation for failing Fontan patients, in spite of the
      lack of experience and the complex anatomy and physiopathology of these patients.
      Considering the high number of variables that play an important role such as type
      of Fontan failure, type of VAD connection, and setting (right VAD [RVAD], left
      VAD [LVAD], or biventricular VAD [BIVAD]), a numerical model could be useful to
      support clinical decisions. The aim of this article is to develop and test a
      lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system simulating and comparing the 
      VAD effects on failing Fontan. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data of 10
      Fontan patients were used to simulate the baseline patients' condition using a
      dedicated lumped parameter model. Starting from the simulated baseline and for
      each patient, a systolic dysfunction, a diastolic dysfunction, and an increment
      of the pulmonary vascular resistance were simulated. Then, for each patient and
      for each pathology, the RVAD, LVAD, and BIVAD implantations were simulated. The
      model can reproduce patients' baseline well. In the case of systolic dysfunction,
      the LVAD unloads the single ventricle and increases the cardiac output (CO) (35%)
      and the arterial systemic pressure (Pas) (25%). With RVAD, a decrement of
      inferior vena cava pressure (Pvci) (39%) was observed with 34% increment of CO,
      but an increment of the single ventricle external work (SVEW). With the BIVAD, an
      increment of Pas (29%) and CO (37%) was observed. In the case of diastolic
      dysfunction, the LVAD increases CO (42%) and the RVAD decreases the Pvci, while
      both increase the SVEW. In the case of pulmonary vascular resistance increment,
      the highest CO (50%) and Pas (28%) increment is obtained with an RVAD with the
      highest decrement of Pvci (53%) and an increment of the SVEW but with the lowest 
      VAD power consumption. The use of numerical models could be helpful in this
      innovative field to evaluate the effect of VAD implantation on Fontan patients to
      support patient and VAD type selection personalizing the assistance.

      newly established assist device program at Semmelweis University].
PG  - 521-7
LID - 10.1556/OH.2015.30115 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the first heart
      transplantation in Hungary in 2012 the emerging need for modern heart failure
      management via mechanical circulatory support has evolved. In May 2012 the
      opening of a new heart failure and transplant unit with 9 beds together with the 
      procurement of necessary devices at Semmelweis University accomplished this need.
      AIM: The aim of the authors was to report their initial experience obtained in
      this new cardiac assist device program. METHOD: Since May, 2012, mechanical
      circulatory support system was applied in 89 cases in 72 patients. Indication for
      support were end stage heart failure refractory to medical treatment and acute
      left or right heart failure. RESULTS: Treatment was initiated for acute graft
      failure after heart transplantation in 27 cases, for end stage heart failure in
      24 cases, for acute myocardial infarction in 21 cases, for acute postcardiotomy
      heart failure in 14 cases, for severe respiratory insufficiency in 2 cases and
      for drug intoxication in one case. Among the 30 survivor of the whole program 13 
      patients were successfully transplanted. CONCLUSIONS: The available devices can
      cover all modalities of current bridge therapy from short term support through
      medium support to heart transplantation or long term support and destination
      therapy. These conditions made possible the successful start of a new cardiac
      assist device program.

TI  - Clinical outcomes in sensitized heart transplant patients bridged with
      ventricular assist devices.
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to transplant
      (BTT) have been known to cause allosensitization, as measured by panel-reactive
      antibody (PRA) levels. The goal of this study was to measure the impact of this
      allosensitization on outcomes. METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed
      in BTT patients, with sensitization defined as peak PRAs >/= 10%. Baseline
      characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using
      descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. RESULTS:
      Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21
      non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47% vs. 10%, p = 
      0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular
      rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).
      Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection
      (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier
      log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of 
      infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION:
      Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. This mortality
      appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the
      development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.

AB  - Noncardiac operations are being increasingly performed on patients with left
      ventricular assist devices (LVADs). However, little is known on the impact of
      continuous-flow LVADs on the vascular supply of the colon for anastomoses. In
      this case, a 67-year-old male supported on an LVAD underwent four successful
      noncardiac operations including two intestinal anastomoses; left colon and small 
      bowel anastomosis. To the best of our knowledge, no existing literature has
      reported successful colonic anastomosis on a continuous-flow LVAD. This case
      illustrates the plausibility of performing colonic anastomoses with appropriately
      selected patients supported on an LVAD. A 67-year-old male with congestive heart 
      failure underwent LVAD placement for decompensated heart failure while awaiting
      orthotopic transplantation. During his recovery, he developed a stage IV sacral
      decubitus ulcer which required a sigmoid loop colostomy placement and a
      rotational flap. Subsequent stoma closure with partial sigmoid colectomy and
      stapled anastomosis was performed, and healed without evidence of anastomotic
      leak. This case illustrates the potential for colonic anastomoses for patients on
      continuous-flow LVAD support. Although oxygenation is known to be an important
      aspect of healing, this patient's outcome suggests that intestinal anastomoses
      can be performed on the induced pulseless environment of an LVAD. Further studies
      will be needed to further elucidate the success of longer segment resections and 
      appropriate surgical candidates.

AB  - The goal of this study was to assess outcomes of patients who underwent
      implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) at nontransplantation
      mechanical circulatory support centers. As the availability of LVADs for advanced
      heart failure has expanded to nontransplantation mechanical circulatory support
      centers, concerns have been expressed about maintaining good outcomes.
      Demographics and outcomes were evaluated in 276 patients with advanced heart
      failure who underwent implantation of LVADs as bridge to transplantation or
      destination therapy at 27 open-heart centers. Baseline characteristics, operative
      mortality, length of stay, readmission rate, adverse events, quality of life, and
      survival were analyzed. The overall 30-day mortality was 3% (8 of 276), and
      survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were 92 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 3%, 
      and 84 +/- 4% for the bridge-to-transplantation group and 81 +/- 3%, 70 +/- 5%,
      and 63 +/- 6% for the destination therapy group, comparable with results
      published by the national Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS). The median length of stay for all patients was
      21 days. Bleeding was the most frequent adverse event. Stroke occurred in 4%
      (bridge to transplantation) and 6% (destination therapy) of patients.
      Quality-of-life measures and 6-minute walk distances showed sustained
      improvements throughout support. In conclusion, outcomes with LVAD support at
      open-heart centers are acceptable and comparable with results from the INTERMACS 
      registry. With appropriate teams, training, center commitment, and certification,
      LVAD therapy is being disseminated in a responsible way to open-heart centers.

TI  - The Heartmate Risk Score Predicts Morbidity and Mortality in Unselected Left
      Ventricular Assist Device Recipients and Risk Stratifies INTERMACS Class 1
      Patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the Heartmate Risk Score (HMRS) and its
      potential benefits in clinical practice. BACKGROUND: The HMRS has been shown to
      correlate with mortality in the cohort of patients enrolled in the Heartmate II
      trials, but its validity in unselected, "real world" populations remains unclear.
      METHODS: This study identified a cohort of 269 consecutive patients who received 
      a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device at our institution, the
      Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, between June 2005 and June 2013.
      Ninety-day and 2-year mortality rates, as well as frequency of several morbid
      events, were compared by retrospectively assigned HMRS category groups. The
      analysis was repeated within the subgroup of INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for 
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) class 1 patients. RESULTS: Receiver
      operating curve analysis showed that the HMRS correlated with 90-day mortality
      with an area under the curve of 0.70. Stratification in low, mid, and high HMRS
      groups identified patients with increasing hazard of 90-day mortality, increasing
      long-term mortality, increasing rate of gastrointestinal bleeding events, and
      increasing median number of days spent in the hospital in the first year post
      implant. Within INTERMACS class 1 patients, those in the highest HMRS group were 
      found to have a relative risk of 90-day mortality 5.7 times higher than those in 
      the lowest HMRS group (39.1% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: HMRS is a valid
      clinical tool to stratify risk of morbidity and mortality after implant of
      Heartmate II devices in unselected patients and can be used to predict short-term
      mortality risk in INTERMACS class 1 patients.

LID - S2213-1779(15)00063-3 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the relationship between anti-factor Xa
      (anti-FXa) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) for monitoring
      intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV-UFH) in patients with continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs). BACKGROUND: CF-LVADs have become
      mainstream therapy for patients with advanced heart failure. Thromboembolic
      events, device thrombosis, and bleeding continue to be a challenge with this
      technology. Adequate anticoagulation is required to prevent these adverse events.
      METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive patients implanted with a CF-LVAD was
      conducted. Paired samples were considered concordant if aPTT values fell into
      expected ranges for subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic anti-FXa
      levels. Heparin dosing was on the basis of anti-Xa levels. RESULTS: A total of
      340 paired values from 38 patients were evaluated. Anti-FXa and aPTT were
      discordant in 253 samples (74.4%), with a high degree of variability in aPTT for 
      any given anti-FXa level (r(2) = 0.57). Results were discordant in 104 samples
      (63.8%) from patients undergoing bridging therapy with warfarin and in 149
      samples (84.2%) from patients with device obstruction and/or hemolysis (p <
      0.001). The most common pattern of discordance was a supratherapeutic aPTT value 
      despite a therapeutic anti-FXa level (49.1% for bridging vs. 75.8% for device
      obstruction and/or hemolysis; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of aPTT were
      disproportionately prolonged relative to the corresponding anti-FXa levels in
      CF-LVAD patients, particularly those with device obstruction. Hemolysis and
      warfarin administration may falsely elevate aPTT, resulting in overestimation of 
      heparin concentration and under-anticoagulation. Use of aPTT and anti-FXa to
      guide heparin therapy may lead to different estimates of heparin concentration in
      the same patient.

TI  - Impact of age on outcomes following continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      device implantation.
LID - ivv051 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of our study was to analyse the impact of age on outcomes in
      patients who underwent continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD)
      placement at our institution. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were
      implanted with a CF-LVAD between January 2008 and June 2014. Eighty-five patients
      were implanted with the device as a bridge to transplant (BTT); the remaining (n 
      = 43) were on destination therapy (DT). Each group was divided into patients <65 
      years old and >/=65 years old at device implantation. Patients were followed up
      for at least 24 months or until transplant or death. RESULTS: Eighty-five
      patients (66%) received a CF-LVAD as BTT. Patients >/=65 years old (n = 8) had a 
      lower preoperative cardiac index and prothrombin time-international normalized
      ratio (P = 0.009), and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (P = 0.008).
      Adverse events including infections, re-exploration for bleeding, ischaemic and
      haemorrhagic stroke, renal failure and right heart failure were comparable in
      both age groups. Eighty-two percent (n = 63) of the young patients and 75% (n =
      6) of the older patients, who were on LVAD as BTT, underwent heart transplant
      within the first 24 months of LVAD implantation. Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and
      24 months were 95, 95, 77 and 70%, respectively, post-CF-LVAD implantation as BTT
      for the younger group and 73% for the older group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P =
      0.35). Forty-three patients (34%) received a CF-LVAD as DT. Patients >/=65 years 
      old (n = 14) on DT had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular disease (P =
      0.048), higher serum sodium (P = 0.004) and serum creatinine values (P = 0.002), 
      preoperatively. There were more strokes in the older patients post-LAVD
      implantation (14 vs 0%; P = 0.048). Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
      were 85, 79, 75 and 62%, respectively, for the younger group and 93, 77, 67 and
      34% for the older group, respectively (P = 0.26). CONCLUSION: This study
      demonstrates that LVAD therapy can be used in the older patients with acceptable 
      mortality and morbidity, and age alone should not be used as the sole criterion
      for exclusion from LVAD implantation.

TI  - Building a bridge to save a failing ventricle: radiologic evaluation of short-
      and long-term cardiac assist devices.

AB  - Heart failure is recognized with increasing frequency worldwide and often
      progresses to an advanced refractory state. Although the reference standard for
      treatment of advanced heart failure remains cardiac transplantation, the
      increasing shortage of donor organs and the unsuitability of many patients for
      transplantation surgery has led to a search for alternative therapies. One such
      therapy is mechanical circulatory support, which helps relieve the load on the
      ventricle and thereby allows it to recover function. In addition, there is
      increasing evidence supporting the use of mechanical devices as a bridge to
      recovery in patients with acute refractory heart failure. In this article, the
      imaging evaluation of various commonly used short- and long-term cardiac assist
      devices is discussed, and their relevant mechanisms of action and physiology are 
      described. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), plays a crucial role
      in preoperative evaluation for assessment of candidacy for implantation of a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH). Also,
      echocardiography and CT are indispensable in assessment of complications
      associated with cardiac devices. Complications commonly associated with
      short-term assist devices include bleeding and malpositioning, whereas long-term 
      devices such as LVADs may be associated with infection, pump thrombosis, and
      cannula malfunction, as well as bleeding. CT is also commonly performed for
      preoperative planning before LVAD or TAH explantation, replacement of a device or
      one of its components, and cardiac transplantation. Online supplemental material 
      is available for this article.

TI  - Kidney dysfunction and left ventricular assist device support: a comprehensive
      perioperative review.
PG  - 48-60
LID - 10.1159/000369589 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used increasingly as a bridge to
      transplantation or as destination therapy in end-stage heart failure patients who
      do not respond to optimal medical therapy. Many of these patients have end-organ 
      dysfunction, including advanced kidney dysfunction, before and after LVAD
      implantation. Kidney dysfunction is a marker of adverse outcomes, such as
      increased morbidity and mortality. This review discusses kidney dysfunction and
      associated management strategies during the dynamic perioperative time period of 
      LVAD implantation. Furthermore, we suggest potential future research directions
      to better understand the complex relationship between renal pathophysiology and
      mechanical circulatory support.

TI  - Decision-making for destination therapy left ventricular assist devices:
      implications for caregivers.
PG  - 172-8
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.114.001276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implanting centers often require the identification of a dedicated
      caregiver before destination therapy left ventricular assist device (DT LVAD)
      implantation; however, the caregiver experience surrounding this difficult
      decision is relatively unexplored. METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2012 through
      July 2013, we conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews with caregivers of
      patients considering DT LVAD. Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and
      deductive approach. We interviewed 17 caregivers: 10 caregivers of patients
      living with DT LVAD, 6 caregivers of patients who had died with DT LVAD, and 1
      caregiver of a patient who had declined DT LVAD. The themes identified, which
      could also be considered dialectical tensions, are broadly interpreted under 3
      domains mapping to decision context, process, and outcome: (1) the stark decision
      context, with tension between hope and reality; (2) the challenging decision
      process, with tension between wanting loved ones to live and wanting to respect
      loved ones' wishes; and (3) the downstream decision outcome, with tension between
      gratitude and burden. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making surrounding DT LVAD should
      incorporate decision support for patients and caregivers. This should include a
      focus on caregiver burden and the predictable tensions that caregivers
      experience.

LID - 10.1111/aor.12422 [doi]
AB  - The use of mechanical circulatory support to treat patients with congestive heart
      failure has grown enormously, recently surpassing the number of annual heart
      transplants worldwide. The current generation of left ventricular assist devices 
      (LVADs), as compared with older devices, is characterized by improved
      technologies and reduced size. The result is that minimally invasive surgery is
      now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange of LVADs. Minimally
      invasive procedures improve surgical outcome; for example, they lower the rates
      of operative complications (such as bleeding or wound infection). The
      miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive techniques
      will be used for most implantations in the future. In this article, we summarize 
      and describe minimally invasive state-of-the-art implantation techniques, with a 
      focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.

AB  - The pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) has recently shown substantial
      improvements in survival as a bridge to heart transplant for patients with
      end-stage heart failure. Since that time, its use has become much more frequent. 
      With increasing utilization, additional questions have arisen including patient
      selection, timing of VAD implantation and device selection. These challenges are 
      amplified by the uniqueness of each patient, the recent abundance of literature
      surrounding VAD use as well as the technological advancements in the devices
      themselves. Ideal strategies for device placement must be sought, for not only
      improved patient care, but also for optimal resource utilization. Here, we review
      the most relevant literature to highlight some of the challenges facing the heart
      failure specialist, and any physician, who will care for a child with a VAD.

LID - 10.1155/2015/592512 [doi]
AB  - Mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) in advanced heart
      failure (HF), in addition to improving symptoms and end-organ perfusion, is
      supposed to stimulate cellular and molecular responses which can reverse
      maladaptive cardiac remodeling. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in
      remodeling processes, a comparative miRNA profiling in transplanted hearts of HF 
      patients with/without LVAD assistance could aid to comprehend underlying
      molecular mechanisms. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze miRNA 
      differential expression in left ventricles of HF patients who underwent heart
      transplantation directly (n = 9) or following a period of LVAD support (n = 8).
      After data validation by quantitative real-time PCR, association with functional 
      clinical parameters was investigated. Bioinformatics' tools were then used for
      prediction of putative targets of modulated miRNAs and relative pathway
      enrichment. The analysis revealed 13 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs in
      failing hearts subjected to LVAD assistance. In particular, the expression level 
      of some of them (miR-338-3p, miR-142-5p and -3p, miR-216a-5p, miR-223-3p,
      miR-27a-5p, and miR-378g) showed correlation with off-pump cardiac index values. 
      Predicted targets of these miRNAs were involved in focal adhesion/integrin
      pathway and in actin cytoskeleton regulation. The identified miRNAs might
      contribute to molecular regulation of reverse remodeling and heart recovery
      mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is prevalent in patients with heart
      failure. Because very few data exist examining the influence of significant
      pre-operative MR on outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      implantation, we evaluate our experience. METHODS: Between October 1996 and
      August 2013, 756 patients underwent primary LVAD implantation at our
      institutions. Of these, 508 patients received a continuous-flow LVAD and
      represent the contemporary cohort for this analysis. Devices implanted included
      the HeartMate II in 410 patients (81%) and HeartWare HVAD in 98 patients (19%).
      Based on availability of pre-operative echocardiography, 491 patients were
      divided into 2 study groups according to degree of pre-operative MR; 189 patients
      (39%) had moderate to severe or greater MR (MR group), and 302 (61%) had less
      than moderate to severe MR (less MR group). Median age at operation (60 years in 
      MR group vs 58 years in less MR group, p = 0.19), male sex (78% in MR group vs
      81% in less MR group, p = 0.42), and ischemic etiology (46% in MR group vs 51% in
      less MR group, p = 0.35) were similar between groups. RESULTS: There were 40
      early deaths (7.9%), and follow-up was available in all 468 early survivors for
      641 patient-years of support. Patients in the MR group had higher late survival
      (2 years, 75%; 4 years, 65%) compared with patients in the less MR group (2
      years, 66%; 4 years, 48%; p < 0.04). Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the
      independent interaction between MR and late survival (hazard ratio 0.62, p =
      0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was improved survival in patients with severe
      pre-operative MR after continuous-flow LVAD implantation in our cohort. These
      findings may lend insight into the possible lack of value of addressing
      significant MR at the time of LVAD implantation.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support in the Dutch National Paediatric Heart
      Transplantation Programmedagger

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with a ventricular assist device
      (VAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx) or recovery may improve outcome 
      in children with terminal heart failure. We report our experience with MCS in
      children eligible for HTx and its effect on waiting list mortality. METHODS:
      Retrospective single-centre cohort study, National Paediatric HTx Programme
      including all children eligible for HTx, since the introduction of MCS-VAD in
      2006. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were eligible for HTx, median age 11.7
      years [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 3.0-14.7]. In 18 patients, (42%) a VAD was
      implanted, 11 (61%) survived to HTx (n = 9) or recovery (n = 2). Techniques and
      devices used were left ventricular assist device (n = 16, 89%), in 4 cases
      preceded by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and biventricular assist 
      device (n = 2, 11%), both preceded by ECMO. In the VAD group, median time to
      death (n = 7) was 18 days (IQR 7-75), median time to HTx (n = 9) 66 days (IQR
      33-223) and 2 patients recovered after 30 and 308 days. The main cause of death
      on MCS was neurological injury in 4 patients (22%) and systemic thrombo-embolic
      events in 2 (11%). The most common serious adverse events included confirmed
      thrombus requiring pump replacement (in 11 patients, 61%) and pericardial
      effusion leading to rethoracotomy (in 5 patients, 28%). Compared with the era
      before MCS (1998-2006), waiting list mortality decreased from 44 to 21%, and is
      now mainly related to complications of VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Since the
      introduction of MCS-VAD, waiting list mortality halved and more children with
      end-stage heart failure survived to heart transplantation, thus improving
      outcome. Although there is substantial mortality and morbidity, overall mortality
      decreases, making MCS-VAD an essential therapeutic tool. The need for donor
      organs remains critically urgent.
