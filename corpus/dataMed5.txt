TI  - Long-term continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) as bridge to
      heart transplantation.

AB  - Heart transplantation (HTx) is the treatment of choice for end-stage heart
      failure but the limited availability of heart's donors still represents a major
      issue. So long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been proposed as an 
      alternative treatment option to assist patients scheduled on HTx waiting list
      bridging them for a variable time period to cardiac transplantation-the so-called
      bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) strategy. Nowadays approximately 90% of patients 
      being considered for MCS receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). In
      fact, LVAD experienced several improvements in the last decade and the
      predominance of continuous-flow over pulsatile-flow technology has been evident
      since 2008. The aim of the present report is to give an overview of
      continuous-flow LVAD utilization in the specific setting of the BTT strategy
      taking into consideration the most representative articles of the scientific
      literature and focusing the attention on the evolution, clinical outcomes,
      relevant implications on the HTx strategy and future perspectives of the
      continuous-flow LVAD technology.
