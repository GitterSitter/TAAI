AB  - Despite therapeutic advances that improve longevity and quality of life, heart
      failure (HF) remains a relentless disease. At the end stage of HF, patients may
      become eligible for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for the indications of
      stabilising acute cardiogenic shock or for chronic HF management. MCS use is
      growing rapidly in the USA and some countries of the European Union, especially
      in transplant-ineligible patients. In others, it remains largely a tool to
      stabilise patients until heart transplant. MCS comprises a heterogeneous group of
      temporary and durable devices which augment or replace the pumping function of
      one or both ventricles, with postimplant 2 year survival rivalling that of
      transplant in selected, lower-risk patients. In transplant-eligible and
      non-transplant-eligible patients, improvement in end-organ perfusion, functional 
      capacity and quality of life have been noted. Even for optimal candidates,
      however, there are a host of potential complications that require constant
      vigilance of a coordinated care team. Recently, there has been official
      recognition of the importance of palliative care expertise in advance care
      planning preimplant and management of patients with ventricular assist devices at
      the end of their lives.
