For medications, see Pharmaceutical drug. For other uses, see Medicine (disambiguation).\r\n\r\nAsclepius, the god of medicine and healing in Greek mythology. Depictions of the serpent-entwined rod of Asclepius are frequently used to represent medicine.\r\nMedicine (UK English Listeni/Ã‹Ë†mÃ‰â€ºdsÃ‰Â¨n/, /Ã‹Ë†mÃ‰â€ºdÃ‰Â¨sÃ‰Â¨n/; US English Listeni/Ã‹Ë†mÃ‰â€ºdÃ‰Â¨sÃ‰Â¨n/) is the science or practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1][2] The word medicine is derived from the Latin ars medicina, meaning the art of healing.[3][4] Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness.\r\n\r\nContemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, prostheses, biologics, and ionizing radiation, among others.[5]\r\n\r\nMedicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.\r\n\r\nPrescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is \"variable and inconsistent\" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, medicine outside the bounds of safety and efficacy is termed quackery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, by Sir Luke Fildes (1891)\r\nMedical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.[8] Even in the developed world however, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49\% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.[9]\r\n\r\nIn modern clinical practice, doctors personally assess patients in order to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient\'s medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview[10] and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g. stethoscope, tongue depressor) are typically used. After examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g. blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.[11] Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue.\r\n\r\nThe components of the medical interview[10] and encounter are:\r\n\r\nChief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the \'symptoms.\' They are in the patient\'s own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called \'presenting complaint\'.\r\nHistory of present illness/complaint (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom.\r\nCurrent activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.\r\nMedications (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, over-the-counter, and home remedies, as well as alternative and herbal medicines/herbal remedies. Allergies are also recorded.\r\nPast medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past infectious diseases and/or vaccinations, history of known allergies.\r\nSocial history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including diet, medications, tobacco, alcohol).\r\nFamily history (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A family tree is sometimes used.\r\nReview of systems (ROS) or systems inquiry: a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss, change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body\'s main organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).\r\nThe physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable.[12] The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.[13]\r\n\r\nThe clinical examination involves the study of:\r\n\r\nVital signs including height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation\r\nGeneral appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or clubbing)\r\nSkin\r\nHead, eye, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT)\r\nCardiovascular (heart and blood vessels)\r\nRespiratory (large airways and lungs)\r\nAbdomen and rectum\r\nGenitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)\r\nMusculoskeletal (including spine and extremities)\r\nNeurological (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, cranial nerves, spinal cord and peripheral nerves)\r\nPsychiatric (orientation, mental state, evidence of abnormal perception or thought).\r\nIt is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.\r\n\r\nThe treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. Follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system, various forms of \"utilization review\", such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services.[14] assist support devices\r\n\r\nThe medical decision-making (MDM) process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient\'s problem.\r\n\r\nOn subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations.\r\n\r\nInstitutions[edit]\r\n\r\nThe Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, fresco by Domenico di Bartolo, 1441Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1442\r\nContemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems. Legal, credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.[15] Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States)[16][17] and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system, or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.\r\n\r\nMost tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly. assist support devices\r\n\r\n\r\nModern drug ampoules\r\nTransparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness,[18] new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.\r\n\r\nDelivery[edit]\r\nSee also: Health care, clinic, hospital and hospice\r\nProvision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.\r\n\r\nPrimary care medical services are provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, clinics, nursing homes, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90\% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes.\r\n\r\nSecondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, emergency rooms, intensive care medicine, surgery services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, assist support devices diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.\r\n\r\nTertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include trauma centers, burn treatment centers, advanced neonatology unit services, organ transplants, high-risk pregnancy, radiation oncology, etc.\r\n\r\nModern medical care also depends on information Ã¢â‚¬â€œ still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.\r\n\r\nIn low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that \"user fees\" be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.[19]\r\n\r\nBranches[edit]\r\nWorking together as an interdisciplinary team, many highly trained health professionals besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: nurses, emergency medical technicians and paramedics, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, podiatrists physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, radiographers, dietitians, and bioengineers, surgeons, surgeon\'s assistant, surgical technologist.\r\n\r\nThe scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. Dentistry, while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine, is a medical field.\r\n\r\nA patient admitted to hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the Cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.\r\n\r\nPhysicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.\r\n\r\nThe main branches of medicine are:\r\n\r\nBasic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in biomedical research\r\nMedical specialties\r\nInterdisciplinary fields, where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.\r\nBasic sciences[edit]\r\nAnatomy is the study of the physical structure of organisms. In contrast to macroscopic or gross anatomy, cytology and histology are concerned with microscopic structures. assist support devices\r\nBiochemistry is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.\r\nBiomechanics is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of Mechanics.\r\nBiostatistics is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to epidemiology and evidence-based medicine.\r\nBiophysics is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of physics and physical chemistry to study biological systems.\r\nCytology is the microscopic study of individual cells.\r\n\r\nLouis Pasteur in his laboratory, 1885\r\nEmbryology is the study of the early development of organisms.\r\nEndocrinology is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.\r\nEpidemiology is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.\r\nGenetics is the study of genes, and their role in biological inheritance.\r\nHistology is the study of the structures of biological tissues by light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\r\nImmunology is the study of the immune system, which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.\r\nMedical physics is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.\r\nMicrobiology is the study of microorganisms, including protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\r\nMolecular biology is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material.\r\nNeuroscience includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the nervous system. A main focus of neuroscience is the biology and physiology of the human brain and spinal cord. Some related clinical specialties include neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry.\r\nNutrition science (theoretical focus) and dietetics (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, weight and eating disorders, allergies, malnutrition, and neoplastic diseases.\r\nPathology as a science is the study of diseaseÃ¢â‚¬â€?the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.\r\nPharmacology is the study of drugs and their actions.\r\nPhotobiology is the study of the interactions between non-ionizing radiation and living organisms.\r\nPhysiology is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.\r\nRadiobiology is the study of the interactions between ionizing radiation and living organisms.\r\nToxicology is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and poisons.\r\nSpecialties[edit]\r\nMain article: Medical specialty\r\nIn the broadest meaning of \"medicine\", there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which have its own entrance examination. These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term \"Royal\". The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.\r\n\r\nWithin medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: \"Medicine\" and \"Surgery.\" \"Medicine\" refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine. In the UK, this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland. \"Surgery\" refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General Surgery, which in the UK leads to membership of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (MRCS). At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the Royal College of Anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).\r\n\r\nSurgery[edit]\r\nMain article: Surgery assist support devices\r\n\r\nSurgeons in an operating room\r\nSurgical specialties employ operative treatment. In addition, surgeons must decide when an operation is necessary, and also treat many non-surgical issues, particularly in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), where a variety of critical issues arise. Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including general surgery, cardiovascular surgery, colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oncologic surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, podiatric surgery, transplant surgery, trauma surgery, urology, vascular surgery, and pediatric surgery. In some centers, anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.\r\n\r\nSurgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming.\r\n\r\n\'Medicine\' as a specialty[edit]\r\nMain article: Internal Medicine\r\nInternal medicine is the medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis, management and nonsurgical treatment of unusual or serious diseases, either of one particular organ system or of the body as a whole. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.[20] In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called \"internists\". Elsewhere, especially in Commonwealth nations, such specialists are often called physicians.[21] These terms, internist or physician (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.\r\n\r\nBecause their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.[22]\r\n\r\nIn the Commonwealth of Nations and some other countries, specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as specialist physicians (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of Primary care.\r\n\r\nThere are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of internal medicine:\r\n\r\nAngiology/Vascular Medicine\r\nCardiology\r\nCritical care medicine\r\nEndocrinology\r\nGastroenterology\r\nGeriatrics\r\nHematology assist support devices\r\nHepatology\r\nInfectious diseases\r\nNephrology\r\nNeurology\r\nOncology\r\nPediatrics\r\nPulmonology/Pneumology/Respirology\r\nRheumatology\r\nTraining in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on Medical education and Physician for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the USA. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic specialties[edit]\r\nClinical laboratory sciences are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, clinical chemistry, hematology, clinical microbiology and clinical immunology.\r\nPathology as a medical specialty is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in evidence-based medicine. Many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.\r\nRadiology is concerned with imaging of the human body, e.g. by x-rays, x-ray computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography.\r\nNuclear medicine is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a gamma camera or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.\r\nClinical neurophysiology is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.\r\nOther major specialties[edit] assist support devices\r\nThe followings are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups.\r\n\r\nAnesthesiology (also known as anaesthetics): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist\'s role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs\' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also served the same function in the labor & delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.\r\nDermatology is concerned with the skin and its diseases. In the UK, dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine.\r\nEmergency medicine is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including trauma, surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.\r\nFamily medicine, family practice, general practice or primary care is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency room coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.\r\nObstetrics and gynecology (often abbreviated as OB/GYN (American English) or Obs & Gynae (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. Reproductive medicine and fertility medicine are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.\r\nMedical Genetics is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.\r\nNeurology is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.\r\nOphthalmology exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa, combining conservative and surgical therapy.\r\nPediatrics (AE) or paediatrics (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.\r\nPharmaceutical medicine is the medical scientific discipline concerned with the discovery, development, evaluation, registration, monitoring and medical aspects of marketing of medicines for the benefit of patients and public health.\r\nPhysical medicine and rehabilitation (or physiatry) is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or congenital disorders.\r\nPodiatric medicine study of, diagnosis, and medical & surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.\r\nPsychiatry is the branch of medicine concerned with the bio-psycho-social study of the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cognitive, perceptual, emotional and behavioral disorders. Related non-medical fields include psychotherapy and clinical psychology.\r\nPreventive medicine is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.\r\nCommunity health or public health is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis.\r\nInterdisciplinary fields[edit] assist support devices\r\nSome interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine include:\r\n\r\nAerospace medicine deals with medical problems related to flying and space travel.\r\nAddiction medicine deals with the treatment of addiction.\r\nMedical ethics deals with ethical and moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine.\r\nBiomedical Engineering is a field dealing with the application of engineering principles to medical practice.\r\nClinical pharmacology is concerned with how systems of therapeutics interact with patients.\r\nConservation medicine studies the relationship between human and animal health, and environmental conditions. Also known as ecological medicine, environmental medicine, or medical geology.\r\nDisaster medicine deals with medical aspects of emergency preparedness, disaster mitigation and management.\r\nDiving medicine (or hyperbaric medicine) is the prevention and treatment of diving-related problems.\r\nEvolutionary medicine is a perspective on medicine derived through applying evolutionary theory.\r\nForensic medicine deals with medical questions in legal context, such as determination of the time and cause of death, type of weapon used to inflict trauma, reconstruction of the facial features using remains of deceased (skull)thus aiding identification.\r\nGender-based medicine studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease.\r\nHospice and Palliative Medicine is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with terminal illnesses including cancer and heart failure.\r\nHospital medicine is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called hospitalists in the USA and Canada. The term Most Responsible Physician (MRP) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role.\r\nLaser medicine involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics and/or treatment of various conditions.\r\nMedical humanities includes the humanities (literature, philosophy, ethics, history and religion), social science (anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology), and the arts (literature, theater, film, and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice.\r\nMedical informatics, medical computer science, and eHealth are relatively recent fields that deal with the application of computers and information technology to medicine.\r\nNosology is the classification of diseases for various purposes.\r\nNosokinetics is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems.\r\nOccupational medicine\'s principal role is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained.\r\nPain management (also called pain medicine, or algiatry) is the medical discipline concerned with the relief of pain.\r\nPharmacogenomics is a form of individualized medicine.\r\nPodiatric medicine study of, diagnosis, and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.\r\nSexual medicine is concerned with diagnosing, assessing and treating all disorders related to sexuality.\r\nSports medicine deals with the treatment and prevention and rehabilitation of sports/exercise injuries such as muscle spasms, muscle tears, injuries to ligaments (ligament tears or ruptures) and their repair in athletes, amateur and professional.\r\nTherapeutics is the field, more commonly referenced in earlier periods of history, of the various remedies that can be used to treat disease and promote health.[23]\r\nTravel medicine or emporiatrics deals with health problems of international travelers or travelers across highly different environments.\r\nTropical medicine deals with the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. It is studied separately in temperate climates where those diseases are quite unfamiliar to medical practitioners and their local clinical needs.\r\nUrgent care focuses on delivery of unscheduled, walk-in care outside of the hospital emergency department for injuries and illnesses that are not severe enough to require care in an emergency department. In some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency room.\r\nVeterinary medicine; veterinarians apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of animals.\r\nWilderness medicine entails the practice of medicine in the wild, where conventional medical facilities may not be available.\r\nMany other health science fields, e.g. dietetics\r\nEducation[edit]\r\nMain articles: Medical education and Medical school\r\nassist support devices\r\nPainted by Toulouse-Lautrec in the year of his own death: an examination in the Paris faculty of medicine, 1901\r\n\r\nMedicine section inside a medical library.\r\nMedical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university medical school, followed by a period of supervised practice or internship, and/or residency. This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a Doctor of Medicine degree, often abbreviated M.D., or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in a recognized university.\r\n\r\nSince knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require continuing medical education. Medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways, including medical journals, seminars, conferences and online programs.\r\n\r\nMedical ethics[edit]\r\nMain article: Medical ethics\r\nMedical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:\r\n\r\nautonomy - the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (Voluntas aegroti suprema lex.)\r\nbeneficence - a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (Salus aegroti suprema lex.)\r\njustice - concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).\r\nnon-maleficence - \"first, do no harm\" (primum non nocere).\r\nrespect for persons - the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.\r\ntruthfulness and honesty - the concept of informed consent has increased in importance since the historical events of the Doctors\' Trial of the Nuremberg trials, Tuskegee syphilis experiment, and others.\r\nValues such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions, considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.\r\n\r\nLegal controls[edit]\r\nIn most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in \"evidence based\", Western, or Hippocratic Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.\r\n\r\nIn the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification. The regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC.\r\n\r\nDoctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of medical malpractice and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.\r\n\r\nCriticism of modern medicine[edit]\r\nA major problem for modern medicine has been lack of access in poor regions. There is an \"outcome gap\" between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive-to-treat diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis. The majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich, low-incidence regions such as the West. On the other hand, countries in the developing world have high rates of HIV but lack the necessary resources to treat them.[24]\r\n\r\nMedical errors and overmedication and other forms of iatrogenesis (harms caused by medical treatment) are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage. Practitioners of human factors engineering believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in aviation safety, where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one \"superhuman\" individual and expect him or her not to make errors. Reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice. Clinical versus statistical, algorithmic diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a 1954 book by Paul E. Meehl, which found statistical methods superior.[25] A 2000 meta-analysis comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or \"mechanical\" diagnostic methods were, in general, although not always, superior.[25]\r\n\r\nDisparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy.[26] For example, elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a 2008 study.[27] Rural poor African-American men were used in an infamous study of syphilis that denied them basic medical care.\r\n\r\nHonors and awards[edit]\r\nMain article: Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine\r\nThe highest honor awarded in medicine is the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded since 1901 by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet.\r\n\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nMain articles: History of medicine and Timeline of medicine and medical technology\r\nAncient world[edit]\r\n\r\nStatuette of ancient Egyptian physician Imhotep, the first physician from antiquity known by name.\r\nPrehistoric medicine incorporated plants (herbalism), animal parts and minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, shamans, or medicine men. Well-known spiritual systems include animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), spiritualism (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and divination (magically obtaining the truth). The field of medical anthropology examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ancient Greek patient gets medical treatment: this aryballos (circa 480Ã¢â‚¬â€œ470 BCE, now in Paris\'s Louvre Museum) probably contained healing oil\r\n\r\nThe Greek physician Hippocrates (ca. 460 BCE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ca. 370 BCE), considered the father of medicine.[28][29]\r\nEarly records on medicine have been discovered from ancient Egyptian medicine, Babylonian medicine, Ayurvedic medicine (in the Indian subcontinent), classical Chinese medicine (predecessor to the modern traditional Chinese Medicine), and ancient Greek medicine and Roman medicine.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, Imhotep (3rd millennium BC) is the first physician in history known by name. The oldest Egyptian medical text is the Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus from around 2000 BCE, which describes gynaecological diseases. The Edwin Smith Papyrus dating back to 1600 BCE is an early work on surgery, while the Ebers Papyrus dating back to 1500 BCE is akin to a textbook on medicine.[30]\r\n\r\nIn China, archaeological evidence of medicine in Chinese dates back to the Bronze Age Shang Dynasty, based on seeds for herbalism and tools presumed to have been used for surgery.[31] The Huangdi Neijing, the progenitor of Chinese medicine, is a medical text written beginning in the 2nd century BCE and compiled in the 3rd century.[32]\r\n\r\nIn India, the surgeon Sushruta described numerous surgical operations, including the earliest forms of plastic surgery.[33][dubious Ã¢â‚¬â€œ discuss][34][35] Earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from Mihintale in Sri Lanka where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found.[36][37]\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the Greek physician Hippocrates, the \"father of medicine\",[28][29] laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine. Hippocrates introduced the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, \"exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence\".[38][39] The Greek physician Galen was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations, including brain and eye surgeries. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the onset of the Early Middle Ages, the Greek tradition of medicine went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued uninterrupted in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.\r\n\r\nMost of our knowledge of ancient Hebrew medicine during the 1st millennium BC comes from the Torah, i.e. the Five Books of Moses, which contain various health related laws and rituals. The Hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the Byzantine Era, with the physician Asaph the Jew.[40]\r\n\r\nMiddle ages[edit]\r\n\r\nA manuscript of Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah by Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imam of Shia Muslims. The text says: \"Golden dissertation in medicine which is sent by Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha, peace be upon him, to al-Ma\'mun.\"\r\nAfter 750 CE, the Muslim world had the works of Hippocrates, Galen and Sushruta translated into Arabic, and Islamic physicians engaged in some significant medical research. Notable Islamic medical pioneers include the Persian polymath, Avicenna, who, along with Imhotep and Hippocrates, has also been called the \"father of medicine\".[41] He wrote The Canon of Medicine, considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine.[42] Others include Abulcasis,[43] Avenzoar,[44] Ibn al-Nafis,[45] and Averroes.[46] Rhazes[47] was one of first to question the Greek theory of humorism, which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval Western and medieval Islamic medicine.[48] Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah by Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imam of Shia Muslims, is revered as the most precious Islamic literature in the Science of Medicine.[49] The Islamic Bimaristan hospitals were an early example of public hospitals.[50][51]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Charlemagne decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian Geoffrey Blainey likened the activities of the Catholic Church in health care during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: \"It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal\". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The Benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great Abbey of Cluny. The Church also established a network of cathedral schools and universities where medicine was studied. The Schola Medica Salernitana in Salerno, looking to the learning of Greek and Arab physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in Medieval Europe.[52]\r\n\r\n\r\nPanorama of Siena\'s Santa Maria della Scala Hospital, one of Europe\'s oldest hospitals. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church established universities which revived the study of sciences - drawing on the learning of Greek and Arab physicians in the study of medicine.\r\nHowever, the fourteenth and fifteenth century Black Death devastated both the Middle East and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East.[53] In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including Gabriele Falloppio and William Harvey.\r\n\r\nThe major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the \'traditional authority\' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general Ã¢â‚¬â€œ see Copernicus\'s rejection of Ptolemy\'s theories on astronomy). Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\nAndreas Vesalius was the author of De humani corporis fabrica, an important book on human anatomy.[54] Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, initiating the scientific field microbiology.[55] Independently from Ibn al-Nafis, Michael Servetus rediscovered the pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the \"Manuscript of Paris\"[56] in 1546, and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553. Later this was described by Renaldus Columbus and Andrea Cesalpino. Herman Boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a \"father of physiology\" due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook \'Institutiones medicae\' (1708). Pierre Fauchard has been called \"the father of modern dentistry\".[57]\r\n\r\nModern[edit]\r\n\r\nPaul-Louis Simond injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898\r\nVeterinary medicine was, for the first time, truly separated from human medicine in 1761, when the French veterinarian Claude Bourgelat founded the world\'s first veterinary school in Lyon, France. Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.\r\n\r\nModern scientific biomedical research (where results are testable and reproducible) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek \"four humours\" and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with Edward Jenner\'s discovery of the smallpox vaccine at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of inoculation earlier practiced in Asia), Robert Koch\'s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of antibiotics around 1900.\r\n\r\nThe post-18th century modernity period brought more groundbreaking researchers from Europe. From Germany and Austria, doctors Rudolf Virchow, Wilhelm Conrad RÃƒÂ¶ntgen, Karl Landsteiner and Otto Loewi made notable contributions. In the United Kingdom, Alexander Fleming, Joseph Lister, Francis Crick and Florence Nightingale are considered important. Spanish doctor Santiago RamÃƒÂ³n y Cajal is considered the father of modern neuroscience.\r\n\r\nFrom New Zealand and Australia came Maurice Wilkins, Howard Florey, and Frank Macfarlane Burnet.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, William Williams Keen, William Coley, James D. Watson, Italy (Salvador Luria), Switzerland (Alexandre Yersin), Japan (Kitasato ShibasaburÃ…ï¿½), and France (Jean-Martin Charcot, Claude Bernard, Paul Broca and others did significant work). Russian Nikolai Korotkov also did significant work, as did Sir William Osler and Harvey Cushing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Fleming\'s discovery of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern antibiotics.\r\nAs science and technology developed, medicine became more reliant upon medications. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only animal and plant products were used as medicine, but also human body parts and fluids.[58] Pharmacology developed from herbalism and many drugs are still derived from plants (atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, aspirin, digoxin, vinca alkaloids, taxol, hyoscine, etc.). Vaccines were discovered by Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur.\r\n\r\nThe first antibiotic was arsphenamine / Salvarsan discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not. The first major class of antibiotics was the sulfa drugs, derived by German chemists originally from azo dyes.\r\n\r\nPharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated; modern biotechnology allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed, sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce side-effects. Genomics and knowledge of human genetics is having some influence on medicine, as the causative genes of most monogenic genetic disorders have now been identified, and the development of techniques in molecular biology and genetics are influencing medical technology, practice and decision-making.\r\n\r\nEvidence-based medicine is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective algorithms of practice (ways of doing things) through the use of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The movement is facilitated by modern global information science, which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The Cochrane Collaboration leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3\% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20\% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5\% concluded positive effect.[59]\r\n\r\nMythology[edit]\r\nassist support devices\r\n\r\n\r\nHygieia by Gustaf Klimt.

As of 2008 the most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor (cadaveric allograft) and implant it into the patient. The patient\'s own heart is either removed (orthotopic procedure) or, less commonly, left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic procedure). Post-operation survival periods average 15 years.[1] Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease, but a life-saving treatment intended to improve the quality of life for recipients.[2]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n2 Contraindications\r\n3 Procedures\r\n3.1 Pre-operative\r\n3.2 Operative\r\n3.2.1 Orthotopic procedure\r\n3.2.2 Heterotopic procedure\r\n3.2.3 \'Living organ\' transplant\r\n3.2.4 Non-beating heart transplant\r\n3.3 Post-operative\r\n4 Complications\r\n5 Prognosis\r\n5.1 Notable recipients\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nNorman Shumway is widely regarded as the father of heart transplantation although the world\'s first adult human heart transplant was performed by a South African cardiac surgeon, Christiaan Barnard, utilizing the techniques developed and perfected by Shumway and Richard Lower.[3] Barnard performed the first transplant on Louis Washkansky on December 3, 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.[3][4] Adrian Kantrowitz performed the world\'s first pediatric heart transplant on December 6, 1967, at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, barely three days after Christiaan Barnard\'s pioneering procedure.[3] Norman Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on January 6, 1968, at the Stanford University Hospital.[3]\r\n\r\nWorldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are performed annually. The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000-2,300 annually). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 119 adult transplants in 2013 alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure.[5] The great disparity between the number of patients needing transplants and the number of procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non-human hearts into humans after 1993. Xenografts from other species and man-made artificial hearts are two less successful alternatives to allografts.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthotopic heart transplant. Recipient P-waves (arrows).\r\nContraindications[edit]\r\nSome patients are less suitable for a heart transplant, especially if they suffer from other circulatory conditions related to the heart. The following conditions in a patient increase the chances of complications:\r\n\r\nKidney, lung, or liver disease\r\nInsulin-dependent diabetes with other organ dysfunction\r\nLife-threatening diseases unrelated to heart failure\r\nVascular disease of the neck and leg arteries.\r\nHigh pulmonary vascular resistance\r\nRecent thromboembolism\r\nAge over 60 years (some variation between centers)\r\nSubstance abuse, notably tobacco smoking (which increases the chance of lung disease)\r\nProcedures[edit]\r\nPre-operative[edit]\r\nA typical heart transplantation begins when a suitable donor heart is identified. The heart comes from a recently deceased or brain dead donor, also called a beating heart cadaver. The patient is contacted by a nurse coordinator and instructed to come to the hospital for evaluation and pre-surgical medication. At the same time, the heart is removed from the donor and inspected by a team of surgeons to see if it is in suitable condition. Learning that a potential organ is unsuitable can induce distress in an already fragile patient, who usually requires emotional support before returning home.\r\n\r\nThe patient must also undergo emotional, psychological, and physical tests to verify mental health and ability to make good use of a new heart. The patient is also given immunosuppressant medication so that the patient\'s immune system does not reject the new heart.\r\n\r\nOperative[edit]\r\n\r\nSchematic of a transplanted heart with native lungs and the great vessels.\r\nOnce the donor heart passes inspection, the patient is taken into the operating room and given a general anaesthetic. Either an orthotopic or a heterotopic procedure follows, depending on the conditions of the patient and the donor heart.\r\n\r\nOrthotopic procedure[edit]\r\nThe orthotopic procedure begins with a median sternotomy, opening the chest and exposing the mediastinum. The pericardium is opened, the great vessels are dissected and the patient is attached to cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor\'s heart is injected with potassium chloride (KCl). Potassium chloride stops the heart beating before the heart is removed from the donor\'s body and packed in ice. Ice can usually keep the heart usable for four[6] to six hours depending on preservation and starting condition. The failing heart is removed by transecting the great vessels and a portion of the left atrium. The patient\'s pulmonary veins are not transected; rather a circular portion of the left atrium containing the pulmonary veins is left in place. The donor heart is trimmed to fit onto the patient\'s remaining left atrium and the great vessels are sutured in place. The new heart is restarted, the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and the chest cavity is closed.\r\n\r\nThe orthotopic procedure was developed by Shumway and Lower at Stanford-Lane Hospital in San Francisco in 1958.[3]\r\n\r\nHeterotopic procedure[edit]\r\nIn the heterotopic procedure, the patient\'s own heart is not removed. The new heart is positioned so that the chambers and blood vessels of both hearts can be connected to form what is effectively a \'double heart\'. The procedure can give the patient\'s original heart a chance to recover, and if the donor\'s heart fails (e.g., through rejection), it can later be removed, leaving the patient\'s original heart. Heterotopic procedures are used only in cases where the donor heart is not strong enough to function by itself (because either the patient\'s body is considerably larger than the donor\'s, the donor\'s heart is itself weak, or the patient suffers from pulmonary hypertension).\r\n\r\n\'Living organ\' transplant[edit]\r\nIn February 2006, at the Bad Oeynhausen Clinic for Thorax and Cardiovascular Surgery, Germany, surgeons successfully transplanted a \'beating heart\' into a patient.[7] Rather than cooling the heart, the living organ procedure keeps it at body temperature and connects it to a special machine called an Organ Care System that allows it to continue pumping warm, oxygenated blood. This technique can maintain the heart in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method.\r\n\r\nNon-beating heart transplant[edit]\r\nThe first successful non-beating heart transplant was achieved in Australia in 2014, performed by cardiothoracic surgeon Kumud Dhital. The transplant was made possible by the development of preservation technology able to preserve a heart, resuscitate it and to assess the function of the heart. The first patient to have this surgery was 57-year-old Michelle Gribilas.[8] Papworth Hospital in England (where the first non-beating heart transplant in Europe was carried out) stated that the technique could increase the number of hearts available for transplant by at least 25\%. [9]\r\n\r\nPost-operative[edit]\r\n\r\nTransplanted heart in the thorax of recipient\r\nThe patient is taken to the ICU to recover. When they wake up, they move to a special recovery unit for rehabilitation. The duration of in-hospital, post-transplant care depends on the patient\'s general health, how well the heart is working, and the patient\'s ability to look after the new heart. Doctors typically prefer that patients leave the hospital 1â€“2 weeks after surgery, because of the risk of infection and presuming no complications. After release, the patient returns for regular check-ups and rehabilitation. They may also require emotional support. The frequency of hospital visits decreases as the patient adjusts to the transplant. The patient remains on immunosuppressant medication to avoid the possibility of rejection. Since the vagus nerve is severed during the operation, the new heart beats at around 100 beats per minute unless nerve regrowth occurs.\r\n\r\nImmunosuppressive agents are continued in the intensive care unit.\r\n\r\nThe patient is regularly monitored to detect rejection. This surveillance can be performed via frequent biopsy or a gene expression blood test known as AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing. Typically, biopsy is performed immediately post-transplant and then AlloMap replaces it once the patient is stable. The transition from biopsy to AlloMap can occur as soon as 55 days after the transplant.\r\n\r\nComplications[edit]\r\nPost-operative complications include infection, sepsis, organ rejection, as well as the side-effects of the immunosuppressive medication. Since the transplanted heart originates from another organism, the recipient\'s immune system typically attempts to reject it. The risk of rejection never fully goes away, and the patient will be on immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of his or her life, but these may cause unwanted side effects, such as increased likelihood of infections, like fevers, unusual pains, or any new feelings. Recipients can get kidney disease from a heart transplant. Many recent advances in reducing complications due to tissue rejection stem from mouse heart transplant procedures.[10] Surgery death rate is 5-10\% in 2011.[11] Hong Kong death rate is 5\% for 16 patients from beginning to 2014.[12]\r\n\r\nPrognosis[edit]\r\nThe prognosis for heart transplant patients following the orthotopic procedure has increased over the past 20 years, and as of June 5, 2009, the survival rates were:[13]\r\n\r\n1 year: 88.0\% (males), 86.2\% (females)\r\n3 years: 79.3\% (males), 77.2\% (females)\r\n5 years: 73.2\% (males), 69.0\% (females)\r\nIn a study spanning 1999 to 2007, conducted on behalf of the U.S. federal government by Dr. Eric Weiss of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, it was discovered that, compared to men receiving male hearts, \"men receiving female hearts had a 15\% increase in the risk of adjusted cumulative mortality\" over five years. No significant differences were noted with females receiving hearts from male or female donors.[14]\r\n\r\nNotable recipients[edit]\r\nAt the time of his death on August 10, 2009, Tony Huesman was the world\'s longest living heart transplant recipient, having survived for 30 years, 11 months and 10 days, before dying of cancer.[15] Huesman received a heart in 1978 at the age of 20 after viral pneumonia severely weakened his heart.[16] The operation was performed at Stanford University under heart transplant pioneer Dr. Norman Shumway.[17]\r\n\r\nAs of December 2013, the record holder for longest living heart recipient is Englishman John McCafferty, 71. He received his heart on 20 October 1982.[15]\r\n\r\nKelly Perkins climbs mountains around the world to promote positive awareness of organ donation. Perkins was the first recipient to climb the peaks of Mt. Fuji, Mt. Kilimanjaro, the Matterhorn, Mt.

In the 24 years after her transplant she became involved in publicity and charity work for the Red Cross, and promoted organ donation in Australia.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nRace car driver and manufacturer Carroll Shelby received a heart transplant in 1990.[19]\r\n\r\nGolfer Erik Compton qualified for the PGA Tour at age 32, after his second heart transplant.[20]\r\n\r\nFormer Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney received a heart transplant on March 24, 2012.[21]\r\n\r\nFormer chairman and founder of MCI Communications William G.

These conditions occur largely as a result of aging. Most people are in their late 50s when diagnosed, and more than one in ten people over 75 have it.\r\n\r\nEarly detection may improve outcomes from surgery.\r\n\r\nCollectively and anatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue makeup of the heart known as the cardiac skeleton. Valve problems may be congenital (inborn) or acquired (due to another cause later in life). Treatment may be with medication but often (depending on the severity) involves valve repair or replacement (insertion of an artificial heart valve). Specific situations include those where additional demands are made on the circulation, such as in pregnancy.[1]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Types\r\n1.1 Aortic and mitral valve disorders\r\n1.2 Pulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders\r\n2 Dysplasia\r\n3 Rheumatic disorders\r\n4 In pregnancy\r\n5 Comparison\r\n6 References\r\n7 External links\r\nTypes[edit]s\r\nPhonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png\r\nValve involved\tStenotic disease\tInsufficiency/regurgitation disease\r\nAortic valve\tAortic valve stenosis\tAortic insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nMitral valve\tMitral valve stenosis\tMitral insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nTricuspid valve\tTricuspid valve stenosis\tTricuspid insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nPulmonary valve\tPulmonary valve stenosis\tPulmonary insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nAortic and mitral valve disorders[edit]\r\nThese are termed left heart diseases.\r\n\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders[edit]\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve diseases are right heart diseases. Pulmonary valve diseases are the least common heart valve disease in adults.[2]\r\n\r\nThe most common types of pulmonary valve diseases are:\r\n\r\npulmonary valve stenosis\r\npulmonary valve insufficiency\r\npulmonary valve incompetence\r\npulmonary valve regurgitation\r\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases classifies non rheumatic pulmonary valve diseases as I37.\r\n\r\nBoth tricuspid and pulmonary valve diseases are less common than aortic or mitral valve diseases due to the lower pressure those valves experience.[2]\r\n\r\nDysplasia[edit]\r\nHeart valve dysplasia is an error in the development of any of the heart valves, and a common cause of congenital heart defects in humans as well as animals; tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect with four abnormalities, one of which is stenosis of the pulmonary valve. Ebstein\'s anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve.[1]\r\n\r\nRheumatic disorders[edit]\r\nValvular heart disease resulting from rheumatic fever is referred to as \"rheumatic heart disease\". While developed countries once had a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, medical advances and improved social conditions have dramatically reduced their incidence. Many developing countries, as well as indigenous populations within developed countries, still carry a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and there has been a resurgence in efforts to eradicate the diseases in these populations. Inflammation of the heart valves due to any cause is called endocarditis; this is usually due to bacterial infection but may also be due to cancer (marantic endocarditis), certain autoimmune conditions (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (Loeffler endocarditis). Certain medications have been associated with valvular heart disease, most prominently ergotamine derivatives pergolide and cabergoline.[3]\r\n\r\nIn pregnancy[edit]\r\nThe evaluation of individuals with valvular heart disease who are or wish to become pregnant is a difficult issue. Issues that have to be addressed include the risks during pregnancy to the mother and the developing fetus by the presence of maternal valvular heart disease as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy. Normal physiological changes during pregnancy require, on average, a 50\% increase in circulating blood volume that is accompanied by an increase in cardiac output that usually peaks between the midportion of the second and third trimesters.[4] The increased cardiac output is due to an increase in the stroke volume, and a small increase in heart rate, averaging 10 to 20 beats per minute.[4] Additionally uterine circulation and endogenous hormones cause systemic vascular resistance to decrease and a disproportionately lowering of diastolic blood pressure causes a wide pulse pressure.[4] Inferior vena caval obstruction from a gravid uterus in the supine position can result in an abrupt decrease in cardiac preload, which leads to hypotension with weakness and lightheadedness.[4] During labor and delivery cardiac output increases more in part due to the associated anxiety and pain, as well as due to uterine contractions which will cause an increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[4]\r\n\r\nValvular heart lesions associated with high maternal and fetal risk during pregnancy include:[4]\r\n\r\nSevere aortic stenosis with or without symptoms\r\nAortic regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nMitral stenosis with NYHA functional class II-IV symptoms\r\nMitral regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease resulting in severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary pressure greater than 75\% of systemic pressures)\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease with severe LV dysfunction (EF less than 0.40)\r\nMechanical prosthetic valve requiring anticoagulation\r\nMarfan syndrome with or without aortic regurgitation\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nIn individuals who require an artificial heart valve, consideration must be made for deterioration of the valve over time (for bioprosthetic valves) versus the risks of blood clotting in pregnancy with mechanical valves with the resultant need of drugs in pregnancy in the form of anticoagulation.\r\n\r\nComparison[edit]\r\nThe following table includes the main types of valvular stenosis and
