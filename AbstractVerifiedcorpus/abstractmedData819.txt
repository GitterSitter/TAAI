Epub2011 Apr 4.ACCF/AHA/HFSA 2011 survey results: current staffing profile of heart failureprograms, including programs that perform heart transplant and mechanicalcirculatory support device implantation: a report of the ACCF Heart Failure andTransplant Committee, AHA Heart Failure and Transplantation Committee, and Heart Failure Society of America.Jessup M, Albert NM, Lanfear DE, Lindenfeld J, Massie BM, Walsh MN, Zucker MJ.OBJECTIVES: There have been no published recommendations about staffing needs fora heart failure (HF) clinic or an office setting focused on heart transplant. Thegoal of this survey was to understand the current staffing environment of HF,transplant, and mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) programs in theUnited States and abroad. This report identifies current staffing patterns butdoes not endorse a particular staffing model.METHODS: An online survey, jointly sponsored by the American College ofCardiology Foundation (ACCF), American Heart Association (AHA), and the HeartFailure Society of America (HFSA), was sent to the members of all 3 organizationswho had identified themselves as interested in HF, heart transplant, or both,between March 12, 2009, and May 12, 2009.RESULTS: The overall response rate to the 1823 e-mail surveys was 23%. There were257 unique practices in the United States (81% of total sites) and 58international sites (19%); approximately 30% of centers were in a cardiovascular group practice and 30% in a medical school hospital setting. The large majorityof practices delivered HF care in both an inpatient and outpatient environment,and slightly more centers were implanting MCSDs (47%) than performing cardiactransplantation (39%). Most practices (43%) were small, with <4 staff members, orsmall- to medium-sized (34%), with 4 to 10 staff members, with only 23% beingmedium (11-20 staff) or large programs (>20 staff). On average, a US HF practice cared for 1641 outpatients annually. An average HF program with transplantperformed 10 transplants. Although larger programs were able to perform moretransplants and see more outpatient HF visits, their clinician staffing volumetended to double for approximately every 500 to 700 additional HF visitsannually. The average staffing utilization was 2.65 physician full-timeequivalents (FTEs), 2.21 nonphysician practitioner (nurse practitioner orphysician assistant) FTEs, and 2.61 nurse coordinator FTEs annually.CONCLUSIONS: The HF patient population is growing in number in the United States and internationally, and the clinicians who provide the highly skilled andtime-consuming care to this population are under intense scrutiny as a result of focused quality improvement initiatives and reduced financial resources. Staffingguidelines should be developed to ensure that an adequate number of qualifiedprofessionals are hired for a given practice volume. These survey results are an initial step in developing such standards.: 21470814  [pubmed - indexed for medline]820. circ heart fail. 2011 may;4(3):378-87. doi: 10.1161/hhf.0b013e3182186210. epub2011 apr 4.accf/aha/hfsa 2011 survey results: current staffing profile of heart failureprograms, including programs that perform heart transplant and mechanicalcirculatory support device implantation: a report of the accf heart failure andtransplant committee, aha heart failure and transplantation committee, and heart failure society of america.jessup m, albert nm, lanfear de, lindenfeld j, massie bm, walsh mn, zucker mj.objectives: there have been no published recommendations about staffing needs fora heart failure (hf) clinic or an office setting focused on heart transplant. thegoal of this survey was to understand the current staffing environment of hf,transplant, and mechanical circulatory support device (mcsd) programs in theunited states and abroad. this report identifies current staffing patterns butdoes not endorse a particular staffing model.methods: an online survey, jointly sponsored by the american college ofcardiology foundation (accf), american heart association (aha), and the heartfailure society of america (hfsa), was sent to the members of all 3 organizationswho had identified themselves as interested in hf, heart transplant, or both,between march 12, 2009, and may 12, 2009.results: the overall response rate to the 1823 e-mail surveys was 23%. there were257 unique practices in the united states (81% of total sites) and 58international sites (19%); approximately 30% of centers were in a cardiovascular group practice and 30% in a medical school hospital setting. the large majorityof practices delivered hf care in both an inpatient and outpatient environment,and slightly more centers were implanting mcsds (47%) than performing cardiactransplantation (39%). most practices (43%) were small, with <4 staff members, orsmall- to medium-sized (34%), with 4 to 10 staff members, with only 23% beingmedium (11-20 staff) or large programs (>20 staff). on average, a us hf practice cared for 1641 outpatients annually. an average hf program with transplantperformed 10 transplants. although larger programs were able to perform moretransplants and see more outpatient hf visits, their clinician staffing volumetended to double for approximately every 500 to 700 additional hf visitsannually. the average staffing utilization was 2.65 physician full-timeequivalents (ftes), 2.21 nonphysician practitioner (nurse practitioner orphysician assistant) ftes, and 2.61 nurse coordinator ftes annually.conclusions: the hf patient population is growing in number in the united states and internationally, and the clinicians who provide the highly skilled andtime-consuming care to this population are under intense scrutiny as a result of focused quality improvement initiatives and reduced financial resources. staffingguidelines should be developed to ensure that an adequate number of qualifiedprofessionals are hired for a given practice volume. these survey results are an initial step in developing such standards.
