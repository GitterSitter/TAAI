Analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing(UNOS).Everitt MD(1), Donaldson AE, Stehlik J, Kaza AK, Budge D, Alharethi R, BullockEA, Kfoury AG, Yetman AT.Author information: (1)University of Utah, and Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Primary Children'sMedical Center, 100 Mario Capecchi Drive, Salt Lake City, UT 84113, USA.melanie.everitt@imail.orgBACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) now survive intoadulthood and often present with end-stage heart failure (HF). HF management and approach to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) may differ from adults without CHD.We sought to compare OHT waitlist characteristics and outcomes for these 2groups.METHODS: The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to identify adults (â‰¥18 years) listed for OHT from 2005 to 2009. The cohort was divided into those with or without CHD.RESULTS: Of 9,722 adults included, 314 (3%) had CHD. Adults with CHD were younger(35 Â± 13 vs 52 Â± 12 years, p < 0.01) and more often had undergone prior cardiacsurgery (85% vs. 34%, p < 0.01). Patients with CHD were less likely to have adefibrillator (44% vs 75%, p < 0.01) or ventricular assist device (5% vs 14%, p <0.01) and were more likely to be listed at the lowest urgency status thanpatients without CHD (64% vs 44%, p < 0.01). Fewer CHD patients achieved OHT (53%vs 65%, p < 0.001). Although overall waitlist mortality did not differ betweengroups (10% vs 8%, p = 0.15), patients with CHD were more likely to experiencecardiovascular death (60% vs 40%, p = 0.03), including sudden in 44% and due toHF in 16%.CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower urgency status, patients with CHD have greatercardiovascular mortality awaiting OHT than those without. Increased defibrillatoruse could improve survival to OHT, because sudden death is common. VAD supportmay benefit select patients, but experience in CHD is limited. Referral tospecialized adult congenital heart centers can enhance utilization of devicetherapies and potentially improve waitlist outcomes.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
