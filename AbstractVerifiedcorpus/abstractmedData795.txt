Thegoal of this survey was to understand the current staffing environment of HF,transplant, and mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) programs in theUnited States and abroad. This report identifies current staffing patterns butdoes not endorse a particular staffing model.METHODS: An online survey, jointly sponsored by the American College ofCardiology Foundation (ACCF), American Heart Association (AHA), and the HeartFailure Society of America (HFSA), was sent to the members of all 3Â organizationswho had identified themselves as interested in HF, heart transplant, or both,between March 12, 2009, and May 12, 2009.RESULTS: The overall response rate to the 1,823Â e-mail surveys was 23%. Therewere 257Â unique practices in the United States (81% of total sites) and58Â international sites (19%); approximately 30% of centers were in acardiovascular group practice and 30% in a medical school hospital setting. Thelarge majority of practices delivered HF care in both an inpatient and outpatientenvironment, and slightly more centers were implanting MCSDs (47%) thanperforming cardiac transplantation (39%). Most practices (43%) were small, with<4Â staff members, or small- to medium-sized (34%), with 4Â to 10Â staff members,with only 23% being medium (11-20Â staff) or large programs (>20Â staff). Onaverage, a U.S. HF practice cared for 1,641Â outpatients annually. An average HFprogram with transplant performed 10Â transplants. Although larger programs wereable to perform more transplants and see more outpatient HF visits, theirclinician staffing volume tended to double for approximately every 500Â to700Â additional HF visits annually. The average staffing utilization was2.65Â physician full-time equivalents (FTEs), 2.21Â nonphysician practitioner(nurse practitioner or physician assistant) FTEs, and 2.61Â nurse coordinator FTEsannually.CONCLUSIONS: The HF patient population is growing in number in the United States and internationally, and the clinicians who provide the highly skilled andtime-consuming care to this population are under intense scrutiny as a result of focused quality improvement initiatives and reduced financial resources. Staffingguidelines should be developed to ensure that an adequate number of qualifiedprofessionals are hired for a given practice volume. These survey results are an initial step in developing such standards.Copyright Â© 2011.
