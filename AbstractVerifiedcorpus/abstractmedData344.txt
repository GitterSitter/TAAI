Electronic address: ann.karimova@gosh.nhs.uk.BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is used to support children withend-stage heart failure to heart transplant.METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 7 years' experience with theBerlin Heart (BH) EXCOR (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin Germany) paracorporealventricular assist device (VAD) in 2 United Kingdom (UK) pediatric hearttransplant centers and the effect of this program on the UK pediatric hearttransplant service.RESULTS: Of 102 children who received BH support, 84% survived to transplant orBH explant and 81% survived to discharge. Neither age nor duration of supportinfluenced outcome. Stroke, ongoing requirement for ventilation while on BH, and diagnosis other than dilated cardiomyopathy were the only independent mortalityrisk factors. Children who weighed < 20 kg had significantly (p = 0.03) longersupport times than bigger children. The number of children treated with a BHincreased over time (p = 0.01). Currently > 50% of pediatric heart transplantsare bridged with a BH; however, pediatric transplants per year have not increasedsignificantly (p = 0.07) CONCLUSIONS: BH use in the UK has allowed significantincreases in the number of children with end-stage heart failure who can besuccessfully bridged to transplant and the length of time they can be supported. The total number of transplants has not increased.Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
