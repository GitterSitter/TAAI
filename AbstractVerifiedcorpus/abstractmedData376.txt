Epub 2013 Aug 6.Organ allocation in adults with congenital heart disease listed for hearttransplant: impact of ventricular assist devices.Gelow JM(1), Song HK, Weiss JB, Mudd JO, Broberg CS.Author information: (1)Heart Failure Transplant Program, Knight Cardiovascular Institute, OregonHealth and Science University, Portland, Oregon.Comment in    J Heart Lung Transplant. 2013 Nov;32(11):1052-3.BACKGROUND: Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) listed for hearttransplantation are rarely supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs). Thismay be a disadvantage to their priority for organ allocation. We sought todetermine the relationship between VAD implantation and successfultransplantation among patients listed for heart transplant.METHODS: Adults with CHD patients (N = 1,250) were identified from the UnitedNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2010 and compared topatients without congenital etiology for heart failure (N = 59,606). VAD use atlisting, listing status, status upgrades and reasons for upgrade prior totransplant were trended at 5-year intervals and appropriate statisticalcomparisons were made between groups.RESULTS: Since 1985, VAD use prior to transplant has increased significantly inpatients without CHD, but not in CHD patients (17% vs 3% in 2006 to 2010, p <0.0001). CHD patients were more likely to be listed as Status 2, compared tothose without (66% vs 40%, p < 0.001 for 2006 to 2010), and less likely to beupgraded to Status 1 after listing (43% vs 55%, p = 0.03). Among those upgradedto Status 1, CHD patients were less likely to have a VAD at transplant than thosewithout (3% vs 18%, p = 0.005). VAD use was more likely to result in death in CHDpatients.CONCLUSIONS: VAD use is less common in CHD patients than in patients without CHD,both at the time of listing and transplantation. Reduced VAD use appears tocontribute to lower listing status and organ allocation. These differences havegrown more disparate over time. Separate criteria for organ allocation for CHDpatients may be justified.Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
