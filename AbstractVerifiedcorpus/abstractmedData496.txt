Unloading of the left ventricle with animplantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonaryvascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in acohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy.METHODS: Pulmonary haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eightHeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplantby virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7%(24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortalitywas 7.7% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91% (10 of 11). Baseline and post-VAD pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic PAP (mmHg), meanPAP, TPG (mmHg) of 57 Â± 9.5, 42 Â± 4.4 and 14 Â± 3.9 reduced to 32 Â± 7.5, 18 Â± 5.5 and 9 Â± 3.3, respectively. PVR reduced from 5 Â± 1.5 to 2.1 Â± 0.5 Wood units (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In selected heart failure patients with secondary PH, use ofcentrifugal LVAD results in significant reductions in PAP, TPG and PVR, which areobserved within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months. Such patients bridged tocandidacy have post-transplant survival comparable with those having a hearttransplant as primary treatment.: 23352390  [pubmed - indexed for medline]497. eur j cardiothorac surg. 2013 jun;43(6):1237-42. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs678. epub 2013 jan 22.use of centrifugal left ventricular assist device as a bridge to candidacy insevere heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension.kutty rs(1), parameshwar j, lewis c, catarino pa, sudarshan cd, jenkins dp,dunning jj, tsui ss.author information: (1)department of cardiothoracic surgery, the transplant unit, papworth hospital, cambridge, uk. ramesh.kutty@papworth.nhs.ukcomment in    eur j cardiothorac surg. 2013 jun;43(6):1242-3.objectives: raised pulmonary artery pressure (pap), trans-pulmonary gradient(tpg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) are risk factors for poor outcomes after heart transplant in patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (ph) andmay contraindicate transplant. unloading of the left ventricle with animplantable left ventricular assist device (lvad) may reverse these pulmonaryvascular changes. we studied the effect of implanting centrifugal lvads in acohort of patients with secondary ph as a bridge to candidacy.methods: pulmonary haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal lvads at a single unit between may 2005 and december 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.results: twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal lvads (eightheartware ventricular assist device (hvad), heartware international, usa and 21ventrassist, ventracor ltd., australia). seventeen were ineligible for transplantby virtue of high tpg/pvr. all the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon pump followed by lvad insertion. four required temporary right vad support.thirty-day mortality post-lvad was 3.4% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7%(24 of 28). thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortalitywas 7.7% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91% (10 of 11). baseline and post-vad pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic pap (mmhg), meanpap, tpg (mmhg) of 57 â± 9.5, 42 â± 4.4 and 14 â± 3.9 reduced to 32 â± 7.5, 18 â± 5.5 and 9 â± 3.3, respectively. pvr reduced from 5 â± 1.5 to 2.1 â± 0.5 wood units (p < 0.05).conclusions: in selected heart failure patients with secondary ph, use ofcentrifugal lvad results in significant reductions in pap, tpg and pvr, which areobserved within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months. such patients bridged tocandidacy have post-transplant survival comparable with those having a hearttransplant as primary treatment.
