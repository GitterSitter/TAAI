The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy ofstandard adult VADs in adolescents and children as well as report our earlyexperience with miniaturized VADs in small children.METHODS: A 15-year retrospective review was performed on all patients youngerthan 18 years of age undergoing insertion of a pulsatile VAD at our institution.RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent VAD placement during the study period. Themean age was 12 (range, 6 months to 18 years), with a mean body surface area of1.48 (range, 0.25 to 2.3 m2). Diagnoses included dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 15),myocarditis (n = 2), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure (n = 1). Ten childrenunderwent insertion of biventricular VADs, and 8 had implantation of leftventricular VADs. The mean support duration was 57 days (range, 2 to 175 days).Complications included bleeding requiring reoperation (n = 4), stroke (n = 5),and device-related infection (n = 2). Outcomes of VAD support were as follows:VAD explantation in 1 case, death while receiving mechanical support in 3patients, and successful transplantation in 14 patients (77%). Survival at 6months after orthotopic heart transplantation was 93% with 1-year and 5-yearsurvival rates of 83%.CONCLUSIONS: Currently available VADs are applicable for use as a bridge toorthotopic heart transplantation or in rare instances for myocardial recovery.The increasing accessibility of miniaturized devices allow for long-term support in smaller children and infants while awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation. Although the perioperative morbidity and mortality of VAD placement is notinsignificant, survival for those who receive a heart transplant is excellent.: 16937036  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1363. ann thorac surg. 2006 sep;82(3):926-32.ventricular assist device support in children and adolescents as a bridge toheart transplantation.sharma ms(1), webber sa, morell vo, gandhi sk, wearden pd, buchanan jr, kormosrl.author information: (1)department of cardiothoracic surgery, the university of pittsburgh school ofmedicine, children's hospital of pittsburgh, pittsburgh, pennsylvania 15213, usa.sharmams@upmc.educomment in    ann thorac surg. 2006 sep;82(3):933.comment on    ann thorac surg. 2006 sep;82(3):917-24; discussion 924-5.background: mechanical circulatory support using ventricular assist devices(vads) is a life-saving option for children in heart failure refractory tomaximal medical management. the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy ofstandard adult vads in adolescents and children as well as report our earlyexperience with miniaturized vads in small children.methods: a 15-year retrospective review was performed on all patients youngerthan 18 years of age undergoing insertion of a pulsatile vad at our institution.results: eighteen patients underwent vad placement during the study period. themean age was 12 (range, 6 months to 18 years), with a mean body surface area of1.48 (range, 0.25 to 2.3 m2). diagnoses included dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 15),myocarditis (n = 2), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure (n = 1). ten childrenunderwent insertion of biventricular vads, and 8 had implantation of leftventricular vads. the mean support duration was 57 days (range, 2 to 175 days).complications included bleeding requiring reoperation (n = 4), stroke (n = 5),and device-related infection (n = 2). outcomes of vad support were as follows:vad explantation in 1 case, death while receiving mechanical support in 3patients, and successful transplantation in 14 patients (77%). survival at 6months after orthotopic heart transplantation was 93% with 1-year and 5-yearsurvival rates of 83%.conclusions: currently available vads are applicable for use as a bridge toorthotopic heart transplantation or in rare instances for myocardial recovery.the increasing accessibility of miniaturized devices allow for long-term support in smaller children and infants while awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation. although the perioperative morbidity and mortality of vad placement is notinsignificant, survival for those who receive a heart transplant is excellent.
