Ann Thorac Surg. 1991 Jan;51(1):43-7.Mechanical circulatory assistance after heart transplantation.Emery RW(1), Eales F, Joyce LD, Von Rueden TJ, King RM, Jorgensen CR, PritzkerMR, Johnson KE, Lake KD, Arom KV.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Transplantation, Minneapolis Heart Institute/AbbottNorthwestern Hospital, Minnesota.From October 1985 through December 1989, 92 heart transplant procedures wereperformed in 89 patients. Nine patients (aged 19 to 66 years; 7 male, 2 female)required mechanical circulatory support after transplantation because of primary idiopathic organ failure (n = 2), implant difficulty (2), poor organ quality (2),or acute right heart failure (3). Devices used included the intraaortic balloonpump (6), centrifugal right ventricular assist device (2), left ventricularassist (1), biventricular assists (2), and total artificial heart (1). Twopatients required multiple devices. One patient underwent retransplantation.Implant time ranged from 1 to 18 days. One early death occurred owing to rightheart failure 6 days after transplantation, 7 hours after removal of a rightventricular assist device, for an overall mortality of 11%. The remaining 8patients are alive 4 months to 28 months after transplantation. The actuarial1-year survival of 89% +/- 10% compares well with the survival of 87% +/- 4% for the entire transplant group. All surviving patients are in functional class I.Echocardiographic examination in all patients revealed left ventricular ejection fraction to be normal in 7 and depressed in 1. Extending the criteria for organdonors or difficulty with the implant procedure can lead to early organ failure, which may be reversible with circulatory assistance allowing excellent survival.: 2018649  [pubmed - indexed for medline]2095. ann thorac surg. 1991 jan;51(1):43-7.mechanical circulatory assistance after heart transplantation.emery rw(1), eales f, joyce ld, von rueden tj, king rm, jorgensen cr, pritzkermr, johnson ke, lake kd, arom kv.author information: (1)division of cardiothoracic transplantation, minneapolis heart institute/abbottnorthwestern hospital, minnesota.from october 1985 through december 1989, 92 heart transplant procedures wereperformed in 89 patients. nine patients (aged 19 to 66 years; 7 male, 2 female)required mechanical circulatory support after transplantation because of primary idiopathic organ failure (n = 2), implant difficulty (2), poor organ quality (2),or acute right heart failure (3). devices used included the intraaortic balloonpump (6), centrifugal right ventricular assist device (2), left ventricularassist (1), biventricular assists (2), and total artificial heart (1). twopatients required multiple devices. one patient underwent retransplantation.implant time ranged from 1 to 18 days. one early death occurred owing to rightheart failure 6 days after transplantation, 7 hours after removal of a rightventricular assist device, for an overall mortality of 11%. the remaining 8patients are alive 4 months to 28 months after transplantation. the actuarial1-year survival of 89% +/- 10% compares well with the survival of 87% +/- 4% for the entire transplant group. all surviving patients are in functional class i.echocardiographic examination in all patients revealed left ventricular ejection fraction to be normal in 7 and depressed in 1. extending the criteria for organdonors or difficulty with the implant procedure can lead to early organ failure, which may be reversible with circulatory assistance allowing excellent survival.
