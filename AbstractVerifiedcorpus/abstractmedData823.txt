In end-of-life situations,decisions must be made about when to deactivate LVAD support. Previous studieshave demonstrated that end-of-life planning, particularly with the use of advancedirectives (ADs), can clarify patients' end-of-life preferences when they areunable to speak for themselves. However, many patients do not have ADs, and amongpatients who do, the ADs may lack useful information on how to guide caresurrogates and clinicians regarding patients' preferences on life-sustainingtreatments. The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 68 patients withadvanced heart failure (56 men [82%]; mean [standard deviation] age, 59.0 Â± 12.2 years) who underwent LVAD implantation between March 2003 and January 2009. Theindication for the LVAD was destination therapy in 36 (53%) patients and bridgeto heart transplant in 32 (47%) patients. Overall, 32 (47%) patients had ADs ofvarying types; 25 (78%) ADs were completed before LVAD implantation. Althoughlife-sustaining treatments (eg, tube feeding, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis) were mentioned, none explicitlymentioned the LVAD or withdrawal of LVAD support at the end of life. Wehypothesize that if instructions regarding LVAD management in ADs are explicit,surrogate and clinician distress may decrease, and ethical dilemmas may beavoided.: 21444048  [pubmed - indexed for medline]824. hosp pract (1995). 2011 feb;39(1):78-84. doi: 10.3810/hp.2011.02.377.the use of advance directives among patients with left ventricular assistdevices.swetz km(1), mueller ps, ottenberg al, dib c, freeman mr, sulmasy dp.author information: (1)division of general internal medicine, mayo clinic, rochester, mn 55905, usa. swetz.keith@mayo.edupatients who undergo implantation of left ventricular assist devices (lvads)often have improved quality of life, but may eventually succumb to their heartfailure and/or sustain lvad-related complications. in end-of-life situations,decisions must be made about when to deactivate lvad support. previous studieshave demonstrated that end-of-life planning, particularly with the use of advancedirectives (ads), can clarify patients' end-of-life preferences when they areunable to speak for themselves. however, many patients do not have ads, and amongpatients who do, the ads may lack useful information on how to guide caresurrogates and clinicians regarding patients' preferences on life-sustainingtreatments. the authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 68 patients withadvanced heart failure (56 men [82%]; mean [standard deviation] age, 59.0 â± 12.2 years) who underwent lvad implantation between march 2003 and january 2009. theindication for the lvad was destination therapy in 36 (53%) patients and bridgeto heart transplant in 32 (47%) patients. overall, 32 (47%) patients had ads ofvarying types; 25 (78%) ads were completed before lvad implantation. althoughlife-sustaining treatments (eg, tube feeding, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis) were mentioned, none explicitlymentioned the lvad or withdrawal of lvad support at the end of life. wehypothesize that if instructions regarding lvad management in ads are explicit,surrogate and clinician distress may decrease, and ethical dilemmas may beavoided.
