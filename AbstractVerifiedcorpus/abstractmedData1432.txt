Transplant Proc. 2005 Oct;37(8):3321-2.Bridge to heart transplantation with the HeartMate device in Gothenburg, Sweden.Liden H(1), Wierup P, Westerberg M, Nilsson F, Wiklund L.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.BACKGROUND: Patients rapidly deteriorating while waiting for hearttransplantation present a major problem. Our strategy for this entity is theHeartMate left ventricular assist device (LVAD) VELVAS, an electrically drivenimplantable LVAD. Herein we report our initial experience.METHODS: The medical records of all the patients who received HeartMate LVAS atour institution were reviewed.RESULTS: From January 1997 through May 2004, 19 patients received a HeartMate.The mean age was 39 (15 to 61) years and 84% were men. The diagnoses were:dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 8), ischemic heart disease (n = 6), myocarditis (n = 3), congenital heart disease (n = 1), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 1).Mean time on LVAD was 113 (10 to 353) days. Ten patients were discharged from thehospital to their homes awaiting transplant or recovery. Three patients showedrecovery of heart function and were subsequently weaned from mechanical support. Thirteen patients underwent heart transplantation. Three patients died duringLVAD treatment. Major adverse events occurred in nine patients, including severe right heart failure (n = 3), severe bleeding (n = 3), stroke (n = 1), hepaticfailure (n = 1), and septicemia (n = 2). Nine of the 13 transplanted patients arealive and well today.CONCLUSION: HeartMate LVAS is a valuable option for patients rapidlydeteriorating while awaiting a heart transplant. Our results are comparable with those reported from larger centers.: 16299019  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1433. transplant proc. 2005 oct;37(8):3321-2.bridge to heart transplantation with the heartmate device in gothenburg, sweden.liden h(1), wierup p, westerberg m, nilsson f, wiklund l.author information: (1)department of cardiothoracic surgery, sahlgrenska university hospital, 413 45 gothenburg, sweden.background: patients rapidly deteriorating while waiting for hearttransplantation present a major problem. our strategy for this entity is theheartmate left ventricular assist device (lvad) velvas, an electrically drivenimplantable lvad. herein we report our initial experience.methods: the medical records of all the patients who received heartmate lvas atour institution were reviewed.results: from january 1997 through may 2004, 19 patients received a heartmate.the mean age was 39 (15 to 61) years and 84% were men. the diagnoses were:dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 8), ischemic heart disease (n = 6), myocarditis (n = 3), congenital heart disease (n = 1), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 1).mean time on lvad was 113 (10 to 353) days. ten patients were discharged from thehospital to their homes awaiting transplant or recovery. three patients showedrecovery of heart function and were subsequently weaned from mechanical support. thirteen patients underwent heart transplantation. three patients died duringlvad treatment. major adverse events occurred in nine patients, including severe right heart failure (n = 3), severe bleeding (n = 3), stroke (n = 1), hepaticfailure (n = 1), and septicemia (n = 2). nine of the 13 transplanted patients arealive and well today.conclusion: heartmate lvas is a valuable option for patients rapidlydeteriorating while awaiting a heart transplant. our results are comparable with those reported from larger centers.
