However, thromboembolicevents, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. Weretrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in apediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a leftVAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwentheart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient isstill on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days ofassistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of ninepatients (56%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When comparedwith noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and alonger length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced forthromboembolic issues, most of them (67%) in patients with VAD-relatedinfections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BHendocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venouscatheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinarycatheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanicalventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Ofthe 17 isolated pathogens, 53% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence ofPseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25%),three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50% of all isolated pseudomonads),and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiactransplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients withinfected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospitalwith increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.Â© 2011, Copyright the Authors.
