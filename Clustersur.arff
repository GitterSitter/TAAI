However, expansion of this technology is still limited by      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential to      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor       may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditional      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may       also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.      Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to       outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base to      support these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potential      predictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely a      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive      techniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,      recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements and      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting of      CF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) consider      potential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTN      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new      reliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research and      management possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the       CF-LVAD patient population move forward.FAU - Wasson, Lauren TAU  - Wasson LTAD  - NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center, 622 West 168th Street,       PH12-134, New York, NY, 10032-3720, USA.FAU - Yuzefpolskaya, MelanaAU  - Yuzefpolskaya MFAU - Wakabayashi, MichiyoriAU  - Wakabayashi MFAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HFAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YFAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NFAU - Jorde, Ulrich PAU  - Jorde UPFAU - Demmer, Ryan TAU  - Demmer RTFAU - Colombo, Paolo CAU  - Colombo PCLA  - engGR  - T32 HL007343/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Fail RevJT  - Heart failure reviewsJID - 9612481SB  - IMPMC - PMC4385742MID - NIHMS633555OID - NLM: NIHMS633555 [Available on 05/01/16]OID - NLM: PMC4385742 [Available on 05/01/16]EDAT- 2014/10/07 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/07 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/07 06:00PMCR- 2016/05/01 00:00AID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2015 May;20(3):317-22. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3.- 25283767own - nlmstat- in-data-reviewda  - 20150404lr  - 20150406is  - 1573-7322 (electronic)is  - 1382-4147 (linking)vi  - 20ip  - 3dp  - 2015 mayti  - hypertension: an unstudied potential risk factor for adverse outcomes during      continuous flow ventricular assist device support.pg  - 317-22lid - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]ab  - in end-stage heart failure, left ventricular assist devices (lvads) represent an       exciting new frontier in which post-device implantation survival approaches that       of heart transplant. however, expansion of this technology is still limited by      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. thus, it is essential to      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. one such predictor       may be hypertension (htn). not only may chronic htn as a traditional      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term lvad support, but htn may       also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.      although current guidelines identify blood pressure (bp) control as important to       outpatient continuous flow (cf) lvad management, there is no evidence base to      support these guidelines. indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation htn as a potential      predictor of adverse cf-lvad outcomes. htn among cf-lvad patients is likely a      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive      techniques to measure bp in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. fortunately,      recent research has elucidated the meaning of doppler bp measurements and      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for bp measurements in the setting of      cf-lvad support. therefore, cf-lvad researchers and clinicians may (1) consider      potential mechanisms relating htn to poor outcomes, (2) realize that htn      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new      reliable and valid methods for outpatient bp measurement that make research and      management possible. it is critical and now feasible that research on htn in the       cf-lvad patient population move forward.fau - wasson, lauren tau  - wasson ltad  - newyork-presbyterian, columbia university medical center, 622 west 168th street,       ph12-134, new york, ny, 10032-3720, usa.fau - yuzefpolskaya, melanaau  - yuzefpolskaya mfau - wakabayashi, michiyoriau  - wakabayashi mfau - takayama, hirooau  - takayama hfau - naka, yoshifumiau  - naka yfau - uriel, nirau  - uriel nfau - jorde, ulrich pau  - jorde upfau - demmer, ryan tau  - demmer rtfau - colombo, paolo cau  - colombo pcla  - enggr  - t32 hl007343/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statespt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - heart fail revjt  - heart failure reviewsjid - 9612481sb  - impmc - pmc4385742mid - nihms633555oid - nlm: nihms633555 [available on 05/01/16]oid - nlm: pmc4385742 [available on 05/01/16]edat- 2014/10/07 06:00mhda- 2014/10/07 06:00crdt- 2014/10/07 06:00pmcr- 2016/05/01 00:00aid - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - heart fail rev. 2015 may;20(3):317-22. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3.'

Thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,      refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricular      assist device (VAD) therapy. The program, supported and funded by the national      healthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical Center for      the operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.      Regional VAD coordinators are educated by the National Center. They are in charge      of regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription,       and continuing patients\\ and caregivers\\ education, mainly regarding driveline      exit site dressing and driveline stabilization. From November 2011 to November      2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support      (LVAD): HeartMate II, n=70, HeartWare, n=25. Mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37\\\%       of the patients were males. Most patients had INTERMACS profile 4 (55\\\%), followed      by 3 and 2 (17\\\% each). Symptomatic and functional improvement are testified by      changes from baseline to month 3 of NYHA functional class (from III-IV to I-II),       results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and NT-proBNP levels (from      6997 to 1126 pg/ml). Overall 1-year survival was 69\\\%, with a trend for outcome      improvement over time and a relationship with preoperative INTERMACS profile      (1-year survival of 60\\\% in patients with INTERMACS profile 1-2 vs 75\\\% in those      with INTERMACS profile 3-4). In summary, where and when a heart transplant      program cannot be implemented, LVAD represents a realistic therapeutic      alternative. The key points for a successful VAD program are a dedicated, highly       specialized multidisciplinary team at the Cardiac Surgery Center, an      infrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,      adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.FAU - Bekbossynov, SerikAU  - Bekbossynov SFAU - Medressova, AsselAU  - Medressova AFAU - Murzagaliyev, MuradymAU  - Murzagaliyev MFAU - Salov, RomanAU  - Salov RFAU - Dzhetybayeva, SaltanatAU  - Dzhetybayeva SFAU - Andossova, SaltanatAU  - Andossova SFAU - Bekbossynova, MakhabbatAU  - Bekbossynova MFAU - Pya, YuriyAU  - Pya YLA  - itaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Programma chirurgico per il trattamento dell\\insufficienza cardiaca -      l\\esperienza del Kazakhstan.PL  - ItalyTA  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome)JT  - Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)JID - 101263411SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - KazakhstanMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/04/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/03 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/29 06:00AID - 10.1714/1463.16161 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome). 2014 Mar;15(3):144-8. doi: 10.1714/1463.16161.- 24770427own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140428dcom- 20140902is  - 1827-6806 (print)is  - 1827-6806 (linking)vi  - 15ip  - 3dp  - 2014 marti  - [surgical heart failure treatment program - the experience of kazakhstan].pg  - 144-8lid - 10.1714/1463.16161 [doi]ab  - in kazakhstan, geographical and cultural reasons do not favor the development of       heart transplant activity. thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,      refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricular      assist device (vad) therapy. the program, supported and funded by the national      healthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical center for      the operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.      regional vad coordinators are educated by the national center. they are in charge      of regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription,       and continuing patients\\ and caregivers\\ education, mainly regarding driveline      exit site dressing and driveline stabilization. from november 2011 to november      2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support      (lvad): heartmate ii, n=70, heartware, n=25. mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37\\\%       of the patients were males. most patients had intermacs profile 4 (55\\\%), followed      by 3 and 2 (17\\\% each). symptomatic and functional improvement are testified by      changes from baseline to month 3 of nyha functional class (from iii-iv to i-ii),       results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and nt-probnp levels (from      6997 to 1126 pg/ml). overall 1-year survival was 69\\\%, with a trend for outcome      improvement over time and a relationship with preoperative intermacs profile      (1-year survival of 60\\\% in patients with intermacs profile 1-2 vs 75\\\% in those      with intermacs profile 3-4). in summary, where and when a heart transplant      program cannot be implemented, lvad represents a realistic therapeutic      alternative. the key points for a successful vad program are a dedicated, highly       specialized multidisciplinary team at the cardiac surgery center, an      infrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,      adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.fau - bekbossynov, serikau  - bekbossynov sfau - medressova, asselau  - medressova afau - murzagaliyev, muradymau  - murzagaliyev mfau - salov, romanau  - salov rfau - dzhetybayeva, saltanatau  - dzhetybayeva sfau - andossova, saltanatau  - andossova sfau - bekbossynova, makhabbatau  - bekbossynova mfau - pya, yuriyau  - pya yla  - itapt  - english abstractpt  - journal articlett  - programma chirurgico per il trattamento dell\\insufficienza cardiaca -      l\\esperienza del kazakhstan.pl  - italyta  - g ital cardiol (rome)jt  - giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)jid - 101263411sb  - immh  - adolescentmh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - childmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/*surgerymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - kazakhstanmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - young adultedat- 2014/04/29 06:00mhda- 2014/09/03 06:00crdt- 2014/04/29 06:00aid - 10.1714/1463.16161 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - g ital cardiol (rome). 2014 mar;15(3):144-8. doi: 10.1714/1463.16161.'

The purpose of this review is to discuss four      sub-classifications of cardiogenic shock patients (acute myocardial infarction,      acute decompensated heart failure, biventricular failure, and myocarditis), and      explore management considerations for these groups, with particular emphasis on      strategies for device placement. RECENT FINDINGS: In single-center studies, the      use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, percutaneous ventricular assist      devices, and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has allowed      approximately half of cardiogenic shock patients to receive an implantable left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant, or experience myocardial      recovery. Primary implantation of a durable LVAD in well-selected myocardial      infarction shock patients was associated with a 1-year survival of 86\\\% in one      small case series. Analysis of a multi-institutional database suggests patients      older than 65 years have a lower post-implantation survival compared with younger      recipients. SUMMARY: Device selection strategies for INTERMACS I patients are      predicated on a patient\\s prognosis, hemodynamic stability, end organ, and      neurologic status. Percutaneous assist devices may be preferred for patients with      favorable prognoses, ECMO for patients with hemodynamic compromise, and durable      mechanical support for patients failing to recover sustainable myocardial      function after short-term device use.FAU - Dutt, Debleena PainAU  - Dutt DPAD  - Zena and Michael A.

The goal of this study was to measure the impact of this      allosensitization on outcomes. METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed      in BTT patients, with sensitization defined as peak PRAs >/= 10\\\%. Baseline      characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using      descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. RESULTS:      Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21      non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47\\\% vs. 10\\\%, p =       0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular      rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).      Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection      (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier      log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of       infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9\\\% vs. 19.0\\\%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION:      Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. This mortality      appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the      development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.CI  - (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and third      generation LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimate      comparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flow      LVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A      semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHS costs data and patient      data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database (BTDB). Quality-adjusted      life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY were calculated for patients      receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotrope supported medical      management. LVADs cost pound80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices and delivered      greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilistic incremental       cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95\\\%CI:      pound31,802- pound94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates       were sensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of      receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the      device cost by 15\\\% decreased the ICER to pound50,106 ($79,533)/QALY. CONCLUSIONS:      Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefits at higher      costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK threshold of      pound20,000 to pound30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now      begins to approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently      recommended by the British NHS. Cost-effectiveness estimates are hampered by the       lack of randomized trials.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were      implanted with a CF-LVAD between January 2008 and June 2014. Eighty-five patients      were implanted with the device as a bridge to transplant (BTT); the remaining (n       = 43) were on destination therapy (DT). Each group was divided into patients <65       years old and >/=65 years old at device implantation. Patients were followed up      for at least 24 months or until transplant or death. RESULTS: Eighty-five      patients (66\\\%) received a CF-LVAD as BTT. Patients >/=65 years old (n = 8) had a       lower preoperative cardiac index and prothrombin time-international normalized      ratio (P = 0.009), and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (P = 0.008).      Adverse events including infections, re-exploration for bleeding, ischaemic and      haemorrhagic stroke, renal failure and right heart failure were comparable in      both age groups. Eighty-two percent (n = 63) of the young patients and 75\\\% (n =      6) of the older patients, who were on LVAD as BTT, underwent heart transplant      within the first 24 months of LVAD implantation. Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and      24 months were 95, 95, 77 and 70\\\%, respectively, post-CF-LVAD implantation as BTT      for the younger group and 73\\\% for the older group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P =      0.35). Forty-three patients (34\\\%) received a CF-LVAD as DT. Patients >/=65 years       old (n = 14) on DT had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular disease (P =      0.048), higher serum sodium (P = 0.004) and serum creatinine values (P = 0.002),       preoperatively. There were more strokes in the older patients post-LAVD      implantation (14 vs 0\\\%; P = 0.048). Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months      were 85, 79, 75 and 62\\\%, respectively, for the younger group and 93, 77, 67 and      34\\\% for the older group, respectively (P = 0.26). CONCLUSION: This study      demonstrates that LVAD therapy can be used in the older patients with acceptable       mortality and morbidity, and age alone should not be used as the sole criterion      for exclusion from LVAD implantation.CI  - (c) The Author 2015.

The purpose of this study was to      evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD in      end-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in the      Netherlands. METHODS: A third-generation LVAD was implanted in 16 heart failure      patients (age 61 +/- 8; 81 \\\% male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20 +/- 6 \\\%)      as destination therapy. All patients were ineligible for heart transplant. At      baseline, 3 and 6 months, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class,      quality-of-life and exercise capacity were assessed. Clinical adverse events were      registered. RESULTS: Survival at 30 days and 6 months was 88 and 75 \\\%,      respectively. In the postoperative phase, 6 (38 \\\%) patients required continuous      veno-venous haemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13 \\\%) patients required      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure.       During follow-up, NYHA functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7 +/-      0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 57 +/- 5 to 23 +/- 3 at 6 months (P < 0.001),      respectively. The 6 min walking distance improved from 168 +/- 42 m to 291 +/- 29      m at 6 months (P = 0.001).

However, due to the limited      availability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)      have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patients      with refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with the      HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as a      bridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was a      retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVAD      implantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were       classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support       (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-heart      transplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 years      old (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart      disease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], and      chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12      patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwent      HMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative       days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery      (21.7\\\%), mediastinal infection (21.7\\\%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinal      collection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1\\\%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0\\\%),       and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3\\\%). All patients were discharged      from hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced driveline      infections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to the      following conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0\\\%), gastrointestinal      bleeding (13.0\\\%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0\\\%), transient ischemic attack      (8.7\\\%), arrhythmia (8.7\\\%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aortic      regurgitation (8.7\\\%), right ventricular failure (4.3\\\%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3\\\%),      and hematuria (4.3\\\%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally New      York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three       patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient was      successfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were two      mortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was      522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to be      effective in our Asian population. Driveline infection rate remains low even in      the tropical hot, humid climate in Singapore. With more patients ending up on      extended periods of LVAD support, increased emphasis in the detection and      management of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will be      needed.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Lim, Choon PinAU  - Lim CPAD  - National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore.FAU - Sivathasan, CumaraswamyAU  - Sivathasan CFAU - Tan, Teing EeAU  - Tan TEFAU - Lim, Chong HeeAU  - Lim CHFAU - Kerk, Ka LeeAU  - Kerk KLFAU - Sim, David Kheng LengAU  - Sim DKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140107PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMCIN - Artif Organs. 2014 Jun;38(6):521-3. - 24392937own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140721dcom- 20150309is  - 1525-1594 (electronic)is  - 0160-564x (linking)vi  - 38ip  - 7dp  - 2014 julti  - use of left ventricular assist device (heartmate ii): a singapore experience.pg  - 543-8lid - 10.1111/aor.12247 [doi]ab  - recent advances in medical and device therapies in heart failure have improved      the survival of patients with heart failure. however, due to the limited      availability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (lvads)      have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patients      with refractory heart failure in singapore. we report our experience with the      heartmate ii (hmii) lvad (thoratec corporation, pleasanton, ca, usa) as a      bridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. this was a      retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent hmii lvad      implantation in our center between may 2009 and december 2012. all patients were       classified as interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support       (intermacs) levels 1 to 3 and underwent lvad implantation as a bridge-to-heart      transplant. there were 17 male and 6 female patients. the mean age was 43.6 years      old (range 14 to 64). the etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart      disease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], and      chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. nine patients were intermacs level 1, 12      patients level 2, and two patients level 3. all patients successfully underwent      hmii lvad implantation. there was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative       days. postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery      (21.7\\\%), mediastinal infection (21.7\\\%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinal      collection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1\\\%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0\\\%),       and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3\\\%). all patients were discharged      from hospital after lvad implantation. three patients experienced driveline      infections during outpatient follow-up. there were 19 readmissions due to the      following conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0\\\%), gastrointestinal      bleeding (13.0\\\%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0\\\%), transient ischemic attack      (8.7\\\%), arrhythmia (8.7\\\%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aortic      regurgitation (8.7\\\%), right ventricular failure (4.3\\\%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3\\\%),      and hematuria (4.3\\\%). post-lvad implantation, 20 patients were functionally new      york heart association (nyha) class i, while 3 reported nyha iii symptoms. three       patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. one patient was      successfully explanted 11 months after lvad implantation. there were two      mortalities during the follow-up period. the average duration of lvad support was      522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). the heartmate ii lvad has proven to be      effective in our asian population. driveline infection rate remains low even in      the tropical hot, humid climate in singapore. with more patients ending up on      extended periods of lvad support, increased emphasis in the detection and      management of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will be      needed.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 international center for artificial organs and transplantation      and wiley periodicals, inc.fau - lim, choon pinau  - lim cpad  - national heart centre singapore, singapore.fau - sivathasan, cumaraswamyau  - sivathasan cfau - tan, teing eeau  - tan tefau - lim, chong heeau  - lim chfau - kerk, ka leeau  - kerk klfau - sim, david kheng lengau  - sim dkla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20140107pl  - united statesta  - artif organsjt  - artificial organsjid - 7802778sb  - imcin - artif organs. 2014 jun;38(6):521-3.

The question addressed was: Can the temporary use of right ventricular       assist devices (RVADs) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute right      ventricular failure after cardiac surgery? More than 183 papers were found using       the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer the      clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient      group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are      tabulated. Indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass       surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assist      device insertion. Significant reductions in central venous pressure (P = 0.005)      and mean pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.01) were reported during and after      RVAD support. Furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (P <      0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05), right ventricular stroke      work (P < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (P < 0.05) were also      seen. Assessment by one study showed that on Day 7 after RVAD removal, the right       ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40\\\%. Dynamic      echocardiography studies performed before, during and after RVAD placement      demonstrated that after RVAD implantation, right ventricular end-diastolic      dimensions (P < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (P < 0.05) and right       ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) increased. Although several studies      successfully weaned patients from an RVAD, there were several complications,      including bleeding requiring surgical intervention. However, this may be reduced       by using percutaneous implantation (bleeding incidence: 4 of 9 patients) rather      than by a surgically implanted RVAD (bleeding incidence: 5 of 5 patients).      However, mortality is higher in percutaneous RVAD patients rather than in      surgical RVAD (80-44\\\%) patients. Causes of death cited for patients on an RVAD      included multiorgan failure, sepsis, thromboembolic events, reoccurring right      heart failure and failure to wean due to persistent right ventricular failure.

Renal failure after LVAD      placement can occur to varying degrees from cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) or due to       intrinsic renal disease. Patients with severely impaired renal function after      LVAD may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) as a temporary or permanent      means of support. We present a unique case of a patient who initiated peritoneal       dialysis (PD) 1 year after placement of an LVAD for destination therapy (DT). One      year later, PD continues to be successfully utilized by this patient for RRT.      There are several proven and theoretical benefits to PD in LVAD patients.      Peritoneal dialysis can provide sustained daily ultrafiltration offering greater       hemodynamic stability, preservation of residual renal function, and a lower risk       of systemic infection.

An Impella 2.5 was placed in patients who were       on peripheral VA ECMO with evidence of left ventricular distension. Patients who       were candidates for heart transplant were transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD.       Five patients on VA ECMO with ventricular distension underwent Impella 2.5      implantation, resulting in a decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter as      measured by echocardiography (7.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.8 cm, p = 0.001).

Heart transplant or long-term ventricular assist device.PG  - 276-81LID - 10.1111/aor.12157 [doi]AB  - Chronic heart failure is a progressive and eventually fatal illness. Although the      disease cannot be cured and treatment is symptom oriented, most of the patients      benefit from optimum medical treatment. Patients with rapid deterioration in      chronic advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment need inotropic      support and may need intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain circulatory support,      which of course cannot be prolonged beyond a certain limit. The outcome of heart       transplant and long-term ventricular assist device (VAD) in such patients is      poor. The short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) offered to such      patients not only provides effective circulatory support and stabilizes them      hemodynamically, but also halts the ensuing or reverts the established end-organ       failure. As the name suggests, the short-term MCS offers support for the short      term, usually less than a month. Although some patients with acute heart failure       experience recovery of myocardial function with short-term MCS support, others      become dependent. These patients, stabilized and \\\"stuck\\\" with short-term MCS, can      be \\\"rescued\\\" with long-term VAD or heart transplantation. Both the procedures,      when done in this special situation, have their inherent advantages,      disadvantages, and complications and hence need the careful consideration about      the choice of the procedure.

In      contrast, partial unloading of failing human hearts with left ventricular (LV)      assist devices (LVADs) can in some patients ameliorate heart failure symptoms.      Here we tested in heterotopic rat heart transplant models whether partial      volume-loading (VL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonary       artery of donor to left atrium of donor, superior vena cava of donor to inferior       vena cava of recipient; n = 27) is superior to the classical model of myocardial       unloading (UL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonary      artery of donor to inferior vena cava of recipient; n = 14) with respect to      preservation of ventricular morphology and function. Echocardiography, magnetic      resonance imaging, and LV-pressure-volume catheter revealed attenuated myocardial      atrophy with ~30\\\% higher LV weight and better systolic contractile function in VL      compared with UL (fractional area shortening, 34\\\% vs. 18\\\%; maximal change in      pressure over time, 2,986 +/- 252 vs. 2,032 +/- 193 mmHg/s). Interestingly, no      differences in fibrosis (Picrosirus red staining) or glucose metabolism      (2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET) between VL and UL were observed. We      conclude that the rat model of partial VL attenuates atrophic remodelling and      shows superior morphological as well as functional preservation, and thus should       be considered more widely as a research model.FAU - Didie, MichaelAU  - Didie MAD  - Institute of Pharmacology, University Medical Center Gottingen and Deutsches      Zentrum fur Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung, partner site Gottingen, Germany;FAU - Biermann, DanielAU  - Biermann DFAU - Buchert, RalphAU  - Buchert RFAU - Hess, AndreasAU  - Hess AFAU - Wittkopper, KatrinAU  - Wittkopper KFAU - Christalla, PeterAU  - Christalla PFAU - Doker, StephanAU  - Doker SFAU - Jebran, FawadAU  - Jebran FFAU - Schondube, FriedrichAU  - Schondube FFAU - Reichenspurner, HermannAU  - Reichenspurner HFAU - El-Armouche, AliAU  - El-Armouche AFAU - Zimmermann, Wolfram-HubertusAU  - Zimmermann WHLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20130614PL  - United StatesTA  - Am J Physiol Heart Circ PhysiolJT  - American journal of physiology.

However,      survival is poorer in HHTx recipients, and with improving results in continuous      flow ventricular assist devices (VADs), many patients can be bridged to allow      normalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic heart      transplant (OHTx) candidates. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyse the      survival of our HHTx cohort and compare them with our VAD bridge patients.      METHODS: A retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 OHTx and 27      HHTx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124      bridge-to-transplant VAD patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received       an OHTx. Pulmonary artery pressures before and after VAD implant were analysed.      Survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS:      HHTx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older,      smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the OHTx cohort. Comparison of the      VAD types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longer time      supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than the      pulsatile devices. The continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonary      artery pressures pretransplant. The HHTx cohort had a significantly poorer      survival than the OHTx cohort (P=0.002). Survival on a continuous device and then      OHTx was significantly better than either HHTx or pulsatile device support.      CONCLUSIONS: The main indication for HHTx, namely fixed elevated pulmonary      hypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by       continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.FAU - Marasco, Silvana FAU  - Marasco SFAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery Unit, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.FAU - Bell, DavidAU  - Bell DFAU - Lee, GeraldineAU  - Lee GFAU - Bailey, MichaelAU  - Bailey MFAU - Bergin, PeterAU  - Bergin PFAU - Esmore, Donald SAU  - Esmore DSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130531PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heterotopic heart transplantOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/06/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/30 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/05 06:00PHST- 2013/05/31 [aheadofprint]AID - ezt281 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Feb;45(2):372-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281.

Post-transplant      outcomes were analyzed pertaining to patient preoperative INTERMACS profiles,      which were retrospectively assigned by 2 blinded cardiologists. Before      transplantation, INTERMACS profile 1 (critical cardiogenic shock) was present in       207 patients, INTERMACS profile 2 (progressive decline) in 291, INTERMACS profile      3 (inotropic dependence) in 176, and INTERMACS profile 4 (resting symptoms) was      present in 30 patients. In-hospital postoperative mortality rates were,      respectively, 43\\\%, 26.8\\\%, and 18\\\% in patients with profiles 1, 2, and 3 to 4      (P<0.001). INTERMACS 1 patients also presented the highest incidence of primary      graft failure (1: 31.3\\\%, 2: 22.3\\\%, 3-4: 21.8\\\%; P=0.03) and postoperative need for      dialysis (1: 33.2\\\%, 2: 18.9\\\%, 3-4: 21.5\\\%; P<0.001). Adjusted odds-ratios for      in-hospital postoperative mortality were 4.38 (95\\\% confidence interval,      2.51-7.66) for profile 1 versus 3 to 4, 2.49 (95\\\% confidence interval, 1.56-3.97)      for profile 1 versus 2, and 1.76 (95\\\% confidence interval, 1.02-3.03) for profile      2 versus 3 to 4. Long-term survival after hospital discharge was not influenced      by preoperative INTERMACS profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative INTERMACS profiles       determine outcomes after emergency heart transplantation. Results call for a      change in policies related to the management of heart transplant candidates      presenting with INTERMACS profiles 1 and 2.FAU - Barge-Caballero, EduardoAU  - Barge-Caballero EAD  - Heart Transplant Unit, Hospital Universitario A Coruna, A Coruna, Spain.FAU - Segovia-Cubero, JavierAU  - Segovia-Cubero JFAU - Almenar-Bonet, LuisAU  - Almenar-Bonet LFAU - Gonzalez-Vilchez, FranciscoAU  - Gonzalez-Vilchez FFAU - Villa-Arranz, AdolfoAU  - Villa-Arranz AFAU - Delgado-Jimenez, JuanAU  - Delgado-Jimenez JFAU - Lage-Galle, ErnestoAU  - Lage-Galle EFAU - Perez-Villa, FelixAU  - Perez-Villa FFAU - Lambert-Rodriguez, Jose LAU  - Lambert-Rodriguez JLFAU - Manito-Lorite, NicolasAU  - Manito-Lorite NFAU - Arizon-Del Prado, Jose MAU  - Arizon-Del Prado JMFAU - Brossa-Loidi, VicensAU  - Brossa-Loidi VFAU - Pascual-Figal, DomingoAU  - Pascual-Figal DFAU - Fuente-Galan, Luis De laAU  - Fuente-Galan Lde LFAU - Sanz-Julve, MarisaAU  - Sanz-Julve MFAU - Muniz-Garcia, JavierAU  - Muniz-Garcia JFAU - Crespo-Leiro, MarisaAU  - Crespo-Leiro MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20130514PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.

To reduce mortality, the      introduction of post-transplant survival in an allocation model based on the      concept of survival benefit might be more appropriate. The aim of this study was       to assess the prognostic accuracy of the heart failure survival score (HFSS), the      Seattle heart failure model (SHFM), the Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) model, and the index for mortality      prediction after cardiac transplantation (IMPACT) score for predicting mortality.      METHODS: The HFSS, SHFM, the adapted SHFM, and the INTERMACS model were evaluated      for predicting waiting list mortality among heart transplant candidates, and the       IMPACT score was tested for predicting post-transplant mortality in separate Cox       regression models. Included were the 448 adult heart transplant candidates listed      for an urgent status between October 2010 and June 2011 in Eurotransplant. A      cardiac allocation score (CAS) was calculated based on the estimated survival      times as predicted by the scores. All analyses were performed for the total      cohort and separately for ventricular assist device (VAD) and non-VAD patients.      RESULTS: Mortality on the waiting list could significantly be predicted in the      non-VAD cohort by HFSS (p = 0.005) and SHFM (p < 0.0001) and after transplant by       IMPACT (p < 0.0001). None of the tested scores could predict mortality among      VAD-supported patients. CONCLUSIONS: In non-VAD patients, the HFSS, SHFM, and      IMPACT provide accurate risk stratification.

Several studies showed that use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      in patients with fixed PH who were initially deemed ineligible for HTx      effectively decreased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), thus permitting HTx. We       recently encountered a candidate for HTx who had severe PH with extremely high      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). A 27-year-old female who had been diagnosed       with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and who was approved for HTx at      age 25 was referred to our institute because of severe fatigability with moderate      dyspnea even at rest due to severe bilateral heart failure. Despite continuous      inotrope infusion, the patient\\s symptoms were not relieved. Right heart      catheterization (RHC) disclosed a PAP of 62/40 mmHg with severely reduced cardiac      output (1.8 l/min). A PVR of 15.9 Wood units suggested progressive worsening of      left ventricular function with almost irreversible remodeling of the pulmonary      vasculature, and the patient was thought to be contraindicated for HTx. Following      3 weeks of aggressive medical treatment, repeat RHC demonstrated PVR lowering to       8.16 Wood units. This suggested it was likely that PVR could be reversed, and the      patient underwent LVAD implantation. RHC performed after LVAD implantation showed      a fall in PVR from the initial, extremely high measurement of 15.9 Wood units to       3.4 Wood units at 2 months postoperatively, and to 2.2 Wood units at 1 year.

Unloading of the left ventricle with an      implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonary      vascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in a      cohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy. METHODS: Pulmonary      haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit      between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:      Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eight HeartWare      ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21      VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplant      by virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon       pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.      Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4\\\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\\\%      (24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortality      was 7.7\\\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\\\% (10 of 11). Baseline and post-VAD       pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic PAP (mmHg), mean      PAP, TPG (mmHg) of 57 +/- 9.5, 42 +/- 4.4 and 14 +/- 3.9 reduced to 32 +/- 7.5,      18 +/- 5.5 and 9 +/- 3.3, respectively. PVR reduced from 5 +/- 1.5 to 2.1 +/- 0.5      Wood units (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In selected heart failure patients with      secondary PH, use of centrifugal LVAD results in significant reductions in PAP,      TPG and PVR, which are observed within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months.      Such patients bridged to candidacy have post-transplant survival comparable with       those having a heart transplant as primary treatment.FAU - Kutty, Ramesh SAU  - Kutty RSAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The Transplant Unit, Papworth Hospital,      Cambridge, UK. ramesh.kutty@papworth.nhs.ukFAU - Parameshwar, JayanAU  - Parameshwar JFAU - Lewis, CliveAU  - Lewis CFAU - Catarino, Pedro AAU  - Catarino PAFAU - Sudarshan, Catherine DAU  - Sudarshan CDFAU - Jenkins, David PAU  - Jenkins DPFAU - Dunning, John JAU  - Dunning JJFAU - Tsui, Steven SAU  - Tsui SSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130122PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Jun;43(6):1242-3. - 23345184own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130517dcom- 20140305is  - 1873-734x (electronic)is  - 1010-7940 (linking)vi  - 43ip  - 6dp  - 2013 junti  - use of centrifugal left ventricular assist device as a bridge to candidacy in      severe heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension.pg  - 1237-42lid - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs678 [doi]ab  - objectives: raised pulmonary artery pressure (pap), trans-pulmonary gradient      (tpg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) are risk factors for poor outcomes       after heart transplant in patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (ph) and      may contraindicate transplant. unloading of the left ventricle with an      implantable left ventricular assist device (lvad) may reverse these pulmonary      vascular changes. we studied the effect of implanting centrifugal lvads in a      cohort of patients with secondary ph as a bridge to candidacy. methods: pulmonary      haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal lvads at a single unit      between may 2005 and december 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. results:      twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal lvads (eight heartware      ventricular assist device (hvad), heartware international, usa and 21      ventrassist, ventracor ltd., australia). seventeen were ineligible for transplant      by virtue of high tpg/pvr. all the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon       pump followed by lvad insertion. four required temporary right vad support.      thirty-day mortality post-lvad was 3.4\\\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\\\%      (24 of 28). thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortality      was 7.7\\\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\\\% (10 of 11). baseline and post-vad       pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic pap (mmhg), mean      pap, tpg (mmhg) of 57 +/- 9.5, 42 +/- 4.4 and 14 +/- 3.9 reduced to 32 +/- 7.5,      18 +/- 5.5 and 9 +/- 3.3, respectively. pvr reduced from 5 +/- 1.5 to 2.1 +/- 0.5      wood units (p < 0.05). conclusions: in selected heart failure patients with      secondary ph, use of centrifugal lvad results in significant reductions in pap,      tpg and pvr, which are observed within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months.      such patients bridged to candidacy have post-transplant survival comparable with       those having a heart transplant as primary treatment.fau - kutty, ramesh sau  - kutty rsad  - department of cardiothoracic surgery, the transplant unit, papworth hospital,      cambridge, uk. ramesh.kutty@papworth.nhs.ukfau - parameshwar, jayanau  - parameshwar jfau - lewis, cliveau  - lewis cfau - catarino, pedro aau  - catarino pafau - sudarshan, catherine dau  - sudarshan cdfau - jenkins, david pau  - jenkins dpfau - dunning, john jau  - dunning jjfau - tsui, steven sau  - tsui ssla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20130122pl  - germanyta  - eur j cardiothorac surgjt  - european journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the european      association for cardio-thoracic surgeryjid - 8804069sb  - imcin - eur j cardiothorac surg. 2013 jun;43(6):1242-3.

We report on our experiences of these      patients with a follow-up of 132 patient years. METHODS: Seventy-four HeartMate      II axial flow pumps and 41 HeartWare centrifugal pumps were implanted in patients      with non-ischaemic (n = 70) or ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 45). The mean age of      the patients was 50 +/- 13 years. All patients were on inotropic support prior to      implantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used as a bridging      procedure in 21 cases. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 14\\\%. Hospital      discharge occurred on average after 46 +/- 33 days. Twenty-two patients of this      cohort received a heart transplant 492 +/- 342 days after implantation of the      device. Two patients died after heart transplantation. A 1-year survival of 73\\\%      and a 2-year survival of 69\\\% were recorded, despite a low incidence of transplant      procedures. The longest support time was 1686 days. CONCLUSIONS: Modern left      ventricular assist device technology can be used successfully for heart failure.       The scarcity of donor hearts leads to prolonged periods on the device, and      chronic ventricular assist device therapy has become a reality, although bridge      to transplant was intended; therefore, sufficient support services for outpatient      care of these patients are required.FAU - Meyer, Anna LAU  - Meyer ALAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery, Hannover      Medical School, Hannover, Germany.FAU - Malehsa, DorisAU  - Malehsa DFAU - Bara, ChristophAU  - Bara CFAU - Haverich, AxelAU  - Haverich AFAU - Strueber, MartinAU  - Strueber MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121209PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Cardiomyopathies/*surgeryMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Length of StayMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - HeartMate IIOT  - HeartWareOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - OutcomeEDAT- 2012/12/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/07 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/12 06:00PHST- 2012/12/09 [aheadofprint]AID - ezs568 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs568 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Jun;43(6):1233-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs568.

We describe the use of this device to support       the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York Heart      Association class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustard      procedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. CASE REPORT: A      HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and      pulmonary edema. RESULTS: The patient\\s edema and acute kidney injury resolved      after device placement.

We report on our experience in the pediatric population. METHODS:      Retrospective review of 27 consecutive children offered mechanical support with      Berlin Heart as a bridge to heart transplant, and Jarvik 2000 as a destination      therapy from February 2002 to October 2011. RESULTS: The median patient age was      4.8 years (range = 75 days to 20.5 years). The median patient weight was 18.6 kg       (range = 2.9-63 kg). We divided the patients in two groups, including in group I       patients assisted for bridging to heart transplantation and in group II patients       with Duchenne\\s dystrophy assisted as destination therapy. In the group I, 11      patients required biventricular mechanical support (BVAD), but in all other      cases, a single left VAD proved sufficient (56\\\%). The median duration of VAD      support was 48 days (1 to 192 days). The median pre-VAD pulmonary vascular      resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5 to 14.4 WU/m(2)). Twelve patients      (48\\\%) were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median duration       of mechanical support of 63 days (range = 2-168 days). Ten deaths occurred (40\\\%),      three for neurological complications, two for sepsis, two for multiorgan failure,      and three other for device malfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our      patients has increased from 33\\\% to 75\\\%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from       89\\\% to 23\\\%. In the group II, two patients with mean age of 15.3 years were      assisted with Jarvik 2000, and both of them are alive in a follow-up of 10.4      months. In two patients with Rpi > 10 WU/m(2), unresponsive to pulmonary      vasodilatator therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2 WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of      BVAD support, respectively. Six patients (32\\\%) required at least one pump change.      Of 12 patients undergoing heart transplantation, five developed an extremely      elevated (>60\\\%) panel-reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,      confirmed by Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of      rejection in the first month after heart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The       survival rate after heart transplantation was 100\\\% with a median follow-up of      34.4 months (45 days to 8.7 years). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in children      with end-stage heart failure is an effective strategy as a bridge to heart      transplantation with a reasonable morbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer      an additional means to reverse extremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.       The total implantable system opens a future scenarios for patients not eligible      for heart transplantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwent      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile      (HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and the      effect on body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) who      underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for      weight change. In the 30-day survivors, end points of the study were continued      LVAD support, heart transplant, or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass      surgery and was excluded. RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria,      BMI was 35.6 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 +/- 5.5      kg/m(2) (mean BMI change -2.5 kg/m(2); P = .063), with a mean follow-up time of      301.6 +/- 255.5 days. The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9      kg/m(2) (P = .016 vs baseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1 kg/m(2)      increase in BMI. BMI <30 kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\\\%), 5      of 19 (26\\\%) in XVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\\\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12       XVE, 2 HMII) or 50\\\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was      4.6 kg/m(2) (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30      kg/m(2) provided significant weight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in      recipients of the continuous flow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a      heart transplant after LVAD insertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6 kg/m(2) (P =      .003). LVAD implantation provides a period of hemodynamic support for obese      patients with advanced heart failure, during which time opportunity may be      available for weight loss. Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater      weight loss than nonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may      be necessary to achieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous      flow LVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study      was to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA)      and BSI after implantation of LVAD for advanced heart failure (HF). This was a      retrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage HF, who underwent       implantation of HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD over a 4 year period. Blood      stream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspected      neurological complications including CVAs were confirmed by neuroimaging.      Extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristics      were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The mean age of our study      population was 62.3 +/- 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males      (n = 75, 86.2\\\%). The baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients      with and without CVAs.

Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,      some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We       sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II      (HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure       and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD. METHODS:      This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patients transplanted during       2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were divided into two groups      according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) or required      additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were compared for      early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major early      post-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival. RESULTS: Early graft      loss was 10.7\\\% in isolated HMII and 25\\\% in HMII + RVAD patients (P = 0.26). There      were no observed differences in the rates of primary graft dysfunction (7.3 vs      0\\\%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5\\\%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25\\\%, P =      0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary artery resistance (odds ratio: 3.286,      95\\\% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant      predictor for adverse outcome of mechanically-bridged heart transplant      recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 +/- 5\\\% in isolated HMII and 75       +/- 15\\\% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate      that heart transplant recipients who required unplanned RV mechanical support      after LVAD implantation achieved comparable rates of early graft loss,      post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged      with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-year graft survival was      equivalent between those two groups. Given the small sample size, further studies      involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.

Gastrointestinal (GI)      bleeding has been frequently reported within this population. METHODS: A      retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from      January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and      management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was      conducted to identify related risk factors. RESULTS: A significant incidence of      GI bleeding (22.8\\\%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93\\\%)       population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from       the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54\\\% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37\\\% from      ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35\\\% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI)      tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95\\\% CI, 2.2-228.6;      p=0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9;      p=0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were      independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in      older patients (mean, 70 years; p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60\\\%) rebled      from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding      anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide       did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates,      length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct       consequence of GI bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors account for GI bleeding      in patients on CF-VADs.

This study aims to describe our      center\\s multidisciplinary team management of single-ventricle patients supported      long term with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric VAD. Patient #1 was a 4-year-old       with double-outlet right ventricle with aortic atresia, L-looped ventricles, and       heart block who developed heart failure 1 year after Fontan. She initially      required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and was transitioned to      Berlin Heart systemic VAD. She was supported for 363 days (cardiac intensive care      unit [CICU] 335 days, floor 28 days). The postoperative course was complicated by      intermittent infection including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,      intermittent hepatic and renal insufficiencies, and transient antithrombin,      protein C, and protein S deficiencies resulting in multiple thrombi. She had a      total of five pump changes over 10 months. Long-term medical management included       anticoagulation with enoxaparin, platelet inhibition with aspirin and      dipyridamole, and antibiotic prophylaxis using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. She      developed sepsis of unknown etiology and subsequently died from multiorgan      failure. Patient #2 was a 4-year-old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who      developed heart failure 2 years after bidirectional Glenn shunt. At systemic VAD       implantation, he was intubated with renal insufficiency. Post-VAD implantation,      his renal insufficiency resolved, and he was successfully extubated to daytime      nasal cannula and biphasic positive airway pressure at night. He was supported      for 270 days (CICU 143 days, floor 127 days). The pump was upsized to a 50-mL      pump in May 2011 for increased central venous pressures (29 mm Hg).

However, thromboembolic      events, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. We      retrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)      in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in a      pediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March      31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),      median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a left      VAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwent      heart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient is      still on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days of      assistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of nine      patients (56\\\%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When compared      with noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median      131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care       unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and a      longer length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR      34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced for      thromboembolic issues, most of them (67\\\%) in patients with VAD-related      infections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BH      endocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,      12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venous      catheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinary      catheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanical      ventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Of      the 17 isolated pathogens, 53\\\% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence of      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3\\\%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25\\\%),      three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50\\\% of all isolated pseudomonads),      and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients with      infected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospital      with increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.

Case study.PG  - 537-40LID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments for      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right time      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function       of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular      afterload.

All patients on the Eurotransplant      high-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be      relisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated with      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospective      analysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated with      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 117      consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure       unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 \\\%) were stabilized and      delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\\s specific characteristics.       After initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as      possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 \\\%      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary      due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 \\\%) needed a left- or      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 \\\%) died while waiting and 87 (84 \\\%)       received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. Cumulative 3 and 12 months      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 \\\%, respectively. CONCLUSION:      Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These data provide the      basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropes in patients      on the HU waiting list.FAU - Hubner, TAU  - Hubner TAD  - Medizinische Abteilung, Kliniken der Barmherzigen Schwestern, Krankenhaus      Neuwittelsbach, Renatastrasse 71a, 80639, Munich, Germany.FAU - Nickel, TAU  - Nickel TFAU - Steinbeck, GAU  - Steinbeck GFAU - Massberg, SAU  - Massberg SFAU - Schramm, RAU  - Schramm RFAU - Reichart, BAU  - Reichart BFAU - Hagl, CAU  - Hagl CFAU - Kiwi, AAU  - Kiwi AFAU - Weis, MichaelAU  - Weis MLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150405TA  - Clin Res CardiolJT  - Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac SocietyJID - 101264123EDAT- 2015/04/07 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/07 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/06 06:00PHST- 2015/01/22 [received]PHST- 2015/03/31 [accepted]PHST- 2015/04/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00392-015-0852-1 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Clin Res Cardiol. 2015 Apr 5.- 25841881own - nlmstat- publisherda  - 20150405lr  - 20150407is  - 1861-0692 (electronic)is  - 1861-0684 (linking)dp  - 2015 apr 5ti  - a single german center experience with intermittent inotropes for patients on the      high-urgent heart transplant waiting list.ab  - aim: currently, more than 900 patients with end-stage heart failure are listed      for heart transplantation in germany. all patients on the eurotransplant      high-urgent status (hu) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be      relisted every 8 weeks. long-term continuous inotropes are associated with      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. in this retrospective      analysis, we report our single center experience with hu patients treated with      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. methods and results: 117      consecutive adult hu candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure       unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 \\\%) were stabilized and      delisted during follow-up. in the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\\s specific characteristics.       after initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as      possible. thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). in 57 \\\%      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary      due to hemodynamic instabilities. fourteen patients (14 \\\%) needed a left- or      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 \\\%) died while waiting and 87 (84 \\\%)       received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. cumulative 3 and 12 months      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 \\\%, respectively. conclusion:      intermittent inotropes in hu patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. these data provide the      basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropes in patients      on the hu waiting list.fau - hubner, tau  - hubner tad  - medizinische abteilung, kliniken der barmherzigen schwestern, krankenhaus      neuwittelsbach, renatastrasse 71a, 80639, munich, germany.fau - nickel, tau  - nickel tfau - steinbeck, gau  - steinbeck gfau - massberg, sau  - massberg sfau - schramm, rau  - schramm rfau - reichart, bau  - reichart bfau - hagl, cau  - hagl cfau - kiwi, aau  - kiwi afau - weis, michaelau  - weis mla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20150405ta  - clin res cardioljt  - clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the german cardiac societyjid - 101264123edat- 2015/04/07 06:00mhda- 2015/04/07 06:00crdt- 2015/04/06 06:00phst- 2015/01/22 [received]phst- 2015/03/31 [accepted]phst- 2015/04/05 [aheadofprint]aid - 10.1007/s00392-015-0852-1 [doi]pst - aheadofprintso  - clin res cardiol. 2015 apr 5.'

Between January 2006 and December 2012, 228 consecutive adult patients were      supported on RotaFlow (n=213) or CentriMag (n=15) ECMO, at our institutions (155       men; age 58.3+/-10.5 years, range: 19-84 years). Indications for support were:      failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy      (n=118) and primary donor graft failure (n=37); postacute myocardial infarction      CS (n=27); acute myocarditis (n=6); and CS on chronic heart failure (n=40). A      peripheral ECMO setting was established in 126 (55.2\\\%) patients while it was      established centrally in 102 (44.7\\\%). Overall mean support time was 10.9+/-9.7      days (range: 1-43 days). Eighty-four (36.8\\\%) patients died on ECMO. Overall      success rate, in terms of survival on ECMO (n=144), weaning from mechanical      support (n=107; 46.9\\\%), bridge to mid-long-term ventricular assist device (n=6;      2.6\\\%), and bridge to heart transplantation (n=31; 13.5\\\%), was 63.1\\\%. One hundred       twenty-two (53.5\\\%) patients were successfully discharged. Stepwise logistic      regression identified blood lactate level and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase      (CK-MB) relative index at 72 h after ECMO initiation, and number of packed red      blood cells (PRBCs) transfused on ECMO as significant predictors of mortality on       ECMO (P=0.010, odds ratio [OR]=2.94; 95\\\% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-3.14;      P=0.010, OR=2.82, 95\\\% CI=1.014-3.721; and P=0.011, OR=2.69; 95\\\% CI=1.06-4.16,      respectively). Central ECMO population had significantly higher rate of      continuous veno-venous hemofiltration need and bleeding requiring surgery events       compared with the peripheral ECMO setting population. No significant differences       were seen by comparing the RotaFlow and CentriMag populations in terms of device       performance. At follow-up, persistent heart failure with left ventricle ejection       fraction (LVEF)</=40\\\% was a risk factor after hospital discharge. Patients with a      poor hemodynamic status may benefit from rapid central or peripheral insertion of      ECMO. The blood lactate level, CK-MB relative index, and PRBCs transfused should       be strictly monitored during ECMO support. In addition, early ventricular assist       device placement or urgent listing for heart transplant should be considered in      patients with persistent impaired LVEF after ECMO.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Loforte, AntonioAU  - Loforte AAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation, S.
