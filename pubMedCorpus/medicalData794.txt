It is therefore      important to identify patients at risk a priori. However, prognostic models      derived from multivariate analyses have had limited predictive power. METHODS:      This study retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 LVAD recipients between      May 1996 and October 2009; of these, 27 later required a RVAD (RVAD(+)) and 156      remained on LVAD only (RVAD(-)) until transplant or death. A decision tree model       was constructed to represent combinatorial non-linear relationships of the      pre-operative data that are predictive of the need for RVAD support. RESULTS: An       optimal set of 8 pre-operative variables were identified: transpulmonary      gradient, age, right atrial pressure, international normalized ratio, heart rate,      white blood cell count, alanine aminotransferase, and the number of inotropic      agents. The resultant decision tree, which consisted of 28 branches and 15      leaves, identified RVAD(+) patients with 85% sensitivity, RVAD(-) patients with      83% specificity, and exhibited an area under the receiver operating      characteristic curve of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: The decision tree model developed in      this study exhibited several advantages compared with existing risk scores.      Quantitatively, it provided improved prognosis of RV support by encoding the      non-linear, synergic interactions among pre-operative variables. Because of its      intuitive structure, it more closely mimics clinical reasoning and therefore can       be more readily interpreted. Further development with additional multicenter,      longitudinal data may provide a valuable prognostic tool for triage of LVAD      therapy and, potentially, improve outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
