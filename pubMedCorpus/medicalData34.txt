METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2012 through      July 2013, we conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews with caregivers of      patients considering DT LVAD. Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and      deductive approach. We interviewed 17 caregivers: 10 caregivers of patients      living with DT LVAD, 6 caregivers of patients who had died with DT LVAD, and 1      caregiver of a patient who had declined DT LVAD. The themes identified, which      could also be considered dialectical tensions, are broadly interpreted under 3      domains mapping to decision context, process, and outcome: (1) the stark decision      context, with tension between hope and reality; (2) the challenging decision      process, with tension between wanting loved ones to live and wanting to respect      loved ones' wishes; and (3) the downstream decision outcome, with tension between      gratitude and burden. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making surrounding DT LVAD should      incorporate decision support for patients and caregivers. This should include a      focus on caregiver burden and the predictable tensions that caregivers      experience.CI  - (c) 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - McIlvennan, Colleen KAU  - McIlvennan CKAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of       Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.). colleen.mcilvennan@ucdenver.edu.FAU - Jones, JacquelineAU  - Jones JAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of       Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).FAU - Allen, Larry AAU  - Allen LAAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of       Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).FAU - Lindenfeld, JoAnnAU  - Lindenfeld JAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of       Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).FAU - Swetz, Keith MAU  - Swetz KMAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of       Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).FAU - Nowels, CarolynAU  - Nowels CAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of       Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).FAU - Matlock, Daniel DAU  - Matlock DDAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of       Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).LA  - engGR  - 1 K07 AG030337-01A2/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - 1K23AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - 1K23HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20150310PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual OutcomesJT  - Circulation.
