However, success and      applicability of this therapy is largely limited by high complication rates      associated with these devices. Although superior outcomes have been achieved with      the second-generation continuous-flow LVADs, device-related infections continue      to be a prevalent complication in this patient population and contribute      significantly to the financial burden of this therapy due to an increased need      for hospitalizations and surgical interventions. Patient selection, device design      and LVAD-induced immune system dysfunction appear to be major risk factors for      the development of device-related infections. Improvements in device design and      better patient selection strategies, particularly with respect to identifying      individuals with genetic susceptibility to device-related infections, may further      reduce this prevalent complication and improve outcomes in patients with advanced      heart failure.FAU - Maniar, SanjayAU  - Maniar SAD  - Center for Cardiovascular Research, Division of Cardiology, Department of      Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 South Euclid      Avenue, Campus PO Box 8066, St Louis, MO 63110-1093, USA.FAU - Kondareddy, SreekanthAU  - Kondareddy SFAU - Topkara, Veli KAU  - Topkara VKLA  - engGR  - T32 HL007081/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32 HL007081-36A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32HL007081/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Med DevicesJT  - Expert review of medical devicesJID - 101230445SB  - IMMH  - Cardiology/methods/trendsMH  - Clinical Trials as TopicMH  - Equipment and SuppliesMH  - Heart Failure/complications/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HospitalizationMH  - HumansMH  - Immune SystemMH  - Infection/complications/*etiologyMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effectsMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC3205433MID - NIHMS326166OID - NLM: NIHMS326166OID - NLM: PMC3205433EDAT- 2011/10/27 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/06 06:00CRDT- 2011/10/27 06:00AID - 10.1586/erd.11.36 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2011 Sep;8(5):627-34. doi: 10.1586/erd.11.36.
