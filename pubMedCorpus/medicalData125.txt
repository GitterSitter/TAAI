Understanding the neurohormonal, inflammatory and      molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology of this syndrome has led to      the development of effective and widely used pharmacological treatments. Despite       this, mortality and hospitalization rates associated with this condition remain      high. The natural course of this illness is usually progressive, often leading      inexorably to end stage heart failure, for which orthotopic heart transplant is a      treatment option but one with limited resource. In the past decade, mechanical      circulatory support has emerged as a potential therapy for certain patients with       advanced heart failure. This article reviews the published data regarding      biomarkers in the setting of mechanical circulatory support, and highlights areas      of ongoing work and potential future areas of interest.FAU - Simpson, JoanneAU  - Simpson JAD  - Institute of Cardiovascular & Medical Sciences, BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular      Research Centre, University of Glasgow, 126 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA,      UK.FAU - Jackson, Colette EAU  - Jackson CEFAU - Gardner, Roy SAU  - Gardner RSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Biomark MedJT  - Biomarkers in medicineJID - 101312535SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - biomarkerOT  - heart failureOT  - left ventricular assist deviceOT  - mechanical circulatory supportOT  - recoveryEDAT- 2014/09/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/17 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/17 06:00AID - 10.2217/bmm.14.55 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Biomark Med. 2014;8(6):855-69. doi: 10.2217/bmm.14.55.
