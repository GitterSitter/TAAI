METHODS: We examined the association of      pre-operative health status, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy      Questionnaire (KCCQ), with survival and hospitalization after LVAD using the KCCQ      score as a continuous variable and stratified by KCCQ score quartile plus missing      KCCQ in 1,125 clinical trial participants who received the HeartMate II (Thoratec      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) as destination therapy (n = 635) or bridge to      transplantation (n = 490). RESULTS: The mean pre-operative KCCQ score was 29.4      +/- 18.7 among survivors (n = 719), and 27.1 +/- 18.3 (n = 406) in those who      died. In time-to-event analysis for all available follow-up using health status      as a continuous variable, the pre-operative KCCQ score did not correlate with      overall mortality after LVAD implantation (p = 0.178). Small absolute differences      were seen between the pre-operative KCCQ quartile and 30-day survival (Q4 95% vs.      Q1 89% vs. missing 87%; p = 0.0009 for trend), 180-day survival (Q4 83% vs. Q1      76% vs missing 79%; p = 0.060 for trend), and days hospitalized at 180 days (Q4      29.8 +/- 25.6 vs. Q1 34.1 +/- 27.1 vs. missing 36.5 +/- 29.9 days; p = 0.009 for       trend). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that pre-operative health status has      limited association with outcomes after LVAD implantation. Although these data      require further study in a diverse population, mechanical circulatory support may      represent a relatively unique clinical situation, distinct from heart failure and      other cardiac surgeries, in which heart failure-specific health status measures      may be largely reversed.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Flint, Kelsey MAU  - Flint KMAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, Stanford University Hospital, Palo Alto,      California.FAU - Matlock, Daniel DAU  - Matlock DDFAU - Sundareswaran, Kartik SAU  - Sundareswaran KSFAU - Lindenfeld, JoannAU  - Lindenfeld JFAU - Spertus, John AAU  - Spertus JAFAU - Farrar, David JAU  - Farrar DJFAU - Allen, Larry AAU  - Allen LALA  - engGR  - K23 HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131008PL  - United StatesTA  - J Heart Lung TransplantJT  - The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the      International Society for Heart TransplantationJID - 9102703SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - *Health Status IndicatorsMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Preoperative PeriodMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/mortality/*therapyPMC - PMC3838487MID - NIHMS525985OID - NLM: NIHMS525985OID - NLM: PMC3838487OTO - NOTNLMOT  - health statusOT  - health-related quality of lifeOT  - heart failureOT  - mechanical circulatory supportOT  - risk predictionEDAT- 2013/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/15 06:00PHST- 2013/05/06 [received]PHST- 2013/09/12 [revised]PHST- 2013/09/12 [accepted]PHST- 2013/10/08 [aheadofprint]AID - S1053-2498(13)01434-4 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.healun.2013.09.005 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Heart Lung Transplant. 2013 Dec;32(12):1249-54. doi:      10.1016/j.healun.2013.09.005.
