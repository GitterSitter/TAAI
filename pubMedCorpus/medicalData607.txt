The cardiac involvement typically results in a high risk of      severe heart failure in infancy or early childhood. While Berlin Heart EXCOR is      widely accepted as ventricular assistance in pediatric patients with end-stage      cardiac failure, infections remain a frequent and potentially severe      complication. Therefore, the extended use of the device in the setting of      intermittent or severe neutropenia is challenging. We present the case of a      three-yr child with Barth syndrome who was bridged successfully to transplant      with a Berlin Heart EXCOR assist device for eight months (251 days) without major      infectious complication, despite several episodes of severe neutropenia. This      case demonstrates that prolonged mechanical circulatory support for a patient      with neutropenia is feasible without important morbidity, with careful monitoring      and a multidisciplinary approach. G-CSF provides an excellent support in managing      neutropenia.CI  - (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Dedieu, NathalieAU  - Dedieu NAD  - Pediatric Cardiology, Cardiothoracic Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London,       UK. nathaliededieu@hotmail.comFAU - Giardini, AlessandroAU  - Giardini AFAU - Steward, Colin GAU  - Steward CGFAU - Fenton, MatthewAU  - Fenton MFAU - Karimova, AnnAU  - Karimova AFAU - Hsia, T YAU  - Hsia TYFAU - Burch, MichaelAU  - Burch MLA  - engGR  - PG/12/5/29350/British Heart Foundation/United KingdomPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121128PL  - DenmarkTA  - Pediatr TransplantJT  - Pediatric transplantationJID - 9802574SB  - IMMH  - Barth Syndrome/complications/*surgeryMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Neutropenia/*etiologyEDAT- 2012/11/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/05 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/30 06:00PHST- 2012/09/14 [accepted]PHST- 2012/11/28 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/petr.12027 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Transplant. 2013 Mar;17(2):E46-9. doi: 10.1111/petr.12027.
