The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates      peaked at 149 per 100 wait-list years in 2007 and has been declining since; in      2012, the rate was 93 heart transplants per 100 active wait-list years. Increased      waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase in      wait-list mortality. Since 2007, the proportion of patients on life support      before transplant increased from 48.6% to 62.7% in 2012. Medical urgency      categories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgency      categories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list       each year; the number of transplants performed each year increased from 274 in      1998 to 372 in 2012. Graft survival in pediatric recipients continues to improve;      5-year graft survival for transplants performed in 2007 was 78.5%. Medicare paid       for some or all of the care for nearly 40% of heart transplant recipients in      2010. Heart transplant appears to be more expensive than ventricular assist      devices for managing end-stage heart failure, but is more effective and likely      more cost-effective.CI  - (c) Copyright 2013 The American Society of Transplantation and the American      Society of Transplant Surgeons.FAU - Colvin-Adams, MAU  - Colvin-Adams MAD  - Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Minneapolis Medical Research      Foundation, Minneapolis, MN; Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology,      University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.FAU - Smithy, J MAU  - Smithy JMFAU - Heubner, B MAU  - Heubner BMFAU - Skeans, M AAU  - Skeans MAFAU - Edwards, L BAU  - Edwards LBFAU - Waller, CAU  - Waller CFAU - Schnitzler, M AAU  - Schnitzler MAFAU - Snyder, J JAU  - Snyder JJFAU - Israni, A KAU  - Israni AKFAU - Kasiske, B LAU  - Kasiske BLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Am J TransplantJT  - American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of      Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant SurgeonsJID - 100968638SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Assisted CirculationMH  - Cardiomyopathies/surgeryMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Cost-Benefit AnalysisMH  - Graft SurvivalMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/surgeryMH  - *Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/economics/mortalityMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical dataMH  - ReoperationMH  - Tissue DonorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - United States/epidemiologyMH  - Waiting Lists/mortalityOTO - NOTNLMOT  - End-stage heart failureOT  - heart transplantOT  - transplant outcomesOT  - ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2014/01/01 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/10 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/31 06:00AID - 10.1111/ajt.12583 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Transplant. 2014 Jan;14 Suppl 1:113-38. doi: 10.1111/ajt.12583.
