We implanted 28 devices in children and infants using a consistent      anticoagulation protocol. We performed a retrospective review of all children      implanted in our program with mechanical assist devices since 1997. Heparin,      dipyridamole, and aspirin were used for anticoagulation and antiaggregation.      Coagulation monitoring included thromboelastography (TEG), platelet aggregration       studies, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and      platelet count. Twenty-eight children, ages 1 month to 16 years (mean 5.3; median      2.4 years), were implanted for 3-107 days (mean 27; median 17). Eighteen received      left ventricular assist devices, seven received biventricular assist devices, and      three received total artificial hearts. Adverse events during the 720 days of      device support included the following: six (21%) reoperations for bleeding; seven      strokes (25%): two fatal, two with a mild residual deficit, and three without      deficit; and three (11%) visceral emboli: two fatal and one nonfatal. There were       eight deaths (29%). Causes of death were embolic (four), graft failure      post-transplantation (one), preimplant anoxic brain damage (two), and postexplant      heart failure (one). 24/28 (86%) survived to transplantation or weaning from      device and 20/28 (71%) were discharged from the hospital, 10 after      transplantation and 10 after native heart recovery. All 20 early survivors      survived long term. We describe an anticoagulation protocol based upon TEG and      platelet aggregation studies and using heparin, aspirin, and dipyridamole.      Adequate anticoagulation is more difficult in children. However, 71% of the      patients in our study survived long term.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.
