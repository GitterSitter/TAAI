We present the      outcomes of patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter clinical study in      Japan using the HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD for bridge to transplantation.       The study evaluated 6 inotrope-dependent heart failure patients failing on      medical management (3 males and 3 females, age 44.7 +/- 15.8 years, BSA 1.58 +/-       0.17 m(2)) implanted with the HMII LVAD at 5 Japanese centers. Functional status,      adverse events and outcomes were determined for the first 6 months with follow-up      at 2 years. After implant, functional improvement was evident in 6-min walk      distance which increased from 268 +/- 92 m at baseline to 399 +/- 105 m at 6      months, and 100% of patients were in NYHA class I or II at 6 months compared to      0% at baseline. Adverse events included localized non-device-related infection      (4/6), arrhythmias (3/6) and percutaneous lead infection (1/6). There were no      re-thoracotomies for bleeding and no strokes or pump replacements. All patients      were alive at 6 months and all were transplanted after 1.96-3.58 years of LVAD      support. The results in Japan of the HMII LVAD for BTT are consistent with      results from the US pivotal clinical trial. The expanded use of this technology      to Japanese heart failure patients is appropriate.FAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SAD  - Department of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, The University of Tokyo,      7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan, kyo-stm@umin.ac.jp.FAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YFAU - Nakatani, TakeshiAU  - Nakatani TFAU - Tabayashi, KoichiAU  - Tabayashi KFAU - Saiki, YoshikatsuAU  - Saiki YFAU - Tominaga, RyujiAU  - Tominaga RCN  - HeartMate II Japanese Clinical InvestigatorsLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyDEP - 20140128PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - MaleMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeIR  - Akiyama MFIR - Akiyama, MasatoshiIR  - Kumagai KFIR - Kumagai, KiichiroIR  - Shibuya TFIR - Shibuya, TakumiIR  - Motomura NFIR - Motomura, NoboruIR  - Nishimura TFIR - Nishimura, TakeshiIR  - Saito AFIR - Saito, AyaIR  - Taketani TFIR - Taketani, TsuyoshiIR  - Nawata KFIR - Nawata, KanIR  - Hisagi MFIR - Hisagi, MotoyukiIR  - Kinoshita OFIR - Kinoshita, OsamuIR  - Sakaguchi TFIR - Sakaguchi, TaichiIR  - Miyagawa SFIR - Miyagawa, SigeruIR  - Yoshikawa YFIR - Yoshikawa, YasushiIR  - Yamauchi TFIR - Yamauchi, TakashiIR  - Saito SFIR - Saito, ShunsukeIR  - Nakashima AFIR - Nakashima, AtsuhiroIR  - Nishida TFIR - Nishida, TakahiroIR  - Tanoue YFIR - Tanoue, YoshihisaIR  - Oishi YFIR - Oishi, YasuhisaIR  - Sonoda HFIR - Sonoda, HiromichiIR  - Takamoto SFIR - Takamoto, ShinichiIR  - Nishimura MFIR - Nishimura, MotonobuIR  - Yamazaki KFIR - Yamazaki, KenjiIR  - Sase KFIR - Sase, KazuhiroIR  - Kyo SFIR - Kyo, ShuneiIR  - Isobe MFIR - Isobe, MitsuakiEDAT- 2014/01/29 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/31 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/29 06:00PHST- 2013/08/08 [received]PHST- 2013/12/24 [accepted]PHST- 2014/01/28 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-013-0752-y [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2014 Jun;17(2):142-8. doi: 10.1007/s10047-013-0752-y.
