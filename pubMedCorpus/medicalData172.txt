Percutaneous transcatheter (PTC) closure of the aortic valve      (AV) has been described as a potential nonsurgical approach. Alternatively, we      present a case of decompensated heart failure due to de novo severe AI following       LVAD in which successful PTC closure of the AV resolved the severe AI and allowed      for clinical recovery and stability for more than 10 months as a bridge to heart       transplantation.
