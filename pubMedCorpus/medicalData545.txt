We undertook this study to characterize the outcomes of      septuagenarians bridged to transplantation (BTT) in the modern era. METHODS: We      conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult OHT in the United Network for      Organ Sharing database from 2005 to 2011. Primary stratification was by age 70      years or older. Subgroup analysis evaluated patients who received BTT. The      primary outcome was survival as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS:      From January 2005 to December 2011, 12,274 adults underwent OHT, including 3,243       (26.4%) who received BTT. In the entire cohort, 11,996 (97.7%) recipients were      aged 18 to 70 years, and 277 (2.3%) were 70 years of age or older. Overall,      patients 70 years or older who underwent OHT had decreased 90-day survival (93.6%      versus 88.8%; p<0.01), 1-year survival (89.0% versus 81.6%; p<0.01), and 2-year      survival (85.4% versus 79.9%; p<0.01) compared with recipients of other ages.      However in the BTT subgroup, recipients 70 years and older (n=43) had similar      90-day (91.2% versus 84.7%; p=0.2), 1-year (86.1% versus 81.7%; p=0.4), and      2-year (82.8% versus 81.7%; p=0.6) survival compared with recipients of other      ages (n=3,200). After adjusting for multiple recipient and donor factors, age      greater than or equal to 70 years was still not associated with an increased      hazard of mortality at 90 days, 1 year, or 2 years. These results were verified      by analysis of a propensity-matched cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients older       than the age of 70 years undergoing OHT have decreased survival, among patients      who received BTT, septuagenarians have outcomes similar to those of younger      recipients. In carefully selected patients dependent on left ventricular assist      devices (LVADs), recipient age greater than or equal to 70 years should not be      viewed as a contraindication to OHT.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
