Part 2: Role of mechanical circulatory support.PG  - 195-208LID - 10.1038/nrcardio.2011.205 [doi]AB  - This Review explores contemporary circulatory support in profound postinfarction       cardiogenic shock. Frequently, death is the only alternative to implantation of a      blood pump, so prospective randomized trials of device versus medical treatment      are unacceptable and evidence is derived from clinical experience. Irrespective      of ACC/AHA and European guidelines, no study has shown survival benefit for the      intra-aortic balloon pump in patients with established shock. In the past 10      years, the safety and durability of mechanical blood pumps has improved      considerably. New temporary and long-term rotary pumps have transformed outcomes       for patients with acute heart failure. For urgent resuscitation, outreach      salvage, and transportation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a      reliable, but time limited, first step. ECMO decompresses the venous system,      provides flow, and ensures oxygenation, but does not unload the failing left      ventricle. Myocardial stunning takes days, and sometimes weeks, to recover.      Effective ventricular unloading is best achieved by surgical implantation of a      temporary rotary or volume-displacement pump. After cardiopulmonary      resuscitation, hemodynamic stabilization allows assessment of cerebral injury and      prognosis. Published series demonstrate that 50-75% of patients with profound      shock can be salvaged either through native heart recovery, urgent      transplantation, or switch to a long-term pump.FAU - Westaby, StephenAU  - Westaby SAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headley Way,      Headington, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK. swestaby@ahf.org.ukFAU - Anastasiadis, KyriakosAU  - Anastasiadis KFAU - Wieselthaler, George MAU  - Wieselthaler GMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20120110PL  - EnglandTA  - Nat Rev CardiolJT  - Nature reviews.
