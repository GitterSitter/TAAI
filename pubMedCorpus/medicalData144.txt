The ability of currently available      investigative modalities to confirm Synergy pump malfunction is limited. The      Synergy speed fluctuates periodically (at 10-s intervals) from the baseline to a       transient decrease followed by a transient increase (alternating speed algorithm,      ASA) with the purpose of changing the blood flow behaviour, thereby reducing      thrombogenicity. The aim of this study was to develop a simple non-invasive      monitoring technique to assess pump function based on the detection of the ASA in      the peripheral microcirculation. METHODS: Between February 2012 and July 2013, 10      patients with advanced chronic heart failure underwent Synergy implantation at      our institution. The pump function was assessed by echocardiography and invasive       monitoring according to standard protocols; additionally, the pump speed and      power consumption were monitored. During the pump function assessment, the pulse       oximeter waveform was recorded from the index fingers of the left and right hand       with simultaneous pump auscultation using a stethoscope positioned on the pump      (right infra-clavicular pocket). RESULTS: The pulse oximeter waveform was readily      detectable from the right and left hand of all study patients. If the Synergy      function was normal, there was a significant difference in the morphology of the       pulse oximeter waveform from each hand: the ASA algorithm produced a more      pronounced variation (giant wave) in the trace from the right hand than from the       left. The giant waves invariably coincided with the sound variation associated      with the ASA algorithms, which were detected regularly at 10-s intervals.      CONCLUSIONS: We describe a simple, readily applicable, inexpensive, non-invasive       technique that allows evaluation of Synergy pump function and may have diagnostic      utility under conditions of suspected pump thrombus/malfunction. This technique      is readily applicable from the early post-implant period throughout support and      allows clinical personnel to verify blood flow variation through the Synergy,      thereby providing a novel method of assessing device function.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
