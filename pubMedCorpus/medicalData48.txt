Moreover latest generation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is      characterized by improved technologies. Moreover the size of new LVAD systems is       considerably reduced when compared to older generation devices. Therefore, less      invasive surgery is now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange      of LVADs. Although experience with these new techniques is still limited,      minimally invasive procedures are thought to improve surgical outcomes by      declining the rates of operative complications such as bleeding or wound      infection. The miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive      techniques will be used for most LVAD-related procedures in the future. In this      article, we summarize and describe minimally invasive surgical techniques, with a      focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.FAU - Rojas, S VAU  - Rojas SVAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation, and Vascular Surgery Hannover      Medical School, Hannover, Germany - schmitto.jan@mh-hannover.de.FAU - Avsar, MAU  - Avsar MFAU - Uribarri, AAU  - Uribarri AFAU - Hanke, J SAU  - Hanke JSFAU - Haverich, AAU  - Haverich AFAU - Schmitto, J DAU  - Schmitto JDLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20150123PL  - ItalyTA  - Minerva ChirJT  - Minerva chirurgicaJID - 0400726SB  - IMEDAT- 2015/01/24 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/24 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/24 06:00PHST- 2015/01/23 [aheadofprint]AID - R06Y9999N00A150002 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Minerva Chir. 2015 Feb;70(1):63-8.
