OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether coronary sinus (CS) or baseline       peripheral venous (PV) levels of established and emerging heart failure (HF)      biomarkers are predictive of CRT outcomes. METHODS: In 73 patients (aged 68 +/-      12 years; 83% men; ejection fraction 27% +/- 7%) with CS and PV blood samples      drawn simultaneously at the time of CRT device implantation, we measured      amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), galectin-3 (gal-3),      and soluble ST2 (sST2) levels. NT-proBNP concentrations >2000 pg/mL, gal-3      concentrations >25.9 ng/mL, and sST2 concentrations >35 ng/mL were considered      positive on the basis of established PV cut points for identifying "high-risk"      individuals with HF. CRT response was adjudicated by the HF Clinical Composite      Score. A major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was defined as the composite      end point of death, cardiac transplant, left ventricular assist device, and HF      hospitalization at 2 years. RESULTS: NT-proBNP concentrations were 20% higher in       the CS than in the periphery, while gal-3 and sST2 concentrations were 10% higher      in the periphery than in the CS (all P < .001). There were 45% CRT nonresponders       at 6 months and 16 (22%) patients with MACE. Triple-positive CS values yielded      the highest specificity of 95% for predicting CRT nonresponse. Consistently, CS      strategies identified patients at higher risk of developing MACE, with >11-fold      adjusted increase for triple-positive CS patients compared to triple-negative      patients (all P </= .04). PV strategies were not predictive of MACE. CONCLUSION:       Our findings suggest that CS sampling of HF biomarkers may be better than PV      sampling for predicting CRT outcomes. Larger studies are needed to confirm our      findings.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Heart Rhythm Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.
