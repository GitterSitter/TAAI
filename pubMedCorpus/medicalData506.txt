First results from the Eurotransplant       pilot study on a survival benefit-based heart allocation.PG  - 873-80LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2013.03.015 [doi]LID - S1053-2498(13)01204-7 [pii]AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients awaiting heart transplantation in Eurotransplant are      prioritized by waiting time and medical urgency. To reduce mortality, the      introduction of post-transplant survival in an allocation model based on the      concept of survival benefit might be more appropriate. The aim of this study was       to assess the prognostic accuracy of the heart failure survival score (HFSS), the      Seattle heart failure model (SHFM), the Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) model, and the index for mortality      prediction after cardiac transplantation (IMPACT) score for predicting mortality.      METHODS: The HFSS, SHFM, the adapted SHFM, and the INTERMACS model were evaluated      for predicting waiting list mortality among heart transplant candidates, and the       IMPACT score was tested for predicting post-transplant mortality in separate Cox       regression models. Included were the 448 adult heart transplant candidates listed      for an urgent status between October 2010 and June 2011 in Eurotransplant. A      cardiac allocation score (CAS) was calculated based on the estimated survival      times as predicted by the scores. All analyses were performed for the total      cohort and separately for ventricular assist device (VAD) and non-VAD patients.      RESULTS: Mortality on the waiting list could significantly be predicted in the      non-VAD cohort by HFSS (p = 0.005) and SHFM (p < 0.0001) and after transplant by       IMPACT (p < 0.0001). None of the tested scores could predict mortality among      VAD-supported patients. CONCLUSIONS: In non-VAD patients, the HFSS, SHFM, and      IMPACT provide accurate risk stratification. Further studies will reveal whether       these models should be considered as the basis for a new heart allocation policy       in Eurotransplant.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
