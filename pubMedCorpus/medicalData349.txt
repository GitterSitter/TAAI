Device      thrombosis is a serious complication of CF-LVADs, but its precise prevalence and       etiology remains uncertain. METHODS: Root-cause analysis was performed in all      cases with device thrombosis confirmed upon explant among patients implanted with      a HeartMate II (HM II) from January 1, 2009 to November 15, 2012. Cannula      position and bend relief integrity were assessed and charts were reviewed with      particular attention to anti-coagulation and infection profiles. RESULTS:      Nineteen of 177 patients (11%) were found to have device thrombosis of various      etiologies after a mean of 351 +/- 311 days, representing 0.12      event/patient-year. Of the 5 mechanically induced thromboses, proximate etiology       was severely abnormal inflow cannula position in 3 patients and bend relief      disconnect with deformed outflow graft in 2 patients. One patient had a      hypercoagulable disorder with prior arterial embolism. In the remaining 13      patients (age 61 +/- 14 years, 77% male, 69% Caucasian), "non-mechanical" device       thrombosis occurred after 357 +/- 383 days; INR at the time of diagnosis was 1.81      (1.62 to 2.07); and mean device speed was 8,855 +/- 359 rpm. Five of 13 patients       (38%) had an infection during the month leading up to device thrombosis. Of note,      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was already elevated at the time of discharge in      patients who would later develop non-mechanical device thrombosis (423 [354 to      766] vs 352 [272 to 373] U/liter, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Device thrombosis is a       multifactorial phenomenon, and differentiation of mechanical and non-mechanical      causes is an essential step for individual diagnosis and treatment plans. Larger       studies excluding patients with obvious mechanical etiology are needed to      investigate biologic and/or management-related risk factors for device      thrombosis. Our findings suggest that LDH may be an early risk marker. Due to the      difficulty in treating late-stage device thrombosis, we suggest early use of      simple tests to rule out both causes of thrombosis, such as X-rays and closer LDH      monitoring (bi-weekly).CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, New York, New York.
