OBJECTIVES: This      study sought to prospectively examine the frequency of post-operative infections       and associated mortality, and modifiable management practices predictive of      infections within 65 days from cardiac surgery. METHODS: This study enrolled      5,158 patients and analyzed independently adjudicated infections using a      competing risk model (with death as the competing event). RESULTS: Nearly 5% of      patients experienced major infections. Baseline characteristics associated with      increased infection risk included chronic lung disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.66;       95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 2.26), heart failure (HR: 1.47; 95% CI:      1.11 to 1.95), and longer surgery (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.41). Practices      associated with reduced infection risk included prophylaxis with      second-generation cephalosporins (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.94), whereas      post-operative antibiotic duration >48 h (HR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.88), stress      hyperglycemia (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.73); intubation time of 24 to 48 h      (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.14); and ventilation >48 h (HR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.66      to 3.63) were associated with increased risk. HRs for infection were similar with      either <24 h or <48 h of antibiotic prophylaxis. There was a significant but      differential effect of transfusion by surgery type (excluding left ventricular      assist device procedures/transplant) (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.20). Major      infections substantially increased mortality (HR: 10.02; 95% CI: 6.12 to 16.39).       CONCLUSIONS: Major infections dramatically affect survival and readmissions.      Second-generation cephalosporins were strongly associated with reduced major      infection risk, but optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis requires further      study. Given practice variations, considerable opportunities exist for improving       outcomes and preventing readmissions.
