We hypothesized that IL-33/ST2 pathway, a new mechanism regulated during      cardiac stress, may be involved in the functional worsening of end-stage HF      patients, candidates for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and       potentially responsible for their outcome. METHODS: IL-33, ST2, and conventional       cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) were determined in cardiac biopsies and      plasma of 22 patients submitted to LVAD implantation (pre-LVAD) and compared with      (1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at the moment of heart       transplantation without prior circulatory support (HT); (2) patients supported by      LVAD at the moment of LVAD weaning (post-LVAD). RESULTS: Cardiac expression of      ST2/IL-33 and cytokines was lower in the pre-LVAD than in the HT group. LVAD      determined an increase of inflammatory mediators comparable to levels of the HT      group. Only ST2 correlated with outcome indices after LVAD implantation.      CONCLUSIONS: IL-33/ST2 and traditional cytokines were involved in decline of      cardiac function of ESHF patients as well as in hemodynamic recovery induced by      LVAD. IL-33/ST2 pathway was also associated to severity of clinical course. Thus,      a better understanding of inflammation is the key to achieving more favorable      outcome by new specific therapies.FAU - Caselli, CAU  - Caselli CAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - D'Amico, AAU  - D'Amico AAD  - Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, 56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Ragusa, RAU  - Ragusa RAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Caruso, RAU  - Caruso RAD  - Cardiovascular Department, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale       delle Ricerche (CNR), Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Prescimone, TAU  - Prescimone TAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Cabiati, MAU  - Cabiati MAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Nonini, SAU  - Nonini SAD  - Cardiotoracovascular Department, Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Marraccini, PAU  - Marraccini PAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy ; Cardiovascular Department, Institute of Clinical Physiology,       Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162      Milan, Italy.FAU - Del Ry, SAU  - Del Ry SAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Trivella, M GAU  - Trivella MGAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Parodi, OAU  - Parodi OAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy ; Cardiovascular Department, Institute of Clinical Physiology,       Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162      Milan, Italy.FAU - Giannessi, DAU  - Giannessi DAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20131210PL  - United StatesTA  - Mediators InflammJT  - Mediators of inflammationJID - 9209001RN  - 0 (Cytokines)RN  - 0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)RN  - 0 (IL33 protein, human)RN  - 0 (Inflammation Mediators)RN  - 0 (Interleukins)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)SB  - IMMH  - Cytokines/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*etiology/immunology/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Inflammation Mediators/*physiologyMH  - Interleukins/*physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiologyMH  - Signal TransductionPMC - PMC3872445OID - NLM: PMC3872445EDAT- 2014/01/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/04 06:00PHST- 2013/09/27 [received]PHST- 2013/11/13 [accepted]PHST- 2013/12/10 [epublish]AID - 10.1155/2013/498703 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Mediators Inflamm. 2013;2013:498703. doi: 10.1155/2013/498703.
