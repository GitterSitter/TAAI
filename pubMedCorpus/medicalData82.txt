OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of      AF on outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD. METHODS: Records of 106 patients      who underwent HMII implantation at a single center were reviewed. The      associations of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and persistent atrial      fibrillation (PeAF) with survival, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, bleeding,       and thromboembolism were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox      proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 56.6 +/- 11.4 years, 87.7%      of the implants were intended as a bridge to transplantation, and median length      of support was 217 days (range: 1 to 952 days). AF was present in 55 patients      (51.9%); 36 patients (34.0%) had PAF and 19 (17.9%) had PeAF. Twenty-one patients      (19.8%) died, and 18 (17.0%) were hospitalized for HF. There were 0.75 major      bleeding events and 0.28 thromboembolic events per patient year of follow-up. PAF      was not associated with increased mortality, HF hospitalization, bleeding, or      thromboembolism. PeAF, however, was an independent predictor of the composite      endpoint of death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 3.54; 95% confidence      interval: 1.52 to 8.25; p < 0.01). Although there was no increase in bleeding or       thromboembolism, patients with AF had thromboembolic events at higher      international normalized ratios (INRs). CONCLUSIONS: Although PAF is not      associated with worse outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD, PeAF may be      associated with increased mortality and HF hospitalization. Patients with AF also      may have thromboembolic events at higher INR levels.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by      Elsevier Inc.
