There are limited data      specifically examining the incidence and predictors of driveline infections      (DLI), with a changing treatment paradigm toward destination therapy (DT) and      longer duration of support. METHODS: Between January 2007 and 2011, 143 patients       underwent HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) implantation, with 87 (61%) as       DT. Driveline maintenance strategy included sterile dressing changes with      chlorhexidine and saline application, without prophylactic oral antibiotics.      RESULTS: DLI developed in 18 patients (12%) at a median of 182 days (range, 26 to      1,138 days) after implantation, among which 12 (66%) were from the DT cohort.      Infections were superficial in 15 (82%) and deep in 3 (18%). Trauma was      documented in 6 patients (33%). Seven patients (38%) needed readmission for DLI.       Surgical debridement was needed in 3 (17%). All patients were managed      successfully, without the need for device explantation or urgent cardiac      transplantation. No patient required continuous antibiotic prophylaxis after the       infection subsided. Risk factor analysis identified duration of support as the      only independent predictor of infection (mean. 600 vs 390 days; p = 0.03). The      odds of having a DLI rose by 4% for every month of support. CONCLUSIONS: Longer      duration of support significantly increased the risk of DLI and hence increased      the risk of DLI in patients with DT. DLI may be successfully managed with      antibiotics and local wound care. Most of the infections were superficial, and      progression to deep pocket or pump infection is rare in our experience.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
