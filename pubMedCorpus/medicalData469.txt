OBJECTIVE      -To investigate the experience of nursing patients who have a ventricular assist       device. DESIGN -A qualitative approach called interpretive description was used      to conduct semistructured, 1-on-1 interviews. PARTICIPANTS-Six registered nurses       with a range of clinical experiences were interviewed in a 1-year period from      2009 to 2010. Data were transcribed and analyzed by the researcher in conjunction      with a research team. RESULTS-Four distinct themes were interpreted from the      interview data: exclusive knowledge, human connection, ethics, and      interdisciplinary stress and technology. CONCLUSION -Nursing patients who have a       ventricular assist device is a complex experience. Nurses develop expert      knowledge that is related to direct exposure to patients; this unique knowledge      should be formally considered in team decision making. Nursing care of patients      who have a ventricular assist device also has features that might result in      overconnected nurse-patient relationships. Closely connected nurse-patient      relationships intensified the emotional difficultly of experiences of exposure to      illness or suffering, or exposure to an unpredictable dying trajectory. Nursing      patients with ventricular assist devices can be difficult, and nursing leaders      should be aware of the emotional reactions that can result from direct exposure      to patients who might be perceived as very ill or suffering. Institutions with      ventricular assist device programs should consider providing emotional support      for health care workers who find this type of work emotionally difficult.FAU - Gibson, Jennifer AAU  - Gibson JAAD  - University of British Columbia School of Nursing, Vancouver, Canada V6Z 1Y6.      jgibson@providencehealth.bc.caFAU - Henderson, AngelaAU  - Henderson AFAU - Jillings, CarolAU  - Jillings CFAU - Kaan, AnnemarieAU  - Kaan ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Prog TransplantJT  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)JID - 100909380SB  - NMH  - *EmpathyMH  - Heart Failure/*nursingMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Nurse-Patient RelationsMH  - Nurses/*psychologyMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - Social SupportMH  - Stress, Psychological/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/06/21 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/06 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/21 06:00AID - U735R2213J2723GL [pii]AID - 10.7182/pit2013766 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Prog Transplant. 2013 Jun;23(2):147-53. doi: 10.7182/pit2013766.
