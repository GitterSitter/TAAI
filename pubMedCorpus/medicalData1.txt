Anthracyclines and newer targeted      therapies, including trastuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are important      agents implemented in clinical practice that carry cardiotoxic risk. While acute       heart failure is often self-limited and reversible, delayed-onset heart failure      significantly reduces survival. Extremes of age, renal dysfunction, pre-existing       coronary artery disease, HER2 positivity, and multi-drug therapy are predictors      of irreversible heart failure after chemotherapy. Left ventricular assist device       (LVAD) implantation and cardiac transplantation can be performed safely in      patients with end-stage heart failure (HF) from chemotherapy. However,      co-existing right ventricular dysfunction, hepatic congestion, and increased risk      of bleeding make LVAD therapy challenging and dependent on careful patient      selection. Cardiac transplantation in patients with chemotherapy-induced heart      failure can be performed with good 10-year survival, but requires 5 years of      cancer freedom and post-transplant infections remain a problem. Improvements in      LVAD therapy and the expanding role of the total artificial heart and other      durable biventricular support devices will likely provide more reliable surgical       options for the management of end-stage HF after chemotherapy.FAU - Deo, Salil VAU  - Deo SVAD  - Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Center, Harrington Heart and Vascular      Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve      University, 11100 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.FAU - Al-Kindi, Sadeer GAU  - Al-Kindi SGFAU - Oliveira, Guilherme HAU  - Oliveira GHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc MedJT  - Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicineJID - 9815942EDAT- 2015/05/12 06:00MHDA- 2015/05/12 06:01CRDT- 2015/05/12 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11936-015-0388-8 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2015 Jun;17(6):388. doi:      10.1007/s11936-015-0388-8.
