METHODS: The      United Network for Organ Sharing Database was reviewed to identify first-time      heart transplant recipients who were bridged to transplantation with either      HW-VAD (n=141) or HMII-VAD (n=1824) from January 2009 through July 2012. RESULTS:      Recipients of HW-VAD had a higher proportion of female patients (27.0% versus      18.9%; p=0.019), a lower body surface area (2.01+/-0.25 m2 versus 2.06+/-0.25 m2;      p=0.035), and a trend toward a higher peak percentage of panel reactive antibody       against human leukocyte class I antigens (40.4%+/-32.8% versus 33.0%+/-30.4%;      p=0.070). Pretransplantation recipient cardiac index (2.33+/-0.66 Lmin(-1)m(-2)      versus 2.33+/-0.68 Lmin(-1)m(-2)), serum creatinine (1.21+/-0.43 mg/dL versus      1.26+/-0.57 mg/dL), and total bilirubin (1.34+/-3.45 mg/dL versus 1.06+/-1.84      mg/dL) were comparable between the two groups (p>0.05 for all comparisons). After      transplantation, there were no significant differences in freedom from rejection       or freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Posttransplant graft survival      rates were similar between the HW-VAD group and the HMII-VAD group at 1, 2, and 3      years (88.4% versus 87.8%, 79.9% versus 83.8%, and 77.4% versus 79.9%,      respectively; p=0.843). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest similar hemodynamic      unloading, pretransplant end-organ function, and posttransplant outcomes in      patients bridged to transplantation with both the HW-VAD and HMII-VAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
