Because most reported post-discharge experience is with left ventricular      assist devices (LVAD), we sought to evaluate the safety and feasibility of home      discharge on paracorporeal biventricular assist devices (BIVAD). METHODS: We      retrospectively reviewed the hospital course and post-discharge outcomes of 46      consecutive patients who received paracorporeal VADs as bridge to transplant. The      success of home discharge was assessed by frequency and reasons for hospital      readmission and survival to transplant. RESULTS: Thirty patients (65%) were      successfully transferred from the intensive care unit and considered candidates      for discharge. Of the 26 patients discharged home, 11 were supported with an LVAD      and 15 with BIVADs. Median duration of support until transplant, explant, or      death did not differ significantly between LVAD or BIVAD patients (91 days vs 158      days; p = 0.09). There were 26 readmissions for medical or device-related      complications; 10 in 7 LVAD patients and 16 in 10 BIVAD patients, with no      difference in median length of stay (17 days vs 25 days; p = 0.67). Out of      hospital duration of support was similar between LVAD and BIVAD patients (61 days      vs 66 days; p = 0.87) as were 6-month and 1-year event-free survival rates (p =      0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes were similar in patients bridged to transplant on      home paracorporeal BIVAD versus LVAD support. We recommend discharge for stable      patients demonstrating device competency and adequate home care regardless of the      need for univentricular or biventricular paracorporeal support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
