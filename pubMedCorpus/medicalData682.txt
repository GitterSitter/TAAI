There is no clearly      proven policy to manage end-stage heart failure patients with valvular      pathologies. The aim of this report was to analysis our experience with combined       approach of VAD implantation and valvular procedures among patients with valvular      heart disease and end-stage heart failure. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical      records of 67 patients who underwent MCS from April 2007 to September 2011. We      identified 12 patients (17.9%) who received concomitant valvular procedures, four      of whom had significant aortic insufficiency and received a simple coaptation      stitch at the center to approximate the fibrous nodules of Arantius. The      mechanical aortic valve was replaced with a stentless bioprosthesis in three      patients. Mitral valve commissurotomy was performed in one patient with mitral      stenosis and seven patients underwent tricuspit valve repair using an      annuloplasty ring. RESULTS: All 12 patients were males, of mean age 50.3 +/- 11.5      years (range = 25-66). Eleven of them (91.6%) survived the early and late      postoperative periods. Ten subjects (83.3%) continue to be supported with VAD; 1       (8.3%) was successfully bridged to transplantation. Each study participant      regression of the valvular pathologies by early echocardiography demonstrated.      CONCLUSION: Concomitant valve surgery during VAD implantation appeared to be a      reasonable option in end-stage heart failure patients with valvular heart      disease.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
