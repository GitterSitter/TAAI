Many of these patients have end-organ       dysfunction, including advanced kidney dysfunction, before and after LVAD      implantation. Kidney dysfunction is a marker of adverse outcomes, such as      increased morbidity and mortality. This review discusses kidney dysfunction and      associated management strategies during the dynamic perioperative time period of       LVAD implantation. Furthermore, we suggest potential future research directions      to better understand the complex relationship between renal pathophysiology and      mechanical circulatory support.FAU - Coffin, Samuel TAU  - Coffin STAD  - Division of Cardiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.,      USA.FAU - Waguespack, Dia RAU  - Waguespack DRAD  - Division of Nephrology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.,      USA.FAU - Haglund, Nicholas AAU  - Haglund NAAD  - Division of Cardiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.,      USA.FAU - Maltais, SimonAU  - Maltais SAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center,      Nashville, Tenn., USA.FAU - Dwyer, Jamie PAU  - Dwyer JPAD  - Division of Nephrology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.,      USA.FAU - Keebler, Mary EAU  - Keebler MEAD  - Division of Cardiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.,      USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20150109PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Cardiorenal MedJT  - Cardiorenal medicineJID - 101554863PMC - PMC4327330OID - NLM: PMC4327330OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart failureOT  - Kidney injuryOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2015/03/12 06:00MHDA- 2015/03/12 06:01CRDT- 2015/03/12 06:00PHST- 2014/09/26 [received]PHST- 2014/10/31 [accepted]PHST- 2015/01/09 [epublish]AID - 10.1159/000369589 [doi]AID - crm-0005-0048 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Cardiorenal Med. 2015 Feb;5(1):48-60. doi: 10.1159/000369589.
