Initial proof of      concept investigations are conducted within in-vitro mock circulation loops,      before proof of principle is demonstrated via in-vivo animal testing. To      facilitate the rapid transition of cardiovascular devices through this      development period, a testing apparatus was developed that closely models the      natural human cardiovascular system haemodynamics. This mock circulation system      accurately replicates cardiac function, coupled to systemic and pulmonary      circulations. The physiological response produced by a number of clinical      cardiovascular conditions can be actively controlled by variable parameters such       as vascular resistance, arterial/venous compliance, ventricle contractility,      heart rate, and heart /vascular volumes, while anatomical variations such as      valve regurgitation and septal defects can be included. Auto-regulation of these       parameters was attempted to reproduce the Frank-Starling mechanism, baroreceptor       reflex, skeletal muscle pump, and postural changes. Steady state validation of      loop performance was achieved by replicating the progression of a patient's      clinical haemodynamics from heart failure, through VAD support, to heart      transplantation. The system has been used to evaluate pulsatile and non-pulsatile      ventricular assist devices, counter pulsation devices, non-invasive cardiac      output monitors and cardiovascular stents. The interaction of these devices with       the cardiovascular system was also investigated with regards to physiological      control strategies and cannula placement. The system is a valuable tool for the      accelerated progression of cardiovascular device development.FAU - Timms, Daniel LAU  - Timms DLAD  - BiVACOR Pty Ltd, and the ICET Laboratory, Critical Care Research Group, The      Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. daniel.timms@bivacor.com.auFAU - Gregory, Shaun DAU  - Gregory SDFAU - Stevens, Michael CAU  - Stevens MCFAU - Fraser, John FAU  - Fraser JFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - United StatesTA  - Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol SocJT  - Conference proceedings : ...
