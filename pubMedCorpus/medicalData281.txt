To facilitate pragmatic research efforts, data regarding the prognostic      importance of noninvasively assessed pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in      stable ambulatory patients with HF are needed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined      the association between echocardiographic PASP and outcomes in 417 outpatients      with HF (age, 54 +/- 13 years; 60.7% men; 50.4% whites; 24.9% with preserved      ejection fraction). Median PASP was 36 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR]: 29, 46).      After a median follow-up of 2.6 years (IQR: 1.7, 3.9) there were 72 major events       (57 deaths; 9 urgent heart transplants; and 6 ventricular assist device      implantations) and 431 hospitalizations for HF. In models adjusting for clinical       risk factors and therapy, a 10-mm Hg higher PASP was associated with 37% higher      risk (95% CI: 18, 59; P<0.001) for major events, and 11% higher risk (95% CI: 1,       23; P=0.039) for major events or HF hospitalization. The threshold that maximized      the likelihood ratio for both endpoints was 48 mm Hg; those with PASP >/= 48 mm      Hg (N=84; 20.1%) had an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.33 (95% CI: 1.96, 5.65;      P<0.001) for major events and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.11; P=0.037) for major events      or HF hospitalization. Reduced right ventricular systolic function had      independent prognostic utility over PASP for adverse outcomes. Right atrial      pressure and transtricuspid gradient both contributed to risk. CONCLUSIONS:      Elevated PASP, determined by echocardiography, identifies ambulatory patients      with HF at increased risk for adverse events.FAU - Kalogeropoulos, Andreas PAU  - Kalogeropoulos APAD  - Emory Clinical Cardiovascular Research Institute, Division of Cardiology, Emory      University, Atlanta, GA.FAU - Siwamogsatham, SarawutAU  - Siwamogsatham SFAU - Hayek, SalimAU  - Hayek SFAU - Li, SongAU  - Li SFAU - Deka, AnjanAU  - Deka AFAU - Marti, Catherine NAU  - Marti CNFAU - Georgiopoulou, Vasiliki VAU  - Georgiopoulou VVFAU - Butler, JavedAU  - Butler JLA  - engGR  - UL1 TR000454/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1TR000454/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20140203PL  - EnglandTA  - J Am Heart AssocJT  - Journal of the American Heart AssociationJID - 101580524SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - *Ambulatory CareMH  - *Arterial PressureMH  - Atrial Function, RightMH  - Atrial PressureMH  - Disease-Free SurvivalMH  - *Echocardiography, Doppler, ColorMH  - Familial Primary Pulmonary HypertensionMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/therapy/*ultrasonographyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HospitalizationMH  - HumansMH  - Hypertension, Pulmonary/mortality/physiopathology/therapy/*ultrasonographyMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Predictive Value of TestsMH  - Proportional Hazards ModelsMH  - Pulmonary Artery/physiopathology/*ultrasonographyMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - *SystoleMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Ventricular Function, RightPMC - PMC3959670OID - NLM: PMC3959670OTO - NOTNLMOT  - echocardiographyOT  - heart failureOT  - mortalityOT  - outcomesOT  - pulmonary hypertensionEDAT- 2014/02/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/02/05 06:00AID - jah3425 [pii]AID - 10.1161/JAHA.113.000363 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2014 Feb 3;3(1):e000363. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.113.000363.
