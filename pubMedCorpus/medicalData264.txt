The United      Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the       predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton,      CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed to      compare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program.      METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Base      were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomes      were time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences of      HT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistate      economic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was from      the NHS, discount rates were 3.5%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years      (QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB pound) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs       HM II. RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulative      incidence of HT was low for both groups (11% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued      4.99 lifetime QALYs costing pound258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84       QALYs costing pound231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for       HW vs HM II were pound23,530 ($37,349) and pound20,799 ($33,014), respectively.      CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a better      clinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was more      cost-effective. This result needs to be reassessed in a randomized controlled      trial comparing the 2 devices.CI  - Crown Copyright (c) 2014. Published by Elsevier Inc.
