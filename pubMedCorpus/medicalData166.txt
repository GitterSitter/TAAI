METHODS AND RESULTS: Data      including P-AVP were obtained from 162 in-hospital patients with stage D HF and      from 80 patients receiving ventricular assist device (VAD, n=46) or heart      transplantation (HTx, n=34) at 3 months after surgery. In the HF group,      considerably high P-AVP (5.9+/-6.1 pg/ml) negatively correlated with serum sodium      concentration (S-Na, 135.3+/-5.8 mEq/L, r=-0.548 [P<0.01]) and cardiac index (CI,      2.2+/-0.5 L.min(-1).m(-2), r=-0.458 [P<0.01]). After VAD/HTx treatment,      improvement in the CI (2.7+/-0.5 L.min(-1).m(-2)[P<0.01] vs. HF) was accompanied       by normalization of serum sodium concentration (S-Na; 138.2+/-2.0 mEq/L [P<0.01]       vs. HF) and suppressed release of AVP (1.7+/-3.4 pg/ml [P<0.01] vs. HF). P-AVP      positively correlated with only S-Na (r=0.454 [P<0.01]), whereas no correlation      was observed with CI after VAD/HTx treatment. P-AVP >/=5.3 pg/ml well predicted      poor 2-year survival in HF group (60% [P<0.01] vs. 90%). CONCLUSIONS: Low cardiac      output stimulates AVP release via a non-osmotic process that results in      hyponatremia and poor prognosis in patients with stage D HF. After sufficient      recovery of cardiac output by cardiac replacement therapy, AVP release is      suppressed and is mainly regulated by serum osmolality.FAU - Imamura, TeruhikoAU  - Imamura TAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of      Tokyo.FAU - Kinugawa, KoichiroAU  - Kinugawa KFAU - Hatano, MasaruAU  - Hatano MFAU - Fujino, TakeoAU  - Fujino TFAU - Inaba, ToshiroAU  - Inaba TFAU - Maki, HisatakaAU  - Maki HFAU - Kinoshita, OsamuAU  - Kinoshita OFAU - Nawata, KanAU  - Nawata KFAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SFAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MFAU - Komuro, IsseiAU  - Komuro ILA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140710PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683RN  - 11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)SB  - IMCIN - Circ J. 2014;78(9):2159-61.
