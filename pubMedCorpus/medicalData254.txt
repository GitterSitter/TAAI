BACKGROUND: The mechanisms and      underlying pathophysiological influences of HR abnormalities in HF are      incompletely understood. METHODS: In a prospective pilot study, 81 patients with       advanced systolic HF (97% were receiving beta-blockers) and 25 age-, sex-, and      body-size matched healthy controls underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise      testing with sampling of neurohormones and biomarkers. RESULTS: Two-thirds of HF       patients met criteria for chronotropic incompetence. Resting HR and HR reserve      (HRR, a measure of chronotropic response) were not correlated with each other and      were associated with distinct biomarker profiles. Resting HR correlated with      increased myocardial stress (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]: r = 0.26;      pro-A-type natriuretic peptide: r = 0.24; N-terminal-proBNP: r = 0.32) and      inflammation (leukocyte count: r = 0.28; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein      assay: r = 0.25). In contrast, HRR correlated with the neurohumoral response to      HF (copeptin: r = -0.33; norepinephrine: r = -0.29) but not with myocyte stress      or injury reflected by natriuretic peptides or hs-troponin I. Patients in the      lowest chronotropic incompetence quartile (HRR </=0.38) displayed more advanced      HF, reduced exercise capacity, ventilatory inefficiency, and poorer quality of      life. Over a median follow-up of 17 months, the combined endpoint of death or      urgent transplant/assist device implantation occurred more frequently in patients      with higher resting HR (>67 beats/min) or lower HRR, with both markers providing       additive prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Increased resting HR and      chronotropic incompetence may reflect different pathophysiological processes,      provide incremental prognostic information, and represent distinct therapeutic      targets.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
