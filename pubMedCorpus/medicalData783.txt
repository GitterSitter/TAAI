This study aims to describe our      center's multidisciplinary team management of single-ventricle patients supported      long term with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric VAD. Patient #1 was a 4-year-old       with double-outlet right ventricle with aortic atresia, L-looped ventricles, and       heart block who developed heart failure 1 year after Fontan. She initially      required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and was transitioned to      Berlin Heart systemic VAD. She was supported for 363 days (cardiac intensive care      unit [CICU] 335 days, floor 28 days). The postoperative course was complicated by      intermittent infection including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,      intermittent hepatic and renal insufficiencies, and transient antithrombin,      protein C, and protein S deficiencies resulting in multiple thrombi. She had a      total of five pump changes over 10 months. Long-term medical management included       anticoagulation with enoxaparin, platelet inhibition with aspirin and      dipyridamole, and antibiotic prophylaxis using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. She      developed sepsis of unknown etiology and subsequently died from multiorgan      failure. Patient #2 was a 4-year-old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who      developed heart failure 2 years after bidirectional Glenn shunt. At systemic VAD       implantation, he was intubated with renal insufficiency. Post-VAD implantation,      his renal insufficiency resolved, and he was successfully extubated to daytime      nasal cannula and biphasic positive airway pressure at night. He was supported      for 270 days (CICU 143 days, floor 127 days). The pump was upsized to a 50-mL      pump in May 2011 for increased central venous pressures (29 mm Hg). Long-term      medical management included anticoagulation with warfarin and single-agent      platelet inhibition using dipyridamole due to aspirin resistance. He developed      increased work of breathing requiring intubation, significant anasarca, and      bleeding from the endotracheal tube. The family elected to withdraw support.      Although both patients died prior to heart transplantation, a consistent      specialized multidisciplinary team approach to the medical care of our VAD      patients, consisting of cardiothoracic surgeons, heart transplant team,      hematologists, pharmacists, infectious disease physicians, psychiatrists,      specialty trained bedside nursing, and nurse practitioners, allowed us to manage       these patients long term while awaiting heart transplantation.CI  - (c) 2012, Copyright the Authors.
