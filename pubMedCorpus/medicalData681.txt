In this study we      evaluated the effect of VAD implantation upon the quality of life among Turkish      patients with end-stage heart failure. METHODS: Twenty-eight VAD implantation      patients included 3 (10.7%) with biventricular support using the Berlin Heart      Excor; 15 (53.6%), left ventricular support with the Berlin Heart Excor; and 10      (35.7%), Heartware implantation for left ventricular support. The Minnesota      Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health       Questionnaire were used to assess changes in the quality of life (QOL). RESULTS:       Of the 28 patients, 2 were females (7.1%) and 26 were males (92.9%) of overall      mean age of 44.6 +/- 15.3 years (range, 8-66). Preoperative mean score of MLHFQ      was significantly improved at 200.4 +/- 147.4 days follow-up (72.8 +/- 11.5 vs      13.7 +/- 10.5; P < .05). SF-36 physical scores and mental scores were improved      postoperatively (physical scores, 20.0 +/- 24.4 vs 70.2 +/- 19.9; mental scores,       38.4 +/- 18.8 vs 73.9 +/- 15.7; P < .05). No significant relation was observed      between the postoperative scores of questionnaires and type of surgery. More      improvement in postoperative MLHFQ scores was seen in patients younger than 45      years of age (P = .027). The severity of chronic heart failure (CHF) regressed      from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV to NYHA class II in 26 and to      NYHA class III in 2 patients (P = .000). CONCLUSION: The QOL among patients with       end-stage heart failure improved dramatically soon after VAD implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
