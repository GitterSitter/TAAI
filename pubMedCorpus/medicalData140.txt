The significance of progressive ventricular dysfunction among      nonresponders remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define predictors of and      clinical outcomes associated with progressive ventricular dysfunction despite      CRT. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 328 patients undergoing CRT with      defibrillator for standard indications. On the basis of 6-month echocardiograms,       we classified patients as responders (those with a >/=5% increase in ejection      fraction) and progressors (those with a >/=5% decrease in ejection fraction), and      all others were defined as nonprogressors. Coprimary end points were 3-year (1)      heart failure, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transplantation, or death      and (2) ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). RESULTS:      Multivariable predictors of progressive ventricular dysfunction were aldosterone       antagonist use (hazard ratio [HR] 0.23; P = .008), prior valve surgery (HR 3.3; P      = .005), and QRS duration (HR 0.98; P = .02). More favorable changes in      ventricular function were associated with lower incidences of heart failure,      LVAD, transplantation, or death (70% vs 54% vs 33%; P < .0001) and VT or VF (66%       vs 38% vs 28%; P = .001) for progressors, nonprogressors, and responders,      respectively. After multivariable adjustment, progressors remained at increased      risk of heart failure, LVAD, transplantation, or death (HR 2.14; P = .0029) and      VT or VF (HR 2.03; P = .046) as compared with nonprogressors. Responders were at       decreased risk of heart failure, LVAD, transplantation, or death (HR 0.44; P <      .0001) and VT or VF (0.51; P = .015) as compared with nonprogressors. CONCLUSION:      Patients with progressive deterioration in ventricular function despite CRT      represent a high-risk group of nonresponders at increased risk of worsened      clinical outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.
