It is      associated with increased interstitial fibrosis, cell death and cardiac      dysfunction. The progression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy has long been      considered as irreversible. However, recent clinical observations and      experimental studies have produced evidence showing the reversal of pathological       cardiac hypertrophy. Left ventricle assist devices used in heart failure patients      for bridging to transplantation not only improve peripheral circulation but also       often cause reverse remodeling of the geometry and recovery of the function of      the heart. Dietary supplementation with physiologically relevant levels of copper      can reverse pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Angiogenesis is essential      and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a constitutive factor for the      regression. The action of VEGF is mediated by VEGF receptor-1, whose activation      is linked to cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase-1 (PKG-1) signaling pathways,      and inhibition of cyclic GMP degradation leads to regression of pathological      cardiac hypertrophy. Most of these pathways are regulated by hypoxia-inducible      factor. Potential therapeutic targets for promoting the regression include:      promotion of angiogenesis, selective enhancement of VEGF receptor-1 signaling      pathways, stimulation of PKG-1 pathways, and sustention of hypoxia-inducible      factor transcriptional activity. More exciting insights into the regression of      pathological cardiac hypertrophy are emerging. The time of translating the      concept of regression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy to clinical practice is      coming.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
