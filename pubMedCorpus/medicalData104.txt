Primarily on the basis      of these animal data, the notion that chronic left ventricular assist device      (LVAD)-induced unloading will result in atrophy has dominated the clinical heart       failure field, and anti-atrophic drugs have been used to enhance the cardiac      recovery potential observed in some LVAD patients. However, whether      unloading-induced atrophy in experimental normal heart models applies to failing       and hypertrophic myocardium in heart failure patients unloaded by continuous-flow      LVADs has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: The study examined whether mechanical      unloading by continuous-flow LVAD leads to myocardial atrophy. METHODS: We      prospectively examined myocardial tissue and hemodynamic and echocardiographic      data from 44 LVAD patients and 18 untransplanted normal donors. RESULTS:      Cardiomyocyte size (cross-sectional area) decreased after LVAD unloading from      1,238 +/- 81 mum(2) to 1,011 +/- 68 mum(2) (p = 0.001), but not beyond that of      normal donor hearts (682 +/- 56 mum(2)). Electron microscopy ultrastructural      evaluation, cardiomyocyte glycogen content, and echocardiographic assessment of      myocardial mass and left ventricular function also did not suggest myocardial      atrophy. Consistent with these findings, t-tubule morphology, cytoplasmic      penetration, and distance from the ryanodine receptor were not indicative of      ongoing atrophic remodeling during LVAD unloading. Molecular analysis revealed no      up-regulation of proatrophic genes and proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome      system. CONCLUSIONS: Structural, ultrastructural, microstructural, metabolic,      molecular, and clinical functional data indicated that prolonged continuous-flow       LVAD unloading does not induce hypertrophy regression to the point of atrophy and      degeneration. These findings may be useful in designing future investigations      that combine LVAD unloading and pharmaceutical therapies as a bridge to recovery       of the failing heart.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
