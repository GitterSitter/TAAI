Axial flow      cfLVADS have been associated with increased rates of adverse gastrointestinal      events such as bleeding angiodysplasia. The purpose of this study was to      determine the incidence of bleeding gastrointestinal tract angiodysplasia and the      profile of patients supported with the centrifugal cfLVAD, referred for      endoscopy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 66 patients implanted with      Ventrassist (n = 33) and Heartware (n = 33) centrifugal continuous flow LVADs was      performed. All patients were on warfarin, aspirin and/or clopidogrel. Endoscopy      was performed in all patients with either active gastrointestinal bleeding (n =      6) or anemia with positive fecal occult blood (n = 6). RESULTS: Bleeding      gastrointestinal angiodysplasia was demonstrated in 5 out of the 12 (41.6%)      patients who underwent endoscopy from the cohort of 66 cfLVAD supported patients       (7.6%). The incidence of bleeding angiodysplasia was higher than the      age-standardized rate of andiodysplasia from literature (0.8%). Active      gastrointestinal bleeding in one other patient was due to diverticulosis. The      five patients with bleeding angiodysplasia tended to be older than the remaining       61 patients (58.8 +/- 10.3 vs 49.6 +/- 15.7 years, p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: We      found excess bleeding angiodysplasia in patients on centrifugal cfLVAD support.      It may be appropriate to screen for angiodysplasia particularly in older patients      prior to support by centrifugal cf LVADs. Reasons for the higher rate of bleeding      angiodysplasia in cfLVAD patients warrant further study.FAU - Muthiah, KavithaAU  - Muthiah KAD  - Heart Failure and Transplant Unit, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Sydney,      Australia.FAU - Robson, DesireeAU  - Robson DFAU - Macdonald, Peter SAU  - Macdonald PSFAU - Keogh, Anne MAU  - Keogh AMFAU - Kotlyar, EugeneAU  - Kotlyar EFAU - Granger, EmilyAU  - Granger EFAU - Dhital, KumudAU  - Dhital KFAU - Spratt, PhillipAU  - Spratt PFAU - Hayward, Christopher SAU  - Hayward CSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130520PL  - ItalyTA  - Int J Artif OrgansJT  - The International journal of artificial organsJID - 7802649SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Angiodysplasia/diagnosis/*epidemiologyMH  - Endoscopy, GastrointestinalMH  - FemaleMH  - Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*epidemiologyMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - New South Wales/epidemiologyMH  - Occult BloodMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftEDAT- 2013/07/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/04 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/31 06:00PHST- 2013/07/30 [ppublish]PHST- 2013/05/20 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2013/03/18 [accepted]AID - 108B59A1-78F6-49E9-B813-6A89267A8D98 [pii]AID - 10.5301/ijao.5000224 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Artif Organs. 2013 Jul;36(7):449-54. doi: 10.5301/ijao.5000224.
