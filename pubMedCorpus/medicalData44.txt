The impact of ventricular assist devices on arrhythmias and      how arrhythmias affect the clinical course of this population are not well      described. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-centre retrospective analysis of      children receiving a ventricular assist device between 1998 and 2011 was      performed. In all, 45 patients received 56 ventricular assist devices. The median      age at initial placement was 13 years (interquartile range 6-15). The median      duration of support was 10 days (range 2-260). The aetiology of heart failure      included cardiomyopathy, transplant rejection, myocarditis, and congenital heart       disease. In all, 32 patients (71%) had an arrhythmia; 19 patients (42%) had an      arrhythmia before ventricular assist device and eight patients (18%) developed      new arrhythmias on ventricular assist device. Ventricular tachycardia was most      common (25/32, 78%). There was no correlation between arrhythmia and risk of      death or transplantation (p=0.14). Of the 15 patients who weaned from ventricular      assist device, post-ventricular assist device arrhythmias occurred in nine (60%),      with five (33%) having their first arrhythmia after weaning. Patients with      ventricular dysfunction after ventricular assist device were more likely to have       arrhythmias (p<0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Arrhythmias, especially ventricular, are      common in children requiring ventricular assist device. They frequently persist      for those able to wean from ventricular assist device.FAU - Kyle, W BuckAU  - Kyle WBAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Decker, JamieAU  - Decker JAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Macicek, Scott LAU  - Macicek SLAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Valdes, Santiago OAU  - Valdes SOAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Morales, DavidAU  - Morales DAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Hong, BorahAU  - Hong BAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Price, Jack FAU  - Price JFAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Dreyer, William JAU  - Dreyer WJAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Denfield, Susan WAU  - Denfield SWAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.FAU - Kim, Jeffrey JAU  - Kim JJAD  - 1Department of Pediatrics,Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of      Medicine,Houston,Texas,United States of America.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Cardiol YoungJT  - Cardiology in the youngJID - 9200019SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - heart failureEDAT- 2015/02/04 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/04 06:00CRDT- 2015/02/04 06:00AID - S1047951113002126 [pii]AID - 10.1017/S1047951113002126 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Cardiol Young. 2015 Feb;25(2):255-60. doi: 10.1017/S1047951113002126.
