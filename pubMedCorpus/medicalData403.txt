BACKGROUND: Bleeding      complications are the most common post-operative adverse events after HMII      implantation. The timing of bleeding events, relationship to coagulation status,       and effect on post-operative survival are incompletely understood. METHODS: From       October 2004 to June 2010, 139 HMII recipients at the Cleveland Clinic received      145 devices as a bridge to transplant or destination therapy for advanced heart      failure. Major bleeding was defined using Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support criteria, with an additional category created to      maximize sensitivity for events. Pre-operative variables, coagulation status, and      bleeding recurrence were assessed for correlation to primary events using      modulated renewal within a multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The cumulative      occurrence of major bleeding was 58% during 171 patient-years of follow-up. There      were 1.14 major bleeds per patient-year, with 44% occurring as repeat bleeding      events. A first bleed did not predict subsequent bleeding. The greatest risk of      bleeding was noted within 2 weeks post-implantation. The international normalized      ratio profile correlated poorly with the risk of bleeding. Bleeding early after      surgery was associated with reduced survival while on HMII support. CONCLUSIONS:       The risk of bleeding peaks early after HMII implantation. Bleeding of thoracic      and gastrointestinal sources dominates these events, although many patients      undergo transfusions for anemia without an apparent source of hemolysis or      bleeding.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
