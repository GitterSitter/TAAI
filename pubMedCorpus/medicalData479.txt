The likelihood of      survival in patients supported on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for      respiratory failure decreases with the length of support. However, extracorporeal      membrane oxygenation can be successfully used in these patients for long periods       (weeks to months) provided adequate support is maintained without complications.       This is not the case with cardiac failure and mechanical circulatory      support.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is usually the initial form of      mechanical circulatory support used in patients with primary refractory      myocardial dysfunction. There is evidence and consensus that if the patient shows      no signs of recovery after a maximum duration of 2 weeks, he or she should be      transitioned to a ventricular assist device, which allows prolonged support. In      post-cardiac surgery patients, survival is only anecdotal beyond 12 days of      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and myocardial recovery is      exceptionally rare after this time period unless new diagnoses and management      strategies are formulated.Repeat extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should      generally not be offered to patients unless it is established that support was      withdrawn prematurely or a new intervention is planned. Repeat extracorporeal      membrane oxygenation may achieve some improvement in early survival, but the      long-term outcomes of survivors are so poor that these attempts cannot be      generally recommended unless organ transplantation is an option.FAU - d'Udekem, YvesAU  - d'Udekem YAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.      yves.dudekem@rch.org.auFAU - Shime, NobuakiAU  - Shime NFAU - Lou, SongAU  - Lou SFAU - MacLaren, GraemeAU  - MacLaren GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Pediatr Crit Care MedJT  - Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care      Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care      SocietiesJID - 100954653SB  - IMMH  - Cardiac Surgical ProceduresMH  - ChildMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *Medical FutilityMH  - Respiratory Insufficiency/*therapyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2013/06/14 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/12 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/06 06:00AID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e318292e332 [doi]AID - 00130478-201306001-00011 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2013 Jun;14(5 Suppl 1):S69-72. doi:      10.1097/PCC.0b013e318292e332.
