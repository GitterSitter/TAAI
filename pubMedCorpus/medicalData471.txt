MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten HF      patients implanted with LVAD as bridge to transplant or destination therapy were       enrolled in the study and 10 age and sex matched volunteers were recruited as the      study control. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in blood leukocytes and superoxide      dismutase (SOD) in erythrocytes were measured by flow      cytometry/immunofluorescence microscopy and spectrophotometry, respectively.      ELISA was used to measure oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) in plasma.      Markers of DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and repairs (Mre11, DNA ligase IV, Ku70, and      Ku80) were quantified in blood lymphocytes by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS:      Levels of ROS and oxLDL were significantly higher in HF patients with LVAD than      baseline as well as the control group; moreover, SOD levels were decreased with      increasing post-operative periods. All the changes indicated enhanced oxidative      stress among LVAD recipients. Significantly higher gamma-H2AX foci in lymphocytes      confirmed DNA double strand breaks in LVAD recipients. gamma-H2AX foci numbers in      lymphocytes were positively correlated with the ROS and oxLDL and negatively with      SOD levels (p<0.0001). Expressions of DNA ligase IV, Ku70 and Ku80 proteins were       highest after one week and Mre11 protein after 3 months of LVAD transplantation;       indicated abnormal DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: The study, for the first time shows      that, continuous flow LVAD implanted HF patients not only exhibit elevated      oxidative stress and DNA damage in blood leukocytes but also have abnormalities      in DNA repair pathways.FAU - Mondal, Nandan KumarAU  - Mondal NKAD  - Department of Surgery, Artificial Organ Lab, University of Maryland School of      Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.FAU - Sorensen, ErikAU  - Sorensen EFAU - Hiivala, NicholasAU  - Hiivala NFAU - Feller, ErikaAU  - Feller EFAU - Griffith, BartleyAU  - Griffith BFAU - Wu, Zhongjun JonAU  - Wu ZJLA  - engGR  - R01 HL 088100/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20130520PL  - AustraliaTA  - Int J Med SciJT  - International journal of medical sciencesJID - 101213954RN  - 0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)RN  - EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - *DNA DamageMH  - *DNA RepairMH  - Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/genetics/metabolism/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Oxidative StressMH  - Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolismMH  - Superoxide Dismutase/metabolismPMC - PMC3675502OID - NLM: PMC3675502OTO - NOTNLMOT  - DNA damageOT  - DNA repair.OT  - heart failureOT  - left ventricular assist deviceOT  - oxidative stressEDAT- 2013/06/20 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/16 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/20 06:00PHST- 2013 [ppublish]PHST- 2013/03/09 [received]PHST- 2013/05/05 [accepted]PHST- 2013/05/20 [epublish]AID - 10.7150/ijms.6219 [doi]AID - ijmsv10p0883 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Int J Med Sci. 2013 May 20;10(7):883-93. doi: 10.7150/ijms.6219.
