Often referred to as "a bridge to recovery,"      involving a ventricular assist device or cardiac transplantation, this technology      only affords temporary cardiopulmonary support. Physicians may have concerns      about initiating VA-ECMO in patients who, in the absence of recovery or transfer       to longer-term therapies, might assert religious or cultural objections to the      terminal discontinuation of life-sustaining therapy (LST). We present a novel      case of VA-ECMO use in an Orthodox Jewish woman with potentially curable lymphoma      encasing her heart to demonstrate the value of anticipating and preemptively      resolving foreseeable disputes. PATIENT: A 40-year-old Hasidic Orthodox Jewish      woman with lymphoma encasing her right and left ventricles decompensated from      heart failure before chemotherapy induction. The medical team, at an academic      medical center in New York City, proposed VA-ECMO as a means for providing      cardiopulmonary support to enable receipt of chemotherapy. Owing to the patient's      religious tradition, which customarily prohibits terminal discontinuation of LST,      clinical staff asked for an ethics consultation to plan for initiation and      discontinuation of VA-ECMO. INTERVENTIONS: Meetings were held with the treating      clinicians, clinical ethics consultants, family, religious leaders, and cultural       liaisons. Through a deliberative process, VA-ECMO was reconceptualized as a      bridge to treatment and not as an LST, a designation assigned to the chemotherapy      on this occasion, given the mortal threat posed by the encasing tumor.      CONCLUSION: Traditional religious objections to the terminal discontinuation of      LST need not preclude initiation of VA-ECMO. The potential for disputes should be      anticipated and steps taken to preemptively address such conflicts. The      reconceptualization of VA-ECMO as a bridge to treatment, rather than as an LST,      can allow patients with objections to the terminal discontinuation of LST to      receive interventions, such as chemotherapy, that might otherwise be precluded by      critical physiology.CI  - (c)AlphaMed Press.FAU - Meltzer, Ellen CAU  - Meltzer ECAD  - Division of Medical Ethics, Department of Anesthesia, and Division of Hematology       and Medical Oncology, Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma, Weill Cornell Medical      College and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA      elc9076@med.cornell.edu.FAU - Ivascu, Natalia SAU  - Ivascu NSAD  - Division of Medical Ethics, Department of Anesthesia, and Division of Hematology       and Medical Oncology, Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma, Weill Cornell Medical      College and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.FAU - Acres, Cathleen AAU  - Acres CAAD  - Division of Medical Ethics, Department of Anesthesia, and Division of Hematology       and Medical Oncology, Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma, Weill Cornell Medical      College and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.FAU - Stark, MeredithAU  - Stark MAD  - Division of Medical Ethics, Department of Anesthesia, and Division of Hematology       and Medical Oncology, Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma, Weill Cornell Medical      College and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.FAU - Furman, Richard RAU  - Furman RRAD  - Division of Medical Ethics, Department of Anesthesia, and Division of Hematology       and Medical Oncology, Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma, Weill Cornell Medical      College and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.FAU - Fins, Joseph JAU  - Fins JJAD  - Division of Medical Ethics, Department of Anesthesia, and Division of Hematology       and Medical Oncology, Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma, Weill Cornell Medical      College and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140805PL  - United StatesTA  - OncologistJT  - The oncologistJID - 9607837SB  - IMPMC - PMC4153457OID - NLM: PMC4153457 [Available on 09/01/15]OTO - NOTNLMOT  - BioethicsOT  - ChemotherapyOT  - CommunicationOT  - Cultural liaisonOT  - LymphomaOT  - Orthodox JudaismOT  - Preventive ethicsOT  - Religious objectionOT  - Surrogate decision makingOT  - Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenationOT  - Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapyEDAT- 2014/08/07 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/07 06:00CRDT- 2014/08/07 06:00PMCR- 2015/09/01 00:00PHST- 2014/08/05 [aheadofprint]AID - theoncologist.2014-0025 [pii]AID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0025 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Oncologist. 2014 Sep;19(9):985-9. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0025.
