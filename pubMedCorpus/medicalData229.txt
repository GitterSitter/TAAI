BACKGROUND: HF is associated with      upregulation of two cardiac SCN5A mRNA splice variants that encode prematurely      truncated, nonfunctional Na(+) channels. Because circulating WBCs demonstrate      similar SCN5A splicing patterns, we hypothesized that these WBC-derived splice      variants might further stratify patients with HF who are at risk for arrhythmias.      METHODS: Simultaneously obtained myocardial core samples and WBCs were compared      for SCN5A variants C (VC) and D (VD). Circulating variant levels were compared      among patients with HF, divided into three groups: HF without an implantable      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), HF with an ICD without appropriate      intervention, and HF with an ICD with appropriate intervention. RESULTS:      Myocardial tissue-derived SCN5A variant expression levels strongly correlated      with circulating WBC samples for both VC and VD variants (r = 0.78 and 0.75,      respectively). After controlling for covariates, patients with HF who had      received an appropriate ICD intervention had higher expression levels of both      WBC-derived SCN5A variants compared with patients with HF with ICDs who had not      received appropriate ICD intervention (odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.64-6.45; p =      0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that circulating      SCN5A variant levels were highly associated with the risk for appropriate ICD      intervention (area under the curve >/=0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating expression       levels of SCN5A variants were strongly associated with myocardial tissue levels.       Furthermore, circulating variant levels were correlative with arrhythmic risk as       measured by ICD events in an HF population within 1 year.
