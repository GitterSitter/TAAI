Discussion includes the etiology, diagnosis, and      management of fungal infection complications related with long-term mechanical      circulatory support. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly      used as bridge to transplant and permanent long-term therapy in the population      with end-stage heart failure. Even though better clinical outcomes have been      achieved with the newer-generation continuous-flow devices, infection      complications are still a major risk for patients with continuous-flow LVAD      implantation in long-term follow-up [Ann Thorac Surg 90:1270-1277, 2010].      Device-related infections can be categorized as driveline infections, pump-pocket      infections, and LVAD-associated endocarditis [Expert Rev Med Devices 8: 627-634,       2011]. The microbiological profile is very heterogeneous; the most common      pathogens are Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus species, and Candida.      Severe fungal infection may lead to dysfunction of the LVAD due to obstructive      mass formation within the device. Due to the only anecdotal reports in the      current literature, we present a very rare case of outflow fungal infectious      thrombus formation leading to outflow cannula obstruction in patient with LVAD.FAU - Maly, JiriAU  - Maly JFAU - Szarszoi, OndrejAU  - Szarszoi OFAU - Dorazilova, ZoraAU  - Dorazilova ZFAU - Besik, JosefAU  - Besik JFAU - Pokorny, MartinAU  - Pokorny MAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental      Medicine, Videnska 1958/9 140 21 Prague 4, Prague, Czech Republic. mpok@ikem.cz.FAU - Kotulak, TomasAU  - Kotulak TFAU - Netuka, IvanAU  - Netuka ILA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140225PL  - EnglandTA  - J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Journal of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101265113SB  - IMMH  - Catheters/microbiologyMH  - Endocarditis/*microbiologyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Ventricles/microbiology/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Mycoses/*microbiologyMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/*microbiologyMH  - Thrombosis/*microbiologyPMC - PMC3996051OID - NLM: PMC3996051EDAT- 2014/02/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/02/26 06:00PHST- 2013/09/04 [received]PHST- 2014/02/04 [accepted]PHST- 2014/02/25 [aheadofprint]AID - 1749-8090-9-40 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1749-8090-9-40 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Feb 25;9:40. doi: 10.1186/1749-8090-9-40.
