The aim of the present study is to review our      institutional experience with this novel device. METHODS: We reviewed the files      of 50 patients (39 men, 11 women) with a mean age of 50.6 +/- 11.8 years (range,       19 to 70 years) who underwent HVAD implantation between July 2009 and November      2011. Two patients underwent HeartWare BIVAD implantation. The underlying heart      diseases were end-stage ischemic heart disease (n = 12), acute myocardial      infarction (n = 9), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 27) and acute myocarditis (n =      2). Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support      (INTERMACS) profiles were level 1 (n = 11), 2 (n = 5), 3 (n = 10), and 4 (n =      24). RESULTS: After a cumulative support duration of 11,086 days, Kaplan-Meier      analysis revealed a survival of 82.0%, 77.9%, 75.5%, at 1, 12, and 24 months,      respectively. Causes of early death were right heart failure (n = 4), multiorgan       failure (n = 2), septic shock (n = 2), and major neurologic complications (n =      4). One late death occurred due to a right heart failure. Comparison between      patients operated on in cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS 1 and 2) and patients who      underwent elective HVAD implantation (INTERMACS 3 and 4) revealed a survival of      61.5% and 44.1% for the INTERMACS 1 and 2 group and 90.3% and 87.1% for the      INTERMACS 3 and 4 group at 1 and 12 months, respectively (odds ratio, 4.67; p =      0.003). One patient was weaned from the system after 2 years. Eleven patients      (22%) were successfully bridged to transplantation. Mean time to transplantation       was 209 days (range, 72 to 427 days). Posttransplant survival at the 1-year      follow-up was 90.9% (11 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with HVAD shows      satisfying results with an excellent posttransplantation survival. Moreover, the       stratified survival based on the level of preoperative stability shows better      outcomes in patients undergoing elective HVAD implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
