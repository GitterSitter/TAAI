Selecting appropriate patients for MCS      involves meeting a number of prespecifications as is required in evaluation for      cardiac transplant candidacy. As technology evolves to bring forth more durable      smaller devices, selection criteria for appropriate MCS recipients will likely      expand to encompass a broader, less sick population. The "Holy Grail" for MCS      will be a focus on clinical recovery and explantation of devices rather than the       currently more narrowly defined indications of bridge to transplantation or      lifetime device therapy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
