BACKGROUND: 30% to 40% of HF patients suffer from poor functional      status and quality of life (QoL) but are not in need of end-stage treatments. We       undertook a multicenter single-arm study to assess the C-Pulse System in such      patients. METHODS: New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or      ambulatory functional class IV HF patients were eligible. Safety was assessed      continuously through 12 months. Efficacy measurements included changes from      baseline to 6 and 12 months in NYHA functional class, Minnesota Living with Heart      Failure (MLWHF) and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, 6-min      walk distance (6MWD), and exercise peak oxygen consumption (pVO2; 6 months only).      RESULTS: Twelve men and 8 women (56.7 +/- 7 years, 34 to 71 years of age) with      ischemic (n = 7) or nonischemic (n = 13) cardiomyopathy were implanted. There was      no 30-day mortality and no neurological events or myocardial infarctions through       12 months. At 6 months, there were 3 deaths (1 device-related). One-year survival      was 85%. At 6 months, C-Pulse produced improvements in NYHA functional class (3.1      +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.7, p = 0.0005), MLWHF (63.6 +/- 19.9 to 40.2 +/- 23.2, p =      0.0005), and KCCQ scores (43.6 +/- 21.1 to 65.6 +/- 21.5, p = 0.0002), but not      6MWD (275.5 +/- 64.0 to 296.4 +/- 104.9, p = NS) or pVO2 (14.5 +/- 3.6 to 13.1      +/- 4.4, p = NS). Improvements continued at 12 months, with 6MWD change becoming       statistically significant (336.5 +/- 91.8, p = 0.0425). CONCLUSIONS: Use of      C-Pulse in this population is feasible, appears safe, and improves functional      status and QoL. A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial is      underway.
