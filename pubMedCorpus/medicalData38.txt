The current generation of left ventricular assist devices       (LVADs), as compared with older devices, is characterized by improved      technologies and reduced size. The result is that minimally invasive surgery is      now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange of LVADs. Minimally      invasive procedures improve surgical outcome; for example, they lower the rates      of operative complications (such as bleeding or wound infection). The      miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive techniques      will be used for most implantations in the future. In this article, we summarize       and describe minimally invasive state-of-the-art implantation techniques, with a       focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Rojas, Sebastian VAU  - Rojas SVAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation, and Vascular Surgery, Hannover      Medical School, Hannover, Germany.FAU - Avsar, MuratAU  - Avsar MFAU - Hanke, Jasmin SAU  - Hanke JSFAU - Khalpey, ZainAU  - Khalpey ZFAU - Maltais, SimonAU  - Maltais SFAU - Haverich, AxelAU  - Haverich AFAU - Schmitto, Jan DAU  - Schmitto JDLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150304TA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cardiac surgeryOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - Minimally invasive surgeryEDAT- 2015/03/05 06:00MHDA- 2015/03/05 06:00CRDT- 2015/03/05 06:00AID - 10.1111/aor.12422 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Mar 4. doi: 10.1111/aor.12422.
