Although the role of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in supporting the       failing LV is established, the indications and outcomes of using LVAD in a      systemic RV remain unclear. We assessed the role of a third-generation LVAD for      systemic RV support. METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 36 years) received the      HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) VAD for systemic RV      failure (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries in 1 and      after atrial switch in 6). Four patients (57%) had severe subpulmonic LV failure,      and aggressive perioperative diuresis with or without hemofiltration was used to       offload the subpulmonic LV. The indications of VAD were (1) bridge to transplant       in 3 and (2) bridge to decision for a high transpulmonary gradient in 4.      Transplantation outcome was compared with systemic RV failure without VAD bridge       in 19 patients (years 1989 to 2013). RESULTS: Systemic RV support alone was      achieved in all patients, with no early deaths (</=30 days). Overall, 6 (86%)      returned home, 3 (44%) received a transplant, 2 (28%) died of noncardiac causes,       and 2 (28%) continue on VAD support (median support, 232 days). Repeat      catheterization (n = 4) showed an improved median transpulmonary gradient in 3      patients (median 18.5 mm Hg pre-VAD vs 8.0 mm Hg post-VAD). Two      bridge-to-decision patients received transplants at 640 and 685 days. The stroke       rate on VAD support was 43% (2 thromboembolic and 1 hemorrhagic; 3 with      satisfactory recovery). De novo aortic regurgitation was 29% (n = 2; 1 valve      replacement). All patients (n = 3) survived transplantation (vs 10.5% early      mortality without VAD bridge; p = 1.00) and were well at follow-up (range, 53 to       700 days). CONCLUSIONS: The third-generation VAD provides durable support for      systemic RV failure as a bridge to transplant and as a strategy to reduce      pulmonary vascular resistance. Although concomitant subpulmonic LV failure is      common, systemic RV support alone was achieved in all patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
