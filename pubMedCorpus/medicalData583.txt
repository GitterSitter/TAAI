OBJECTIVE: To determine whether electrocardiograms of VT with LV apical exit      sites would identify patients with larger scars extending a greater distance from      the base toward the apex and decreased heart transplant/left ventricular assist      device (LVAD)-free survival. METHODS: Consecutive patients with LV NICM      undergoing VT ablation between May 2008 and April 2011 were studied. All      electrocardiograms of spontaneous and induced VT were analyzed. Apical VT was      defined as left bundle branch morphology with precordial transition >/= V5 or      right bundle branch morphology with precordial transition </= V3. Scar percentage      was defined as the area of low voltage divided by the total surface area.      RESULTS: Thirty-two of 76 patients had 1 or more apical VTs. Those with apical      VTs had larger percentage of endocardial and epicardial bipolar scars (14.9% vs      8.1%, P = .01, and 15.5% vs 5.5%, P = .03, respectively), scar that, although      originating from the periannular region (94.7% of the patients), was more likely       to extend apically beyond the basal half (48.3% vs 24.4%, P = .05 endocardial,      and 85.7% vs 25.9%, P = .07 epicardial), and worse transplant/LVAD-free survival       during a mean follow-up of 332 days (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NICM      and apical VTs have larger voltage abnormality extending as contiguous or patchy       "scar" from the base further toward the apex and worse transplant/LVAD-free      survival. Particular attention should be paid to optimal heart failure management      in these patients, with more guarded prognosis.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Heart Rhythm Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.
