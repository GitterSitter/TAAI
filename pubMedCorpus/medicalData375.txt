BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage heart failure as a result of CCMP from      anthracyclines are often precluded from heart transplantation because of a      history of cancer. In such patients, durable MCS may offer an important chance      for life prolongation. Yet, there are no data to support the use of MCS in this      increasingly prevalent group of patients. METHODS: We searched 3,812 MCS patients      from June 2006 through March 2011 in the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) database for the diagnosis of CCMP. We      compared characteristics, outcomes, and survival between CCMP patients and      patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS:      Compared with patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ischemic      cardiomyopathy, patients with CCMP were overwhelmingly female (72% vs. 24% vs.      13%, p = 0.001), had MCS more often implanted as destination therapy (33% vs. 14%      vs. 22%, p = 0.03), required more right ventricular assist device support (19%      vs. 11% vs. 6%, p = 0.006), and had a higher risk of bleeding (p = 0001).      Survival of CCMP patients was similar to that of other groups. CONCLUSIONS: CCMP       patients treated with MCS have survival similar to other MCS patients despite      more frequent need for right ventricular assist device support and increased      bleeding risk.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
