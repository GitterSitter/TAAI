These devices may be implanted as a bridge to transplant or as destination      therapy. After surgical recovery and education regarding device care, patients      are discharged home. Meticulous care of the driveline must be taken to prevent      infection and trauma of the site throughout the perioperative event and for the      duration of support. Currently a standardized protocol for care of the driveline       and exit site does not exist. VAD coordinators from across the country discussed       the variability in care at different centers in the United States through a      series of conference calls. A survey consisting of 16 questions was developed.      The survey included questions on preoperative antibiotic recommendations,      driveline placement and exit site suturing, frequency of dressing changes, and      showering practices. VAD coordinators shared center-specific dressing protocols      and any driveline success stories. This survey was sent to 73 centers; 38 centers      (52%) responded. The purpose of the survey was to define current practice in      order to move toward a standard of practice or protocol based on expert opinion      for VAD driveline care and to assess the need for future studies.FAU - Cannon, AnneAU  - Cannon AAD  - University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, CO, USA. anne.cannon@uch.eduFAU - Elliott, TonyaAU  - Elliott TFAU - Ballew, CaroleAU  - Ballew CFAU - Cavey, JulieAU  - Cavey JFAU - O'Shea, GenevieveAU  - O'Shea GFAU - Franzwa, JenniferAU  - Franzwa JFAU - Puhlman, MarkAU  - Puhlman MFAU - Bennett, JamiAU  - Bennett JFAU - Ryan, TimothyAU  - Ryan TFAU - Lockard, KathleenAU  - Lockard KFAU - Avrahami, NeshamaAU  - Avrahami NFAU - Brennan, PamelaAU  - Brennan PFAU - Kurien, SudhaAU  - Kurien SFAU - Andrus, ShaunaAU  - Andrus SFAU - Dick, SaraAU  - Dick SFAU - Davis, ErinAU  - Davis ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Prog TransplantJT  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)JID - 100909380SB  - NMH  - Antibiotic ProphylaxisMH  - BandagesMH  - BiofilmsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - HygieneMH  - Immunocompromised HostMH  - Infection Control/*methodsMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & controlMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Suture TechniquesMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2012/11/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/02/13 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/29 06:00AID - H3G1P545W41T4438 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Prog Transplant. 2012 Dec;22(4):351-9.
