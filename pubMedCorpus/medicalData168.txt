One common strategy to address AI during CF-LVAD support      is central oversewing of the aortic valve, which allows some opening between the       valve leaflets laterally. However, the long-term durability of this technique has      not been extensively described. METHODS: All patients who underwent central      oversewing of the aortic valve during CF-LVAD support between January 2006 and      March 2013 were included in this analysis. Pre- and post-procedure      intra-operative transesophageal echocardiograms (TEEs) were reviewed to determine      the efficacy of the surgical technique, whereas all subsequent transthoracic      echocardiograms (TTEs) were reviewed to assess durability. AI severity was graded      using the vena contracta (VC) width and the ratio between the VC and left      ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with      central aortic valve oversewing were identified. Median follow-up was 560 days      (range 46 to 954 days). All but 1 patient had their aortic insufficiency reduced       to "none/trace" on post-operative TEE. There was no statistically significant      increase in the VC width and VC/LVOT ratio between the first and last follow-up      echocardiograms, and only 2 patients developed more than mild aortic      insufficiency after central oversewing. Central oversewing of the aortic valve      did not adversely affect outcomes after LVAD implantation. CONCLUSION: Central      oversewing of the aortic valve is an effective and durable means of addressing      greater than mild AI in patients with CF-LVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
