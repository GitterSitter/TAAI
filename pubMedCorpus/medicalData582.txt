The question addressed was: is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation      (ECMO) superior to dedicated ventricular assist device (VAD) in patients with      acutely failing allograft following transplantation. Altogether, 162 papers were       found using the reported search, of which 8 represented the best evidence to      answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of      publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of       these papers are tabulated. Two studies provide data only for ECMO-treated      patients, in three, the authors describe their experiences with Levitronix      CentriMag and three studies directly compare the outcomes of ECMO and VAD      support. The survival ranges from 40 to 74% in patients rescued with ECMO      compared with 33-60% in patients supported with dedicated VAD. We conclude that      there is insufficient evidence to prefer ECMO over VAD and the optimal modality      of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) following heart transplantation should be      determined by the surgeon and institutional experience and dependent on the      extent and severity of myocardial dysfunction and the presence or absence of      associated respiratory insufficiency.FAU - Urban, MarianAU  - Urban MAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine,       Videnska, Prague, Czech Republic. maub@ikem.czFAU - Szarszoi, OndrejAU  - Szarszoi OFAU - Pirk, JanAU  - Pirk JFAU - Netuka, IvanAU  - Netuka ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121230PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMMH  - BenchmarkingMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/adverse effects/mortalityMH  - Heart Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortalityMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Respiratory Insufficiency/etiologyMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Ventricular Function, RightPMC - PMC3598045OID - NLM: PMC3598045EDAT- 2013/01/02 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/31 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/02 06:00PHST- 2012/12/30 [aheadofprint]AID - ivs546 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivs546 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2013 Apr;16(4):517-9. doi: 10.1093/icvts/ivs546.
