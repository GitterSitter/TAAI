BACKGROUND: Regenerative      potential of stem cells to repair acute infarction is limited. Improved hCPC      survival, proliferation, and differentiation into functional myocardium will      increase efficacy and advance translational implementation of cardiac      regeneration. METHODS: hCPCs isolated from the myocardium of heart failure      patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation were engineered      to express green fluorescent protein (hCPCe) or Pim-1-GFP (hCPCeP). Functional      tests of hCPC regenerative potential were performed with immunocompromised mice      by using intramyocardial adoptive transfer injection after infarction. Myocardial      structure and function were monitored by echocardiographic and hemodynamic      assessment for 20 weeks after delivery. hCPCe and hCPCeP expressing luciferase      were observed by using bioluminescence imaging to noninvasively track      persistence. RESULTS: hCPCeP exhibited augmentation of reparative potential      relative to hCPCe control cells, as shown by significantly increased      proliferation coupled with amelioration of infarction injury and increased      hemodynamic performance at 20 weeks post-transplantation. Concurrent with      enhanced cardiac structure and function, hCPCeP demonstrated increased cellular      engraftment and differentiation with improved vasculature and reduced infarct      size. Enhanced persistence of hCPCeP versus hCPCe was revealed by bioluminescence      imaging at up to 8 weeks post-delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic engineering of hCPCs      with Pim-1 enhanced repair of damaged myocardium. Ex vivo gene delivery to modify      stem cells has emerged as a viable option addressing current limitations in the      field. This study demonstrates that efficacy of hCPCs from the failing myocardium      can be safely and significantly enhanced through expression of Pim-1 kinase,      setting the stage for use of engineered cells in pre-clinical settings.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
