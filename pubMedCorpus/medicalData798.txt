In      particular, isolated right heart dysfunction after cardiotomy has a poor      prognosis and is associated with a high mortality rate. The occurrence of      postoperative right heart failure may develop in more than 40% of patients      undergoing implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and cardiac      transplantation. To date, mechanical cardiac assistance in the form of VADs has      become accepted as a therapeutic solution for end-stage patients when a donor      heart is not available. However, right ventricular (RV) assistance is still in      the early phase of development when compared with LVAD technology.      State-of-the-art RVADs, both in clinical use and under development, are reviewed       in this manuscript. Clinical RVADs include the extracorporeal pulsatile Abiomed      BVS 5000 and AB5000, Thoratec PVAD, MEDOS VAD, BerlinHeart Excor, the      percutaneous continuous flow CentriMag and TandemHeart systems, and the      implantable Thoratec IVAD. Devices on the horizon, including the wear-free      implantable DexAide and the minimally invasive Impella RD, are additionally      reviewed. In addition to the current status of RV assistance, as well as the      device categorization, the outlook and considerations for successful development       of future RVADs were discussed.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.
