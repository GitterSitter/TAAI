However, VA      ECMO can be limited by insufficient ventricular unloading, resulting in thrombus       formation and pulmonary edema. Impella 2.5 has been used to unload the left      ventricle and provide hemodynamic support during acute heart failure. We present       our experience of the Impella 2.5 as an adjunct for left ventricular unloading      during peripheral VA ECMO support and as a bridge for the HeartMate II left      ventricular assist device (LVAD). An Impella 2.5 was placed in patients who were       on peripheral VA ECMO with evidence of left ventricular distension. Patients who       were candidates for heart transplant were transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD.       Five patients on VA ECMO with ventricular distension underwent Impella 2.5      implantation, resulting in a decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter as      measured by echocardiography (7.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.8 cm, p = 0.001). Four      patients were subsequently transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD after      restoration of end-organ function. Impella 2.5 is a safe means to unload the left      ventricle while on peripheral VA ECMO to prevent left ventricle thrombus      formation and worsening pulmonary edema in patients transitioning to a HeartMate       II LVAD.FAU - Cheng, AllenAU  - Cheng AAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Rochester Medical Center,      Rochester, New York 14642, USA.FAU - Swartz, Michael FAU  - Swartz MFFAU - Massey, H ToddAU  - Massey HTLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Aortic Valve/physiopathologyMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*methodsMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Ventricles/*physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Pulmonary Edema/prevention & control/therapyMH  - Thrombosis/prevention & controlMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*therapyEDAT- 2013/09/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/03 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f0e52 [doi]AID - 00002480-201309000-00017 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2013 Sep-Oct;59(5):533-6. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f0e52.
