The      study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Included were      24 consecutive female cfLVAD recipients and 24 male recipients (62.5% HeartMate      II, 37.5% HeartWare) who received their devices between July 2007 and May 2013.      Subjects were matched using propensity score analysis based on age, diagnosis,      body surface area, preoperative mechanical circulatory support, heart failure      severity score (INTERMACS class), and comorbidities. Female patients were      significantly sicker before operation. After propensity score matching, there      were no statistically significant differences in demographics or clinical      baseline characteristics between male and female LVAD recipients. Also, there was      a trend towards a longer postoperative intensive care unit stay in the female      group (median 9 days [interquartile range 5-17] versus 15 days [interquartile      range 8-33]; P < 0.061) and higher postoperative bilirubin values (median 14      mmol/L [interquartile range 10-17] versus 21 mmol/L [interquartile range 13-30]).      However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of      outcome (P < 0.569). The overall survival was comparable between the two groups      (log rank P < 0.389). Half (50%) of female patients required inotropic support      for more than 7 days compared with 21.7% in the male group (P < 0.048). Half      (50%) of female recipients required short-term postoperative right ventricular      assist device implantation compared with 16.7% in the male group (P < 0.014). In       conclusion, cfLVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation is associated with      longer duration of inotropic support and higher requirement for postoperative      mechanical right ventricular support in women with similar survival rates.      Further studies are required to identify additional demographic and clinical      factors that modulate outcomes and will enhance the ability to risk-stratify      cfLVAD recipients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Weymann, AlexanderAU  - Weymann AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support,       Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of      Cardiac Surgery, Heart Center, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.FAU - Patil, Nikhil PrakashAU  - Patil NPFAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AFAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNFAU - Garcia Saez, DianaAU  - Garcia Saez DFAU - Amrani, MohamedAU  - Amrani MFAU - Bahrami, ToufanAU  - Bahrami TFAU - De Robertis, FabioAU  - De Robertis FFAU - Wahlers, ThorstenAU  - Wahlers TFAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRFAU - Popov, Aron-FrederikAU  - Popov AFFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140829PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Bridge to recoveryOT  - Bridge to transplantationOT  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist deviceOT  - Gender differencesEDAT- 2014/09/02 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/02 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/02 06:00PHST- 2014/08/29 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12361 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Mar;39(3):212-9. doi: 10.1111/aor.12361.
