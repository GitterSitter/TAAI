Limitations of first-generation left ventricular assist devices for long-term      support of patients with end-stage disease have led to the development of newer      second-generation and third-generation pumps, which are smaller, have fewer      moving parts, and have shown improved durability, allowing for extended support.       The HeartMate II (second generation) and HeartWare (third generation) are 2      devices that have shown great promise as potential alternatives to      transplantation in select patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
