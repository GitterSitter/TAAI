Isolated and      defined changes in hemodynamic parameters are unattainable in animal models,      while the heart-pump interaction in its whole complexity cannot be modeled in      vitro or in silico. AIM: The aim of this work was to develop an isolated heart      setup to provide a realistic heart-pump interface with the possibility of easily       adjusting hemodynamic parameters. METHODS: A mock circuit mimicking the systemic       circulation was developed. Eight porcine hearts were harvested using a protocol      similar to heart transplantation. Then, the hearts were resuscitated using      Langendorff perfusion with rewarmed, oxygenated blood. An RBP was implanted and      the setup was switched to the "working mode" with the left heart and the RBP      working as under physiologic conditions. Both the unassisted and assisted      hemodynamics were monitored. RESULTS: In the unassisted condition, cardiac output      was up to 9.5 l/min and dP/dtmax ranged from 521 to 3621 mmHg/s at a preload of      15 mmHg and afterload of 70 mmHg. With the RBP turned on, hemodynamics similar to      heart-failure patients were observed in each heart. Mean pump flow and flow      pulsatility ranged from 0 to 11 l/min. We were able to reproduce conditions with       an open and closed aortic valve as well as suction events. CONCLUSIONS: An      isolated heart setup including an RBP was developed, which combines the      advantages of in silico/vitro methods and animal experiments. This tool thus      provides further insight into the interaction between the heart and an RBP.FAU - Granegger, MarcusAU  - Granegger MAD  - Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of      Vienna, Vienna - Austria and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster for Cardiovascular      Research, Vienna - Austria.FAU - Mahr, StephaneAU  - Mahr SFAU - Horvat, JohannAU  - Horvat JFAU - Aigner, PhilippAU  - Aigner PFAU - Roehrich, MichaelAU  - Roehrich MFAU - Stoiber, MartinAU  - Stoiber MFAU - Plasenzotti, RobertoAU  - Plasenzotti RFAU - Zimpfer, DanielAU  - Zimpfer DFAU - Schima, HeinrichAU  - Schima HFAU - Moscato, FrancescoAU  - Moscato FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20131009PL  - ItalyTA  - Int J Artif OrgansJT  - The International journal of artificial organsJID - 7802649SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Blood Flow VelocityMH  - Cardiac OutputMH  - *Coronary CirculationMH  - Heart/*physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - *HemodynamicsMH  - Models, AnimalMH  - Myocardial ContractionMH  - PerfusionMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Pulsatile FlowMH  - SwineMH  - TemperatureMH  - Time FactorsMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftEDAT- 2013/12/24 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/19 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/24 06:00PHST- 2013/12/23 [ppublish]PHST- 2013/10/09 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2013/08/07 [accepted]AID - E47F1C59-21AF-43AF-A308-4E76CAC93FF3 [pii]AID - 10.5301/ijao.5000257 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Artif Organs. 2013 Dec;36(12):878-86. doi: 10.5301/ijao.5000257.
