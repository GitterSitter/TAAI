However, a certain number of patients continue to have      significant mitral regurgitation (MR) under LVAD support. We investigated      pre-operative echocardiographic features associated with persistent MR after LVAD      implantation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 82 consecutive patients      undergoing continuous-flow LVAD implantation between 2007 and 2010. We obtained      echocardiograms performed within 2 weeks before and 1 week after surgery. We      investigated the pre-operative echocardiographic findings associated with      significant MR post-LVAD and compared 1-year mortality after LVAD surgery between      patients with and without significant MR post-LVAD. RESULTS: MR was significant      in 43 patients (52.4%) before LVAD surgery. Among those, 5 underwent concomitant       mitral valve repair (MVr) at the time of LVAD implantation. Of the remaining 38      patients, 25 (65.8%) showed improvement of MR, whereas 13 patients (34.2%)      continued to have significant MR post-LVAD. Multivariate analysis revealed that      posterior displacement of the coaptation point of mitral leaflets was      significantly associated with significant MR post-LVAD (hazard ratio, 1.335; 95%       confidence interval, 1.035-1.721; p = 0.026) even after adjusting for the amount       of pre-operative MR flow. Post-LVAD 1-year survival of patients with and without       significant MR post-LVAD was not significantly different (92.3% vs 89.1%, p =      0.826). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-LVAD posterior displacement of mitral leaflets may be      indicative of post-operative significant MR, which would help identify      echocardiographic features of functional MR refractory to simple volume reduction      of the ventricle.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
