Little is known about their post-transplant outcomes. The       aim of this analysis was to determine whether there was a difference in early      survival for children bridged to transplant with EXCOR versus status 1A pediatric      heart transplant patients not transplanted with ventricular assist device      support. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pediatric heart transplant patients (n=106) bridged      to transplantation with EXCOR were compared with a similarly aged cohort (n=1021)      within the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) database (both cohorts      from May 2007 to December 2010). In the EXCOR group, 12-month post-transplant      survival (88.7%) was similar to OPTN patients listed status 1A who were not on      ventricular assist device support at transplant (89.3%; P=0.85) and significantly      better than 12-month survival in OPTN patients on extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation at transplant (60.3%; P<0.001). Rejection (50%) was a significantly      (P=0.005) higher cause of 12-month post-transplant mortality in the EXCOR      compared with the OPTN group. Death after transplant was also higher in EXCOR      patients with congenital heart disease compared with those with cardiomyopathy      (26.1% versus 7.2%; P=0.02). Post-transplant survival was similar in EXCOR      patients with >/=1 serious adverse event during ventricular assist device support      as those without an event during support. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month      post-transplant survival with EXCOR is comparable with overall pediatric heart      transplant survival and superior to survival after extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation. Neither adverse events during support nor factors associated with      mortality during support influence post-transplant survival. Rejection was a      significantly greater cause of post-transplant mortality in EXCOR than in OPTN      patients.FAU - Eghtesady, PiroozAU  - Eghtesady PAD  - St. Louis Children's Hospital, St. Louis, MO (P.E., D.E., C.C.); Boston      Children's Hospital, Boston, MA (C.S.D.A.); Berlin Heart, Inc, The Woodlands, TX       (C.T.); Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR (M.I.); Riley Hospital for       Children, Indianapolis, IN (M.T.); Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee,      WI (J.T.); and Duke Children's Hospital, Durham, NC (R.D.B.J.).FAU - Almond, Christopher S DAU  - Almond CSFAU - Tjossem, ChristineAU  - Tjossem CFAU - Epstein, DeirdreAU  - Epstein DFAU - Imamura, MichiakiAU  - Imamura MFAU - Turrentine, MarkAU  - Turrentine MFAU - Tweddell, JamesAU  - Tweddell JFAU - Jaquiss, Robert D BAU  - Jaquiss RDFAU - Canter, CharlesAU  - Canter CCN  - Berlin Heart InvestigatorsLA  - engGR  - R01 FD0003557/FD/FDA HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - United StatesTA  - CirculationJT  - CirculationJID - 0147763SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - BerlinMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/mortality/*trendsMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Graft Rejection/mortality/prevention & controlMH  - Heart Transplantation/mortality/*trendsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*trendsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Postoperative Care/mortality/*trendsMH  - Survival Rate/trendsMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - heart failureOT  - heart-assist deviceOT  - pediatricsOT  - surgeryOT  - transplantationEDAT- 2013/09/18 06:00MHDA- 2013/12/16 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/14 06:00AID - 128/26_suppl_1/S24 [pii]AID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000446 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Circulation. 2013 Sep 10;128(11 Suppl 1):S24-31. doi:      10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000446.
