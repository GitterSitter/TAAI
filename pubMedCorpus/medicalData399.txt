Once medical management has hit its ceiling, attention is turned to surgical      options for mechanical support. The approach to these options has to bear in mind      that there may be many potential causes for pump failure, and that these occur      often in the context of pulmonary hypertension and poor gas exchange. Although      extracorporeal life support has been the mainstay of treatment for acute heart      failure, in the last decade, attention has been focusing on longer-term options      to bridge to recovery or eventual transplant. Added to this are more novel      applications of ventricular assist devices, notable in the management of the      failing Fontan circulation where there are no perfect solutions. There is growing      interest in the use of such devices to power this delicate circulation and extend      the functional capacity of patients without resorting to transplantation. In this      review article, we explore the role each of these surgical modalities has to play      in the management of the child with acute and chronic heart failure, and explore       the recent developments in the rapidly growing field of pediatric ventricular      assist.FAU - Kanani, MazyarAU  - Kanani MAD  - Cardiac Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust,      Cardiac Unit 7th Floor, Nurses Home, London, WC1N 3JH, UK.FAU - Hsia, Tain-YenAU  - Hsia TYLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Cardiol RepJT  - Current cardiology reportsJID - 100888969SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - Decision MakingMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*methodsMH  - Fontan ProcedureMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/trendsMH  - HumansEDAT- 2013/09/04 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/04 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11886-013-0404-0 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Cardiol Rep. 2013 Oct;15(10):404. doi: 10.1007/s11886-013-0404-0.
