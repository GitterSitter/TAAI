Nine patients (6 males, 3 females; mean       33.5 +/- 7.8 years; New York Heart Association class III or IV) received the HVAD      as a bridge to transplantation between 2011 and 2012. Six had dilated      cardiomyopathy, 2 secondary cardiomyopathy, and 1 dilated phase hypertrophic      cardiomyopathy. All operations were uneventful, with a mean operation time of 269      +/- 77 min and cardiopulmonary bypass time of 121 +/- 40 min. One required a      temporary right ventricular assist device and was weaned on postoperative day 20,      while another required pump exchange due to foreign tissue in the inflow. Mean      support duration was 245 +/- 162 days (range: 50-535 days) and mean pump blood      flow at 1 month postoperatively was 4.8 +/- 0.8 l/min. There was no mortality      after 30 days, though 1 patient died during support due to cerebral hemorrhage.      Presently, the others are waiting for heart transplantation without problems,      except 1 who suffered from an active infection. There was no pump mechanical      failure in any case. The HeartWare pump enables quick implantation with      acceptable morbidity and mortality. Our preliminary results indicate that this      left ventricular assist device is safe for circulatory assistance for heart      transplant candidates in Japan.FAU - Nishi, HiroyukiAU  - Nishi HAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of      Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.FAU - Toda, KoichiAU  - Toda KFAU - Miyagawa, ShigeruAU  - Miyagawa SFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Fukushima, SatsukiAU  - Fukushima SFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Yoshioka, DaisukeAU  - Yoshioka DFAU - Saito, TetsuyaAU  - Saito TFAU - Ueno, TakayoshiAU  - Ueno TFAU - Sakaguchi, TaichiAU  - Sakaguchi TFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140125PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/complications/*therapyMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic/complications/*therapyMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/etiology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - MaleMH  - Operative TimeMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2014/01/28 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/31 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/28 06:00PHST- 2013/09/26 [received]PHST- 2013/12/24 [accepted]PHST- 2014/01/25 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-013-0753-x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2014 Jun;17(2):149-56. doi: 10.1007/s10047-013-0753-x.
