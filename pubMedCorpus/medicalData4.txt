However, stroke (a well-known LVAD complication) and subclinical      cerebral ischemia may result in transient or permanent cognitive decline. We      sought to describe the incidence and predictors of cognitive decline after LVAD      using a valid, sensitive assessment tool. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 4419      patients in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory      Support who underwent LVAD implantation between May 2012 and December 2013,      cognitive function was assessed in 1173 patients with the Trail Making B Test      before LVAD and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The test detects several forms of      cognitive impairment, including subclinical stroke. Cognitive decline was defined      as a clinically important increase during follow-up using a moderate Cohen d      effect size of 0.5xbaseline SD (32 s). The cumulative incidence of cognitive      decline in the year after LVAD implantation, treating death and transplantation      as competing risks, was 29.2%. In adjusted analysis, older age (>/=70 versus <50       years; hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.46-3.44; Ptrend<0.001) and      destination therapy (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.92) were      significantly associated with greater risk of cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS:      Cognitive decline occurs commonly in patients in the year after LVAD and is      associated with older age and destination therapy. These results could have      important implications for patient selection and improved communication of risks       before LVAD implantation. Additional studies are needed to explore the      association between cognitive decline and subsequent stroke, health status, and      mortality in patients after LVAD.CI  - (c) 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Fendler, Timothy JAU  - Fendler TJAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.). fendlert@umkc.edu.FAU - Spertus, John AAU  - Spertus JAAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Gosch, Kensey LAU  - Gosch KLAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Jones, Philip GAU  - Jones PGAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Bruce, Jared MAU  - Bruce JMAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Nassif, Michael EAU  - Nassif MEAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Flint, Kelsey MAU  - Flint KMAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Dunlay, Shannon MAU  - Dunlay SMAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Allen, Larry AAU  - Allen LAAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).FAU - Arnold, Suzanne VAU  - Arnold SVAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).LA  - ENGGR  - HHSN268201100025C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL116799/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32 HL110837/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150429TA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual OutcomesJT  - Circulation.
