Despite the functional and biologic evidence of reverse cardiac      remodeling, few patients actually proceed to myocardial recovery, and even fewer       to the point of having their device explanted. An enhanced understanding of the      biology and care of the mechanically supported patient has redirected focus on      the possibility of using ventricular assist devices as a bridge to myocardial      recovery and removal. Herein, we review the current issues and approaches to      transforming myocardial recovery to a practical reality.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
