Here, we present a case of a       patient with hemolytic anemia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist      device (CF-LVAD) implantation that was successfully treated with pentoxifylline.       Our case is a 64-year-old African American woman who was implanted with a      HeartMate II device on August 6, 2010, as a bridge to transplant for end-stage      heart failure. Her postoperative course was complicated by recurrent      gastrointestinal bleeding and antiplatelet therapy was discontinued. On October      25, 2011, she was readmitted with anemia and hemoglobin of 6.6 mg/dl and no      identifiable source of bleeding. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 936 IU/L,      indicating severe hemolysis. Due to her evidence of hemolytic anemia and her      inability to tolerate antiplatelet therapy due to recurrent bleeding, she was      discharged on pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily on October 27, 2011, with      hemoglobin of 11.2 mg/dl after transfusion. After 60 days of pentoxifylline, her       hemoglobin and LDH in clinic were 10.1 mg/dl and 223 IU/L, respectively. The      patient was successfully bridged to transplant in June 2012. Additional analysis       of pentoxifylline as a therapeutic modality to manage hemolytic anemia after      CF-LVAD implantation may be warranted.FAU - Jennings, Douglas LAU  - Jennings DLAD  - Pharmacy Services, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, USA.      djennin1@gmail.comFAU - Williams, Celeste TAU  - Williams CTFAU - Morgan, Jeffrey AAU  - Morgan JALA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Hemoglobins)RN  - 0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Vasodilator Agents)RN  - EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)RN  - SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)SB  - IMMH  - Anemia, Hemolytic/*drug therapyMH  - Cardiomyopathies/therapyMH  - FemaleMH  - Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/*etiology/*therapyMH  - Heart Failure/complications/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - Hemoglobins/analysisMH  - HemolysisMH  - HumansMH  - L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/bloodMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardial Ischemia/therapyMH  - Pentoxifylline/*therapeutic useMH  - Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effectsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Vasodilator Agents/*therapeutic useEDAT- 2013/07/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/31 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f0eb1 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2013 Sep-Oct;59(5):526-7. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f0eb1.
