Sixty-one percent of patients have been       reported to show moderate-to-severe dysfunction of the systemic ventricle, 25      years after repair of transposition of the great arteries by a Mustard procedure.      In such cases, heart transplant often seems to be the only option. When severe      heart failure with hemodynamic instability develops, the only way to bridge these      patients to a transplant is implantation of a mechanical circulatory support      system. Because of the special anatomic features of the right ventricle, the      implantation procedure can be challenging. Here, we report the case of a patient       who underwent a left ventricular assist device implant owing to severe heart      failure, 36 years after undergoing a Mustard procedure.FAU - Dakkak, Abdul RahmanAU  - Dakkak ARAD  - From the Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Hospital of Muenster,      Albert-Schweitzer Campus 1, Gebaeude: A1, 48149 Muenster, Germany.FAU - Sindermann, Juergen ReinhardAU  - Sindermann JRFAU - Dell'Aquila, Angelo MariaAU  - Dell'Aquila AMFAU - Welp, Henryk AdrianAU  - Welp HAFAU - Martens, SvenAU  - Martens SFAU - Scherer, MirelaAU  - Scherer MLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20140917TA  - Exp Clin TransplantJT  - Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East      Society for Organ TransplantationJID - 101207333EDAT- 2014/09/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/19 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/19 06:00AID - 10.6002/ect.2014.0043 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Exp Clin Transplant. 2014 Sep 17. doi: 10.6002/ect.2014.0043.
