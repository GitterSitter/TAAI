There has been interest in understanding whether pre-operative frailty      is associated with worse outcomes after implantation of a left ventricular assist      device (LVAD) as destination therapy. METHODS: Patients undergoing LVAD      implantation as destination therapy at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota,      from February 2007 to June 2012, were included in this study. Frailty was      assessed using the deficit index (31 impairments, disabilities and comorbidities)      and defined as the proportion of deficits present. We divided patients based on      tertiles of the deficit index (>0.32 = frail, 0.23 to 0.32 = intermediate frail,       <0.23 = not frail). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to      examine the association between frailty and death. Patients were censored at      death or last follow-up through October 2013. RESULTS: Among 99 patients (mean      age 65 years, 18% female, 55% with ischemic heart failure), the deficit index      ranged from 0.10 to 0.65 (mean 0.29). After a mean follow-up of 1.9 +/- 1.6      years, 79% of the patients had been rehospitalized (range 0 to 17      hospitalizations, median 1 per person) and 45% had died. Compared with those who       were not frail, patients who were intermediate frail (adjusted HR 1.70, 95% CI      0.71 to 4.31) and frail (HR 3.08, 95% CI 1.40 to 7.48) were at increased risk for      death (p for trend = 0.004). The mean (SD) number of days alive out of hospital      the first year after LVAD was 293 (107) for not frail, 266 (134) for intermediate      frail and 250 (132) for frail patients. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty before destination      LVAD implantation is associated with increased risk of death and may represent a       significant patient selection consideration.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
