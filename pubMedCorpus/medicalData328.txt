Conventional constant speed LVAD controllers do not regulate flow      according to preload, and can cause over/underpumping, leading to harmful      ventricular suction or pulmonary edema, respectively. We implemented a novel      adaptive controller which maintains a linear relationship between mean flow and      flow pulsatility to imitate native Starling-like flow regulation which requires      only the measurement of VAD flow. In vitro controller evaluation was conducted      and the flow sensitivity was compared during simulations of postural change,      pulmonary hypertension, and the transition from sleep to wake. The Starling-like       controller's flow sensitivity to preload was measured as 0.39 L/min/mm Hg, 10      times greater than constant speed control (0.04 L/min/mm Hg). Constant speed      control induced LV suction after sudden simulated pulmonary hypertension, whereas      Starling-like control reduced mean flow from 4.14 to 3.58 L/min, maintaining safe      support. From simulated sleep to wake, Starling-like control increased flow 2.93       to 4.11 L/min as a response to the increased residual LV pulsatility. The      proposed controller has the potential to better match device outflow to patient      demand in comparison with conventional constant speed control.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs      and Transplantation.FAU - Gaddum, Nicholas RAU  - Gaddum NRAD  - Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, St. Thomas' Hospital,      King's College London, London, UK.FAU - Stevens, MichaelAU  - Stevens MFAU - Lim, EinlyAU  - Lim EFAU - Fraser, JohnAU  - Fraser JFAU - Lovell, NigelAU  - Lovell NFAU - Mason, DavidAU  - Mason DFAU - Timms, DanielAU  - Timms DFAU - Salamonsen, RobertAU  - Salamonsen RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesDEP - 20131223PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *Models, CardiovascularMH  - Pulsatile Flow/*physiologyMH  - Ventricular Function, Left/*physiologyOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Flow controlOT  - Frank-Starling mechanismOT  - Heart failureOT  - Left ventricular assist device controlOT  - Pulsatility indexEDAT- 2014/01/01 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/31 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/31 06:00PHST- 2013/12/23 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12221 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2014 Mar;38(3):E46-56. doi: 10.1111/aor.12221.
