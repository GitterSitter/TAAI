Until recently, this was      thought to be unidirectional, progressive, and irreversible. However,      irreversibility has been shown to be incorrect because complete or partial      reversal can occur that can be marked after myocardial unloading with a left      ventricular assist device (LVAD). Patients with chronic advanced heart failure      can show near-normalization of nearly all structural abnormalities of the      myocardium or reverse remodeling after LVAD support. However, reverse remodeling       does not always equate with clinical recovery. The molecular changes occurring      after LVAD support are reviewed, both those demonstrated with LVAD unloading      alone in patients bridged to transplantation and those occurring in the      myocardium of patients who have recovered enough myocardial function to have the       device removed. Reverse remodeling may be attributable to a reversal of the      pathological mechanisms that occur in remodeling or the generation of new      pathways. A reduction in cell size occurs after LVAD unloading, which does not      necessarily correlate with improved cardiac function. However, some of the      changes in both the cardiac myocyte and the matrix after LVAD support are      specific to myocardial recovery. In the myocyte, increases in the cytoskeletal      proteins and improvements in the Ca(2)(+) handling pathway seem to be      specifically associated with myocardial recovery. Changes in the matrix are      complex, but excessive scarring appears to limit the ability for recovery, and      the degree of fibrosis in the myocardium at the time of implantation may predict       the ability to recover.FAU - Birks, Emma JAU  - Birks EJAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY,       USA. emma.birks@louisville.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Circ ResJT  - Circulation researchJID - 0047103SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Calcium SignalingMH  - Cytoskeleton/metabolismMH  - Extracellular Matrix/metabolismMH  - Heart Failure/metabolism/*therapyMH  - Heart Ventricles/*metabolism/pathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansOTO - NOTNLMOT  - heart failureOT  - left ventricular assist deviceOT  - remodelingOT  - reverse remodelingEDAT- 2013/08/31 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/31 06:00AID - CIRCRESAHA.113.301413 [pii]AID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301413 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ Res. 2013 Aug 30;113(6):777-91. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301413.
