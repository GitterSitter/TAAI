These devices have clear advantages over extracorporeal       membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and are often used in adults. They are only recently       being commonly used in the pediatric age group. As the use of LVADs becomes more       mainstream in children, it is important to determine the complication profile      associated with these devices. Furthermore, with the increasing application of      LVADs in children, pediatric neurosurgeons are seeing a correlative increase in      associated neurological complications. In this study, the authors reviewed the      incidence of neurological complications due to LVAD use in the pediatric age      group and the role of neurosurgery in treatment. METHODS: The authors examined      data regarding patients with LVADs from the Texas Children's Hospital Heart      Center database (July 01, 2007, to June 30, 2011) and recorded neurological      complications requiring neurosurgical consultation. They identified 2 children      who underwent craniotomies during LVAD treatment. RESULTS: Intracranial      hemorrhage occurred in 3 (6.5%) of the 46 patients treated with an LVAD at the      authors' institution. Of these patients, 2 were treated with craniotomies for      life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages. The 3 patients in the neurosurgical      cohort presented with cerebral infarction, decreased level of consciousness,      and/or seizure. At the last follow-up (286, 503, and 550 days), 1 patient (case      2) had no decline in neurological status, underwent a successful heart      transplant, and was discharged home; 1 patient (case 1) died of refractory      cardiac failure; and 1 patient (case 3) was on an LVAD for destination therapy      (that is, the LVAD is not a bridge to transplantation but rather the final      treatment). This patient was discharged from the hospital, but he died of      overwhelming fungemia at 286 days while on VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial      hemorrhage is a serious and feared complication of LVAD treatment. While the      surgical risk is substantial due to systemic anticoagulation and significant      medical comorbidities, neurosurgical evacuation of hemorrhage plays an important       life-saving role that can yield successful and acceptable outcomes.FAU - Mayer, Rory RAU  - Mayer RRAD  - Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Department of Neurosurgery, Texas Children's       Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston 77030, USA.FAU - Hwang, Steven WAU  - Hwang SWFAU - Reddy, Gaddum DAU  - Reddy GDFAU - Morales, David LAU  - Morales DLFAU - Whitehead, William EAU  - Whitehead WEFAU - Curry, Daniel JAU  - Curry DJFAU - Bollo, Robert JAU  - Bollo RJFAU - Luerssen, Thomas GAU  - Luerssen TGFAU - Jea, AndrewAU  - Jea ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120831PL  - United StatesTA  - J Neurosurg PediatrJT  - Journal of neurosurgery.
