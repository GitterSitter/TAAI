The driveline used to power today's      left ventricular assist devices, however, continues to be a source of infection,       traumatic damage, and rehospitalization. Previous attempts to wirelessly power      left ventricular assist devices using transcutaneous energy transfer systems have      been limited by restrictions on separation distance and alignment between the      transmit and receive coils. Resonant electrical energy transfer allows power      delivery at larger distances without compromising safety and efficiency. This      review covers the efforts to wirelessly power mechanical circulatory assist      devices and the progress made in enhancing their energy sources.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
