METHODS: The medical records of 6 adult patients with complex CHD who underwent      VAD implantation were retrospectively analyzed to characterize pre-operative      clinical status, implantation techniques and challenges, post-operative      management, and post-operative outcomes. RESULTS: All patients had a systemic      right ventricle, including 2 with single-ventricle physiology. The average age at      VAD implantation was 41 years. The implanted VADs included 1 HeartMate XVE, 3      HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA), 1 Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, New      York, NY), and 1 HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA). In-hospital      outcomes included no sub-pulmonic ventricular failure, no VAD thrombosis or      mechanical failure, 30-day mortality in 1 patient, non-fatal sub-arachnoid      hemorrhage in 1 patient, and sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring      unsynchronized direct current cardioversion in 1 patient. Of the 5 patients who      survived to discharge, 1 patient received 171 days of VAD support before cardiac       transplantation and survived for 1,484 days after transplantation; 1 patient      received 262 days of VAD support before out-of-hospital death of unknown      etiology; 1 patient had received VAD support for 988 days as of December 1, 2012,      while awaiting a transplant; and 2 patients who received VADs as destination      therapy had received 577 and 493 days of VAD support, respectively, and were      still alive as of December 1, 2012. CONCLUSIONS: This case series characterizes      important post-operative management challenges and clinical outcomes associated      with VAD implantation as a bridge-to-transplant or as destination therapy in      adult patients with complex CHD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
