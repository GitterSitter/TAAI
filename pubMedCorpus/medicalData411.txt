Complications may develop followed by frequent hospital admissions-most      often in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting-rendering a transplant a distant      reality and to discontinue the device means certain death. Emotional support for       patient and family is critical. Regardless of the original goal for the device,      palliative care provides assistance in communication, goal setting, and symptom      management and yet its consultation is often more for brink-of-death care than      end-of-life care provided at the time of diagnosis of a life-threatening disease       such as heart failure. This study examined the recent deaths of hospitalized      patients with VADs and the use of the palliative care service. Understanding the       benefit and timing of palliative care for VAD patients-particularly in the ICU      setting--may improve the end-of-life experience for patients, families, and      healthcare providers.FAU - McGonigal, PegAU  - McGonigal PAD  - Aurora Health Care, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53207, USA. peg.mcgonigal@aurora.orgLA  - engGR  - R25CA110454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - Omega (Westport)JT  - OmegaJID - 1272106SB  - IMMH  - Attitude of Health PersonnelMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Palliative Care/*methodsMH  - Patient Care Planning/*organization & administrationMH  - Patient Care Team/*organization & administrationMH  - *Professional-Patient RelationsMH  - Terminal Care/*organization & administrationMH  - Terminally IllEDAT- 2013/08/28 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/21 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/28 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Omega (Westport). 2013;67(1-2):161-6.
