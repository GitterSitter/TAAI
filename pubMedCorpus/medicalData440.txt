Accordingly, the role of implantable      cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in this patient population remains undefined.       METHODS AND RESULTS: Records of 106 consecutive patients undergoing implantation       of the HeartMate II LVAD at a single center were reviewed. For patients surviving      >30 days postimplant (98 patients), the impact of VAs and ICDs on survival was      analyzed. Mean age was 56.6+/-11.4 years, 82.1% were male, 42.5% had an ischemic       cardiomyopathy, 87.7% were bridge to transplantation, and median length of      support was 217 days. Twenty-one (19.8%) patients died, 60 (56.6%) survived to      transplantation, and 25 patients (23.6%) reached the end of study, had the LVAD      explanted, or were lost to follow-up. Post-LVAD VAs occurred in 37 patients      (34.9%) but were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.58      [0.18-1.90]). Sixty-two (63.3%) patients had an active ICD, and 36 (36.7%)      patients had no ICD or an inactivated ICD post-LVAD. Patients with an ICD were      more likely to be INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support) level 3 or 4 at the time of implant (54.8% versus 33.3%;      P=0.04). An appropriate shock was delivered in 27.3% of patients, but the      presence of an active ICD was not associated with improved survival (hazard      ratio, 1.12 [0.37-3.35]). CONCLUSIONS: VAs are common in patients with continuous      flow LVADs. Although some episodes may be clinically significant, VAs are not      associated with a worse prognosis, and concomitant ICDs in these patients may not      reduce mortality.FAU - Enriquez, Alan DAU  - Enriquez ADAD  - Zena and Michael A.
