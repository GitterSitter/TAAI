However, despite continuous improvement in       VAD technology, there remains a significant early postoperative morbidity and      mortality in this extreme patient group. The aim of the current study was to      explore the short-term outcomes and predictors for 90 day mortality in the      patients after implantation of continuous-flow LVAD. Perioperative clinical,      echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and laboratory data of 90 day survivors and      nonsurvivors were collected and compared retrospectively. Multivariate logistic      regression analysis was performed on univariate predictors for 90 day mortality      with an entry criterion of p < 0.1. Between July 2006 and May 2012, 117 patients       underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD as a bridge to transplantation:       71 (60.7%) HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) and 46 (39.3%) HVAD      (HeartWare International, Framingham, MA). All-cause 90 day mortality was 17.1%.       Multivariate analysis revealed higher preoperative central venous pressure (odds       ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.014-1.378; p = 0.033) and      higher age (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38; p = 0.045) as the only independent      predictors for 90 day mortality. Optimization of preoperative volume status,      preload, and right heart function as well as age-based selection of candidates      for LVAD support are the critical factors influencing early outcome after      continuous-flow LVAD implantation.FAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AAD  - From the *Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory      Support, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom; daggerDepartment of Cardiothoracic Surgery,      University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; and double daggerDepartment of       Heart Failure and Transplant Medicine, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation       Trust, Hill End Road, Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNFAU - Zych, BartlomiejAU  - Zych BFAU - Garcia, DianaAU  - Garcia DFAU - Popov, Aron-FrederikAU  - Popov AFFAU - Weymann, AlexanderAU  - Weymann AFAU - Patil, Nikhil PAU  - Patil NPFAU - Hards, RachelAU  - Hards RFAU - Capoccia, MassimoAU  - Capoccia MFAU - Wahlers, ThorstenAU  - Wahlers TFAU - De Robertis, FabioAU  - De Robertis FFAU - Bahrami, ToufanAU  - Bahrami TFAU - Amrani, MohamedAU  - Amrani MFAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures/*mortalityMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative Complications/*mortalityMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC3942348OID - NLM: PMC3942348EDAT- 2014/01/09 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/25 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/09 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000035 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Mar-Apr;60(2):162-9. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000035.
