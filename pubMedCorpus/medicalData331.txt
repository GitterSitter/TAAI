It has been      increasingly recognized that there is a rapidly expanding population of children       diagnosed and living with heart failure. This expanding population has resulted      in increasing numbers of children with medically resistant end-stage heart      failure. The traditional therapy for these children has been heart      transplantation. However, children with heart failure unlike adults do not have      symptoms until they present with end-stage heart failure and therefore, cannot      safely wait for transplantation. Many of these children were bridged to heart      transplantation utilizing extracorporeal membranous oxygenation as a bridge to      transplant which has yielded poor results. As such, industry, clinicians, and the      government have refocused interest in developing increasing numbers of MCS      options for children living with heart failure as a bridge to transplantation and      as a chronic therapy. In this review, we discuss MCS options for short and      long-term support that are currently available for infants and children with      end-stage heart failure.FAU - Wilmot, IvanAU  - Wilmot IAD  - Department of Cardiology, The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital      Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, USA.FAU - Lorts, AngelaAU  - Lorts AAD  - Department of Cardiology, The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital      Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, USA.FAU - Morales, DavidAU  - Morales DAD  - Department of Congenital Heart Surgery, The Heart Institute, Cincinnati      Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,      USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20131206PL  - Korea (South)TA  - Korean J Thorac Cardiovasc SurgJT  - The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgeryJID - 101563922PMC - PMC3868686OID - NLM: PMC3868686OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cardiac transplantationOT  - Extracorporeal membranous oxygenationOT  - Heart failureOT  - PediatricOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/12/26 06:00MHDA- 2013/12/26 06:01CRDT- 2013/12/26 06:00PHST- 2013/10/29 [received]PHST- 2013/10/29 [revised]PHST- 2013/10/29 [accepted]PHST- 2013/12/06 [epublish]AID - 10.5090/kjtcs.2013.46.6.391 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Korean J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2013 Dec;46(6):391-401. doi:      10.5090/kjtcs.2013.46.6.391.
