We evaluated structural changes at the time of left      ventricular assist device implantation in heart failure patients who had been      exposed to anthracycline, and we correlated those changes with clinical      presentation. We retrospectively studied left ventricular core samples taken at      implantation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device in 12 heart      failure patients (mean age, 46 +/- 16 yr) who had histories of anthracycline      exposure. We evaluated those samples for hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and fibrosis.      Histopathologic findings showed moderate-to-severe myocyte hypertrophy, moderate       myocytolysis, and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis with areas of      replacement fibrosis. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked decreases in      myofibrils, diffuse mitochondrial swelling, and disorganization of the      sarcoplasmic reticulum. The interval between anthracycline therapy and heart      failure was a mean of 6.8 +/- 5.7 years; duration of heart failure symptoms, 38      +/- 47 months; and duration of device support, 414 +/- 266 days. Four patients      are continuing on device support, 3 have undergone transplantation, 3 have      undergone device explantation, and 2 have died. The time of heart failure onset      and the duration of symptoms did not correlate with the severity and extent of      the histopathologic changes. The histopathologic findings and the clinical course      varied in heart failure patients with anthracycline exposure. No correlation was       observed between anthracycline therapy and the development or duration of heart      failure symptoms, severity of histopathologic changes, or outcomes.FAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMFAU - Radovancevic, RajkoAU  - Radovancevic RFAU - Demirozu, Zumrat TAU  - Demirozu ZTFAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHFAU - Buja, L MaximilianAU  - Buja LMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20150401PL  - United StatesTA  - Tex Heart Inst JJT  - Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke's      Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children's HospitalJID - 8214622SB  - IMPMC - PMC4382876OID - NLM: PMC4382876OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Anthracyclines/adverse effectsOT  - antineoplastic agents/adverse effectsOT  - arrhythmias, cardiac/chemically inducedOT  - cardiomyopathies/chemically inducedOT  - congestive heart failure/chemically inducedOT  - doxorubicin/toxicityOT  - heart-assist devicesOT  - myocardium/pathologyOT  - nonischemic cardiomyopathyOT  - retrospective studiesOT  - ventricular remodelingEDAT- 2015/04/16 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/16 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/16 06:00PHST- 2015/04 [ecollection]PHST- 2015/04/01 [epublish]AID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Tex Heart Inst J. 2015 Apr 1;42(2):124-30. doi: 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509.      eCollection 2015 Apr.
