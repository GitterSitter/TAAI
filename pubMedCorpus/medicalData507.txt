METHOD: Over the 3 years, more than 100 end-stage heart failure cases have been      treated with LVAD implantation in our center, including 6 patients with a LV      thrombus. Three were detected using preoperative transthoracic echocardiography.       Fifty percent of the patients had dilated cardiomyopathy and the remaining cases       had an ischemic etiology. Double inotropic support with dopamine and dobutamine      was used in all, with 3 drugs with the addition of adrenaline in 2 patients. In 4      cases we implanted the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (HeartWare, Inc.,      Miramar, Fla, United States) and in the remaining 2 patients, the Berlin Heart      EXCOR ventricular assist device (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) for      biventricular support. In 1 patient the apical ventriculotomy was extended to      remove an intertrabecular thrombosis and ventricular septal surface covered with       a dacron patch to minimize the thrombogenic potential. RESULTS: Two patients died      due to sepsis and multiorgan failure. None of the patients experienced a      neurological event, pump thrombosis, or pump malfunction. Two subjects underwent       re-explorations due to hemorrhage. Two candidates underwent successfull      transplantation without any evidence of thrombosis in the explanted heart or      device. CONCLUSION: We believe that patients with a LV thrombus and preserved      right ventricular function are good candidates for implantation of a LVAD after      removing the intracavitary thrombus.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
