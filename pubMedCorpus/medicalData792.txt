We hypothesised that changes in GRK isoforms may be associated      with clinical status in advanced HF, using the Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) scale. METHODS: We included      31 patients with advanced HF undergoing transplantation. According to INTERMACS      profiles, mRNA and protein levels of GRK isoforms in left ventricular (LV)      myocardium were analyzed and compared with nonfailing LV samples. RESULTS: In      failing LV myocardium, GRK2 and GRK5 (but not GRK3) protein was up-regulated      compared with control samples. Among HF patients, an increase in GRK2 and GRK5      mRNA and protein abundance was observed in beta-agonist-treated patients (vs      beta-blockers: P < .05) and in higher-risk INTERMACS status (profiles 2 and 3 vs       4 and 5: P < .05). A significant negative correlation of GRK2 expression with LV       stroke volume supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Increased GRK2 correlates      with clinical severity using the INTERMACS scale and LV stroke volume, supporting      it as a potential target in advanced HF. These changes are paralleled by GRK5      expression in the failing myocardium, suggesting a relevant role in human HF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
