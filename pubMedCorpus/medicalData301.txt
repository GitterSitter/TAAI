Several studies have demonstrated that a       ventricular assist device improves the quality of life and prognosis of the      patients with end-stage heart failure. A 75-yr-old man debilitated with New York       Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV due to severe left ventricular      systolic dysfunction received LVAD implantation as a destination therapy. The      patient was discharged with improved functional status (NYHA functional class II)      after appropriate cardiac rehabilitation and education about how to manage the      device and potential emergency situations. This is the first case of successful      continuous-flow LVAD implantation as a destination therapy in Korea.FAU - Lee, Ga YeonAU  - Lee GYAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center,      Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ; Cardiovascular      Imaging Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of      Medicine, Seoul, Korea.FAU - Park, Sung-JiAU  - Park SJAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center,      Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ; Cardiovascular      Imaging Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of      Medicine, Seoul, Korea.FAU - Kim, SujinAU  - Kim SAD  - Cardiovascular Imaging Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University      School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.FAU - Choi, NamgyungAU  - Choi NAD  - Cardiac and Vascular Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University      School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.FAU - Jeong, Dong SeopAU  - Jeong DSAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Samsung Medical Center,      Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ; Cardiac and Vascular       Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine,      Seoul, Korea.FAU - Jeon, Eun-SeokAU  - Jeon ESAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center,      Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ; Cardiac and Vascular       Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine,      Seoul, Korea.FAU - Lee, Young TakAU  - Lee YTAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Samsung Medical Center,      Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ; Cardiac and Vascular       Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine,      Seoul, Korea.LA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131226PL  - Korea (South)TA  - J Korean Med SciJT  - Journal of Korean medical scienceJID - 8703518SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - DyspneaMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prosthesis ImplantationMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Republic of KoreaMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*surgeryPMC - PMC3890465OID - NLM: PMC3890465OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart FailureOT  - Heart-Assist DeviceOT  - HeartMate IIOT  - Mechanical Circulatory SupportEDAT- 2014/01/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/02 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/17 06:00PHST- 2013/02/21 [received]PHST- 2013/07/04 [accepted]PHST- 2013/12/26 [epublish]AID - 10.3346/jkms.2014.29.1.137 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Korean Med Sci. 2014 Jan;29(1):137-40. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2014.29.1.137.
