Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)      represent an advance in the management of advanced CHF, but may pose ethical      challenges for SPC services providing care to this population.The patient      received an LVAD as 'bridge-to-heart-transplant,' but subsequently experienced      multiple cerebral haemorrhages, resulting in neurological deficits, and severe      functional impairment. The risk of further cerebral events precluded ongoing      anticoagulation, and she was transferred to an SPC inpatient unit for symptom      control and end-of-life care. Following discussion within the multi-disciplinary       team and with the patient's family, LVAD support was withdrawn, and the patient      died peacefully. This piece reviews the ethical considerations that informed      decision-making, in particular, autonomy, informed consent and futility. In      addition, the question of the nature of LVADs is debated and how the perceptions       of the patient, and others, of the device may influence decision-making around      withdrawal of treatment.FAU - McLean, SarahAU  - McLean SAD  - Palliative Care Service, St Francis Hospice, Dublin, Ireland.FAU - Dhonnchu, Tara NiAU  - Dhonnchu TNFAU - Mahon, NiallAU  - Mahon NFAU - McQuillan, ReginaAU  - McQuillan RFAU - Gordijn, BertAU  - Gordijn BFAU - Ryan, KarenAU  - Ryan KLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20130107TA  - BMJ Support Palliat CareJT  - BMJ supportive & palliative careJID - 101565123OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Clinical decisionsOT  - EthicsOT  - Heart failureOT  - HospiceOT  - PalliativeEDAT- 2013/01/07 00:00MHDA- 2013/01/07 00:00CRDT- 2014/03/20 06:00AID - bmjspcare-2012-000347 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bmjspcare-2012-000347 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2013 Jan 7. doi: 10.1136/bmjspcare-2012-000347.
