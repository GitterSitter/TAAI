Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have been      increasingly used as a bridge support to heart transplantation in children. We      aimed to examine the profiles of CRP in children receiving VAD support. METHODS:       Charts of 13 children receiving Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) from 2005 to 2009 were      reviewed. The data obtained prior to and during VAD support included: CRP, white       blood cells, inotropes and steroid use, VAD mode and duration of VAD support. Ten      patients received left VAD (LVAD) and 3 biventricular VAD (BiVAD). RESULTS: The      median duration of VAD support was 59 days (ranged 3-678 days). Pre-VAD CRP was      35 +/- 51 mg/l and increased to 109 +/- 59 mg/l on days 1-3 after the VAD      implantation (P = 0.01), then gradually decreased to 28 +/- 28 mg/l by 4 months      and normalized by 5 months (P < 0.0001). CRP was higher in BiVAD than in LVAD      patients throughout the study period (P = 0.003). CRP positively correlated with       the doses of the epinephrine and norepinephrine and the monocyte counts, and      negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count. The lymphocyte count was 2.5 +/-      0.4 x 10(9)/l prior to implantation, and decreased to 2.1 +/- 1.3 x 10(9)/l on      days 1-3 (P = 0.5) and then to 0.6 +/- 0.1 x 10(9)/l by 6 months (P = 0.08). It      tended to be lower in BiVAD patients (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: SIR exists in      children prior to VAD support. VAD implantation is associated with a significant       and prolonged increase in CRP and a decrease in lymphocyte count, indicating a      suppressed immune function, being more pronounced in BiVAD patients.FAU - Yu, XiaoyangAU  - Yu XAD  - Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Stollery Children's      Hospital, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.FAU - Larsen, BodilAU  - Larsen BFAU - Rutledge, JenniferAU  - Rutledge JFAU - West, LoriAU  - West LFAU - Ross, David BAU  - Ross DBFAU - Rebeyka, Ivan MAU  - Rebeyka IMFAU - Buchholz, HolgerAU  - Buchholz HFAU - Li, JiaAU  - Li JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120522PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399RN  - 9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - C-Reactive Protein/*metabolismMH  - Cardiopulmonary Bypass/*adverse effectsMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart VentriclesMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Infant, NewbornMH  - Lymphocyte CountMH  - MaleMH  - PrognosisMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*blood/etiologyPMC - PMC3422931OID - NLM: PMC3422931EDAT- 2012/05/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/24 06:00PHST- 2012/05/22 [aheadofprint]AID - ivs206 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivs206 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2012 Sep;15(3):426-31. doi:      10.1093/icvts/ivs206.
