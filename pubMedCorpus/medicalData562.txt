The premise is that such patients cannot tolerate      cardiopulmonary bypass and the extended surgery needed for implantable left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. We have adopted an alternative      strategy to implant long-term LVADs as the initial device therapy in such      patients. METHODS: Over a 3 year period, we used implantable LVADs (Jarvik 2000,       one; Ventrassist, one; Heartmate XVE, two; and Heartmate II, nine) in 13 patients      (11 men and two women; mean age 54 years) with postmyocardial infarction shock      without prior use of a short-term LVAD. The median time interval from myocardial       infarction to LVAD implantation was 3.5 days. Eight patients were on a      ventilator, two had unknown neurological status and four had suffered cardiac      arrest in the preceding 24 h. Two had prior coronary artery bypass graft. Nine      had received dual antiplatelet therapy postmyocardial infarction. The mean      laboratory value of creatinine was 1.5 mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 748 U/l,      international normalized ratio 1.5 and lactate 3.2 mmol/l. One procedure was      carried out off pump; for the others, the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 72      min. Right ventricular assist devices were used in two cases and were later      explanted. RESULTS: One patient died of progressive multiorgan failure. All      others survived to hospital discharge. There were no re-explorations for bleeding      or major infectious complications; two patients had perioperative stroke. The      median duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay and hospital       stay was 3, 9 and 18 days, respectively. At 1 year, of the 12 survivors, eight      have since had heart transplant, one patient underwent device explant, two      remained alive on support and one died 7 months post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data       challenge the notion that patients in refractory cardiogenic shock are too ill to      tolerate immediate placement of implantable LVADs. Despite the surgical      challenges, a one-stop implantable LVAD approach for cardiogenic shock is      feasible and may offer unique advantages over the bridge-to-bridge approach      because it avoids the incremental costs, hospitalization and morbidity associated      with repeated interventions.FAU - Pawale, AmitAU  - Pawale AAD  - Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10029, USA.FAU - Pinney, SeanAU  - Pinney SFAU - Ashley, KimberlyAU  - Ashley KFAU - Flynn, RachelAU  - Flynn RFAU - Milla, FedericoAU  - Milla FFAU - Anyanwu, Anelechi CAU  - Anyanwu ACLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130130PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Aug;44(2):217-8.
