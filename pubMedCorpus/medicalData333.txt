Muscle injury and subsequent activation of myogenic progenitor cells is      associated with oxidative stress. Cytoglobin is a hemoprotein expressed in      response to oxidative stress in a variety of tissues, including striated muscle.       In this study, we demonstrate that cytoglobin is up-regulated in activated      myogenic progenitor cells, where it localizes to the nucleus and contributes to      cell viability. siRNA-mediated depletion of cytoglobin from C2C12 myoblasts      increased levels of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death both at      baseline and in response to stress stimuli. Conversely, overexpression of      cytoglobin reduced reactive oxygen species levels, caspase activity, and cell      death. Mice in which cytoglobin was knocked out specifically in skeletal muscle      were generated to examine the role of cytoglobin in vivo. Myogenic progenitor      cells isolated from these mice were severely deficient in their ability to form      myotubes as compared with myogenic progenitor cells from wild-type littermates.      Consistent with this finding, the capacity for muscle regeneration was severely      impaired in mice deficient for skeletal-muscle cytoglobin. Collectively, these      data demonstrate that cytoglobin serves an important role in muscle repair and      regeneration.FAU - Singh, SarvjeetAU  - Singh SAD  - Departments of Internal Medicine, Molecular Biology, and Pathology, the Donald W.
