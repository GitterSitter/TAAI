The      purpose of this article was to describe the background and the design of a study       entitled "Profiling Biobehavioral Responses to Mechanical Support in Advanced      Heart Failure" (PREMISE). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PREMISE is a prospective      cohort study designed to (1) identify common and distinct trajectories of change       in physical and psychological symptom burden; (2) characterize common      trajectories of change in serum biomarkers of myocardial stress, systemic      inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction; and (3) quantify associations between       symptoms and biomarkers of pathogenesis in adults undergoing VAD implantation.      Latent growth mixture modeling, including parallel process and      cross-classification modeling, will be used to address the study aims and will      entail identifying trajectories, quantifying associations between trajectories      and both clinical and quality-of-life outcomes, and identifying predictors of      favorable symptom and biomarker responses to VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS:      Research findings from the PREMISE study will be used to enhance shared patient      and provider decision making and to shape a much-needed new breed of      interventions and clinical management strategies that are tailored to      differential symptom and pathogenic responses to VAD implantation.FAU - Lee, Christopher SAU  - Lee CSAD  - Christopher S.
