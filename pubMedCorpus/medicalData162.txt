It may be used either as a      bridge to cardiac transplantation or as a destination therapy. The health of a      75-year-old man with a medical history of systolic heart failure worsened.      Therefore, he was recommended to have implanted a LVAD (Thoratec Corp.) as a      destination therapy. After the surgery, he was enrolled in patient cardiac      rehabilitation for the improvement of dyspnea and exercise capacity. In results,       there is an improvement on his exercise capacity and quality of life. For the      first time in Korea, we reported a benefit of exercise therapy after being      implanted with a LVAD.FAU - Park, Won HahAU  - Park WHAD  - Divison of Sports Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,      Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.FAU - Seo, Yong GonAU  - Seo YGAD  - Divison of Sports Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,      Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.FAU - Sung, Ji DongAU  - Sung JDAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University       School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140626PL  - Korea (South)TA  - Ann Rehabil MedJT  - Annals of rehabilitation medicineJID - 101573065PMC - PMC4092182OID - NLM: PMC4092182OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Destination therapyOT  - Exercise therapyOT  - Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)EDAT- 2014/07/16 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/16 06:01CRDT- 2014/07/16 06:00PHST- 2013/03/04 [received]PHST- 2013/08/16 [accepted]PHST- 2014/06/26 [epublish]AID - 10.5535/arm.2014.38.3.396 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Rehabil Med. 2014 Jun;38(3):396-400. doi: 10.5535/arm.2014.38.3.396.
