One potential      complication of VAD therapy is the development of antibodies directed against      human leukocyte antigens (HLA). This phenomenon has not been well described with       the Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD, the most commonly used VAD in pediatric patients.      METHODS: The records of all pediatric patients undergoing VAD support using the      Berlin Heart device at our institution between April 2005 and August 2011 were      reviewed retrospectively. Demographic and clinical data regarding the VAD course       were collected. Assessment of anti-HLA antibodies was performed using Luminex,      and antibodies were quantified using mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).      Assessment for anti-HLA antibodies was performed before VAD implantation and in      serial fashion after VAD implantation. Clinically significant anti-HLA antibodies      (sensitization) were defined by an MFI of more than 1000. RESULTS: Thirty-six      patients were supported with the Berlin Heart VAD; 13 met inclusion criteria. The      majority (85%) carried the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Evidence of      sensitization pre-VAD was found in 69%; new-onset sensitization (the development       of new antibodies on VAD) occurred in 69%. All patients survived to      transplantation. In two patients, the retrospective crossmatch was positive, but       only in one patient was the crossmatch positive for antibodies formed while on      VAD. CONCLUSIONS: Using Luminex and MFI quantification, anti-HLA antibodies are      common before VAD implantation in pediatric patients. While on VAD support, new      anti-HLA antibodies formed in a majority, but the immediate impact of these      antibodies appears to be limited.FAU - O'Connor, Matthew JAU  - O'Connor MJAD  - Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences/Arkansas      Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA. mjoconnor@uams.eduFAU - Harville, Terry OAU  - Harville TOFAU - Rhodes-Clark, BobbieAU  - Rhodes-Clark BFAU - Pye, Sherry EAU  - Pye SEFAU - Knecht, Kenneth RAU  - Knecht KRFAU - Imamura, MichiakiAU  - Imamura MFAU - Frazier, Elizabeth AAU  - Frazier EAFAU - Morrow, W RobertAU  - Morrow WRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - TransplantationJT  - TransplantationJID - 0132144RN  - 0 (HLA Antigens)RN  - 0 (Isoantibodies)SB  - IMMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/blood/immunology/*therapyMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - HLA Antigens/*immunologyMH  - Heart Failure/blood/immunology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Isoantibodies/*immunologyMH  - MaleMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2013/06/20 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/29 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/20 06:00AID - 10.1097/TP.0b013e3182925242 [doi]AID - 00007890-201306270-00018 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Transplantation. 2013 Jun 27;95(12):1542-7. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3182925242.
