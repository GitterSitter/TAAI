METHODS: Thirty of 657 patients with end-stage heart failure supported with      continuous-flow LVADs were assessed for device explantation. Each patient      underwent an individualized process of weaning focused on principles of      ventricular unloading, gradual reconditioning, and transition to medical therapy.      RESULTS: After varying reconditioning periods, 27 patients (16 men, 11 women;      age, 39 +/- 12 years) underwent LVAD explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman;      age, 22 +/- 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. The      duration of LVAD support was 533 +/- 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for the      explant cohort and 1,097 +/- 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explant      cohort. The LV end-diastolic dimension, LV ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary       artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort were      significantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). Two late deaths occurred       after LVAD explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1      patient required resumption of LVAD support 2.7 years after device removal. The      remaining explant patients remain in New York Heart Association classes I to II      with medical management alone (mean survival post-explant, 1,172 +/- 948 days).      The 3 candidates who could not be weaned ultimately underwent transplantation.      CONCLUSIONS: The potential for recovery of native LV function after long-term      continuous-flow LVAD support should encourage a more aggressive approach to      ventricular reconditioning with the goal of device explantation and a return to      medical management, particularly in young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
