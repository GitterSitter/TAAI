Herein, we sought to understand the benefit of atrial rhythm control in the      setting of ventricular rate and regularity control induced by atrioventricular      node (AVN) ablation. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with heart failure, persistent      AF, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <35%, and left bundle branch block      underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) + AVN ablation, and were      randomized to one of the following groups: (1) Atrial Rhythm Control (ARC); (2)      AF. Patients were subsequently followed for up to 1 year. RESULTS: Similar      numbers of patients in each group were lost to follow-up or have withdrawn (ARC      two; AF three). Rhythm control in four patients in the ARC group was inadequate.       Among the remaining patients, the incidence of death (ARC=1, AF=2) or left      ventricular assist device +/- transplantation (ARC=2, AF=1) were similar. Among      the remaining patients (ARC 16, AF 19), at 1 year, there were no significant      differences in CRT response rate, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure survey      score, 6-minute hall walk distance, ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurrence, or LV      dimensions. A significantly higher hospital encounter rate among ARC patients was      attributable to efforts to maintain uniform atrial rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: In this      pilot study, no incremental benefit for ARC was apparent. A larger study will be       necessary to adequately examine these issues.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Schwartzman, DavidAU  - Schwartzman DAD  - Heart, Lung and Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh,      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.FAU - Housel, DebraAU  - Housel DFAU - Bazaz, RaveenAU  - Bazaz RFAU - Jain, SandeepAU  - Jain SFAU - Saba, SamirAU  - Saba SFAU - Gorcsan, John 3rdAU  - Gorcsan J 3rdFAU - Adelstein, EvanAU  - Adelstein ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20141127PL  - United StatesTA  - Pacing Clin ElectrophysiolJT  - Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACEJID - 7803944SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - ablationOT  - atrial fibrillationOT  - heart failureOT  - pacingOT  - resynchronizationEDAT- 2014/11/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/29 06:00CRDT- 2014/11/29 06:00PHST- 2014/07/10 [received]PHST- 2014/09/14 [revised]PHST- 2014/10/19 [accepted]PHST- 2014/11/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/pace.12535 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pacing Clin Electrophysiol. 2015 Feb;38(2):275-81. doi: 10.1111/pace.12535.
