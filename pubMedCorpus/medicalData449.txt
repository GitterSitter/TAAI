The objective of this study      was to compare the HVAD device to the HeartMate II (HMII) axial flow device. Very      few studies have compared clinical outcomes between newer generation VADs.      METHODS: All perioperative and follow-up data on LVAD recipients were collected      prospectively in our institutional database. Between January 2006 and April 2012,      46 consecutive patients underwent implantation of either an HVAD (n=13) or a HMII      (n=33) device. Pre-implant demographics, perioperative and postoperative clinical      outcomes were reviewed between groups. RESULTS: Overall, the baseline      characteristics, demographics, co-morbidities and laboratory values were      comparable between the two groups. The majority of the patients were Interagency       Registry for Mechanical Assisted Circulatory Support 3-4 (92% in both groups) and      most of the patients were bridge to transplant (75% in HMII vs. 79% in HVAD).      Survival and the incidence of perioperative bleeding, renal dysfunction, liver      dysfunction, and infection were similar between the groups. However, HVAD devices      had a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (31% vs.      0% in HMII patients, p<0.01) and stroke (44% vs. 10% in HMII patients, at one      year p=0.04). Hemorrhagic strokes were more frequent in patients with HVAD (three      of the five episodes vs. one of the three episodes in HMII patients, p=0.06).      CONCLUSION: While device complications were comparable, patients with HVAD      experienced a significantly higher incidence of stroke and GI bleeding and      therefore refinement in patients' management may decrease incidence of these      complications.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Lalonde, Spencer DAU  - Lalonde SDAD  - Heart Failure/Transplant Program, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, Toronto General      Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.FAU - Alba, Ana CAU  - Alba ACFAU - Rigobon, AlannaAU  - Rigobon AFAU - Ross, Heather JAU  - Ross HJFAU - Delgado, Diego HAU  - Delgado DHFAU - Billia, FilioAU  - Billia FFAU - McDonald, MichaelAU  - McDonald MFAU - Cusimano, Robert JAU  - Cusimano RJFAU - Yau, Terrence MAU  - Yau TMFAU - Rao, VivekAU  - Rao VLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130711PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/*etiologyMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/*etiologyMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Stroke/*epidemiology/*etiologyEDAT- 2013/07/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/24 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/13 06:00PHST- 2013/07/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/jocs.12158 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2013 Sep;28(5):604-10. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12158.
