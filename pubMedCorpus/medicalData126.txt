In this study, 187 outpatients with HF referred to the Duke      Medical Center for consideration of advanced HF therapies were retrospectively      evaluated. All patients had undergone right-sided cardiac catheterization and      cardiopulmonary exercise testing; the median cardiac index (CI) was 2.0 L/min/m2       (interquartile range 1.7 to 2.3), and the median peak oxygen consumption was 11.3      ml/kg/min (interquartile range 9.2 to 13.8). Despite aggressive medical therapy,       medical management had failed in 97 patients (52%) at 18 months, defined as left       ventricular assist device implantation, cardiac transplantation, or death. After       multivariate adjustment, factors associated with failure of optimal medical      management included percentage achieved of predicted peak oxygen consumption, low      CI (i.e., <2 L/min/m2), left ventricular size, and exercise time. Patients with      discordant findings on right-sided cardiac catheterization and cardiopulmonary      exercise testing were common, occurring in 88 patients (47%). The most common      profile was preserved CI but reduced functional capacity, and these patients      remained at high risk for requiring advanced therapies, whereas patients with      reduced CIs but preserved exercise capacity were uncommon. In conclusion, low CI       was independently associated with higher rates of death, transplantation, and      left ventricular assist device implantation in this study. Also, patients with      preserved CIs at rest but poor functional capacity, so-called cardiac      insufficiency, were commonly encountered and had poor outcomes with medical      management.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
