Adenosine       triphosphate (ATP) is required for normal cardiac contraction, and abnormalities       in creatine kinase (CK) energy metabolism, the primary myocardial energy reserve       reaction, have been observed in experimental and clinical HF. However, the      prognostic value of abnormalities in ATP production rates through CK in human HF       has not been investigated. Fifty-eight HF patients with nonischemic      cardiomyopathy underwent (3)(1)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to      quantify cardiac high-energy phosphates and the rate of ATP synthesis through CK       (CK flux) and were prospectively followed for a median of 4.7 years.      Multiple-event analysis (MEA) was performed for HF-related events including      all-cause and cardiac death, HF hospitalization, cardiac transplantation, and      ventricular-assist device placement. Among baseline demographic, clinical, and      metabolic parameters, MEA identified four independent predictors of HF events:      New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, left ventricular ejection fraction      (LVEF), African-American race, and CK flux. Reduced myocardial CK flux was a      significant predictor of HF outcomes, even after correction for NYHA class, LVEF,      and race. For each increase in CK flux of 1 mumol g(-)(1) s(-)(1), risk of      HF-related composite outcomes decreased by 32 to 39%. These findings suggest that      reduced CK flux may be a potential HF treatment target. Newer imaging strategies,      including noninvasive (3)(1)P MRS that detect altered ATP kinetics, could thus      complement risk stratification in HF and add value in conditions involving other       tissues with high energy demands, including skeletal muscle and brain.FAU - Bottomley, Paul AAU  - Bottomley PAAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School      of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.FAU - Panjrath, Gurusher SAU  - Panjrath GSFAU - Lai, ShenghanAU  - Lai SFAU - Hirsch, Glenn AAU  - Hirsch GAFAU - Wu, KatherineAU  - Wu KFAU - Najjar, Samer SAU  - Najjar SSFAU - Steinberg, AngelaAU  - Steinberg AFAU - Gerstenblith, GaryAU  - Gerstenblith GFAU - Weiss, Robert GAU  - Weiss RGLA  - engGR  - R01 HL056882/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL061912/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01-HL056882/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01-HL61912/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Sci Transl MedJT  - Science translational medicineJID - 101505086RN  - 8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)RN  - EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)SB  - IMCIN - Circ Res. 2014 Apr 11;114(8):1228-30.
