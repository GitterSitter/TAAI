While using IABP in cardiac surgery is well established, there are      few studies on the utility of IABP support in high-risk cardiac patients      undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Major non-cardiac surgeries are associated with      high rates of cardiac complications in patients with advanced coronary disease.      Recent case studies have reported favorable outcomes with the use of IABP support      in non-cardiac surgery in patients with severe cardiac compromise. Using IABP may      reduce cardiac complications by providing hemodynamic stability. Here, we present      five cases of IABP use in high-risk cardiac patients undergoing resection and      anastomosis of the trachea. IABP was inserted prior to induction of anesthesia in      four of the cases, while IABP insertion was withheld in one case. In the four      cases where IABP support was utilized, the IABP was removed between 6-48 hours      postoperatively with no complications. The patient who did not undergo IABP      insertion died on the 8th postoperative day due to uncontrollable pulmonary edema      and progressive myocardial infarction. We also review the literature and discuss       the role of IABP use in non-cardiac surgery.FAU - Ahmadi, Zargham HosseinAU  - Ahmadi ZHAD  - Lung Transplantation Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis      and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,      Tehran, Iran.FAU - Rahnemai-Azar, Amir AliAU  - Rahnemai-Azar AAAD  - Department of Surgery, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami,      U.S.A.FAU - Shadmehr, Mohammad BehgamAU  - Shadmehr MBAD  - Tracheal Diseases Research Center, NRITLD, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical       Sciences, Tehran, Iran.FAU - Parsa, TaherehAU  - Parsa TAD  - Telemedicine Research Center, NRITLD, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical      Sciences, Tehran, Iran.FAU - Behzadnia, NedaAU  - Behzadnia NAD  - Lung Transplantation Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis      and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,      Tehran, Iran.FAU - Aval, Zahra AnsariAU  - Aval ZAAD  - Pediatric Respiratory Diseases Research Center, NRITLD, Shahid Beheshti      University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.FAU - Mokri, BaharehAU  - Mokri BAD  - Clinical Tuberculosis and Epidemiology Research Center, NRITLD, Shahid Beheshti      University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.FAU - Gholamhoseini, HamidehAU  - Gholamhoseini HAD  - Lung Transplantation Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis      and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,      Tehran, Iran.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - IranTA  - TanaffosJT  - TanaffosJID - 101308232PMC - PMC4153278OID - NLM: PMC4153278OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart FailureOT  - Intra-Aortic Balloon PumpOT  - Resection and Anastomosis of TracheaEDAT- 2014/09/06 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/06 06:01CRDT- 2014/09/06 06:00PHST- 2013/11/10 [received]PHST- 2014/01/15 [accepted]PST - ppublishSO  - Tanaffos. 2014;13(1):48-51.
