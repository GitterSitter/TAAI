Because the majority of MCS devices are      implanted after prior cardiac operations, special precautions are necessary at      the time of implant. MCS in single ventricle patients usually requires      ventricular and aortic cannulation, with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt for      pulmonary blood flow. Limited outcomes data is available, with less than 15% of      pediatric MCS patients having congenital heart disease. The Berlin EXCOR is the      only durable device currently available for infants. Neurologic complications are      the major cause of mortality, and survival during support is poor for infants <5       kg. Patients post-Fontan with acute cardiac failure and/or respiratory failure      are at high risk for death before transplant and should be considered for MCS      therapy. Several emerging miniature continuous flow devices will soon broaden the      landscape of available pediatric devices.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
