In selected patients, these improvements are      sufficient to allow ultimate device explantation without requiring      transplantation; this represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of      heart failure. Like heart failure itself, LVADs influence multiple biological      systems. The transverse tubules are a system of membrane invaginations in      ventricular cardiomyocytes which allow rapid propagation of the action potential       throughout the cell. Through their dense concentration of L-type Ca2+ channels in      close proximity with intracellular Ryanodine receptors, the t-tubules enable      synchronous Ca2+ release throughout the cell. The t-tubules' structure appears to      be specifically regulated by mechanical load, such that either the overload of      heart failure (or the spontaneously hypertensive rat model (Song et al., 2006))      or the profound unloading in a chronically unloaded heart result in impaired      t-tubule structure, with ineffective Ca2+ release. While there are multiple      molecular pathways which underpin t-tubule regulation, Tcap appears to be      important in regulating the effect of altered loading on the t-tubule system.
