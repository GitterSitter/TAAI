Compared to the first generation pulsatile-flow left ventricular      assist devices (PFVADs), CFVADs have demonstrated improved reliability and      durability. However, CFVADs have also been associated with certain complications       thought to be linked with decreased arterial pulsatility. Previous studies      comparing CFVADs and PFVADs have presented conflicting results. It is important      to understand the outcome differences between CFVAD and PFVAD in order to further      advance the current VAD technology. METHODS: In this review, we compared the      outcomes of CFVADs and PFVADs and examined the need for arterial pulsatility for       the future generation of mechanical circulatory support. RESULTS: CVADs offer      advantages of smaller size, increased reliability and durability, and subsequent       improvements in survival. However, with the increasing duration of long-term      support, it appears that CFVADs may have specific complications and a lower rate       of left ventricular recovery associated with diminished pulsatility, increased      pressure gradients on the aortic valve and decreased compliance in smaller      arterial vessels. PFVAD support or pulsatility control algorithms in CFVADs could      be beneficial and potentially necessary for long term support. CONCLUSIONS: Given      the relative advantages and disadvantages of CFVADs and PFVADs, the ultimate      solution may lie in incorporating pulsatility into current and emerging CFVADs      whilst retaining their existing benefits. Future studies examining physiologic      responses, end-organ function and LV remodeling at varying degrees of pulsatility      and device support levels are needed.FAU - Cheng, AllenAU  - Cheng AAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.FAU - Williamitis, Christine AAU  - Williamitis CAAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.FAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ChinaTA  - Ann Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101605877PMC - PMC4250555OID - NLM: PMC4250555OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Continuous flow (CF)OT  - left ventricular assist device (LVAD)OT  - myocardial recoveryOT  - pulsatile flow (PF)OT  - pulsatilityEDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:01CRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00PHST- 2014/06/27 [received]PHST- 2014/08/23 [accepted]AID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24 [doi]AID - acs-03-06-573 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Nov;3(6):573-81. doi:      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24.
