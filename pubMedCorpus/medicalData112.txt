Despite the clinical importance and significant cost of short-term      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, the state of their present use has       not been analyzed on a national scale. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was       to characterize the demographics, treatment practices, survival rates, and cost      of short-term MCS. METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed all      adult patients receiving short-term MCS in the United States from 2004 to 2011 by      using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization      Project. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, use of percutaneous devices for short-term      MCS increased by 1,511% compared with a 101% increase in nonpercutaneous devices.      Mortality rates declined over this period (p for trend = 0.027) from 41.1% in      2004 to 2007 to 33.4% in 2008 to 2011. A similar trend was observed for the      subset of patients with cardiogenic shock, decreasing from 51.6% to 43.1% (p for       trend = 0.012). Hospital costs also declined over this period (p for trend =      0.011). Multivariable analysis revealed balloon pumps (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; 95%      confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 2.52), coagulopathy (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.88 to       2.94), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR: 3.50; 95% CI: 2.20 to 5.57) before       short-term MCS were among the most significant predictors of mortality.      CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-term MCS in the United States has increased rapidly,      whereas rates of in-hospital mortality have decreased. These changes have taken      place in the context of declining hospital costs associated with short-term MCS.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
