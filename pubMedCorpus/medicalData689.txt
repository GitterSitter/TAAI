METHODS: Thirty patients      admitted to an ICU for PAC guided HF therapy were enrolled; concentrations of      soluble ST2 (sST2), highly sensitive troponin I, an experimental ultrasensitive      troponin I, amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, cystatin C, and      myeloperoxidase were measured over the first 48 hours. Outcomes included response      of filling pressures and hemodynamics to tailored therapy and 90-day event-free      survival (death, left ventricular assist device implantation, transplant).      RESULTS: Of the biomarkers evaluated, only sST2 concentrations were higher in      those who failed to achieve goals for central venous pressure ((CVP), 225.3      versus 104.6 ng/mL; P = 0.003) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ((PCWP),      181.7 versus 88.2 ng/mL; P = 0.05). Only sST2 concentrations were associated with      adverse events (186.7 versus 92.2 ng/mL; P = 0.01). In age-adjusted Cox      proportional hazards analysis, an elevated sST2 during the first 48 hours      following ICU admission independently predicted 90-day outcomes (Hazard Ratio =      5.53; P = 0.03) superior to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score for this      application; in Kaplan-Meier analysis the risk associated with elevated sST2      concentrations was present early and sustained through the duration of follow-up       (log rank P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing HF therapy guided by      invasive monitoring, sST2 concentrations were associated with impending failure      to reduce filling pressures and predicted impending events. Elevated sST2 values       early in the ICU course theoretically could assist therapeutic decision-making in      advanced stage HF patients.
