Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and third      generation LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimate      comparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flow      LVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A      semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHS costs data and patient      data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database (BTDB). Quality-adjusted      life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY were calculated for patients      receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotrope supported medical      management. LVADs cost pound80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices and delivered      greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilistic incremental       cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95%CI:      pound31,802- pound94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates       were sensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of      receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the      device cost by 15% decreased the ICER to pound50,106 ($79,533)/QALY. CONCLUSIONS:      Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefits at higher      costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK threshold of      pound20,000 to pound30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now      begins to approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently      recommended by the British NHS. Cost-effectiveness estimates are hampered by the       lack of randomized trials.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..
