The clinical data of six      patients bridged to HTx with Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric device were analyzed      retrospectively. Information about graft function, CA results, and EMB findings      as well as appearance DSA was collected. Also, information about growth and      cognitive function was analyzed. These findings were compared with age-, gender-,      and diagnosis-matched HTx patients. During the median follow-up time of four and       half yr after HTx, the prognosis including graft function, number of rejection      episodes, and incidence of coronary artery vasculopathy, growth and cognitive      development did not differ between VAD-bridged HTx patients compared with control      patients. In both groups, one patient developed positive DSA titer after HTx. Our      single-center experience suggests that the prognosis of pediatric HTx patients      treated with VAD before transplantation is not inferior to that of other HTx      patients.CI  - (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Jahnukainen, TimoAU  - Jahnukainen TAD  - Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and      Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.      timo.jahnukainen@helsinki.fiFAU - Rautiainen, PaulaAU  - Rautiainen PFAU - Mattila, Ilkka PAU  - Mattila IPFAU - Puntila, JuhaAU  - Puntila JFAU - Haavisto, AnuAU  - Haavisto AFAU - Qvist, ErikAU  - Qvist EFAU - Pihkala, JaanaAU  - Pihkala JFAU - Perasaari, JuhaAU  - Perasaari JFAU - Merenmies, JussiAU  - Merenmies JFAU - Sairanen, HeikkiAU  - Sairanen HFAU - Jalanko, HannuAU  - Jalanko HFAU - Salminen, Jukka TAU  - Salminen JTLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20121128PL  - DenmarkTA  - Pediatr TransplantJT  - Pediatric transplantationJID - 9802574RN  - 0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - CognitionMH  - Coronary Artery Disease/pathologyMH  - FemaleMH  - FinlandMH  - Graft RejectionMH  - Heart Failure/*surgery/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic useMH  - InfantMH  - MaleMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - PrognosisMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/11/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/06 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/30 06:00PHST- 2012/09/24 [accepted]PHST- 2012/11/28 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/petr.12028 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Transplant. 2013 Feb;17(1):73-9. doi: 10.1111/petr.12028.
