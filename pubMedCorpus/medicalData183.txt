This study reviews the      results of the US trial with specific attention to hemolysis, thrombotic      complications, and pump failure. METHODS: The US SUSTAIN trial was a multicenter,      prospective, single-arm observational study in advanced heart failure patients      listed for transplantation. Follow-up was complete in 100% of the patients at 6      months. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were enrolled at 23 centers. Forty-six      patients (73%) reached the primary end points of survival to transplantation,      alive on the original device at 180 days and listed for transplantation, or      explant for recovery. Median duration of support was 267 days (range, 10 to 952      days) with a total support time of 46 patient-years. There was no clinical      hemolysis reported during the study. Mean lactate dehydrogenase values peaked at       day 4 and significantly decreased during support (435+/-236 U/L and 297+/-142 U/L      on day 3 and day 180, respectively). There were no cases of pump thrombosis      reported, and 3 cases of pump thrombus "in transit" (0.06 events/patient-year)      were observed. There were 6 (10%) cases of magnetic levitation system failure,      all secondary to cable wire fractures (0.12 events/patient-year). All patients      were hemodynamically stable with the backup hydrodynamic mode. Major adverse      events included gastrointestinal bleeding (0.52 events/patient-year), ischemic      and hemorrhagic strokes (0.17 events/patient-year and 0.09 events/patient-year,      respectively), and driveline infections (0.67 events/patient-year). CONCLUSIONS:       The DuraHeart demonstrated good hemocompatibility; however, the reliability of      full magnetic levitation systems should be a high priority in future pump      designs.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
