We aimed to summarize the      current evidence on outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.       METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007       to December 2013, supplemented with manual review. Three reviewers independently       assessed each study for saliency on patient-centered outcomes. Data were      summarized in tabular form. Overall study characteristics encouraged inclusion of      all indications (destination therapy and bridge to transplant) and prevented      meta-analysis. The electronic search identified 465 abstracts, of which 50 met      inclusion criteria; manual review added 2 articles in press. The articles      included 10 industry-funded trials and registries, 10 multicenter reports, and      the remainder single-center observational experiences. Estimated actuarial      survival after continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ranged from 56% to      87% at 1 year, 43% to 84% at 2 years, and 47% at 4 years. Improvements in      functional class and quality of life were reported, but missing data complicated       interpretation. Adverse events were experienced by the majority of patients, but       estimates for bleeding, stroke, infection, right heart failure, arrhythmias, and       rehospitalizations varied greatly. CONCLUSIONS: The totality of data for      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices show consistent improvements in      survival and quality of life counterbalanced by a range of common complications.       Although this summary should provide a practical resource for healthcare      provider-led discussions with patients, it highlights the critical need for      high-quality patient-centered data collected with standard definitions.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - McIlvennan, Colleen KAU  - McIlvennan CKAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center       for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division       of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,      L.A.A.). colleen.mcilvennan@ucdenver.edu.FAU - Magid, Kate HAU  - Magid KHAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center       for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division       of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,      L.A.A.).FAU - Ambardekar, Amrut VAU  - Ambardekar AVAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center       for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division       of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,      L.A.A.).FAU - Thompson, Jocelyn SAU  - Thompson JSAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center       for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division       of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,      L.A.A.).FAU - Matlock, Daniel DAU  - Matlock DDAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center       for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division       of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,      L.A.A.).FAU - Allen, Larry AAU  - Allen LAAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center       for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division       of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,      L.A.A.).LA  - engGR  - K23 HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20141007PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
