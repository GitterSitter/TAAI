We aimed to identify      factors associated with HLA antibodies during continuous flow (CF)-VAD support      and assess the effect on transplant probability and outcomes. METHODS: We      included 143 consecutive heart failure patients who received a CF-VAD as a      bridge-to-transplant at 3 institutions. Factors associated with post-VAD peak      panel reactive antibodies (PRA) among several measurements were identified using       multivariable linear regression. A parametric survival model was used to assess      transplant waiting time and probability, risk of rejection, and a composite      outcome of rejection, graft failure, and death. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients      (25%) were female; mean age was 47 +/- 13 years. Eighty-one patients (57%) had a       pre-VAD PRA of 0%, and 16 were highly sensitized (PRA > 80%). Age, female sex,      and pre-VAD PRA were independently associated with post-VAD PRA. A 10-year      increase in age was associated with a 5% decrease in post-VAD PRA (p = 0.03).      Post-VAD PRA was 19% higher in women vs men (p < 0.01). A 10%-increase in pre-VAD      PRA was associated with a 4.7% higher post-VAD PRA (p < 0.01). During a mean      follow-up of 12 +/- 11 months, 90 patients underwent cardiac transplantation. A      20% increase in post-VAD PRA was associated with 13% lower probability of      transplant (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.99). A high PRA      was not associated with adverse post-transplant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Younger      age, female sex, and pre-VAD PRA were independent predictors of elevated PRA      post-VAD. Higher PRA was significantly associated with lower transplant      probability but not increased rejection, graft failure, or death after      transplant.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
