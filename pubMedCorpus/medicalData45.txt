Experience with      ventricular assist device support for these patients as a bridge to heart      transplantation has been limited and often not resulted in successful hospital      discharge. We report the successful use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart,       The Woodlands, TX) ventricular assist device in bridging a child with Fontan      circulation and systolic dysfunction to heart transplantation and discharge home.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
