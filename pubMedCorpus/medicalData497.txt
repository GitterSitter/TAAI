This      project aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a bridge-to-transplantation      (BTT)-VAD approach relative to direct heart transplantation in      transplant-eligible patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was used to      evaluate survival benefits and costs for BTT-VAD versus nonbridged heart      transplant recipients. Three different scenarios were considered according to      severity of patients' baseline hemodynamic status (high, medium, and low risk).      Results are presented in terms of survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratio.       Sensitivity analyses were used to analyze uncertainty in model estimates. Over a       20-year time horizon, BTT-VAD therapy increased survival at an increased cost      relative to nonbridged heart transplant recipients: $100 841more in costs and      1.19 increased life years (LYs) in high-risk patients ($84 964/LY), $112 779 more      in costs and 1.14 more LYs ($99 039/LY) in medium-risk patients, and an      additional cost of $144 334 and incremental clinical benefit of 1.21 more LYs      ($119 574/LY) in low-risk patients. The sensitivity analysis estimated a 59%,      54%, and 43% chance of BTT-VAD therapy being cost-effective for high-, medium-,      and low-risk patients at a willingness-to-pay level of $100 000/LY. Subgroup      analyses indicated that risk of post-VAD and transplantation complications,      waiting time, renal dysfunction, and patient age substantially affected the      cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSIONS: BTT-VAD therapy is associated with      improved survival and increased costs. On the basis of commonly accepted      willingness-to-pay thresholds, BTT-VAD therapy is likely to be cost-effective      relative to nonbridged heart transplantation in specific circumstances.FAU - Alba, Ana CAU  - Alba ACAD  - Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada. carolina.alba@uhn.caFAU - Alba, Luis FAU  - Alba LFFAU - Delgado, Diego HAU  - Delgado DHFAU - Rao, VivekAU  - Rao VFAU - Ross, Heather JAU  - Ross HJFAU - Goeree, RonAU  - Goeree RLA  - engGR  - Canadian Institutes of Health Research/CanadaPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130522PL  - United StatesTA  - CirculationJT  - CirculationJID - 0147763SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Circulation. 2013 Jun 18;127(24):2375-7.
