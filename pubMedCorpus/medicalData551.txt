However, the fixed pump speed of these devices may      lack response to activity and oxygen demand, thereby limiting exercise tolerance.      The objective of this observational study was to describe exercise capacity as      measured by peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) that may be expected during      support with a cfLVAD. Peak VO2 was measured in patients (mean age: 58.3 +/- 11.7      years; 66.7% ischemic and 33.3% DT) before cfLVAD support (11.2 +/- 3.0      ml/kg/min, n = 25), between 3 and 6 months (12.7 +/- 3.5 ml/kg/min, n = 31), at 1      year (10.7 +/- 2.6 ml/kg/min, n = 16), and longer than 1 year (11.2 +/- 1.7      ml/kg/min, n = 10). There was no statistical improvement in peak VO2 at any time       point after implantation. In addition, ventilatory efficiency remained poor after      LVAD implantation at all time points. Although studies have shown an increase in       survival and patient's quality of life, exercise capacity as measured by      cardiopulmonary exercise testing remains low during cfLVAD support.FAU - Leibner, Evan SAU  - Leibner ESAD  - Heart and Vascular Institute, Milton S.
