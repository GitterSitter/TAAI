This study reviews the      population-based provincial experience in British Columbia. METHODS: We performed      a retrospective review of the prospectively maintained database. Impella devices       were inserted for acute cardiogenic shock refractory to maximal therapy, as a      bridge to decision or to long-term mechanical support. RESULTS: Between August      2007 and September 2009, 35 patients received 37 Impella devices (Impella LP 2,5,      n=2; Impella LP 5,0, n=29; and Impella RD 5.0, n=6) (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA).      Devices were inserted in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy (n=13), acute      myocardial infarction (n=6), postcardiotomy shock (n=6), and other etiologies      (n=12). Mean age was 53.0+/-13.7 years. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction      was 19+/-9% at the time of insertion. Nineteen patients required aggressive      resuscitation, all patients were on inotropic support, 97% of patients were      intubated, and 46% of patients received mechanical circulatory support prior to      insertion of the Impella devices. Mean duration of support was 3.7+/-3.0 days. In      all, 49% were successfully weaned, and 22% were transferred to long-term      mechanical support. Four patients have subsequently undergone successful cardiac       transplantation. The 30-day mortality was 40%, and 6-month mortality was 49%.      Complications included gastrointestinal bleeding (n=1), hemoptysis (n=1), and      thrombocytopenia (n=4). There were no cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.      CONCLUSION: Temporary support with Impella microaxial ventricular assist devices       adds a valuable therapeutic option in selected patients with acute decompensated       heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
