Our aim was to determine risk factors associated with      the outcomes of delisting, transplant, or death while waiting. METHODS: In this      single-center, retrospective study of patients listed for heart transplants,      competing risk analysis was used to model survival from listing to 4 competing      outcomes (transplant, death, delisting for clinical deterioration, delisting for       clinical improvement or surgical intervention). RESULTS: There were 308 listing      episodes in 280 patients. In competing risk analysis, 11% remained listed at 6      months (transplant 62%, dead 13%, delisted worse 6%, delisted improved 8%).      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices were      associated both with higher probability of transplant (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; P       < .001) and delisting for clinical deterioration (HR, 2.7; P = .06). Younger age       at listing and complex congenital heart disease were shared risk factors for      mortality (HR, 1.07; P = .05; HR, 2.9; P = .003) and delisting because of      clinical deterioration (HR, 1.17; P = .01; HR, 2.8; P = .02). Younger age at      listing and fetal listing were associated with delisting for clinical improvement      or surgical intervention (HR, 1.13; P = .01; HR, 2.9; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS:      Overall survival to transplant depends on risk factors including age at listing,       cardiac diagnosis, and mechanical circulatory support. Knowledge of risk factors       for death and delisting for clinical deterioration or improvement can assist      patient selection and timing of transplant listing.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
