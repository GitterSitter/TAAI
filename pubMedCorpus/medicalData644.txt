METHODS: We describe three patients who had infections related to a fistula      between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the LVAD pocket and who subsequently       underwent successful heart transplantation without developing sepsis. In no case       did the LVAD-related infection adversely affect the outcome of transplantation.      CONCLUSIONS: For detecting the fistulas, full upper-GI endoscopy and colonoscopy       were superior to other types of diagnostic imaging studies.CI  - (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Akay, Mehmet HAU  - Akay MHAD  - Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's Episcopal      Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA.FAU - Gregoric, IgorAU  - Gregoric IFAU - Cohn, William EAU  - Cohn WEFAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Gastric Fistula/*complications/physiopathologyMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/surgeryMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Intestinal Fistula/*complications/physiopathologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/*etiology/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Sampling StudiesMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/09/18 06:00MHDA- 2013/03/08 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/18 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01517.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2012 Sep;27(5):643-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01517.x.
