BACKGROUND: In CF-LVAD patients, the dynamic interaction of       device speed, left and right ventricular decompression, and valve function can be      assessed during an echocardiography-monitored speed ramp test. METHODS: We      devised a unique ramp test protocol to be routinely used at the time of discharge      for speed optimization and/or if device malfunction was suspected. The patient's       left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, frequency of aortic valve opening,      valvular insufficiency, blood pressure, and CF-LVAD parameters were recorded in      increments of 400 rpm from 8,000 rpm to 12,000 rpm. The results of the speed      designations were plotted, and linear function slopes for left ventricular      end-diastolic dimension, pulsatility index, and power were calculated. RESULTS:      Fifty-two ramp tests for 39 patients were prospectively collected and analyzed.      Twenty-eight ramp tests were performed for speed optimization, and speed was      changed in 17 (61%) with a mean absolute value adjustment of 424 +/- 211 rpm.      Seventeen patients had ramp tests performed for suspected device thrombosis, and       10 tests were suspicious for device thrombosis; these patients were then treated       with intensified anticoagulation and/or device exchange/emergent transplantation.      Device thrombosis was confirmed in 8 of 10 cases at the time of emergent device      exchange or transplantation. All patients with device thrombosis, but none of the      remaining patients had a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension slope >-0.16.      CONCLUSIONS: Ramp tests facilitate optimal speed changes and device malfunction      detection and may be used to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions and      need for surgical intervention in CF-LVAD patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
