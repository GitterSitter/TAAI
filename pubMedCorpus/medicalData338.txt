Pump thrombosis may initially be suspected in      the setting of clinical and biochemical evidence for intravascular hemolysis,      putatively related to shear stress on red blood cells propelled through a      partially occluded pump. Limited data exist to guide management in these      patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a series of 8 LVAD patients who      presented with intravascular hemolysis secondary to pump thrombosis who were      treated with intraventricular thrombolytic therapy. In 3 patients, thrombolytic      therapy led to complete and lasting resolution of hemolysis, suggesting      successful dissolution of pump thrombus. In the remaining 5 patients,      thrombolytic therapy ultimately failed to halt or reverse pump thrombosis and      hemolysis: 1 patient required emergent pump exchange, 2 patients progressed to      cardiogenic shock and died, 1 patient suffered a debilitating stroke after which       care was withdrawn, and 1 patient underwent cardiac transplantation. CONCLUSIONS:      In the setting of LVAD thrombosis, thrombolytic therapy is an alternate treatment      strategy in a subset of patients. Candidacy for this alternate procedure must      carefully weigh the risks of complications, including hemorrhage and      thromboembolism.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
