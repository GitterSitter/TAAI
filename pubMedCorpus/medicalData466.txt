The pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocols trials have      enrolled patients with advanced heart failure in a bridge-to-transplant      indication. METHODS: The primary outcome, success, was defined as survival on the      originally implanted device, transplant, or explant for ventricular recovery at      180 days. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of survival, functional and      quality of life outcomes, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 332 patients in      the pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocols trial have      completed their 180-day primary end-point assessment. Survival in patients      receiving the HeartWare pump was 91% at 180 days and 84% at 360 days. Quality of       life scores improved significantly, and adverse event rates remain low.      CONCLUSIONS: The use of the HeartWare pump as a bridge to transplant continues to      demonstrate a high 180-day survival rate despite a low rate of transplant.      Adverse event rates are similar or better than those observed in historical      bridge-to-transplant trials, despite longer exposure times due to longer survival      and lower transplant rates.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
