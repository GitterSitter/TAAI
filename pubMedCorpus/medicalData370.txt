The MVAD Pump (HeartWare Inc,       Framingham, MA) is a small, axial VAD that uses magnetic and hydrodynamic      impeller technology and incorporates wide helical flow channels to minimize shear      stress. In this study, we implanted the MVAD Pump in an ovine model to evaluate      device hemocomaptiblity, biocompatibility, performance, and safety. METHODS: The       MVAD Pump was implanted in an ovine model (n = 9) for 90 days. The pump was      implanted through a thoracotomy and secured to the LV apex with a gimbaled sewing      ring, which allowed for intraoperative adjustment of the insertion depth and      angle of the inflow cannula. Serum analytes and coagulation parameters were      analyzed at specific intervals throughout the study period. Pump flow, speed, and      power were recorded daily to monitor device performance. Sheep were electively      euthanized at 90 days for pathologic and histologic analysis. RESULTS: In this      study, results demonstrated the safety, reliability, hemocompatability, and      biocompatibility of the MVAD Pump. Nine animals were implanted for 90 +/- 5 days.      No complications occurred during surgical implantation. Seven of the 9 animals      survived until elective sacrifice. Each sheep that survived to the scheduled      explant appeared physically normal, with no signs of cardiovascular or other      organ compromise. The 2 sheep that were euthanized early showed no evidence of      device-related issues. CONCLUSIONS: The MVAD Pump was successfully implanted      through a thoracotomy and demonstrated excellent hemodynamic support with no      device malfunctions throughout the study period.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - McGee, Edwin JrAU  - McGee E JrAD  - Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Northwestern      University School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.
