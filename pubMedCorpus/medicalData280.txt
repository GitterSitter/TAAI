The IABP      confers a wide variety of vaguely understood effects on cardiac physiology and      mechano-energetics. Although, the recommendations for its use are multiple, most       are not substantially evidence-based. Indicatively, the results of recently      performed prospective studies have put IABP's utility in the setting of      post-infarction cardiogenic shock into question. However, the particular issue      remains open to further research. IABP support in high-risk patients undergoing      PCI is associated with favorable long-term clinical outcome. In cardiac surgery,       the use of IABP in cases of peri-operative low-output syndrome, refractory angina      or ischemia-related mechanical complications is a usual, but poorly justified      strategy. Anecdotal cases of treatment of incessant ventricular arrhythmias,      reversal of right ventricular dysfunction and partial myocardial recovery have      also been reported with its use. Converging data demonstrate the potential of      safe long-term IABP support as a bridge to decision making or a bridge to      transplantation modality in patients with heart failure. The feasibility of IABP       insertion via other than the femoral artery sites enhances this potential.      Despite the fact that several other counterpulsation devices have been developed       and tested overtime none has managed to substitute the IABP, which continues to      be most frequently used mechanical assist device.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
