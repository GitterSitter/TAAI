Diabetes is prevalent      in advanced heart failure patients. In this study, we sought to investigate the      effects of mechanical circulatory support on diabetic parameters with LVAD      implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, data on 244 LVAD       recipients between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Patients without history of      diabetes, death within the first 3 months after LVAD implantation, heart      transplantation after LVAD, or LVAD explantation were excluded from the study.      Baseline demographic, laboratory, and echocardiographic information prior to LVAD      placement and 6-month follow-up were obtained. Laboratory values indicative of      diabetic control were found to improve significantly at 6 months post-LVAD      implantation (glycated haemoglobin, 7.2 vs. 6.1%, P < 0.0001; serum fasting      glucose, 141 vs. 122 mg/dL, P = 0.003; mean daily insulin dose, 30 vs. 24 IU/day,      P = 0.02). Additionally, the use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was      successfully discontinued in six patients at 6 months post-LVAD implantation.      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term LVAD therapy is associated with improvement in diabetic      control which is probabvly due to improvements in cardiac output and      normalization of biochemical derangements resulting from diabetes.CI  - (c) 2014 The Authors.
