The RV exhibits a greater capacity for rapid recovery than the left ventricle,      making devices designed specifically for temporary RV MCS attractive. We report      our experience with the Impella Right Direct (RD) and Right Peripheral (RP)      temporary ventricular assist devices (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) in patients with      ARVF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the clinical      outcomes of consecutive patients supported with the Impella RD or RP at 2      institutions during a 6-year period. RESULTS: During the study period, 18      patients (67% men; mean age 57 +/- 10 years) received MCS, 15 with the Impella RD      and 3 with the Impella RP. Before RV MCS, all patients required intravenous      inotropes, 7 (39%) required inhaled nitric oxide, 7 (39%) required intra-aortic      balloon counterpulsation, and 2 (11%) had experienced a cardiac arrest. Device      implantation resulted in an improvement in cardiac index (2.1 +/- 0.1      liters/min/m(2) pre-implant vs 2.6 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m(2) post-implant, p =      0.04) and reduced central venous pressure (22 +/- 5 vs 15 +/- 4 mm Hg, p < 0.01).      Fourteen (78%) patients recovered sufficient RV function to facilitate device      explanation after 7 days (range, 2-19 days) of support, and 4 (22%) patients died      on support after 6 days (range 1-11 days). Survival to 30 days was 72% and to 1      year was 50%. At 1-year follow-up, the mean New York Heart Association functional      classification was 1.3 +/- 0.5, and only 1 patient demonstrated severe RV      dysfunction on echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with ARVF rapidly      recover sufficient RV function to facilitate device explantation, highlighting an      expanding role for minimally invasive temporary RV assist devices optimized for      the treatment of recoverable ARVF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
