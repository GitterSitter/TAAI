However,      clinical presentation and outcome of CIED infection in the setting of LVAD has      not been previously described. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 247 patients       who underwent LVAD implantation at Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Arizona,      and Florida, from January 2005 to December 2011. Demographic and clinical data of      patients who met criteria for CIED infection were extracted. RESULTS: Of 247      patients with LVADs, 215 (87%) had CIED at the time of LVAD implantation and six       (2.8%) subsequently developed CIED infections. Three patients developed CIED      lead-related endocarditis and the other three had pocket infection. All three      instances of CIED pocket infection were preceded by device generator exchange,      whereas all three patients with CIED lead-related endocarditis had prior      LVAD-related infections. Causative pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginos (1),       coagulase-negative staphylococci (2), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus      (1), a gram-positive bacillus (1), and culture negative (2). All patients      underwent complete CIED removal along with antimicrobial therapy. The three      patients with CIED lead-related endocarditis and prior LVAD infections received      chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy, and one patient had LVAD exchange. All      but one remained alive at the last follow-up with a median duration of 15 months       (7-46 months) from the time of CIED infection. CONCLUSION: Patients who are      receiving LVAD therapy and develop CIED infection should be managed with complete      CIED removal. Chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy is warranted in cases that      have concomitant LVAD infection.CI  - (c)2013, The Authors.
