We aimed to compare the outcomes      after the implementation of three heart replacement strategies in this high-risk       population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients      between the ages of 65 and 72 receiving a continuous-flow LVAD as bridge to      transplantation or destination therapy or isolated HTx at our center between 2005      and 2012. The patients were stratified according to treatment strategy into three      groups: group D (destination LVAD, n = 23), group B (bridge to transplantation      LVAD, n = 43), and group H (HTx alone, n = 47). The primary outcomes of interest       were survival to discharge and 2-year overall survival. RESULTS: The patients in       group D were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of ischemic      cardiomyopathy, and had a higher pulmonary vascular resistance than did patients       in groups B or H. There were no significant differences between groups in      survival to discharge (87% D vs 83.7% B vs 87.2% H, p = 0.88) or 2-year overall      survival (75.7% D vs 68.7% B vs 80.9% H, log-rank p = 0.47). The incidence rates       of readmission were 1.1 events/patient.year in group D and 0.5      events/patient.year in group H. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference       in perioperative, short-term, and medium-term survival between the treatment      groups. However, the LVAD patients had a higher incidence of readmission. Larger       trials are needed to refine differences in long-term survival, quality of life,      and resource utilization for elderly patients requiring heart replacement      therapy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
