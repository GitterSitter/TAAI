We evaluated the feasibility of low-molecular-weight heparin      (LMWH) for initiation of anti-coagulation and transitioning to oral      anti-coagulation after LVAD implantation. METHODS: This single-center study      included 78 consecutive patients who underwent either Thoratec HeartMate II LVAD       (n = 27) or HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD, n = 51) implantation. The       LMWHs enoxaparin (n = 50) and dalteparin (n = 28) were used. LMWH was started      within 24 hours post-operatively in 79.5% of patients. No anti-coagulation was      given before starting LMWH therapy. LMWH activity was monitored by determination       of anti-factor Xa levels in plasma. RESULTS: The majority of patients (80.7%) had      peak anti-Xa activity within the defined range of efficacy of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/ml by      the second day of treatment. Mean effective peak anti-Xa activity was 0.28 +/-      0.06 IU/ml. Mean duration of anti-coagulation with LMWH was 25.8 +/- 18 days.      Ischemic strokes were observed in 3 patients (3.8%), with a total of 4 events.      Three events occurred while on LMWH, and 1 event occurred during follow-up on      oral anti-coagulation. There was 1 fatal stroke. No pump thrombus was observed.      Major bleeding was observed in 5 patients (6.4%), with a total of 6 events.      Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common complication (n = 3). There were no      fatal bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: LMWH in the setting of LVAD shows rapid and      constant biologic efficacy. Anti-coagulation with LMWH appears feasible after      LVAD implantation. These findings support further evaluation of LMWH as an      alternative to unfractionated heparin in this patient cohort.CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Sandner, Sigrid EAU  - Sandner SEAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.
