We hypothesized that LVAD explant-OHT is a more challenging      surgical procedure compared to OHT without LVAD explantation and that      institutional LVAD explant-OHT procedural volume would be associated with      post-transplant graft survival. We sought to assess the impact of institutional      volume of LVAD explant-OHT on post-transplant graft survival. METHODS: This is a       retrospective analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for      adult OHTs with long-term LVAD explantation. LVAD explant-OHT volume was      characterized on the basis of the center's year-specific total OHT volume      (OHTvol) and year-specific LVAD explant-OHT volume quartile (LVADvolQ). The      effect of LVADvolQ on graft survival (death or re-transplantation) was analyzed.       RESULTS: From 2004 to 2011, 2,681 patients underwent OHT with LVAD explantation      (740 with HeartMate XVE, 1,877 with HeartMate II and 64 with HeartWare devices).       LVAD explant-OHT at centers falling in the lowest LVADvolQ was associated with      reduced post-transplant graft survival (p = 0.022). After adjusting for      annualized OHTvol (HR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.993 to 1.003, p = 0.515 and pulsatile XVE      (HR = 0.842, 95% CI 0.688 to 1.032, p = 0.098), multivariate analysis confirmed a      significantly (approximately 37%) increased risk of post-transplant graft failure      among explant-OHT procedures occurring at centers in the lowest volume quartile      (HR = 1.371, 95% CI 1.030 to 1.825, p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: Graft survival is      decreased when performed at centers falling in the lowest quartile of LVAD      explant-OHT for a given year. This volume-survival relationship should be      considered in the context of limited donor organ availability and the rapidly      growing number of LVAD centers.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
