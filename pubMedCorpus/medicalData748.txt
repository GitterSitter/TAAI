However, data on risk factors for early death in BTT      patients are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the United Network for      Organ Sharing database of all patients bridged to OHT with a HeartMate II from      January 2005 to December 2010. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day      mortality. Additional postoperative outcomes were cerebrovascular accident and      need for renal replacement therapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival.      Preoperative variables associated with 90-day death on univariate analysis      (p<0.2) were included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.      RESULTS: A HeartMate II was used to bridge 1,312 patients (average age, 52+/-12      years) to OHT, most commonly for idiopathic cardiomyopathy (50.7%). During the      study, 171 patients (13.0%) died. The unadjusted 90-day survival was 92.3%. The      highest annual average center volume in this cohort, examining for BTT recipients      only, was 28 BTT procedures yearly. Postoperative cerebrovascular accident      occurred in 29 patients (2.2%), and 106 (8.3%) required renal replacement      therapy. Cox regression revealed age, glomerular filtration rate, African      American race, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, serum bilirubin, need for      mechanical ventilation, donor age, and prolonged ischemia time were associated      with 90-day death. Early survival was improved for patients who underwent OHT at       high-volume centers (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study examining risk factors for       early death in patients bridged to OHT using HeartMate II mechanical assistance      will aid in identifying patients best suited to benefit from this technology.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
