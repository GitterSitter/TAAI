Relief of congestion through      intravenous loop diuretics is a mainstay of therapy. In cases where diuretics are      not effective, ultrafiltration may be used to achieve euvolemia. Beta-blockers      should be continued or reduced in dose at admission but should not typically be      held. In patients with normotensive or hypertensive heart failure, afterload      reduction with vasodilators should be instituted at presentation. Choice of a      particular agent such as nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or nesiritide depends on      patient characteristics such as presence of ischemia, degree of congestion, and      renal function. Nitroprusside may be preferable in patients with congestion and      low cardiac output, but with caution in patients with significant hypotension.      Intravenous inotropes/inodilators, such as dobutamine and milrinone, should be      limited to hypotensive patients with evidence of poor tissue perfusion. Milrinone      may be preferable in patients who have significant pulmonary venous hypertension.      In patients who do not respond to initial medical therapy and who are candidates       for either cardiac transplantation or destination left ventricular assist device,      mechanical circulatory support should be considered early, prior to the      development of end-organ damage.FAU - Majure, David TAU  - Majure DTAD  - University of California, San Francisco, Box 0131, 505 Parnassus Ave., Room      U127a, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA, DMajure@medicine.ucsf.edu.FAU - Teerlink, John RAU  - Teerlink JRLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20111006TA  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc MedJT  - Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicineJID - 9815942EDAT- 2011/10/07 06:00MHDA- 2011/10/07 06:00CRDT- 2011/10/07 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11936-011-0149-2 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2011 Oct 6.
