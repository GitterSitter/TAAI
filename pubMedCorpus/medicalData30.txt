BACKGROUND: CF-LVADs have become      mainstream therapy for patients with advanced heart failure. Thromboembolic      events, device thrombosis, and bleeding continue to be a challenge with this      technology. Adequate anticoagulation is required to prevent these adverse events.      METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive patients implanted with a CF-LVAD was      conducted. Paired samples were considered concordant if aPTT values fell into      expected ranges for subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic anti-FXa      levels. Heparin dosing was on the basis of anti-Xa levels. RESULTS: A total of      340 paired values from 38 patients were evaluated. Anti-FXa and aPTT were      discordant in 253 samples (74.4%), with a high degree of variability in aPTT for       any given anti-FXa level (r(2) = 0.57). Results were discordant in 104 samples      (63.8%) from patients undergoing bridging therapy with warfarin and in 149      samples (84.2%) from patients with device obstruction and/or hemolysis (p <      0.001). The most common pattern of discordance was a supratherapeutic aPTT value       despite a therapeutic anti-FXa level (49.1% for bridging vs. 75.8% for device      obstruction and/or hemolysis; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of aPTT were      disproportionately prolonged relative to the corresponding anti-FXa levels in      CF-LVAD patients, particularly those with device obstruction. Hemolysis and      warfarin administration may falsely elevate aPTT, resulting in overestimation of       heparin concentration and under-anticoagulation. Use of aPTT and anti-FXa to      guide heparin therapy may lead to different estimates of heparin concentration in      the same patient.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
