We conducted a mixed-method study to investigate quality of       life, psychological symptoms, and emotional and cognitive reactions after LVAD      implant. Twenty-six patients admitted to cardiac rehabilitation were administered      quality of life questionnaires (Short Form 36 of the Medical Outcomes Study and      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire), the Hospital Anxiety and      Depression Scale, and the Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences inventory,      and underwent three in-depth unstructured interviews within 2 months after LVAD      implant. Quality of life assessment (Short Form 36) documented persistently low      physical scores whereas mental component scores almost achieved normative values.      Clinically relevant depression and anxiety were observed in 18 and 18% of      patients, respectively; avoidant coping scores correlated significantly with both      depression and anxiety (Pearson correlation coefficients 0.732, P < 0.001 and      0.764, P < 0.001, respectively). From qualitative interviews, factors that      impacted on LVAD acceptance included: device type, disease experience during      transplant waiting, nature of the assisted organ, quality of patient-doctor      communication, the opportunity of sharing the experience, and recipient's      psychological characteristics. Quality of life improves early after LVAD implant,      but emotional distress may remain high. A multidimensional approach that takes      into account patients' psychological characteristics should be pursued to enhance      LVAD acceptance.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Modica, MaddalenaAU  - Modica MAD  - Cardiac Rehabilitation S.
