In patients requiring a ventricular assist device (VAD), the       benefit from ICD therapy is not well established. The aim of this study was to      define the impact of ICD on outcomes in VAD-supported patients. METHODS AND      RESULTS: We reviewed data for consecutive adult HF patients receiving VAD as a      bridge to transplantation from 1996 to 2003. The primary outcome was survival to       transplantation. A total of 144 VADs were implanted [85 left ventricular (LVAD),       59 biventricular (BIVAD), mean age 50 +/- 12 years, 77% male, left ventricular      ejection fraction 18 +/- 9%, 54% ischemic]. Mean length of support was 119 days      (range 1-670); 103 patients (72%) survived to transplantation. Forty-five      patients had an ICD (33 LVAD, 12 BIVAD). More LVAD patients had an appropriate      ICD shock before implantation than after (16 vs 7; P = .02). There was a trend      toward higher shock frequency before LVAD implant than after (3.3 +/- 5.2 vs 1.1       +/- 3.8 shocks/y; P = .06). Mean time to first shock after VAD implant was 129      +/- 109 days. LVAD-supported patients with an ICD were significantly more likely       to survive to transplantation [1-y actuarial survival to transplantation: LVAD:      91% with ICD vs 57% without ICD (log-rank P = .01); BIVAD: 54% vs 47% (log-rank P      = NS)]. An ICD was associated with significantly increased survival in a      multivariate model controlling for confounding variables (odds ratio 2.54, 95%      confidence interval 1.04-6.21; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Shock frequency decreases      after VAD implantation, likely owing to ventricular unloading, but appropriate      ICD shocks still occur in 21% of patients. An ICD is associated with improved      survival in LVAD-supported HF patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
