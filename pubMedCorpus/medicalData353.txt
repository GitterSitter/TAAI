Some of these patients are      awaiting transplant but others will have a mechanical heart pump as their      ultimate treatment. The history of MCS devices is reviewed, along with the 4      trials that define the modern era of circulatory support. The practical aspects      of life with an MCS device are reviewed and common problems encountered with MCS       devices. Future trends including miniaturization and development of completely      contained MCS systems are reviewed.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
