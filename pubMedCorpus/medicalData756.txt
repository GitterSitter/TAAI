VADs decrease the symptoms of HF and improve quality of life by      replacing some of the work of a failing heart. They unload the ventricle to      provide improved cardiac output and end-organ perfusion, resulting in improvement      in cardiorenal syndromes and New York Heart Association functional class rating.       VADs are currently used asa bridge to heart transplantation, a bridge to recovery      of cardiac function, or as destination therapy. Complications of VAD include      bleeding, infections, arrhythmias, multiple organ failure, right ventricular      failure, and neurological dysfunction. Patients with VAD have unique      pharmacotherapeutic requirements in terms of anticoagulation, appropriate      antibiotic selection, and continuation of HF medications. Pharmacists in acute      care and community settings are well prepared to care for the patient with VAD.      These patients require thorough counseling and follow-up with regard to      prevention and treatment of infections, appropriate levels of anticoagulation,      and maintenance of fluid balance. A basic understanding of this unique therapy      can assist pharmacists in attending to the needs of patients with VAD.FAU - Von Ruden, Serena A SAU  - Von Ruden SAAD  - Franciscan Health System, St. Joseph Hospital, Tacoma, WA, USA.FAU - Murray, Margaret AAU  - Murray MAFAU - Grice, Jennifer LAU  - Grice JLFAU - Proebstle, Amy KAU  - Proebstle AKFAU - Kopacek, Karen JAU  - Kopacek KJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Pharm PractJT  - Journal of pharmacy practiceJID - 8900945SB  - IMMH  - Community Pharmacy Services/*standardsMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - PharmacistsMH  - *Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - Randomized Controlled Trials as TopicMH  - Ventricular Function/*physiologyEDAT- 2012/03/07 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/03/07 06:00AID - 0897190011431635 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0897190011431635 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Pharm Pract. 2012 Apr;25(2):232-49. doi: 10.1177/0897190011431635.
