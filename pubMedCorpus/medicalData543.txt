Reduced pulsatility      has been implicated as a contributing cause. The aim of this study was to assess       the effects of different degrees of pulsatility on the incidence of nonsurgical      bleeding. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Utah Transplantation Affiliated Hospitals      (U.T.A.H.) heart failure and transplant program databases were queried for      patients with end-stage heart failure who required support with the      continuous-flow LVAD HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) between 2004      and 2012. Pulsatility was evaluated by means of the LVAD parameter pulsatility      index (PI) and by the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve opening during      the first 3 months of LVAD support. PI was analyzed as a continuous variable and       also stratified according to tertiles of all the PI measurements during the study      period (low PI: <4.6, intermediate PI: 4.6-5.2, and high PI: >5.2). Major      nonsurgical bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin >/=2 g/dL (in the      absence of hemolysis) was the primary end point. A total of 134 patients (median       age of 60 [interquartile range: 49-68] years, 78% men) were included. Major      bleeding occurred in 33 (25%) patients (70% gastrointestinal, 21% epistaxis, 3%      genitourinary, and 6% intracranial). In multivariable analysis, PI examined      either as a categorical variable, low versus high PI (hazard ratio, 4.06; 95%      confidence interval, 1.35-12.21; P=0.04), or as a continuous variable (hazard      ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.92; P=0.02) was associated with an      increased risk of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced pulsatility in patients      supported with the continuous-flow LVAD HeartMate II is associated with an      increased risk of nonsurgical bleeding, as evaluated by PI.FAU - Wever-Pinzon, OmarAU  - Wever-Pinzon OAD  - Utah Transplantation Affiliated Hospitals, Cardiac Transplant Program, Salt Lake       City, UT, USA. omar.wever.pinzon@hsc.utah.eduFAU - Selzman, Craig HAU  - Selzman CHFAU - Drakos, Stavros GAU  - Drakos SGFAU - Saidi, AbdulfattahAU  - Saidi AFAU - Stoddard, Gregory JAU  - Stoddard GJFAU - Gilbert, Edward MAU  - Gilbert EMFAU - Labedi, MohamedAU  - Labedi MFAU - Reid, Bruce BAU  - Reid BBFAU - Davis, Erin SAU  - Davis ESFAU - Kfoury, Abdallah GAU  - Kfoury AGFAU - Li, Dean YAU  - Li DYFAU - Stehlik, JosefAU  - Stehlik JFAU - Bader, FerasAU  - Bader FLA  - engGR  - 4R01 HL089592-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - C06-RR11234/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1-RR025764/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.DEP - 20130311PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
