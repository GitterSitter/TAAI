With the      shortage of donor hearts available for the treatment of end-stage heart failure,       VADs have been used to provide temporary treatment until a heart becomes      available. VADs provide external sources of power for mechanical circulatory      support and are capable of sustaining life over weeks and months. This study      provides preliminary details about the psychiatric symptoms and disorders of the       first eight children equipped with a VAD in Turkey. METHODS: Eight pediatric      patients who recently underwent VAD implantation, aged 1 to 16 years, were      evaluated using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia,      Child Behavior Checklist, Children's Depression Inventory, Beck Depression      Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and followed up for 6      months. RESULTS: In the first evaluation, five participants had a psychiatric      disorder diagnosis. Two patients had adjustment disorder with depressive and      anxiety symptoms; one had anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; and two had       major depressive disorder. The anxiety and depressive symptom levels in      questionnaires were consistent with psychiatric diagnoses. Two patients had heart      transplantation during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: To determine and treat       psychiatric symptoms and disorders at an earlier stage, it is important for      children and adolescents with a VAD and those who have undergone heart      transplantation to be evaluated by a multidisciplinary consultation liaison team       including psychiatrists, psychologists, consultant nurses, and counselors.FAU - Ozbaran, BurcuAU  - Ozbaran BAD  - Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Ege      University, Bornova Izmir, Turkey. drbbeker@yahoo.comFAU - Kose, SezenAU  - Kose SFAU - Yagdi, TahirAU  - Yagdi TFAU - Engin, CagatayAU  - Engin CFAU - Erermis, SerpilAU  - Erermis SFAU - Uysal, TaciserAU  - Uysal TFAU - Ayik, FatihAU  - Ayik FFAU - Karakula, SultanAU  - Karakula SFAU - Ulger, ZulalAU  - Ulger ZFAU - Atay, YukselAU  - Atay YFAU - Ozbaran, MustafaAU  - Ozbaran MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Psychosom MedJT  - Psychosomatic medicineJID - 0376505SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - Child, Hospitalized/*psychologyMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/complications/psychology/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/psychologyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/complications/*diagnosisMH  - *Patient Care TeamMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/methodsMH  - Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - TurkeyEDAT- 2012/06/12 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/04 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/12 06:00AID - PSY.0b013e318258853a [pii]AID - 10.1097/PSY.0b013e318258853a [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Psychosom Med. 2012 Jun;74(5):554-8. doi: 10.1097/PSY.0b013e318258853a.
