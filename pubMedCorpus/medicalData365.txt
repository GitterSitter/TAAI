However, device-related infections      remain a significant problem. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence      and microbiological aetiology of bacteraemia in patients with VADs, and to assess      the impact of bacteraemia on clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study      was conducted of patients having VAD implantation at the Alfred Hospital      (Melbourne, Australia) from October 1990 to July 2009. Medical records and      microbiology databases were reviewed. Patients who were supported with a VAD for       72h or more were evaluated for demographic data, VAD type, the occurrence of      bacteraemia and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: During the 19-year period, 135 VAD      patients (89 Thoratec PVAD, 10 Novacor, and 36 Ventrassist) supported for a total      duration of 17,304 (median 74) support days were included. Sixty-one patients      (45%) developed VAD-associated bacteraemia, an incidence of 5.6 episodes per 1000      support days. The incidence of bacteraemia per 1000 days of support was similar      for the three devices used: Thoratec PVAD, Novacor and Ventrassist VADs      (7.8+/-0.8, 5.2+/-1.5 and 3.4+/-0.5, respectively, p=0.74). Staphylococcus aureus      was the most common pathogen (25%). The rates of death on device, survival to      transplant, recovery with explant and outcomes after transplantation, including      30-day mortality, median survival time and incidence of cerebrovascular accidents      were not significantly impacted upon by bacteraemia. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteraemia is       common in VAD patients. However, the incidence of VAD-associated bacteraemia is      independent of device type and with aggressive antimicrobial therapy; clinical      outcomes need not be affected by the bacteraemia.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic      Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ).
