METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty five healthy      controls matched with 97 patients with stable advanced HF were prospectively      enrolled. Exercise capacity, age, gender, and HF aetiology were balanced between       HFDM- and HFDM+ groups. Subjects underwent maximal bicycle spiroergometry with      blood sampling to measure metabolites and neurohormones before and immediately      after the exercise. HFDM+ patients had increased free fatty acids, glucose, and      beta-hydroxybutyrate compared with controls. HFDM+ patients had higher baseline      copeptin (24 +/- 16 vs. 17 +/- 13 pmol/L, P < 0.05) but otherwise showed similar       neurohumoral activation and exercise response to HFDM- patients. Peak oxygen      consumption (VO(2)) was unrelated to post-exercise free fatty acids, glucose,      lactate, or glycerol, but strongly correlated with post-exercise pyruvate (in      all: r = 0.62, P < 0.001). During the next 17 +/- 10 months, 36% of HF patients      experienced an adverse event (death, urgent transplantation, or assist device      insertion). From metabolic factors, only post-exercise glucose [hazard ratio (HR)      1.28, P = 0.04), total body fat (HR 0.58, P < 0.001), and the presence of DM (HR       1.98, P = 0.04) were predictive of the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception      of pyruvate, acute changes of metabolic substrates are not related to cardiac      performance in HF, regardless of diabetic status. Inhibition of body fat      depletion, attenuation of stress-related hyperglycaemia, or increasing dynamics      of plasma pyruvate may represent therapeutic targets in advanced HF.FAU - Melenovsky, VojtechAU  - Melenovsky VAD  - Department of Cardiology, Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine-IKEM,      Prague 4, 140 28, Czech Republic. vojtech.melenovsky@ikem.czFAU - Kotrc, MartinAU  - Kotrc MFAU - Polak, JanAU  - Polak JFAU - Pelikanova, TerezieAU  - Pelikanova TFAU - Bendlova, BelaAU  - Bendlova BFAU - Cahova, MonikaAU  - Cahova MFAU - Malek, IvanAU  - Malek IFAU - Jarolim, PetrAU  - Jarolim PFAU - Kazdova, LudmilaAU  - Kazdova LFAU - Kautzner, JosefAU  - Kautzner JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120612PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595RN  - 0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)RN  - IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)SB  - IMMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Case-Control StudiesMH  - Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Exercise TestMH  - Exercise ToleranceMH  - Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*metabolismMH  - FemaleMH  - Glucose/*metabolismMH  - Heart Failure/*metabolismMH  - HumansMH  - Insulin ResistanceMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Oxygen Consumption/physiologyMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Statistics as TopicEDAT- 2012/06/15 06:00MHDA- 2012/11/07 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/15 06:00PHST- 2012/06/12 [aheadofprint]AID - hfs080 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs080 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2012 Jul;14(7):754-63. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs080.
