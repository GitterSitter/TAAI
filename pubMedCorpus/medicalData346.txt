BACKGROUND: Adverse events in LVAD patients remain high. It is unclear whether      pre-operative characteristics influence the likelihood of the development of      post-operative hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Knowing which patients      are at greater risk might assist in tailoring anticoagulation therapy for certain      patients. METHODS: Advanced heart failure patients (n = 956) discharged from the       hospital after LVAD implantation in the HMII bridge to transplantation (n = 405)       and destination therapy (n = 551) clinical trials were retrospectively evaluated.      Bleeding requiring surgery or transfusion of >2 U of packed red blood cells,      stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), and pump thrombosis were tracked from hospital      discharge until patient outcome. RESULTS: Adverse event rates for post-discharge       bleeding (0.67 events/patient-year) were higher than those for hemorrhagic stroke      (0.05), ischemic stroke (0.04), and pump thrombosis (0.03). The main sites of      bleeding included gastrointestinal (45% of events), wound (12%), and epistaxis      (4%). Older age (>65 years) (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.31), lower pre-operative      hematocrit (</=31%) (HR: 1.31), ischemic etiology (HR: 1.35), and female (HR:      1.45) were statistically significant multivariable risk factors for bleeding.      Female (HR: 1.92) and 65 years of age and younger (HR: 1.94) were multivariable      risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke, whereas female (HR: 1.84) and history of      diabetes (HR: 1.99) were risk factors for ischemic stroke. Female (HR: 1.90) and       higher body mass index (HR: 1.71/10 kg/m(2) increase) were also multivariable      risk factors for pump thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bleeding and      thrombotic events during LVAD support differs by patient demographics, including       sex, age, body mass index, and etiology of heart failure. Further studies should       focus on the potential of tailored anticoagulation strategies in these subgroups.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
