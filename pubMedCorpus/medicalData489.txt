However,      survival is poorer in HHTx recipients, and with improving results in continuous      flow ventricular assist devices (VADs), many patients can be bridged to allow      normalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic heart      transplant (OHTx) candidates. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyse the      survival of our HHTx cohort and compare them with our VAD bridge patients.      METHODS: A retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 OHTx and 27      HHTx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124      bridge-to-transplant VAD patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received       an OHTx. Pulmonary artery pressures before and after VAD implant were analysed.      Survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS:      HHTx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older,      smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the OHTx cohort. Comparison of the      VAD types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longer time      supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than the      pulsatile devices. The continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonary      artery pressures pretransplant. The HHTx cohort had a significantly poorer      survival than the OHTx cohort (P=0.002). Survival on a continuous device and then      OHTx was significantly better than either HHTx or pulsatile device support.      CONCLUSIONS: The main indication for HHTx, namely fixed elevated pulmonary      hypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by       continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.FAU - Marasco, Silvana FAU  - Marasco SFAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery Unit, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.FAU - Bell, DavidAU  - Bell DFAU - Lee, GeraldineAU  - Lee GFAU - Bailey, MichaelAU  - Bailey MFAU - Bergin, PeterAU  - Bergin PFAU - Esmore, Donald SAU  - Esmore DSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130531PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heterotopic heart transplantOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/06/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/30 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/05 06:00PHST- 2013/05/31 [aheadofprint]AID - ezt281 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Feb;45(2):372-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281.
