The incidence of RHF complicates 20-50%      (range, 9-44%) of cases and is a major factor of postoperative morbidity and      mortality. Unfortunately, despite the fact that many risk factors contributing to      the development of RHF after LVAD implantation have been identified, it seems to       be extremely difficult to avoid them. Prevention of RHF consists of the      management of the preload and the afterload of the right ventricle with optimum      inotropic support. The administration of vasodilators designed to reduce      pulmonary vascular resistance is standard practice in most centers. The surgical       attempt of implantation of a right ventricular assist device does not always      resolve the problem and is not available in all cardiac surgery centers.FAU - Argiriou, MihalisAU  - Argiriou MAD  - 1 Cardiac Surgery Department, Transplantation Unit, "Evangelismos" Hospital,      Athens, Greece ; 2 University of Ioannina School of Medicine, Ioannina, Greece ;       3 Pulmonary Department-Oncology Unit, "G.
