ECLS also complements       cardiac surgical and cardiology procedures, implantation of long-term mechanical       cardiac assist devices, heart and lung transplantation and cardiopulmonary      resuscitation. Available ECLS therapies provide a range of options to the      multidisciplinary teams who are involved in the time-critical care of these      complex patients. While venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can      provide complete respiratory support, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal      facilitates protective lung ventilation and provides only partial respiratory      support. Mechanical circulatory support with venoarterial (VA) ECMO employed in a      traditional central/peripheral fashion or in a temporary ventricular assist      device configuration may stabilise patients with decompensated cardiac failure      who have evidence of end-organ dysfunction, allowing time for recovery,      decision-making, and bridging to implantation of a long-term mechanical      circulatory support device and occasionally heart transplantation. In highly      selected patients with combined severe cardiac and respiratory failure, advanced       ECLS can be provided with central VA ECMO, peripheral VA ECMO with timely      transition to venovenous ECMO or VA-venous ECMO upon myocardial recovery to avoid      upper body hypoxia or by addition of an oxygenator to the temporary ventricular      assist device circuit. This article summarises the available ECLS options and      provides insights into the principles and practice of these techniques. One      should emphasise that, as is common with many emerging therapies, their optimal      use is currently not backed by quality evidence. This deficiency needs to be      addressed to ensure that the full potential of ECLS can be achieved.FAU - Shekar, KiranAU  - Shekar KFAU - Mullany, Daniel VAU  - Mullany DVFAU - Thomson, BruceAU  - Thomson BFAU - Ziegenfuss, MarcAU  - Ziegenfuss MFAU - Platts, David GAU  - Platts DGFAU - Fraser, John FAU  - Fraser JFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140509PL  - EnglandTA  - Crit CareJT  - Critical care (London, England)JID - 9801902SB  - IMPMC - PMC4057103OID - NLM: PMC4057103EDAT- 2014/07/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/18 06:00CRDT- 2014/07/18 06:00PHST- 2014/05/09 [aheadofprint]AID - cc13865 [pii]AID - 10.1186/cc13865 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Crit Care. 2014 May 9;18(3):219. doi: 10.1186/cc13865.
