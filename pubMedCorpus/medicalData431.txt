Six sheep were assigned to either      an acute or chronic group. Then we created an acute myocardial infarction in each      by occluding the distal left anterior descending coronary artery with a balloon      for 90 minutes. All the sheep underwent LVAD implantation 30 days later. On the      same day, sheep in the acute group underwent transendocardial cell injections and      were euthanized. Sheep in the chronic group received cell injections 2 weeks      after LVAD implantation and were euthanized 30 days later. The presence of the      LVAD or the use of chest-closure wires did not interfere with electromechanical      mapping. Furthermore, no adverse events were observed during electromechanical      mapping or the stem cell injections. In all sheep, the LVAD flow rate was      approximately 4 L/min during mapping and the injections, and no adjustments were       required. Histologic analysis confirmed that the mesenchymal precursor stem cells      were successfully delivered. No differences were observed between the acute and      chronic groups. In conclusion, our study showed that transendocardial      electromechanical mapping and stem cell injections are safe and feasible in the      presence of an LVAD. Surgically implanted metal devices, including the LVAD,      steel chest-closure wire, and skin staples, were compatible with the      electromechanical mapping system.FAU - Zheng, YiAU  - Zheng YAD  - The Stem Cell Center and Cardiovascular Pathology Research Department, Texas      Heart Institute at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.FAU - Sampaio, Luiz CAU  - Sampaio LCFAU - Li, KeAU  - Li KFAU - Silva, Guilherme VAU  - Silva GVFAU - Cabreira-Hansen, MariaAU  - Cabreira-Hansen MFAU - Vela, DeborahAU  - Vela DFAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMFAU - Bove, ChristinaAU  - Bove CFAU - Perin, Emerson CAU  - Perin ECLA  - engGR  - 1P20HL101438/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - Tex Heart Inst JJT  - Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke's      Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children's HospitalJID - 8214622SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Disease Models, AnimalMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Feasibility StudiesMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - MagneticsMH  - *Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/instrumentationMH  - Myocardial Infarction/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - SheepMH  - *Surgery, Computer-Assisted/adverse effects/instrumentationMH  - Time FactorsMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftPMC - PMC3709201OID - NLM: PMC3709201OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Electromechanical mappingOT  - heart failureOT  - left ventricular assist deviceOT  - mesenchymal stem cellEDAT- 2013/08/06 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/13 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/06 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Tex Heart Inst J. 2013;40(3):229-34.
