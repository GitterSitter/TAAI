Diagnosis      requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, because many of the signs and      symptoms of this condition are nonspecific and can be acute or chronic.      Identification of the underlying aetiology, which can include pulmonary      hypertension, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, congenital or valvular heart      disease, and sepsis, is essential. Echocardiography is the technique of choice      for first-line assessment, but cardiac MRI is the current gold standard for      anatomical and functional assessment of the right ventricle. Therapy for RV      failure should be directed at the underlying cause, although management of      symptoms is also important. Therapeutic options range from pharmacological      treatment to mechanical RV support and heart transplantation. The complex 3D      geometry of the right ventricle and its intricate interactions with the left      ventricle have left many questions about RV failure unanswered. However,      promising new targeted therapies are under development and mechanical support is       becoming increasingly feasible. The next decade will be an exciting time for      advances in our understanding and management of RV failure.FAU - Simon, Marc AAU  - Simon MAAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Heart &      Vascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Scaife Hall S-555,      200 Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. simonma@upmc.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130212PL  - EnglandTA  - Nat Rev CardiolJT  - Nature reviews.
