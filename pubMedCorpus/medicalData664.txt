Despite advances in medical care, prognosis      with HF remains poor, especially in advanced stages. The large patient population      with advanced HF and the limited number of donor organs stimulated the      development of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices as a bridge to      transplant and for destination therapy. However, MCS devices require a major      operative intervention, cardiopulmonary bypass, and blood component exposure,      which have been associated with significant adverse event rates, and long      recovery periods. Miniaturization of MCS devices and the development of an      efficient and reliable transcutaneous energy transfer system may provide the      vehicle to overcome these limitations and usher in a new clinical paradigm in      heart failure therapy by enabling less invasive beating heart surgical procedures      for implantation, reduce cost, and improve patient outcomes and quality of life.       Further, it is anticipated that future ventricular assist device technology will       allow for a much wider application of the therapy in the treatment of heart      failure including its use for myocardial recovery and as a platform for support      for cell therapy in addition to permanent long-term support.CI  - (c) 2012, Copyright the Authors.
