Most can be managed with corrective or palliative surgery but a small group will       develop severe heart failure, leaving cardiac transplantation as the ultimate      treatment option. Unfortunately, due to the inadequate number of available donor       organs, only a small number of patients can benefit from this therapy, and      mortality remains high for pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation,      especially compared to adults. The purpose of this review is to describe the      potential role of mechanical circulatory support in this context and to review      current experience. For patients with congenital heart disease, ventricular      assist devices are most commonly used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation, an       application which has been shown to have several important advantages over      medical therapy alone or support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,      including improved survival to transplant, less exposure to blood products with      less immune sensitization, and improved organ function. While these devices may      improve wait list mortality, the chronic shortage of donor organs for children is      likely to remain a problem into the foreseeable future. Therefore, there is great      interest in the development of mechanical ventricular assist devices as potential      destination therapy for congenital heart disease patients with end-stage heart      failure. This review first discusses the experience with the currently available       ventricular assist devices in children with congenital heart disease, and then      follows to discuss what devices are under development and may reach the bedside      soon.FAU - Clark, Joseph BAU  - Clark JBAD  - Penn State Hershey Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center, Departments of      Pediatrics, Penn State Hershey Childrens Hospital, Penn State Hershey College of       Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.FAU - Pauliks, Linda BAU  - Pauliks LBFAU - Myers, John LAU  - Myers JLFAU - Undar, AkifAU  - Undar ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United Arab EmiratesTA  - Curr Cardiol RevJT  - Current cardiology reviewsJID - 101261935SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Defects, Congenital/surgeryMH  - Heart Diseases/*congenital/surgeryMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Palliative CareMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Tissue Donors/supply & distributionPMC - PMC3197085OID - NLM: PMC3197085OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Congenital heart diseaseOT  - Mechanical circulatory supportOT  - end-stage heart failureOT  - extracorporeal life support.OT  - pediatric heart transplantationOT  - pediatricsEDAT- 2012/05/02 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/25 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/02 06:00PHST- 2011/01/26 [received]PHST- 2011/06/13 [revised]PHST- 2011/06/30 [accepted]AID - 10.2174/157340311797484222 [doi]AID - CCR-7-102 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Cardiol Rev. 2011 May;7(2):102-9. doi: 10.2174/157340311797484222.
