Between January 2007 and July 2011, 73      consecutive adult patients were supported on peripheral PLS ECMO system at our      institution (55 men; age 60.3 +/- 11.6 years, range: 23-84 years). Indications      for support were failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of      postcardiotomy (n = 50) and primary donor graft failure (n = 8), post-acute      myocardial infarction CS (n = 12), and CS on chronic heart failure (n = 3). Mean       support time was 10.9 +/- 7.6 days (range: 2-34 days). Overall, 26 (35.6%)      patients died on ECMO. Among survivors on ECMO, 44 (60.2%) patients were      successfully weaned from support, and three (4.1%) were switched to a      mid-long-term ventricular assist device. Thirty-three (45.2%) were successfully      discharged. The following variables were significantly different if survivors and      nonsurvivors on ECMO were compared: age (P = 0.04), female gender (P < 0.01),      cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ECMO (P < 0.01), lactate level before ECMO      (P = 0.01), number of platelets, fresh frozen plasma units, and packed red blood       cells (PRBCs) transfused during ECMO support (P = 0.03, P = 0.02, and P < 0.01),       blood lactate level (P = 0.01), and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) relative      index 72 h after ECMO initiation (P < 0.001), and multiple organ failure on ECMO       (P < 0.01). Stepwise logistic regression identified blood lactate level and CK-MB      relative index at 72 h after ECMO initiation, and number of PRBCs transfused on      ECMO as significant predictors of mortality on ECMO (P = 0.011, odds ratio [OR] =      2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-3.12; P = 0.012, OR = 2.81, 95% CI =      1.026-2.531; and P = 0.012, OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.02-5.21; respectively).      Patients with an initial poor hemodynamic status could benefit by rapid      peripheral installation of PLS ECMO. The blood lactate level, CK-MB relative      index, and PRBCs transfused should be strictly monitored during ECMO support.CI  - (c) 2012, Copyright the Authors.
