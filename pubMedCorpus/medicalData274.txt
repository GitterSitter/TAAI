Because of improvement in cardiovascular care there is now a      growing number of patients such as the elderly and those with abundant      comorbidity who are not eligible for cardiac transplant. Durable mechanical      circulatory support is the new reality in the treatment of advanced heart failure      in this population subset. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has evolved       from humble origins as a short-term extracorporeal and pulsatile device into a      durable intracorporeal continuous flow device capable of providing permanent      support in the form of destination therapy (DT) LVAD. Data gathered from original      landmark clinical trials including Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance      for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH), and the Heart Mate II      Trial, and the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support      (INTERMACS) provide insight into the type of patient and the timing in which to      consider DT LVAD therapy. There are a number individual patient warning signs and      symptoms that predate clinical decline; thus, identifying individuals who might      benefit from a DT LVAD strategy. The adverse event burden that accompanies DT      LVAD therapy cannot be ignored when considering LVAD as an adjunct to ongoing      medical therapy. Trends in patient selection regarding mechanical circulatory      support continue to evolve along with the technology. As more clinical outcome      data are gathered we will continue to refine our patient selection criteria and      timing of implant.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
