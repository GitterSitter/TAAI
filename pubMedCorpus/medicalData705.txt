The aim of this multi-modal intervention was      to improve the body weight, exercise tolerance and psychosocial status in      outpatients on long-term LVAD support. METHODS: Seventy patients participated in       this non-randomized intervention study [intervention group (IGr) n = 34; control       group (CGr) n = 36] over 18 months (T1-T4); the baseline sample characteristics      showed no differences between groups. Dietary counselling and weight management      intervention was performed by a dietician based on a specific algorithm. Physical      reconditioning followed a home ergometry protocol and was supplemented by      psychosocial counselling. The outcomes were measured based on the body mass index      (BMI), cardiopulmonary exercise testing and self-report [hospital anxiety and      depression scale (HADS), SF-36]. RESULTS: The intervention showed a strong      positive effect on nutrition and weight management [95% confidence interval (CI):      -0.71-0.69; effect size (ES): 0.907; P = 0.02)], resulting in the normal BMI      (kg/m(2)) values in the IGr (T1: 24.0 +/- 0.6; T4: 24.5 +/- 1.1; P = 0.35)      compared with a significant BMI increase in the CGr (T1: 23.8 +/- 0.6; T4: 29.7      +/- 0.8; P = 0.05). Significant differences appeared regarding exercise tolerance      (VO(2)max/% predicted) in favour of IGr patients (IGr: 69 +/- 2.9; CGr 62 +/-      3.7; P = 0.04). This increase was reflected by patients' self-reporting based on       the SF-36 physical component score (IGr: P = 0.04; CGr: P = 0.54). SF-36      psychosocial component scores showed no changes for both groups. However, CGr      showed a tendency for increased anxiety scores relative to their counterparts      (IGr: 4.95 +/- 0.4; CGr: 6.6 +/- 0.9; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IGr patients showed      a strong benefit from a multi-modal intervention, including dietary counselling,       controlled exercise and psychosocial support. Dietary counselling holds potential      to prevent obesity in this patient population.FAU - Kugler, ChristianeAU  - Kugler CAD  - Division of Cardiac, Thoracic, Transplantation, and Vascular Surgery, Hannover      Medical School, Hannover, Germany. kugler.christiane@mh-hannover.deFAU - Malehsa, DorisAU  - Malehsa DFAU - Schrader, EvaAU  - Schrader EFAU - Tegtbur, UweAU  - Tegtbur UFAU - Guetzlaff, ElkeAU  - Guetzlaff EFAU - Haverich, AxelAU  - Haverich AFAU - Strueber, MartinAU  - Strueber MLA  - engPT  - Controlled Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120621PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Dec;42(6):1033-4.
