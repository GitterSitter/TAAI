There are limited data on the microbiology and      epidemiology of these infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients      scheduled for VAD implantation were enrolled (2006-2008) at 11 US cardiac centers      and followed prospectively until transplantation, explantation for recovery,      death, or for 1 year. Eighty-six patients (57%) received HeartMate II devices.      Data were collected on potential preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative       risk factors for infection. Clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were      collected for suspected infections and evaluated by an infectious diseases      specialist. Thirty-three patients (22%) developed 34 VAD-related infections with       an incidence rate of 0.10 per 100 person-days (95% confidence interval,      0.073-0.142). The median time to infection was 68 days. The driveline was the      most commonly infected site (n=28); 18 (64%) were associated with invasive      disease. Staphylococci were the most common pathogen (47%), but pseudomonas or      other Gram-negative bacteria caused 32% of infections. A history of depression      and elevated baseline serum creatinine were independent predictors of VAD      infection (adjusted hazard ratio=2.8 [P=0.007] and 1.7 [P=0.023], respectively).       The HeartMate II was not associated with a decreased risk of infection. VAD      infection increased 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio=5.6; P<0.0001).      CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, multicenter study demonstrates that infection      frequently complicates VAD placement and is a continuing problem despite the use       of newer, smaller devices. Depression and renal dysfunction may increase the risk      of VAD infection. VAD infection is a serious consequence because it adversely      affects patient survival.
