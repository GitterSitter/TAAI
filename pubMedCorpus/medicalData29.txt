BACKGROUND: The HMRS has been shown to      correlate with mortality in the cohort of patients enrolled in the Heartmate II      trials, but its validity in unselected, "real world" populations remains unclear.      METHODS: This study identified a cohort of 269 consecutive patients who received       a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device at our institution, the      Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, between June 2005 and June 2013.      Ninety-day and 2-year mortality rates, as well as frequency of several morbid      events, were compared by retrospectively assigned HMRS category groups. The      analysis was repeated within the subgroup of INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for       Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) class 1 patients. RESULTS: Receiver      operating curve analysis showed that the HMRS correlated with 90-day mortality      with an area under the curve of 0.70. Stratification in low, mid, and high HMRS      groups identified patients with increasing hazard of 90-day mortality, increasing      long-term mortality, increasing rate of gastrointestinal bleeding events, and      increasing median number of days spent in the hospital in the first year post      implant. Within INTERMACS class 1 patients, those in the highest HMRS group were       found to have a relative risk of 90-day mortality 5.7 times higher than those in       the lowest HMRS group (39.1% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: HMRS is a valid      clinical tool to stratify risk of morbidity and mortality after implant of      Heartmate II devices in unselected patients and can be used to predict short-term      mortality risk in INTERMACS class 1 patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
