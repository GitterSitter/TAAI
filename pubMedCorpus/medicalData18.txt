Preclinical data suggest these cells improve vascular density,      which would be expected to decrease fibrosis and inflammation. OBJECTIVES: The      goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that bone marrow stem cells (CD34+)      will improve histological measurements of vascularity, fibrosis, and inflammation      in human subjects undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement as a      bridge to cardiac transplantation. METHODS: Subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy      who were scheduled for placement of an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation      underwent bone marrow aspiration the day before surgery; the bone marrow was      processed into cell fractions (bone marrow mononuclear cells, CD34+, and CD34-).       At LVAD implantation, all fractions and a saline control were injected      epicardially into predetermined areas and each injection site marked. At the time      of transplantation, injected areas were collected. Data were analyzed by paired      Student t test comparing the effect of cell fractions injected within each      subject. RESULTS: Six subjects completed the study. There were no statistically      significant differences in complications with the procedure versus control      subjects. Histological analysis indicated that myocardium injected with CD34+      cells had decreased density of endothelial cells compared to saline-injected      myocardium. There were no significant differences in fibrosis or inflammation      between groups; however, density of activated fibroblasts was decreased in both      CD34+ and CD34- injected areas. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue analysis does not support the      hypothesis that bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells promote increased vascular tissue      in humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy via direct injection.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
