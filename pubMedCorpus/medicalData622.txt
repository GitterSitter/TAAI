Cardiogenic shock in PPCM, though      rare, can be life-threatening, often requiring support with mechanical      circulatory support devices. We present a case of 37-year-old Caucasian female      who developed cardiogenic shock within 24 hours of the delivery of her twins. The      echocardiogram demonstrated severe biventricular failure which necessitated      biventricular device placement and support with a CentriMag(R) centrifugal pump.       This biventricular support was employed, using a single-circuit CentriMag(R)      pump, using a 'Y' connection which made weaning from right-sided support and      conversion to univentricular support easier and feasible. The patient recovered      four weeks later and was explanted off the CentriMag(R) support and did well.      This technology allows for the CentriMag(R) to be considered as an early option      for biventricular support in the treatment and management of these patients as a       bridge to recovery.FAU - Aggarwal, AAU  - Aggarwal AAD  - Center for Heart Transplant and Assist Devices, Advocate Christ Medical Center,      Oak Lawn, IL, USA.FAU - Modi, SAU  - Modi SFAU - Kumar, SAU  - Kumar SFAU - Korrapati, CAU  - Korrapati CFAU - Tatooles, AAU  - Tatooles AFAU - Pappas, P SAU  - Pappas PSFAU - Bhat, GAU  - Bhat GLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121025PL  - EnglandTA  - PerfusionJT  - PerfusionJID - 8700166SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *Cardiomyopathies/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - ElectrocardiographyMH  - *Extracorporeal Circulation/instrumentation/methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - HumansMH  - *Postpartum PeriodMH  - PregnancyMH  - *Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - *Shock, Cardiogenic/physiopathology/surgeryEDAT- 2012/10/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/13 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/30 06:00PHST- 2012/10/25 [aheadofprint]AID - 0267659112464713 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0267659112464713 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Perfusion. 2013 Mar;28(2):156-9. doi: 10.1177/0267659112464713.
