The study design was a retrospective review      of prospectively collected data. Included were 42 patients who underwent cf-LVAD       implantation (64.3% HeartMate II, 35.7% HeartWare) between July 2007 and May 2013      with preoperative hepatic failure defined as elevation of greater than or equal      to two liver function parameters above twice the upper normal range. Mean patient      age was 35 +/- 12.5 years, comprising 23.8% females. Dilated cardiomyopathy was      present in 92.9% of patients (left ventricular ejection fraction 17.3 +/- 5.9%).       Mean support duration was 511 +/- 512 days (range: 2-1996 days). Mean      preoperative laboratory parameters for blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine,      total bilirubin, and alanine aminotransferase were 9.5 +/- 5.4 mg/dL, 110.3 +/-      42.8 mumol/L, 51.7 +/- 38.3 mmol/L, and 242.1 +/- 268.6 U/L, respectively. All      parameters decreased significantly 1 month postoperatively. The mean preoperative      modified Model for Endstage Liver Disease excluding international normalized      ratio score was 16.03 +/- 5.57, which improved significantly after cf-LVAD      implantation to 10.62 +/- 5.66 (P < 0.001) at 7 days and 5.83 +/- 4.98 (P <      0.001) at 30 days postoperatively. One-year and 5-year survival was 75.9 and      48.1%, respectively. 21.4% of the patients underwent LVAD explantation for      myocardial recovery, 16.7% were successfully transplanted, and 7.1% underwent      LVAD exchange for device failure over the follow-up period. Patients with      preexisting acute hepatic failure are reasonable candidates for cf-LVAD      implantation, with excellent rates of recovery and survival, suggesting that      cf-LVAD therapy should not be denied to patients merely on grounds of      "preoperative elevated liver enzymes/hepatopathy."CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Weymann, AlexanderAU  - Weymann AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support,       Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of      Cardiac Surgery, Heart Center, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.FAU - Patil, Nikhil PAU  - Patil NPFAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AFAU - Mohite, Phrashant NAU  - Mohite PNFAU - Garcia Saez, DianaAU  - Garcia Saez DFAU - Bireta, ChristianAU  - Bireta CFAU - Wahlers, ThorstenAU  - Wahlers TFAU - Karck, MatthiasAU  - Karck MFAU - Kallenbach, KlausAU  - Kallenbach KFAU - Ruhparwar, ArjangAU  - Ruhparwar AFAU - Fatullayev, JavidAU  - Fatullayev JFAU - Amrani, MohamedAU  - Amrani MFAU - De Robertis, FabioAU  - De Robertis FFAU - Bahrami, ToufanAU  - Bahrami TFAU - Popov, Aron-FrederikAU  - Popov AFFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20141027PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Bridge-to-recoveryOT  - Bridge-to-transplantationOT  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist deviceOT  - End-organ dysfunctionOT  - Hepatic failureEDAT- 2014/10/28 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/28 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/28 06:00PHST- 2014/10/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12375 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Apr;39(4):336-42. doi: 10.1111/aor.12375.
