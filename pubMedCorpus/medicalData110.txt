Although results reported have been excellent,       older recipients and donors associated with significant comorbidities are now the      rule rather than the exception. Moreover, heart failure has become a significant       public health problem with a growing population of patients in countries unable      to answer the demand for transplantation. An emerging answer to this dilemma      comes from results reported with the use of continuous flow pumps where patient      survival approaches 80% one and 2 years after implantation in selected patients.       Is it time to triage patients to continuous flow pumps? Should we recommend      continuous flow pump implantations in patients with various comorbidities, and      offer transplantation to a selected group of patients who will reach the      long-term benefit of the procedure?CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
