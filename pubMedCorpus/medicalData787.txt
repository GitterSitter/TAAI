METHODS AND RESULTS: Study Group 1 consisted of 151 consecutive      outpatients (age 48.7 +/- 12 years; 110 men) with end-stage dilative      cardiomyopathy. Group 2, consisting of 11 consecutive patients (age 50 +/- 11      years; 6 men) with sinus rhythm and "true" decompensation, was used to create      "critical values" of WI. There were no demographic or somatic (weight and height)      differences between the groups. The follow-up period of ambulatory patients was      31 +/- 8 months. Non-invasive WI was studied in the common carotid artery.      Complete invasive and non-invasive data were also recorded on the day of      investigation. During follow-up 44 pts were lost; there were 15 cardiac deaths      (10%), life-saving ventricular assist device implantation in 10 (6.6%) and      transplantation in 19 (12.7%). For statistical purposes this group was named the       "events" Group B (n = 44). A predisposing factor for events (death, "true"      decompensation and "urgent" transplantation in ambulatory patients) was low first      peak ("cut-off value" assessed in Group 2 < 4100 mmHg*s(3)) (OR 45.6, CI      14.5-143.3, p < 0.001). Less powerful predictors of the risk of deterioration      were pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure      (PAP) and E/A mitral wave relation (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The new      ventricular-arterial coupling parameter 1st peak of WI can potentially be used to      distinguish patients at high risk for true deterioration and death. This      parameter can be used to predict the need for assist device implantation.FAU - Siniawski, HenrykAU  - Siniawski HAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum,      Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany. siniawski@dhzb.de.FAU - Lehmkuhl, HansAU  - Lehmkuhl HAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum,      Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany. lehmkuhl@dhzb.de.FAU - Dandel, MichaelAU  - Dandel MAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum,      Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany. dandel@dhzb.de.FAU - Unbehaun, AxelAU  - Unbehaun AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum,      Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany. unbehaun@dhzb.de.FAU - Kemper, DagmarAU  - Kemper DAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum,      Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany. kemper@dhzb.de.FAU - Weng, YuguoAU  - Weng YAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum,      Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany. weng@dhzb.de.FAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum,      Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany. hetzer@dhzb.de.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120201PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - J Funct BiomaterJT  - Journal of functional biomaterialsJID - 101570734PMC - PMC4031013OID - NLM: PMC4031013EDAT- 2012/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2012/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2014/06/24 06:00PHST- 2011/12/08 [received]PHST- 2012/01/18 [revised]PHST- 2012/01/28 [accepted]AID - jfb3010100 [pii]AID - 10.3390/jfb3010100 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Funct Biomater. 2012 Feb 1;3(1):100-13. doi: 10.3390/jfb3010100.
