The risk of profound GF       has not declined in the past decade, as the consequence of the liberalisation of       donor acceptance criteria because of the scarcity of donors. It is therefore      important to try to diagnose graft failure and recognise the mechanisms of early       graft dysfunction. AIM: To establish haemodynamic and echocardiographic criteria       of early GF to define patients who should be considered for assist device support      or re-transplantation. METHODS: Between January 2000 and March 2009, 116 HTx      patients were studied. On the basis of echocardiography and continuous invasive      monitoring, three groups were identified: (1) The true graft failure group (GF)      consisted of 46 patients; (2) The latent right ventricular (RV) dysfunction group      (RV-D) consisted of 25 patients with small left ventricular (LV) chamber (< 39      mm) and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) < 50%; (3) The control group consisted of 45       consecutive HTx patients without any haemodynamic complications. RESULTS:      Postoperatively, only the GF group required large doses of norepinephrine (> 0.3       mumg/kg/min) and inhalative NO (40 ppm). Nevertheless, right and left filling      pressures were significantly higher than in the controls (right 12 +/- 3.6 vs.      9.0 +/- 2 and left atrial pressure 13.0 +/- 3.2 vs. 9.6 +/- 2 mm Hg, both p <      0.001). Cardiac index was significantly smaller (2.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.9, p <      0.001) but neither pulmonary artery pressure (29.5 +/- 6 vs. 29.7 +/- 7 mm Hg)      nor transpulmonary gradient (6 +/- 5 vs. 5.1 +/- 5 mm Hg) nor pulmonary vascular       resistance (273 +/- 97 vs. 287 +/- 144 dyn x s x cm-5) differed significantly      from those of the control group. In the GF group, LV end diastolic dimension      (LVEDD) was significantly smaller and function poorer than in controls (39.8 +/-       5 vs. 44.4 +/- 5 mm, respectively, p = 0.001). RV function was also significantly      worse (RVEF 42.2 +/- 14% vs. 56.0 +/- 9%), respectively, p = 0.001), whereas RV      dimension did not differ significantly. Mechanical support after failure of the      initial medical treatment was necessary in 37% of patients; 29 (63.0%) patients      from the GF group died, the cause of death being sepsis with multi-organ failure.      In the RV-D group, remodelling was quite similar but LVEF was excellent and      maximal systolic velocity from the posterior wall was significantly higher than      in GF. No death occurred. CONCLUSIONS: True early GF represents a grave      haemodynamic situation with high mortality. Bedside echocardiography helps to      distinguish between latent RV dysfunction and true GF.FAU - Siniawski, HenrykAU  - Siniawski HAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery,Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin,      13353 Berlin, Germany. siniawski@dhzb.deFAU - Dandel, MichaelAU  - Dandel MFAU - Lehmkuhl, Hans BrendanAU  - Lehmkuhl HBFAU - Hiemann, NicolaAU  - Hiemann NFAU - Kemper, DagmarAU  - Kemper DFAU - Knosalla, ChristophAU  - Knosalla CFAU - Stein, JuliaAU  - Stein JFAU - Weng, YuguoAU  - Weng YFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - PolandTA  - Kardiol PolJT  - Kardiologia polskaJID - 0376352SB  - IMCIN - Kardiol Pol. 2012;70(12):1318; author reply 1318-9.
