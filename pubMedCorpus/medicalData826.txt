We examined the safe working range for LVAD pump speed       and the effect on pump output and cardiac function in 13 stable outpatients with       VentrAssist-LVAD (Ventracor Ltd, Australia). Pump speed was decreased from a      baseline mean of 2,073 +/- 86 revolutions per minute (RPM, with corresponding      mean flow of 5.59 +/- 1.18 L/min, mean +/- standard deviation) to an average      low-speed of 1,835 +/- 55 RPM (corresponding flow 4.68 +/- 0.99 L/min) and up to       high-speed of 2,315 +/- 66 RPM (corresponding flow 6.30 +/- 1.29 L/min). There      was a strong linear relationship between alteration in speed and flow rates (r(2)      = 0.89, p < 0.00001) but marked interpatient variation. Downward titration to      preset minimum 1,800 RPM was achieved in 9/13 (69%) and upward titration to the      preset maximum 2,400 RPM was achieved in 4/13 (31%). Upward titration was stopped      due to ventricular suction or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 4/13      (31%). Ventricular suction or VT (in 4/13) tended to be more common in patients      with poor right ventricular (RV) function (p = 0.07). In summary, pump flow is      stable within a relatively small speed range and should not be altered without      close monitoring due to variation in response between patients, particularly with      concomitant RV impairment.FAU - Hayward, Christopher SAU  - Hayward CSAD  - Heart Failure and Transplant Unit, St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, New South      Wales, Australia. cshayward@stvincents.com.auFAU - Salamonsen, RobertAU  - Salamonsen RFAU - Keogh, Anne MAU  - Keogh AMFAU - Woodard, JohnAU  - Woodard JFAU - Ayre, PeterAU  - Ayre PFAU - Prichard, RoslynAU  - Prichard RFAU - Walker, RobynAU  - Walker RFAU - Kotlyar, EugeneAU  - Kotlyar EFAU - Macdonald, Peter SAU  - Macdonald PSFAU - Jansz, PaulAU  - Jansz PFAU - Spratt, PhillipAU  - Spratt PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Coronary Circulation/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hemodynamics/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Pulsatile FlowMH  - Ventricular Function, Left/*physiologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/10/13 06:00MHDA- 2012/02/14 06:00CRDT- 2011/10/13 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318233b112 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2011 Nov-Dec;57(6):495-500. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318233b112.
