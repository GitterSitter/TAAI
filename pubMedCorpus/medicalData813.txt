Right ventricular (RV)       dysfunction is common after LVAD insertion and is a significant source of      morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing LVAD placement. Several studies      have identified clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic      parameters that may serve as risk factors for RV dysfunction after LVAD      placement. Furthermore, scoring systems have been established to help      quantitatively predict the potential need for RV support after LVAD placement.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
