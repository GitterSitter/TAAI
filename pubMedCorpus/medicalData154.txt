The clinical results of eight      patients, who underwent LVAD implantation with the Jarvik 2000 (median age 55.0      years; six men) between 2005 and 2010, including two who participated in a      multicenter clinical trial in Japan, were reviewed. Two patients underwent LVAD      implantation as destination therapy. Four patients underwent Jarvik 2000      implantation via median sternotomy, while the other four underwent implantation      via left thoracotomy. There were no major complications during surgery. Four      patients were supported for more than 2 years. The longest support duration was      1,618 days. Six patients successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a      median 725 days of support. One patient on destination therapy died of a cerebral      infarction. The other patient on destination therapy had had the LVAD for 1,618      days. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100, 86, and 86%,      respectively. The median postoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase level was      860.5 U/L at 1 month, 735 U/L at 6 months, and 692 U/L at 1 year. There were no      fatal device-related infections. We found that the Jarvik 2000 with pin bearing      could support patients with end-stage heart failure with acceptable mortality and      morbidity rates. Further evaluations of the prevalence of thromboembolic and      hemolytic events in patients with the new conical-bearing Jarvik 2000 are      required.FAU - Yoshioka, DaisukeAU  - Yoshioka DAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of      Medicine, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Japan, yoshioka@surg1.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.FAU - Matsumiya, GoroAU  - Matsumiya GFAU - Toda, KoichiAU  - Toda KFAU - Sakaguchi, TaichiAU  - Sakaguchi TFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Matsuda, HikaruAU  - Matsuda HFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140722PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/07/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/23 06:00CRDT- 2014/07/23 06:00PHST- 2014/03/27 [received]PHST- 2014/06/30 [accepted]PHST- 2014/07/22 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-014-0783-z [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2014 Dec;17(4):308-14. doi: 10.1007/s10047-014-0783-z.
