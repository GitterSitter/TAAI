We studied 1,675 patients with systolic HF who      underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at a single university center (77.4%      men, mean age 52.2 +/- 11.6 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 23.2      +/- 7.1% and New York Heart Association class III or IV in 79.1%). We evaluated      2-year survival in patients stratified by both BMI (normal 18.5 to 24.9      kg/m(2)[reference], overweight 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2), obese >/=30.0 kg/m(2)) and by       peak oxygen uptake (PKVO2; high >14 ml/kg/minute, low </=14 ml/kg/minute). At 2      years, BMI category was significantly associated with outcomes for the low PKVO2       group (p <0.001) but not the high PKVO2 group (p = 0.1). In the low PKVO2 group,       obese patients had decreased risk of death free from urgent status 1A heart      transplant or ventricular assist device placement after multivariate adjustment      compared with normal BMI (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]      0.44 to 0.91, p = 0.01); no significant difference was observed for overweight      patients (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.25, p = 0.5). In the high PKVO2 group, no      relation was seen (overweight BMI HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32, p = 0.3; obese HR      0.87, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.75, p = 0.7). In conclusion, the obesity paradox was only       observed in patients with lower cardiorespiratory fitness in this advanced      systolic HF cohort, indicating that improved functional capacity may attenuate      the obesity paradox.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
