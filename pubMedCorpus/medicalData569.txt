Indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely with      the development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and      the total artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patients      awaiting transplantation, so much so, that LVADs are now approved of as a      strategy for destination therapy. In this review, the authors describe in detail       the current basic indications, functioning modalities, main limitations of      surgical LAVDs, total artificial heart development, and percutaneous assist      devices, trying to clarify this complex, but fascinating topic.FAU - Rigatelli, GianlucaAU  - Rigatelli GAD  - Section of Adult Congenital Heart Disease, Cardiovascular Diagnosis and      Endoluminal Interventions, Rovigo General Hospital, Viale Tre Martiri, 45100      Rovigo, Italy.FAU - Santini, FrancescoAU  - Santini FFAU - Faggian, GiuseppeAU  - Faggian GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ChinaTA  - J Geriatr CardiolJT  - Journal of geriatric cardiology : JGCJID - 101237881PMC - PMC3545257OID - NLM: PMC3545257OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cardiac surgeryOT  - Cardiocirculatory supportOT  - DevicesOT  - Heart failureOT  - Heart transplantEDAT- 2013/01/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/24 06:01CRDT- 2013/01/24 06:00PHST- 2012/05/28 [received]PHST- 2012/08/29 [revised]PHST- 2012/09/15 [accepted]AID - 10.3724/SP.J.1263.2012.05281 [doi]AID - jgc-09-04-389 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Geriatr Cardiol. 2012 Dec;9(4):389-400. doi: 10.3724/SP.J.1263.2012.05281.
