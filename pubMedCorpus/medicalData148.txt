It consists of two      pneumatic pumps with four mechanical valves that replace nearly the entire      myocardium, thus also making it effective therapy for heart failure from      alternative (ALT) anatomical and pathophysiological causes that preclude left      ventricular assist device (LVAD). This report reviews the clinical indications      and outcomes for TAH implantation at our institution from 2006 to 2012. We sought      to characterize and compare survival to transplant for patients with BiVHF to      those with ALT indications. The overall survival to transplant for all patients      was 86% (57/66). There was a trend towards decreased survival to transplantation       in the ALT group compared with the BiVHF group (77% vs. 93%, HR 0.42 [95%      confidence interval 0.1, 1.7], log-rank test: p = 0.2). This was likely driven by      certain high risk subgroups of allograft failure, LVAD failure, and acute      postinfarct shock.FAU - Thanavaro, Kristin LAU  - Thanavaro KLAD  - From the *Division of Cardiology, Virginia Commonwealth University Medical      Center, Richmond, Virginia; and daggerDivision of Cardiothoracic Surgery,      Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia.FAU - Tang, Daniel GAU  - Tang DGFAU - Kasirajan, VigneshwarAU  - Kasirajan VFAU - Shah, Keyur BAU  - Shah KBLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/07/30 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/30 06:00CRDT- 2014/07/29 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000111 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Sep-Oct;60(5):594-6. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000111.
