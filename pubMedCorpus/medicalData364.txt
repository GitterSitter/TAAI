As support duration for VADs      continues to rise, patient management and device maintenance will play an      increasingly crucial role. The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System has currently       been implanted in >4,000 patients worldwide. The HeartWare controller stores      approximately 30 days of VAD data including pump rotational speed, power      consumption, and estimated VAD flow. Routine assessment of controller log files      can serve as a pump performance tool and clinical management aid, assisting the      clinician to make accurate and timely diagnoses. Here, we discuss the      controller's data collection system as well as present the process for evaluation      and reporting of controller log files to clinicians.FAU - Chorpenning, KatherineAU  - Chorpenning KAD  - From HeartWare, Inc., Miami Lakes, Florida.FAU - Brown, Michael CAU  - Brown MCFAU - Voskoboynikov, NeilAU  - Voskoboynikov NFAU - Reyes, CarlosAU  - Reyes CFAU - Dierlam, Anne EAU  - Dierlam AEFAU - Tamez, DanielAU  - Tamez DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - *ComputersMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *Research ReportMH  - Telemedicine/*instrumentationEDAT- 2013/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/26 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000022 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Jan-Feb;60(1):115-8. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000022.
