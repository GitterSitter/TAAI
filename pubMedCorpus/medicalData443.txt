METHODS: Survival rates,      echocardiographic parameters, laboratory values and adverse events of 85      consecutive patients supported with a HM II were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall,      mean age was 45 +/- 13 years, 62 (73%) were male and non-ischaemic dilatated      cardiomyopathy was present in 60 (71%) patients. The median duration of      mechanical support was 387 days (IQR 150-600), with a range of 1-1835 days. The      6-month, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year survival rates during HM II LVAD support were 85,       81, 76, 76 and 68%, respectively. Echocardiographic parameters demonstrated      effective left ventricular unloading, while laboratory results reflected adequate      organ perfusion. However, HM II support was associated with adverse events, such       as infections in 42 patients (49%; 0.67 events/patient-year), cardiac arrhythmia       in 44 (52%; 0.86 events/patient-year), bleeding complications in 32 (38%; 0.43      events/patient-year) and neurological dysfunction in 17 (20%; 0.19      events/patient-year). CONCLUSIONS: In view of the increasing shortage of donor      hearts, HM II LVAD support may be considered a life-saving treatment in end-stage      HF patients, with good survival. However, it is still associated with some      serious adverse events, of which neurological complications are the most      critical.FAU - Lok, Sjoukje IAU  - Lok SIAD  - Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.      s.lok@umcutrecht.nlFAU - Martina, Jerson RAU  - Martina JRFAU - Hesselink, TimAU  - Hesselink TFAU - Rodermans, Ben F MAU  - Rodermans BFFAU - Hulstein, NelienkeAU  - Hulstein NFAU - Winkens, BjornAU  - Winkens BFAU - Klopping, CorinneAU  - Klopping CFAU - Kirkels, J HansAU  - Kirkels JHFAU - Doevendans, Pieter AAU  - Doevendans PAFAU - Ramjankhan, FaizAU  - Ramjankhan FFAU - de Weger, Roel AAU  - de Weger RAFAU - de Jonge, NicolaasAU  - de Jonge NFAU - Lahpor, Jaap RAU  - Lahpor JRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130718PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgery/ultrasonographyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative Complications/etiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Adverse eventsOT  - Continuous-flow LVADOT  - HeartMate IIOT  - SurvivalEDAT- 2013/07/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/10 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/23 06:00PHST- 2013/07/18 [aheadofprint]AID - ezt347 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt347 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Sep;44(3):e233-8. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt347.
