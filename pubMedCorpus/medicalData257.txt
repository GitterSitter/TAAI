We investigated readmissions after HeartMate II      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation by characterizing their type,       temporal frequency, causative factors, and resource use and survival after      readmission. BACKGROUND: The HeartMate II LVAD provides enhanced survival and      quality of life to end-stage heart failure patients. Whether these improved      outcomes are accompanied by a similar reduction in unplanned hospital      readmissions is largely unknown. METHODS: From October 2004 to January 2010, 118       patients received a HeartMate II, of whom 92 were discharged on device support.      Subsequent readmissions were analyzed using prospectively maintained clinical and      financial databases. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (52%) had 177 unplanned      hospital readmissions, 87 non-LVAD- and 90 LVAD-associated. Reasons for      non-LVAD-associated readmissions included medical management of comorbidities and      progression of cardiac pathology (n = 48), neuropsychiatric/psychosocial issues      (n = 22), and infections (n = 17). Those for LVAD-associated readmissions      included device component infection (n = 51), management of nontherapeutic      anticoagulation or device malfunction (n = 22), and bleeding (n = 15). Cumulative      incidence of unplanned readmissions was higher (p < 0.0001) for destination      therapy than bridge-to-transplant patients (9/patient vs. 4/patient at 24      months). Cumulative hospital days overall were 25 and 42 at 12 and 18 months,      respectively, and the costs were 18% and 29% of initial implantation costs.      Increased number of unplanned readmissions was predictive of mortality.      CONCLUSIONS: Unplanned readmissions are common during HeartMate II support and      negatively affect resource use and survival. Refining patient selection,      especially in destination therapy patients, reducing infectious and bleeding      complications, and increasing awareness about these devices might reduce      unnecessary readmissions.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
