This can be veno-venous, in       which de-oxygenated blood is drained from the venous system and oxygenated before      being returned to the venous system, and veno-arterial where the re-oxygenated      venous blood is returned to the arterial system. Haemorrhage, sepsis and      thrombo-embolism are common and potentially lethal complications. Left      ventricular assist devices are a continually evolving technology, that may be      used as a bridge to transplantation or destination therapy in end-stage cardiac      failure. The VentrAssist left ventricular assist device is a small implantable,      continuous flow centrifugal pump, that is controlled and powered by a      percutaneous lead. However, in these patients, right heart failure may present as      an acute event following weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), or      post-operatively in the intensive care unit. Patients who do not respond to      inotropes and pulmonary vasodilators may need a right ventricular assist device      (RVAD). We report a successful case of right heart assist extra corporeal      membrane oxygenation used as temporary right heart support in combination with a       VentrAssist left ventricular assist device. The use of right heart assist extra      corporeal membrane oxygenation to help a failing right heart during left      ventricular assist device placement is not new, however, our technique describes       a novel method of cannulation of the femoral vein and pulmonary trunk via a      tunnelled vascular tube graft, which allows the chest to be closed whilst on      right heart support, and decannulation to proceed without resternotomy. This      technique has also been used successfully subsequent to this.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic      Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ).
