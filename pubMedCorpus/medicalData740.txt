METHODS: We investigated the outcomes of patients bridged to recovery      compared with those bridged to transplantation. All left ventricular assist      devices were implanted as a bridge to transplantation with a very proactive      program of promoting myocardial recovery. A total of 40 patients were bridged to       recovery and 52 to transplantation. Of the bridged to recovery (explanted) group,      33 were men (age, 32.8 +/- 11.8 years), 37 had dilated cardiomyopathy (familial      in 3, peripartum cardiomyopathy in 3) and 3 had myocarditis. Of the bridged to      transplantation (transplanted) group, 42 were men (age, 42.3 +/- 12.5 years; P <       .0005 vs bridged to recovery). The diagnosis was ischemic heart disease in 24,      dilated cardiomyopathy in 21 (only 13 received drug therapy), hypertrophic      obstructive cardiomyopathy in 2, arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 2,       myocarditis in 1, and congestive heart disease in 2. RESULTS: The survival rate      was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%, 78.3, and 78.3% in the explanted and      transplanted groups at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively. In total, 12 (23%)      patients bridged transplantation either died from, or required ventricular assist      device support, for primary graft failure. Of the explanted patients, 4 (10%)      subsequently required transplantation at 34, 512, 1019, and 1213 days (2 died 25       and 1867 days after transplantation and 2 were well after 1523 and 3199 days).      The rate of transplant or ventricular assist device-free survival less noncardiac      death for the bridged to recovery and bridged to transplantation groups,      respectively, was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%, 78.3%, and 78.3% at 1, 3,      and 7 years. At latest follow-up (1394 +/- 1195 days for the bridged to recovery       and 1913 +/- 941 days for the bridged to transplantation group), 5 of the bridged      to transplantation patients (9.6%) had malignancy, 34 (65.4%) had      hypercholesterolemia, 25 (48.1%) had hypertension, and 7 (13.5%) had coronary      disease. The creatinine was 125.5 +/- 43.5 vs 95.2 +/- 16.5 mumol/L for the      bridged to transplantation and bridged to recovery groups (P < .001).      CONCLUSIONS: The outcome after explantation for myocardial recovery is      comparable, if not better than, after bridge to transplantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
