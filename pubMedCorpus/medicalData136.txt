The Synergy Pocket Micro-pump      (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, Mass), the smallest surgically implanted long-term      LVAD, provides partial flow up to 4.25 L/min and was primarily designed for "less      sick" patients with severe heart failure. This device is implanted minimally      invasively without sternotomy or cardiopulmonary bypass. Early implantation in      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support       class 4 and higher was shown to be feasible and associated with significantly      improved hemodynamics and quality of life. The aim of this study was to present      our experience with implementation of long-term partial circulatory support as a       bridge to transplantation in patients with more advanced heart failure who were      dependent preoperatively on inotropic support or intra-aortic balloon pump.      METHODS: In this observational study, only inotropic or intra-aortic balloon      pump-dependent patients with end-stage heart failure were included (n = 12).      These patients underwent Synergy device implantation between February 2012 and      August 2013. RESULTS: The mean preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support class was 2.17 +/- 0.84 (class 1, 25%; class 2, 33%;      class 3, 42%). The mean age was 46 +/- 15 years, and 33% were female.      Preoperatively, 4 patients (33%) had at least 1 previous sternotomy, 3 patients      (25%) were supported with a balloon pump, 1 patient (8%) had a previous      full-support LVAD, and 4 patients (33%) had cerebrovascular events in the past.      After device implantation, there were no right ventricular failures,      device-related infections, hemorrhagic strokes, arterial or venous      thromboembolisms, or worsenings of aortic and mitral regurgitation observed over       the follow-up. The mean follow up was 174 +/- 171 days (range, 5-764 days;      cumulative, 3199 days). One patient (8%) died, 3 patients (25%) successfully      underwent transplantation, 1 device (8%) was explanted after myocardial recovery,      and 5 patients (42%) are still on ongoing support. Two patients (17%) were      upgraded to a full-support LVAD after 65 days of mean support. A total of 11 of      12 patients (92%) were discharged from the hospital and are presently alive. Left      ventricular end-diastolic diameter was significantly reduced 3 months after      device implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Partial LVAD support may be clinically      efficacious in inotropic and intra-aortic balloon pump-dependent patients. On the      basis of our experience and evidence of previous research, such patients may      benefit from minimally invasive access, no need for sternotomy and      cardiopulmonary bypass, a short implantation time, an easy exchange if necessary,      and a lower risk of subsequent heart transplantation. Because the implantation is      performed without sternotomy, device upgrade is feasible with a comparatively low      operative risk and good clinical outcome. Our preliminary results show that      partial-support devices may have the potential to replace full-support LVADs in      the near future.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
