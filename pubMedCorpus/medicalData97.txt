The outcome of cardiac transplantation is generally poor, and almost half of      patients die while waiting for the procedure to be done. PATIENT: We report here       the remarkable case of a 63-year-old man with heart failure caused by AL      amyloidosis. After a long course, which included rapid deterioration of      preexisting heart failure, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, biventricular      assist device support, heart transplantation, renal failure, kidney      transplantation and finally a life-threatening H1N1 virus pneumonia, the patient       managed not only to survive but also to return fully to his previous demanding      duties and lifestyle. DISCUSSION: Early use of left ventricular or biventricular       mechanical circulatory support may be beneficial as a bridge to transplantation      in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis.FAU - Gkouziouta, AggelikiAU  - Gkouziouta AAD  - aOnassis Cardiac Surgery Center bSecond Department of Cardiology, Attikon      University Hospital cFirst Department of Internal Medicine, Laiko Hospital      dDepartment of Cardiology, Mediterraneo Hospital, Athens, Greece.FAU - Farmakis, DimitriosAU  - Farmakis DFAU - Manginas, AthanassiosAU  - Manginas AFAU - Sfyrakis, PetrosAU  - Sfyrakis PFAU - Saroglou, GeorgiosAU  - Saroglou GFAU - Adamopoulos, StamatisAU  - Adamopoulos SFAU - Iliodromitis, Efstathios KAU  - Iliodromitis EKLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141020TA  - J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown)JT  - Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)JID - 101259752EDAT- 2014/10/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/22 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/22 06:00AID - 10.2459/JCM.0000000000000216 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown). 2014 Oct 20.
