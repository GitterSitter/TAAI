Previous research has      demonstrated that insertion of the LVAD alone improves exercise capacity and      quality of life (QOL). This study investigated whether supervised exercise      training results in a further improvement. METHODS: This prospective, randomized       controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and      intention-to-treat analysis investigated the effect of exercise training on      exercise capacity and QOL in 14 patients who underwent LVAD insertion as a bridge      to heart transplantation. Exercise training consisted of 8 weeks of gym-based      aerobic and strengthening exercises 3 times a week, with a progressive      mobilization program, compared with the control group that completed mobilization      alone. Exercise capacity was measured before and after the intervention using      maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). QOL      was measured using the Short Form 36-item assessment. RESULTS: No adverse events       were reported. There was a trend toward greater improvement in peak oxygen      consumption (Vo(2)), 6MWD, and QOL in the exercise group (n = 7) compared with      the control group (n = 7); however, no significant between-group difference was      detected for improvements in peak Vo(2) [mean difference (exercise--control)] of       2.96 ml/kg/min (95% confidence interval, -1.04 to 6.97), 6MWD at 54 meters (-51      to 159 meters), and QOL scores over time (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise      training is feasible and safe in patients with a LVAD. Trends toward greater      improvement in exercise capacity and QOL after exercise training warrant further       investigation in a larger trial.CI  - Crown Copyright (c) 2012.
