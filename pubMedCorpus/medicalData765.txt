Consequently, researchers have sought predictors that may identify patients at      risk. However, they have lacked sensitivity and/or specificity. This study      investigated the use of a decision tree technology to explore the preoperative      data space for combinatorial relationships that may be more accurate and precise.      We retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 patients with initial LVAD      implantation at the Artificial Heart Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical      Center, between May 1996 and October 2009. Among those patients, 27 later      required a right ventricular assist device (RVAD+) and 156 remained on LVAD      (RVAD-) until the time of transplantation or death. A synthetic minority      oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to the RVAD+ group to compensate for      the disparity of sample size. Twenty-one resampling levels were evaluated, with      decision tree model built for each. Among these models, the top six predictors of      the need for an RVAD were transpulmonary gradient (TPG), age, international      normalized ratio (INR), heart rate (HR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),      prothrombin time, and right ventricular systolic pressure. TPG was identified to       be the most predictive variable in 15 out of 21 models, and constituted the first      splitting node with 7 mmHg as the breakpoint. Oversampling was shown to improve      the senstivity of the models monotonically, although asymptotically, while the      specificity was diminished to a lesser degree. The model built upon 5X synthetic       RVAD+ oversampling was found to provide the best compromise between sensitivity      and specificity, included TPG (layer 1), age (layer 2), right atrial pressure      (layer 3), HR (layer 4,7), INR (layer 4, 9), alanine aminotransferase (layer 5),       white blood cell count (layer 5,6, &7), the number of inotrope agents (layer 6),       creatinine (layer 8), AST (layer 9, 10), and cardiac output (layer 9). It      exhibited 85% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 0.87 area under the receiver      operating characteristic curve (RoC), which was found to be greatly improved      compared to previously published studies.FAU - Wang, YajuanAU  - Wang YAD  - Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA       15213, USA. yajuanwan@gmail.comFAU - Simon, MarcAU  - Simon MFAU - Bonde, PramodAU  - Bonde PFAU - Harris, Bronwyn UAU  - Harris BUFAU - Teuteberg, Jeffrey JAU  - Teuteberg JJFAU - Kormos, Robert LAU  - Kormos RLFAU - Antaki, James FAU  - Antaki JFLA  - engGR  - 1R01HL086918-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20120210PL  - United StatesTA  - IEEE Trans Inf Technol BiomedJT  - IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the      IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology SocietyJID - 9712259SB  - IMMH  - Decision TreesMH  - Heart Failure/*diagnosis/physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - PrognosisMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*surgeryMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/*physiopathologyEDAT- 2012/02/16 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/22 06:00CRDT- 2012/02/16 06:00PHST- 2012/02/10 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1109/TITB.2012.2187458 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed. 2012 May;16(3):383-90. doi:      10.1109/TITB.2012.2187458.
