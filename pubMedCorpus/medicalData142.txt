The patient was treated with three consecutive stages of mechanical circulatory      support as a triple bridge to cardiac transplantation. Extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation support was used for 5 days, followed by Levitronix CentriMag      biventricular assist devices for 39 days. This was escalated to implantation of      the CardioWest temporary total artificial heart for 107 days. The patient      experienced concurrent end-stage renal disease and subsequently underwent both      heart and kidney transplantation. On postoperative day 18 the patient was      discharged with good cardiac and renal function.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
