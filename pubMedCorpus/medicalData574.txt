However, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition after      application of LVADs is not clearly defined. The purpose of the present study was      to investigate ECM remodeling after mechanical unloading in a rat heart      transplant model. Sixty male Lewis rats were subjected to abdominal heterotopic      heart transplantation, and the transplanted hearts were pressure- and      volume-unloaded. The age- and weight- matched male Lewis rats who had undergone      open thoracic surgeries were used as the control. Left ventricle ECM accumulation      and the expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue      inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were measured on the third,      seventh, and fourteenth days after transplantation/sham surgery. Compared with      the control group, myocardial ECM deposition significantly increased on the      seventh and fourteenth days after heart transplantation (P < 0.05) and peaked on       the 14th day. The gelatinase activity as well as mRNA expression of MMP-2 and      MMP-9 significantly increased after transplantation (P < 0.05). Both mRNA and      protein levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 significantly increased compared with those      of the control group. Mechanical unloading may lead to adverse remodeling of the       ECM of the left ventricle. The underlying mechanism may due to the imbalance of      the MMP/TIMP system, especially the remarkable upregulation of TIMPs in the      pressure and volume unloaded heart.FAU - Wang, LuAU  - Wang LAD  - Division of Cardiology, Shandong Corps Hospital of Chinese People's Armed Police       Forces, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China.FAU - Xu, Yu-XianAU  - Xu YXFAU - Du, Xiao-JieAU  - Du XJFAU - Sun, Quan-GeAU  - Sun QGFAU - Tian, Ying-JunAU  - Tian YJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130115PL  - SpainTA  - J Physiol BiochemJT  - Journal of physiology and biochemistryJID - 9812509RN  - 0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)RN  - 127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)RN  - 9007-34-5 (Collagen)RN  - EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)RN  - EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)RN  - EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)SB  - IMMH  - AbdomenMH  - AnimalsMH  - Collagen/biosynthesisMH  - Extracellular Matrix/*genetics/metabolism/pathologyMH  - Gelatinases/genetics/metabolismMH  - Gene Expression ProfilingMH  - *Gene Expression RegulationMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Ventricles/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - MaleMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/metabolismMH  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolismMH  - RatsMH  - Rats, Inbred LewMH  - Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/genetics/metabolismMH  - Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/genetics/metabolismMH  - Transplantation, HeterotopicMH  - *Ventricular RemodelingEDAT- 2013/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/18 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/15 06:00PHST- 2012/05/16 [received]PHST- 2013/01/02 [accepted]PHST- 2013/01/15 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s13105-013-0235-x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Physiol Biochem. 2013 Sep;69(3):477-85. doi: 10.1007/s13105-013-0235-x.
