METHODS: Patients receiving a HeartMate II LVAD       in the bridge to transplant (n = 490) and destination therapy (n = 634) trials      were included (n = 1125). AAs requiring treatment were recorded, regardless of      symptoms. Using Cox models with and without a 60-day blanking period, risk      factors for early and late AAs were determined. RESULTS: In total, there were 271      AAs in 231 patients (21%), most of which occurred within the first 60 days.      Patients with and without AAs had similar survival (p = 0.16). Serum creatinine      (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.49 per unit increase, 1.18 to 1.88; p < 0.001) and      ejection fraction (HR = 0.98 per 1% increase, 0.95 to 0.999; p = 0.04) were      associated with AAs in a multivariable model. Although quality of life (QoL) and       functional status improved in all patients, those with AAs had worse unadjusted      QoL (p < 0.001) and a decreased rate of improvement in six-minute walk distance      over six to 24 months postimplant (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately      one-fifth of LVAD patients have AAs, most commonly within the first 60 days of      support. Preoperative creatinine is a strong risk factor for early and late AAs.       Although AAs do not impact survival, they are associated with decreased      functional status and QoL improvements during LVAD support.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Brisco, Meredith AAU  - Brisco MAAD  - Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Medical University of South      Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.FAU - Sundareswaran, Kartik SAU  - Sundareswaran KSFAU - Milano, Carmelo AAU  - Milano CAFAU - Feldman, DavidAU  - Feldman DFAU - Testani, Jeffrey MAU  - Testani JMFAU - Ewald, Gregory AAU  - Ewald GAFAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSFAU - Farrar, David JAU  - Farrar DJFAU - Goldberg, Lee RAU  - Goldberg LRCN  - HeartMate II Clinical InvestigatorsLA  - engSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00121472SI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00121485PT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140418PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809RN  - AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathologyMH  - Creatinine/bloodMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart AtriaMH  - Heart Failure/blood/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - Preoperative PeriodMH  - Proportional Hazards ModelsMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - RiskMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2014/04/23 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/11 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/23 06:00PHST- 2014/04/18 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/jocs.12336 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2014 Jul;29(4):572-80. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12336.
