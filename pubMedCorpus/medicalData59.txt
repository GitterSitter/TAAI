The first device (HeartMate II)      was implanted as a bridge to transplantation. However, after few months of      support the patient showed signs of myocardial recovery and the device was      successfully explanted. After 2 years of uneventful follow-up, the patient's      condition deteriorated requiring further mechanical support. Due to the elevated       risk associated with a redo full-support LVAD implantation, we decided to implant      a partial support device (Synergy(R) CircuLite). Because of recurrent pump      thrombosis requiring device exchange, the final weeks to transplantation were      bridged with CentriMag(R) short-term LVAD. After successful cardiac      transplantation the patient required further temporary extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation support which was weaned off and explanted on the fourth      postoperative day. After further uncomplicated postoperative recovery the patient      was discharged and has been doing well for 1 year of follow-up.FAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support,       Harefield Hospital, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Middlesex,      London, UB9 6JH, UK, a.sabashnikov@gmail.com.FAU - Butters, TomAU  - Butters TFAU - Hogerle, BenjaminAU  - Hogerle BFAU - Hedger, MikeAU  - Hedger MFAU - Zeriouh, MohamedAU  - Zeriouh MFAU - Fatullayev, JavidAU  - Fatullayev JFAU - Weymann, AlexanderAU  - Weymann AFAU - Choi, Yeong-HoonAU  - Choi YHFAU - Wahlers, ThorstenAU  - Wahlers TFAU - Popov, Aron-FrederikAU  - Popov AFFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141231TA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648EDAT- 2015/01/01 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/01 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/01 06:00PHST- 2014/06/30 [received]PHST- 2014/11/27 [accepted]PHST- 2014/12/31 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-014-0809-6 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - J Artif Organs. 2014 Dec 31.
