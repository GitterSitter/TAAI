The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates       peaked at 149.0 per 100 waitlist years in 2007 and has been declining since then;      in 2013, the rate was 87.4 heart transplants per 100 active waitlist years.      Increased waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase      in waitlist mortality. Since 2008, the proportion of patients on life support      before transplant increased from 53.4% to 65.8% in 2013. Medical urgency      categories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgency      categories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list       each year; the number of pediatric transplants performed each year increased from      293 in 2003 to 411 in 2013. Patient survival among pediatric recipients continues      to improve; 5-year patient survival for transplants performed from 2001 through      2008 was 70% to 80%. Medicare paid for some or all of the care for 42.2% of all      heart transplant recipients in 2012.CI  - (c) Copyright 2015 The American Society of Transplantation and the American      Society of Transplant Surgeons.FAU - Colvin-Adams, MAU  - Colvin-Adams MAD  - Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Minneapolis Medical Research      Foundation, Minneapolis, MN; Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology,      University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.FAU - Smith, J MAU  - Smith JMFAU - Heubner, B MAU  - Heubner BMFAU - Skeans, M AAU  - Skeans MAFAU - Edwards, L BAU  - Edwards LBFAU - Waller, C DAU  - Waller CDFAU - Callahan, E RAU  - Callahan ERFAU - Snyder, J JAU  - Snyder JJFAU - Israni, A KAU  - Israni AKFAU - Kasiske, B LAU  - Kasiske BLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Am J TransplantJT  - American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of      Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant SurgeonsJID - 100968638SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - End-stage heart failureOT  - heart transplantOT  - transplant outcomesOT  - ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2015/01/30 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/30 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/29 06:00AID - 10.1111/ajt.13199 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Transplant. 2015 Jan;15 Suppl 2:1-28. doi: 10.1111/ajt.13199.
