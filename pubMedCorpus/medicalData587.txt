BACKGROUND: LVAD mortality risk      prediction is important for candidate selection and communicating expectations to      patients and clinicians. With the evolution of LVAD support, prior risk      prediction models have become less valid. METHODS: Patients enrolled into the      HMII bridge to transplantation and destination therapy trials (N = 1,122) were      randomly divided into derivation (DC) (n = 583) and validation cohorts (VC) (n =       539). Pre-operative candidate predictors of 90-day mortality were examined in the      DC with logistic regression, from which the HMII Risk Score (HMRS) was derived.      The HMRS was then applied to the VC. RESULTS: There were 149 (13%) deaths within       90 days. In the DC, mortality (n = 80) was higher in older patients (odds ratio      [OR]: 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 1.7 per 10 years), those with      greater hypoalbuminemia (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.76 per mg/dl of albumin),      renal dysfunction (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.2 per mg/dl creatinine),      coagulopathy (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7 to 5.8 per international normalized ratio      unit), and in those receiving LVAD support at less experienced centers (OR: 2.2,       95% CI: 1.2 to 4.4 for <15 trial patients). Mortality in the DC low, medium, and       high HMRS groups was 4%, 16%, and 29%, respectively (p < 0.001). In the VC,      corresponding mortality was 8%, 11%, and 25%, respectively (p < 0.001). HMRS      discrimination was good (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve:       0.71, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: The HMRS might be useful for mortality       risk stratification in HMII candidates and may serve as an additional tool in the      patient selection process.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
