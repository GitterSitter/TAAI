The application of       adult ventricular assist devices in pediatric patients has led to increased      thrombotic events. Therefore, we have been developing a pediatric ventricular      assist device (PVAD), the Penn State 12 cc PVAD. It is designed for patients with      a body weight of 5-15 kg and has a stroke volume of 12 cc. Clot formation is the       major concern. It is correlated to the coagulability of blood, the blood      contacting materials and the fluid dynamics within the system. The intent is for       the PVAD to be a long term therapy. Therefore, the system may be oriented in      different positions according to the patient's behavior. This study evaluates for      the first time the impact of position on the flow patterns within the Penn State       12 cc PVAD, which may help to improve the PVAD design concerning chamber and      ports geometries. The fluid dynamics are visualized by particle image      velocimetry. The evaluation is based on inlet jet behavior and calculated wall      shear rates. Vertical and horizontal model orientations are compared, both with a      beat rate of 75, outlet pressures of 90/60 mm Hg and a flow rate of 1.3 l/min.      The results show a significant change of the inlet jet behavior and the      development of a rotational flow pattern. Vertically, the inlet jet is strong      along the wall. It initiates a rotational flow pattern with a wandering axis of      rotation. In contrast, the horizontal model orientation results show a weaker      inlet jet along the wall with a nearly constant center of rotation location,      which can be correlated to a higher risk of thrombotic events. In addition, high       speed videography illustrates differences in the diaphragm motion during      diastole. Diaphragm opening trajectories measurements determine no significant      impact of the density of the blood analog fluids. Hence, the results correlate to      human blood.FAU - Schonberger, MarkusAU  - Schonberger MAD  - Department of Bioengineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park,      Pennsylvania 16802, USA.FAU - Deutsch, StevenAU  - Deutsch SFAU - Manning, Keefe BAU  - Manning KBLA  - engGR  - HV48191/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - N01 HV048191/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Blood Flow VelocityMH  - ChildMH  - Computer-Aided DesignMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/statistics & numerical dataMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - HydrodynamicsMH  - In Vitro TechniquesMH  - Models, CardiovascularMH  - PennsylvaniaMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Pulsatile FlowMH  - SystoleMH  - UniversitiesPMC - PMC3431512MID - NIHMS392569OID - NLM: NIHMS392569OID - NLM: PMC3431512EDAT- 2012/08/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/26 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/30 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3182639a18 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2012 Sep-Oct;58(5):481-93. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3182639a18.
