The inflow cannulation site induces major hemodynamic changes and so      there is a need to optimize the site used depending on the patient's condition.      Therefore, this study evaluated and compared the hemodynamic influence of right      atrial cannulation (RAC) and right ventricular cannulation (RVC) inflow sites. An      in vitro variable heart failure mock circulation loop was used to compare RAC and      RVC in mild and severe biventricular heart failure (BHF) conditions. In the      severe BHF condition, higher ventricular ejection fraction (RAC: 13.6%, RVC:      32.7%) and thus improved heart chamber and RVAD washout were observed with RVC,      which suggested this strategy might be preferable for long-term support (i.e.,      bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy) to reduce the risk of thrombus      formation. In the mild BHF condition, higher pulmonary valve flow (RAC: 3.33      L/min, RVC: 1.97 L/min) and lower right ventricular stroke work (RAC: 0.10 W,      RVC: 0.13 W) and volumes were recorded with RAC. These results indicate an      improved potential for myocardial recovery, thus RAC should be chosen in this      condition. This in vitro study suggests that RVAD inflow cannulation site should       be chosen on a patient-specific basis with a view to the support strategy to      promote myocardial recovery or reduce the risk of long-term complications.CI  - (c) 2013, Copyright the Authors.
