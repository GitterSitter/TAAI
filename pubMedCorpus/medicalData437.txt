Patients undergoing MVR with concomitant HMII implantation      were compared with those undergoing HMII implantation alone. Of the 57 patients      undergoing cf-LVAD implantation, 21 (36.8%) underwent concomitant MVR and 36      (63.2%) underwent cf-LVAD implantation alone. Patients receiving MVR had greater       decrement in PVR (59.4% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.01). Decrease in end-diastolic diameter       was greater for patients receiving MVR but did not reach statistical significance      (18.2 vs. 13.5 mm, p = 0.33). Duration of mechanical ventilation (121.6 vs. 181.4      hours, p = 0.45) and inotropic support (162.4 vs. 153.2 hours, p = 0.86), change       in creatinine (0.19 vs. -0.26 mg/dl, p = 0.34), increase in bilirubin (2.54 vs.      1.55 mg/dl, p = 0.63), intensive care unit stay (168.0 vs. 231.5 hours, p =      0.38), and overall length of stay (32.0 vs. 42.5 days, p = 0.75) were similar.      There was no difference in survival at 3 months (89.7% vs. 83.3%) and 1 year      (83.7 vs. 67.3%, p = 0.34). Addition of MVR may result in greater decrement of      PVR than HMII implantation alone. This may permit certain patients thought to be       ineligible for transplantation to become candidates.FAU - Taghavi, SharvenAU  - Taghavi SAD  - Department of Surgery, Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,      USA.FAU - Hamad, EmanAU  - Hamad EFAU - Wilson, LynnAU  - Wilson LFAU - Clark, RachaelAU  - Clark RFAU - Jayarajan, Senthil NAU  - Jayarajan SNFAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NFAU - Goldstein, Daniel JAU  - Goldstein DJFAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HFAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YFAU - Mangi, Abeel AAU  - Mangi AALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)RN  - RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Aortic Valve/pathologyMH  - Bilirubin/metabolismMH  - *Cardiac Surgical ProceduresMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - Creatinine/metabolismMH  - DiastoleMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/surgeryMH  - Heart Ventricles/*pathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Intensive Care UnitsMH  - Length of StayMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Mitral Valve/*surgeryMH  - Mitral Valve Insufficiency/surgeryMH  - Respiration, ArtificialMH  - Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/surgeryMH  - *Vascular ResistanceEDAT- 2013/07/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/31 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829be026 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2013 Sep-Oct;59(5):469-73. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829be026.
