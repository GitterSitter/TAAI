This study examined the development of AR and long-term results      after implantation of cf-LVADs. METHODS: The study included all patients with no       or less than mild AR who underwent HeartMate II (58 [62%]; Thoratec Corp,      Pleasanton, CA) or HeartWare (35 [38%]; HeartWare International, Framingham, MA)       implantation at our institute from July 2006 to July 2012. Serial echocardiograms      were obtained preoperatively, at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively, and then at a      minimum of 4-month intervals in patients with longer-term support. Kaplan-Meier      estimates for freedom from moderate or greater AR were generated. Logistic      regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of AR after cf-LVAD      implantation. RESULTS: Median duration of LVAD support was 527 days (25(th),      75(th): 289, 907; range, 60 to 2,433 days). Mild AR developed in 48 patients      (51.6%) over a median duration of 126 days, with progression to moderate AR in 13      (14%) over 493 days and to severe AR in 2 (2.1%) over 1,231 days. The incidence      of mild or greater AR was 43.1% in HeartMate II vs 65.7% in HeartWare recipients       (p = 0.035). Overall freedom from moderate or greater AR was 94.7% +/- 2.6% at 1       year, 86.9% +/- 4.5% at 2 years, 82.8% +/- 5.9% at 3 years, and 31% +/- 16.9% at       4 years. Independent predictors of AR were duration of support (odds ratio,      1.002; 95% confidence interval, 1.000 to 1.004; p = 0.017) and a persistently      closed aortic valve (odds ratio, 0.193; 95% confidence interval, 0.097 to 0.382;       p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AR is associated with longer cf-LVAD support duration      and persistent aortic valve closure. Incidence of moderate or greater AR after      cf-LVAD implantation increases significantly after 3 years. The clinical      implications of these data may warrant consideration of prophylactic aortic valve      replacement at the time of cf-LVAD implantation, particularly with expected      longer duration of support and in patients with preexisting AR that is more than       mild.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
