We       evaluated the incidence and outcomes of pump replacement procedures with the      HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD. METHODS: Data were      obtained from 1,128 patients implanted from March 2005 to January 2010 with the      HeartMate II during the clinical trials for bridge to transplant and destination       therapy. The operative mortality associated with the replacement procedure was      determined. RESULTS: The mean duration of HeartMate II support was 568 +/- 535      days (cumulative duration: 1,755 patient-years, longest: 6.5 years). A total of      72 (6.4%) patients underwent 79 LVAD replacements (0.045 events/patient-year) of       which 2 were in the initial operation and 77 in separate procedures. Reasons for       replacement were percutaneous lead damage (36 events, 3.0%), device thrombosis      (25 events, 2.1%), infection (7 events, 0.6%), and miscellaneous other (11      events, 0.9%). The median time to pump replacement was 428 days (range 0 to      1,474). Of the 77 replacement procedures, there were 5 (6.5%) operative deaths      within 30 days. The causes of death were device thrombosis, right heart failure,       multisystem organ failure, and bleeding. One year after exchange (median 2.1      years after initial implant), 30% had died, 5% were transplanted, and 65% were      ongoing and alive. CONCLUSIONS: HeartMate II device failure requiring pump      replacement is infrequent, but when required can be done safely. These data      continue to provide encouraging evidence supporting HeartMate II use for      long-term circulatory support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
