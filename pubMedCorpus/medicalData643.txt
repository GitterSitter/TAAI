After      normalization of ventricular diameters during unloading, the pre-explant left      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) allows the detection of patients with the      potential to remain stable after VAD explantation. However, some patients with      LVEF >45 before VAD explantation show early recurrence of heart failure (HF). We       aimed to find out if unstable improvement can be recognized before VAD      explantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 96 patients weaned from VADs since 1995,      a relatively homogenous group of 53 patients with nonischemic chronic      cardiomyopathy (CCM) was selected for the study. The pre-explant stability of      major parameters of LV function, size, and geometry that were measured by      echocardiography during serial "off-pump" trials was tested for relationship with      cardiac stability after VAD explantation. LVEF, systolic peak wall motion      velocity (Sm), end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), end-diastolic relative wall      thickness (RWT(ED)) and end-diastolic short/long-axis ratio (S/L(ED)) were      selected for evaluation. In postweaning unstable patients, the selected      parameters showed relevant instability already before VAD explantation during the      time period between best cardiac improvement and VAD explantation and also during      the final off-pump trial just before VAD explantation. For all parameters, there       were significant differences (P<0.05) in pre-explant changes between patients      with and without postweaning cardiac stability. Using the optimal cutoff values      obtained from receiver-operating characteristic analysis, we found for our      selected parameters predictive values for postexplant cardiac stability of >/=1      year, >/=3 years, and >/=5 years, ranging between 94 and 100, 92, and 100, and 78      and 100, respectively. Using for all parameter changes the cutoff value of 10, we      found similar predictive values for cardiac stability of >/=1 year, >/=3 years,      and >/=5 years, ranging between 93 and 97, 90 and 96, and 83 and 92,      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest the possibility to      improve the prediction of postexplant transplant/VAD-free outcome in CCM patients      with cardiac improvement during VAD support by analyzing the pre-explant      stability of several LV off-pump echocardiographic parameters during serial      off-pump trials.FAU - Dandel, MichaelAU  - Dandel MAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin,       Germany. dandel@dhzb.deFAU - Weng, YuguoAU  - Weng YFAU - Siniawski, HenrykAU  - Siniawski HFAU - Potapov, EvgenijAU  - Potapov EFAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TFAU - Lehmkuhl, Hans BAU  - Lehmkuhl HBFAU - Drews, ThorstenAU  - Drews TFAU - Knosalla, ChristophAU  - Knosalla CFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - CirculationJT  - CirculationJID - 0147763RN  - 0 (Cardiovascular Agents)SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cardiovascular Agents/therapeutic useMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Device RemovalMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology/*surgery/ultrasonographyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/physiopathology/ultrasonographyMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Organ SizeMH  - PrognosisMH  - Proportional Hazards ModelsMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - RecurrenceMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/physiopathology/ultrasonographyMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/09/22 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/10 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/12 06:00AID - 126/11_suppl_1/S9 [pii]AID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.084640 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Circulation. 2012 Sep 11;126(11 Suppl 1):S9-19.
