Furthermore, they are critical to the arsenal of the heart failure      cardiologist, given the supply/demand mismatch for donor organs. Unfortunately,      these devices present their own complications. Despite antiplatelet agents and      systemic anticoagulation, a number of patients present with pump thrombosis, a      life-threatening event requiring either pump exchange or treatment with systemic       thrombolytics. In an effort to avoid these morbid therapies, glycogen IIb/IIIa      inhibitors, which have both antiplatelet and thrombolytic properties, have been      proposed to treat pump thrombosis. We report here the largest case series using      these agents and document a previously unreported high failure rate with this      therapy.FAU - Bellumkonda, LavanyaAU  - Bellumkonda LAD  - From the *Division of Cardiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven,      Connecticut; and daggerSection of Cardiac Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New      Haven, Connecticut.FAU - Subrahmanyan, LakshmanAU  - Subrahmanyan LFAU - Jacoby, DanielAU  - Jacoby DFAU - Bonde, PramodAU  - Bonde PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Peptides)RN  - 0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)RN  - 0 (eptifibatide)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Peptides/*therapeutic useMH  - Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic useMH  - Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - Thrombosis/*drug therapy/*etiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/17 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000028 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Jan-Feb;60(1):134-6. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000028.
