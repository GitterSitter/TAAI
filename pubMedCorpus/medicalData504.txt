Although the availability of      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may increase the number of transplants      performed by reducing deaths while waiting, it may also lead to increased      morbidity post-transplantation. We sought to assess the impact of mechanical      support on post-transplant outcomes in a single centre. METHODS: We assessed the       outcomes of paediatric (age </=16 years) heart transplantation in a single unit      in the era of mechanical support (1998-2012) by retrospective cohort study.      Outcomes before (1998-2005) and after (2005-2012) the routine use of the Berlin      Heart EXCOR device were contrasted. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients underwent      heart transplantation during this period. The diagnosis was dilated      cardiomyopathy in 61.7%, two-ventricle CHD in 11.4%, single ventricle CHD in      16.8% and miscellaneous in 10.1%. Sixty-nine (41%) were bridged to transplant by       mechanical support; with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 19 (28%),      ventricular assist device in 40 (58%) and a combination in 10 (14.0%).      Post-transplant mortality at 30 days was significantly greater in those supported      by MCS than without (7 vs 1%, P < 0.05), and a greater proportion of patients had      neurological (23 vs 8%, P < 0.01) and major respiratory sequelae (20 vs 4%, P <      0.001). There was no significant increase in the need for post-transplant      mechanical support (10 vs 6%, P = 0.3) in those supported prior to transplant.      The number of transplants performed increased from 67 in 1998-2005 to 100 in the       most recent era (2005-2012), and an increased proportion of these patients have      been supported mechanically prior to transplantation (51 vs 27%, P < 0.01).      CONCLUSION: Along with strategies to increase donor utilization, MCS has allowed       an increase in cardiac transplant activity at the expense of a higher early      mortality and morbidity.FAU - Botha, PhilAU  - Botha PAD  - Department of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne,       UK.FAU - Solana, RuthAU  - Solana RFAU - Cassidy, JaneAU  - Cassidy JFAU - Parry, GarethAU  - Parry GFAU - Kirk, RichardAU  - Kirk RFAU - Hasan, AsifAU  - Hasan AFAU - Griselli, MassimoAU  - Griselli MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130502PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Nov;44(5):840-2.
