It is crucial to know the status of      end-organ perfusion, which may require invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a      systemic arterial and pulmonary artery catheter. Depending on the indication for       LVAD support (bridge to decision or cardiac transplantation vs destination      therapy), it is important to readdress goals of care with the patient (if      possible) and their family after major events have occurred that challenge the      survival of the patient.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
