Continuous axial-flow LVAD therapy      provides effective haemodynamic support for the failing left ventricle, improving      both the clinical functional status and quality of life. Echocardiographers must       develop a systematic approach to echocardiographic assessment of LVAD      implantation and post-LVAD implant cardiac morphology and physiology. This      approach must include the evaluation of left and right heart chamber morphology      and physiology and the anatomy and physiology of the inflow and outflow cannulas       and the rotor pump, and the determination of the degree of tricuspid      regurgitation and the presence of interatrial shunts and aortic regurgitation.      Collaboration among the echocardiography and HF/transplant teams is essential to       obtain this comprehensive evaluation. We outline a systematic approach to      evaluating patients with HF who have failed conventional therapy and require LVAD      therapy as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or destination therapy.FAU - Ammar, Khawaja AAU  - Ammar KAAD  - Aurora Cardiovascular Services, Aurora Sinai/Aurora St. Luke's Medical Centers,      University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 2801 W.
