Factors associated with this      occurrence of commissural fusion are unknown. The aim of this study was to      examine histological characteristics of cf-LVAD-induced commissural fusion in      relation to clinical variables. METHODS: Gross and histopathological examinations      were performed on 19 hearts from patients supported by either HeartMate II (n =      17) or HeartWare (n = 2) cf-LVADs and related to clinical characteristics (14      heart transplantation, 5 autopsy). RESULTS: Eleven of the 19 (58%) aortic valves       showed fusion of single or multiple commissures (total fusion length 11 mm [4-20]      (median [interquartile range]) per valve), some leading to noticeable nodular      displacements or considerable lumen diameter narrowing. Multiple fenestrations      were observed in one valve. Histopathological examination confirmed commissural      fusion, with varying changes in valve layer structure without evidence of      inflammatory infiltration at the site of fusion. Commissural fusion was      associated with continuous aortic valve closure during cf-LVAD support (P =      0.03). LVAD-induced aortic valve insufficiency developed in all patients with      commissural fusion and in 67% of patients without fusion. Age, duration of      cf-LVAD support and aetiology of heart failure (ischaemic vs dilated      cardiomyopathy) were not associated with the degree of fusion. CONCLUSIONS:      Aortic valve commissural fusion after support with cf-LVADs is a non-inflammatory      process leading to changes in valve layer structure that can be observed in >50%       of cf-LVAD patients. This is the first study showing that patients receiving full      cf-LVAD support without opening of the valve have a significantly higher risk of       developing commissural fusion than patients on partial support.FAU - Martina, Jerson RAU  - Martina JRAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht,      Netherlands.FAU - Schipper, Marguerite E IAU  - Schipper MEFAU - de Jonge, NicolaasAU  - de Jonge NFAU - Ramjankhan, FaizAU  - Ramjankhan FFAU - de Weger, Roel AAU  - de Weger RAFAU - Lahpor, Jaap RAU  - Lahpor JRFAU - Vink, AryanAU  - Vink ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130624PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aortic Valve/*pathologyMH  - Aortic Valve Insufficiency/*etiology/pathologyMH  - AutopsyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/pathology/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC3781792OID - NLM: PMC3781792OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Aortic stenosisOT  - Aortic valveOT  - Rotary blood pumpEDAT- 2013/06/27 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/27 06:00PHST- 2013/06/24 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt263 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt263 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2013 Oct;17(4):616-24. doi:      10.1093/icvts/ivt263.
