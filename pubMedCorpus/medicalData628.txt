The aim of this study was to investigate the effects       of Iva during MU, in a rodent model of HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the      chronic effects (4 weeks) of Iva (10 mg/kg/day) alone and in combination with MU       [induced by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)] on whole-heart      and cellular structure, function, and excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in a       rodent (rat) model of HF, 12 weeks post-left coronary artery (LCA) ligation.      Effects of Iva were compared with those of beta-blockade using metoprolol [(Met),      250 mg/kg/day]. Iva, but not Met, reversed myocardial fibrosis, alone and in      combination with MU. MU-induced restoration of deranged E-C coupling was enhanced      by Iva to a greater extent than Met: both Iva and Met enhanced the recovery of      the Ca(2+) transient amplitude and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)      content, but Iva alone maintained MU-induced normalization of L-type Ca(2+)      current and t-tubule abnormalities. Met prevented MU-induced reduction in the      myocardial size (myocardial atrophy); Iva had no effect on this parameter.      CONCLUSION: Iva shows beneficial structural and E-C coupling effects during MU:      Iva reverses myocardial fibrosis and enhances the restoration of deranged E-C      coupling, displaying more beneficial effects than that of Met. These results      suggest that Iva may prove effective in enhancing functional recovery in heart      failure patients receiving LVAD therapy.FAU - Navaratnarajah, ManorajAU  - Navaratnarajah MAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Middlesex, Harefield UB9 6JH, UK.FAU - Ibrahim, MichaelAU  - Ibrahim MFAU - Siedlecka, UrszulaAU  - Siedlecka UFAU - van Doorn, CarinAU  - van Doorn CFAU - Shah, AdarshAU  - Shah AFAU - Gandhi, AjayAU  - Gandhi AFAU - Dias, PriyanthiAU  - Dias PFAU - Sarathchandra, PadminiAU  - Sarathchandra PFAU - Yacoub, Magdi HAU  - Yacoub MHFAU - Terracciano, Cesare MAU  - Terracciano CMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20121018PL  - EnglandTA  - Cardiovasc ResJT  - Cardiovascular researchJID - 0077427RN  - 0 (Benzazepines)RN  - 0 (Calcium Channels, L-Type)RN  - 3H48L0LPZQ (ivabradine)RN  - GEB06NHM23 (Metoprolol)RN  - SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - AtrophyMH  - Benzazepines/*pharmacology/therapeutic useMH  - Calcium/metabolismMH  - Calcium Channels, L-Type/physiologyMH  - Excitation Contraction Coupling/drug effectsMH  - FibrosisMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Rate/drug effectsMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Metoprolol/pharmacologyMH  - Myocardium/pathologyMH  - RatsMH  - Ventricular Remodeling/*drug effectsEDAT- 2012/10/20 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/03 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/20 06:00PHST- 2012/10/18 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2012/11/09 [aheadofprint]AID - cvs318 [pii]AID - 10.1093/cvr/cvs318 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Cardiovasc Res. 2013 Feb 1;97(2):230-9. doi: 10.1093/cvr/cvs318.
