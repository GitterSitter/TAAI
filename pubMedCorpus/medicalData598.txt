Medical therapies have      proven efficacious, but only a small number of pharmacological options are in      development. When patients cease to respond adequately to optimal medical      therapy, cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to improve symptoms,      reduce hospitalizations, promote reverse remodelling, and decrease mortality.      However, challenges remain in identifying the ideal recipients for this therapy.       The field of mechanical circulatory support has seen immense growth since the      early 2000s, and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have transitioned over      the past decade from large, pulsatile devices to smaller, more-compact,      continuous-flow devices. Infections and haematological issues are still important      areas that need to be addressed. Whereas LVADs were once approved only for      'bridge to transplantation', these devices are now used as destination therapy      for critically ill patients with HF, allowing these individuals to return to the       community. A host of novel strategies, including cardiac contractility      modulation, implantable haemodynamic-monitoring devices, and phrenic and vagus      nerve stimulation, are under investigation and might have an impact on the future      care of patients with chronic HF.FAU - Abraham, William TAU  - Abraham WTAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Ohio State University, 473 West 12th      Avenue, Room 110P, Columbus, OH 43210-1252, USA. william.abraham@osumc.eduFAU - Smith, Sakima AAU  - Smith SALA  - engGR  - UL1 TR000090/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121211PL  - EnglandTA  - Nat Rev CardiolJT  - Nature reviews.
