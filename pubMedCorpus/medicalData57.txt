They offer several      advantages over previously used pulsatile-flow LVADs, including improved      durability, less surgical trauma, higher energy efficiency, and lower      thrombogenicity. These benefits translate into better survival, lower frequency      of adverse events, improved quality of life, and higher functional capacity of      patients. However, mounting evidence shows unanticipated consequences of      continuous-flow support, such as acquired aortic valve insufficiency and acquired      von Willebrand syndrome. In this review article we discuss current evidence on      differences between continuous and pulsatile mechanical circulatory support, with      a focus on clinical implications and potential benefits of pulsatile flow.FAU - Baric, DavorAU  - Baric DAD  - Davor Baric, Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Dubrava      University Hospital, Avenija Gojka Suska 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, dbaric@kbd.hr.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - CroatiaTA  - Croat Med JJT  - Croatian medical journalJID - 9424324SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Pulsatile FlowMH  - Quality of LifePMC - PMC4295069OID - NLM: PMC4295069EDAT- 2015/01/07 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/22 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/07 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Croat Med J. 2014 Dec;55(6):609-20.
