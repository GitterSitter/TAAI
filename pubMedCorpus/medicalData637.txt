Studies have suggested that outcomes after VAD implantation may be      dependent on institutional procedural volume, and outcome data from      non-transplant centres are lacking. This study reviews the outcomes of patients      who received a long-term VAD at our centre to determine if these devices can be      safely implanted at tertiary care, low-volume, non-transplant centres. METHODS:      We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study, examining the clinical      outcomes of consecutive patients who received a long-term VAD over a 42-month      period. RESULTS: During the study period 73 patients required MCS, of whom 16      received a long-term VAD. This select group had a mean Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile of 1.6 (0.9) and      before implantation 94% required at least 1 inotropic medication, 69% had      suffered a cardiac arrest, 63% required an intra-aortic balloon pump, 69%      required mechanical ventilation, and 44% required short-term MCS. The primary      outcome of survival to transplant or ongoing MCS at 1 year was achieved in 75% of      patients. Operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital survival were 100%,      88%, and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term VADs can be implanted at      low-volume, nontransplant centres with survival rates comparable with      contemporary clinical trials. Availability of a specialty trained      multidisciplinary team with expertise in short-term and long-term MCS options      facilitates appropriate patient selection and might be more important than      institutional volume in determining outcomes after implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
