We performed a multicentre      analysis of the real world outcomes associated with its use. METHODS: Between May      2010 and January 2013, 4 Canadian centres inserted a total of 72 HVADs in 71      patients. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively for the       1-year estimate of the principal outcome of transplant, explant for recovery, or       death in patients who had a bridge to transplantation indication. Adverse event      rates were estimated as events per patient-year (PPY). RESULTS: In the 67      patients who received the HVAD with the indication of bridge to transplant, 26      (38.8%) received a successful transplant, 2 (3%) received an explant for      recovery, and 10 (14.9%) patients died during support. Median follow-up time with      the HVAD was 6.9 months (range, 2 days to 30.4 months). Despite having 74% of the      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support       (INTERMACS) scores of level 1 and 2 at the time of implantation, the rate      estimate for survival at 1 year was 86.3% (95% confidence interval, 76.7-93.3).      With 48.2 total patient years of support, the rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic      strokes were 0.21 and 0.19 events PPY, respectively. Women made up 40% of the      cohort and an adverse neurologic event occurred with an event rate of 0.38 PPY in      women. CONCLUSIONS: The HVAD adequately supports acutely ill heart failure      patients until the time of transplant or recovery. A high incidence of adverse      neurologic outcomes might be related to the large percentage of female patients,       the high INTERMACS levels, or unknown factors; further surveillance is required.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
