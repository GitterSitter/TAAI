BACKGROUND: Patients with left ventricular      assist devices (LVADs) are given 30 days of elective status 1A time. This      allowance may create competition for organs between stable LVAD-supported      registrants and less stable registrants listed status 1A or 1B. METHODS: The      Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for all status      1A and 1B listings between 2005 and 2010. Cox models were used to estimate the      relative and absolute risk of adverse events (death or delisting as too ill)      during status 1A or 1B listing. RESULTS: Status 1A registrants supported with      dual inotropes and right heart monitoring had a higher risk of adverse events      compared to those supported with implanted LVADs using elective 1A time (hazard      ratio: 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.8 to 5.7). The 30-day risk of events was      1% (95% confidence interval: 0.1% to 3%) for implanted LVADs using elective 1A      time and 6% (95% confidence interval: 4% to 8%) for dual inotrope support.      Registrants listed with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices had a higher      risk of adverse events (hazard ratio: 9.1; p < 0.0001) compared with registrants       with implanted LVADs using elective 1A time. The odds of transplant were higher      for implanted LVADs (odds ratio: 1.5; p < 0.0001) compared with dual-inotrope and      intra-aortic balloon pump support. CONCLUSIONS: The historic allowance for 30      days of elective status 1A time for implanted LVADs creates disparities in risk      among status 1A registrants. The allowance of 30 days of elective status 1A time       should not be allocated to stable registrants with implanted LVADs. Registrants      supported with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices should be listed status      1A indefinitely.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
