METHODS: A total of 7,404       CF-LVAD patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) from 134 participating institutions were analyzed      from 4 distinct regions: Northeast, 2,605 (35%); Midwest, 2,210 (30%); West, 973       (13%); and South, 1,616 (22%). RESULTS: At baseline, patients in the Northeast      and South were more likely to have INTERMACS risk profiles 1 and 2. A      bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy was more common in the Northeast (31.7%;      West, 18.5%; South, 26.9%; Midwest, 25.5%; p < 0.0001). In contrast, destination       therapy (DT) was more likely in the South (40.6%; Northeast, 32.3%; Midwest,      27.3%; West, 27.3%; p < 0.0001). Although all regions showed a high 1-year      survival rate, some regional differences in long-term mortality were observed.      Notably, survival beyond 1 year after LVAD implant was significantly lower in the      South. However, when stratified by device strategy, no significant differences in      survival for BTT or DT patients were found among the regions. Finally, with the      exception of right ventricular failure, which was more common in the South, no      other significant differences in causes of death were observed among the regions.      CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in clinical profile and LVAD strategy exist in       the United States. Despite an overall high survival rate at 1 year, differences      in mortality among the regions were noted. The lower survival rate in the South      may be attributed to patient characteristics and higher use of LVAD as DT.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
