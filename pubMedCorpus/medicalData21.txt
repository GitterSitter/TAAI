The aim of the study was to address the weaning procedure,      analyzing the hemodynamic and echocardiographic picture of patients weaned and to      identify predictors of poor outcome among this population. DESIGN: Observational       study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-nine VA      ECMO cases. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-nine      patients (38%) were weaned, 7 (5.4%) were bridged to a ventricular assist device,      and 6 (5.2%) were listed for heart transplantation. Weaned patients showed a      significant increase of pulse pressure (35 [0-50] mmHg before ECMO, 59 [53-67]      mmHg at weaning, 61 [51-76] mmHg after ECMO (p<0.001]) and reduction of dose of      inotropes (inotropic score [as defined in the text] 20 [14-40] before ECMO, 10      [3-15] at weaning, and 10 [5-15] after ECMO, p<0.001). Left ventricular ejection       fraction (LVEF) increased from 19 (0-22.5)% before ECMO to 35 (22-55)% after ECMO      (p<0.001). A significant improvement of right ventricular (RV) function was      observed in weaned patients (RV dysfunction from 52% to 21%, p<0.001). Among      weaned patients, 15 (31%) died. Patients who died after weaning had longer ECMO      duration compared to discharged patients (8 [5-11] v 4 [2-6] days, p = 0.01) and       more transfusions (22 [10-37] v 7 [0.5-15] units, p = 0.02); survival was lower      in patients with central ECMO (postcardiotomy) compared to peripheral ECMO (p =      0.045). Mortality was higher in those with persistence of RV failure, continuous       venovenous hemofiltration, higher inotropic score, lower systolic pressure, or      higher leucocyte count at weaning. CONCLUSIONS: Successful weaning from ECMO is a      multifaceted process, which encompasses consistent recovery of myocardial and      end-organ function; LVEF, though improved, is still low at weaning. Hospital      survival is correlated significantly to the duration of ECMO support and to      bleeding complications.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
