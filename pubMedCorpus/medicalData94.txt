Clinicians have, therefore, turned to mechanical means of circulatory       support. At present, a broad range of devices are available, which may be      extracorporeal, implantable, or percutaneous; temporary or long term. Although      counter pulsation provided by intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and comprehensive       mechanical support for both the systemic and the pulmonary circulation through      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain a major tool of acute care in      patients with cardiogenic shock, both before and after surgical or percutaneous      intervention, the development of devices such as the Impella or the Tandemheart      allows less invasive forms of temporary support. On the other hand, concerning      mid-, or long-term support, left ventricular assist devices have evolved from a      last resort life-saving therapy to a well-established viable alternative for      thousands of heart failure patients caused by the shortage of donor organs      available for transplantation. The optimal selection of the assist device is      based on the initial consideration according to hemodynamic situation,      comorbidities, intended time of use and therapeutic options. The present article       offers an update on currently available mechanical circulatory support systems      (MCSS) for short and long-term use as well as an insight into future      perspectives.FAU - Ferrari, MarkusAU  - Ferrari MAD  - Clinic of Internal Medicine 1, HSK, Klinikum der Landeshauptstadt Wiesbaden und      der HELIOS Kliniken Gruppe, Wiesbaden, Germany.FAU - Kruzliak, PeterAU  - Kruzliak PFAU - Spiliopoulos, KyriakosAU  - Spiliopoulos KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20141028PL  - GermanyTA  - Clin Res CardiolJT  - Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac SocietyJID - 101264123SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/10/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/29 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/29 06:00PHST- 2014/03/11 [received]PHST- 2014/10/14 [accepted]PHST- 2014/10/28 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00392-014-0771-6 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Res Cardiol. 2015 Feb;104(2):95-111. doi: 10.1007/s00392-014-0771-6.
