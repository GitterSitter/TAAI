We report two cases of mechanical assistance in      patients with SV physiology: a 2-year old male with hypoplastic left heart      syndrome who underwent Norwood Stage I and II followed by HF and a 4-year old      female with a univentricular heart who developed a severe right ventricular      dysfunction 2 years after a cavopulmonary shunt. Mechanical support utilizing      ventricular assist devices (VADs) is considered a valid tool to bridge patients      with congestive heart failure to either OHT or to recovery. Increasing experience      and improved outcomes utilizing this technology in children with biventricular      hearts have led to considering employing these devices in failing SV treatment.      We present 2 cases of terminally ill children with SV who were assisted with a      VAD.FAU - Brancaccio, GianlucaAU  - Brancaccio GAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Piazza S.
