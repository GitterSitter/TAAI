Between January 2002 and January 2012, all patients <18 years of age who      underwent the implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR at Bambino Gesu Children's      Hospital were included. A total of 25 patients were included in this study.      Median age and weight at implantation were 22.4 months (range 3.6-154.2) and 10      kg (range 4.5-36), respectively. Diagnosis included cardiomyopathy (n = 20) and      congenital heart disease (n = 5). Eleven patients received atrial cannulation.      Nine patients underwent biventricular assist device support. Seven patients      underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before the implantation of the      EXCOR VAD. Median duration of VAD support was 51 days (range 2-167). Nine      patients had evidence of acute BI including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 5) and      cerebral ischemia (n = 4). Freedom from BI at 30, 60, and 90 days from VAD      implantation was 80.7, 69.9, and 43.3%, respectively. Weight <10 kg at      implantation was significantly associated with BI. BI is a frequent complication       among children supported with EXCOR VAD and is associated with lower weight at      implantation. However, our data do not support the association between size and      BI. Future prospective multicenter studies are warranted to further help      understand the etiology and the impact of BI and to improve functional outcomes      for children undergoing EXCOR VAD mechanical support.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs.FAU - Polito, AngeloAU  - Polito AAD  - Department of Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery and , Bambino Gesu Pediatric      Hospital, Rome, Italy.FAU - Netto, RobertaAU  - Netto RFAU - Soldati, MassimilianoAU  - Soldati MFAU - Brancaccio, GianlucaAU  - Brancaccio GFAU - Grutter, GiorgiaAU  - Grutter GFAU - Amodeo, AntonioAU  - Amodeo AFAU - Ricci, ZaccariaAU  - Ricci ZFAU - Morelli, StefanoAU  - Morelli SFAU - Cogo, PaolaAU  - Cogo PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130405PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Brain Ischemia/*etiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - InfantMH  - Intracranial Hemorrhages/*etiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Risk FactorsOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Brain injuryOT  - Heart failureOT  - PediatricOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/04/09 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/13 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/09 06:00PHST- 2013/04/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12075 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2013 Oct;37(10):851-6. doi: 10.1111/aor.12075.
