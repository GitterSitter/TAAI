Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a major      role in the clinical decision making during insertion of the devices and in the      post-operative management of these patients. The detection of structural and      device-related mechanical abnormalities is critical for optimal functioning of      assist device. In this review article, we describe the usefulness of TEE for      optimal perioperative management of patients presenting for HeartWare LVAD      insertion.FAU - Patangi, Sanjay OrathiAU  - Patangi SOAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia, Freeman Hospital, High Heaton,      Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, United Kingdom.FAU - George, AnthonyAU  - George AFAU - Pauli, HenningAU  - Pauli HFAU - O'Leary, DenisAU  - O'Leary DFAU - Roysam, ChandrikaAU  - Roysam CFAU - Butt, TanveerAU  - Butt TFAU - Schueler, StephanAU  - Schueler SFAU - Prabhu, MaheshAU  - Prabhu MFAU - MacGowan, GuyAU  - MacGowan GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - IndiaTA  - Ann Card AnaesthJT  - Annals of cardiac anaesthesiaJID - 9815987SB  - IMCIN - Ann Card Anaesth. 2013 Oct-Dec;16(4):235-7.
