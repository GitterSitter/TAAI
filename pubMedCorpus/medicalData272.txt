Despite improvement in morbidity and mortality from use of these      devices, quality of life may be limited by cataract. Access to cataract surgery      in this predominantly elderly population is essential but limited by      unfamiliarity with these devices. We describe phacoemulsification and intraocular      lens implantation in 2 patients with LVADs. The patients had extensive      preoperative cardiology evaluations and were instructed to continue warfarin      through the day of surgery. Monitored sedation was used with fentanyl and      midazolam. Both patients experienced significant improvement in visual acuity and      quality of life. Neither experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability.      Cataract surgery may be safely performed in patients with LVAD support when      adequate monitoring resources are available.
