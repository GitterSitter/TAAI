Heart      transplantation can be postponed and for certain patients even replaced by      smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Mechanical support      of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate haemodynamic stabilization and       recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in these severely ill patients.      These new devices may be of great help to bridge patients until a suitable      cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed as definitive treatment for      patients who do not qualify for transplantation. Main indications for LVAD      implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to transplantation or destination      therapy. An LVAD may be an important tool for patients with an expected prolonged      period on the waiting list, for instance those with blood group O or B, with high      or low body weight and those with potentially reversible secondary organ failure       and pulmonary artery hypertension. However, LVAD implantation means an additional      heart operation with inherent perioperative risks and complications during the      waiting period. Finally, cardiac transplantation in patients with prior      implantation of an LVAD represents a surgical challenge. The care of patients      after the implantation of miniaturized LVADs, such as the HeartWare(R) system,      seems to be easier than following pulsatile devices. The explantation of such      devices at the time of transplantation is technically more comfortable than after      HeartMate II implantation.FAU - Carrel, ThierryAU  - Carrel TAD  - Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital Berne, Berne, Switzerland.FAU - Englberger, LarsAU  - Englberger LFAU - Kadner, AlexanderAU  - Kadner AFAU - Mohacsi, PaulAU  - Mohacsi PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Multimed Man Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Multimedia manual of cardiothoracic surgery : MMCTS / European Association for      Cardio-Thoracic SurgeryJID - 101495626SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart failureOT  - HeartWare(R) systemOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2014/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/14 06:00AID - mmt010 [pii]AID - 10.1093/mmcts/mmt010 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Multimed Man Cardiothorac Surg. 2013;2013:mmt010. doi: 10.1093/mmcts/mmt010.
