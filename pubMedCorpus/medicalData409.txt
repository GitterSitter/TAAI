Heart transplant or long-term ventricular assist device.PG  - 276-81LID - 10.1111/aor.12157 [doi]AB  - Chronic heart failure is a progressive and eventually fatal illness. Although the      disease cannot be cured and treatment is symptom oriented, most of the patients      benefit from optimum medical treatment. Patients with rapid deterioration in      chronic advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment need inotropic      support and may need intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain circulatory support,      which of course cannot be prolonged beyond a certain limit. The outcome of heart       transplant and long-term ventricular assist device (VAD) in such patients is      poor. The short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) offered to such      patients not only provides effective circulatory support and stabilizes them      hemodynamically, but also halts the ensuing or reverts the established end-organ       failure. As the name suggests, the short-term MCS offers support for the short      term, usually less than a month. Although some patients with acute heart failure       experience recovery of myocardial function with short-term MCS support, others      become dependent. These patients, stabilized and "stuck" with short-term MCS, can      be "rescued" with long-term VAD or heart transplantation. Both the procedures,      when done in this special situation, have their inherent advantages,      disadvantages, and complications and hence need the careful consideration about      the choice of the procedure. We have tried to elucidate this situation by      considering the advantages and disadvantages of both options.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs      and Transplantation.FAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation & Mechanical Support, Royal Brompton      & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.FAU - Zych, BartlomiejAU  - Zych BFAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130827PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - End-stage heart failureOT  - Heart transplantationOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/08/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/29 06:00PHST- 2013/08/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12157 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2014 Apr;38(4):276-81. doi: 10.1111/aor.12157.
