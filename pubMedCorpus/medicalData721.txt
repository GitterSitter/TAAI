We have used the CentriMag VAD as a bridge to decision device. We      describe our experience with device placement, use and outcomes. METHODS: This is      a retrospective study of all patients who underwent CentriMag placement at our      institution from January 2007 to August 2009. Sixty-three patients had placement       of a CentriMag device, with 43% (n = 27) of these being placed due to failure of       medical management. These cases were the focus of our study. RESULTS: Primary      diagnoses were ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 17), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 7)      or other (n = 3). Mean age was 47.1 (range 7 to 72) years. Prior to implant, 85%       of patients were on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, 70% were on      vasopressors, and 44% were on more than one inotrope. INTERMACS score was 1 in      67% of patients and 2 in 33% of patients. Six patients were bridged to a      long-term device, 8 to transplantation and 10 to recovery. Eighty-nine percent      (24 of 27) of patients survived to explant and 74% (20 of 27) survived to      hospital discharge, with a 1-year survival of 68%. Thromboembolic complications      occurred in 10 patients, including 6 strokes. Compared with patients who survived      to discharge, those who died had a significantly higher body mass index (30.8 vs       24.1 kg/m(2), p = 0.003). Survivors to discharge demonstrated significant      improvements in hepatic and renal function over the course of device support      while non-survivors did not. CONCLUSIONS: The CentriMag demonstrates promising      results when used in patients with acute heart failure refractory to medical      management.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
