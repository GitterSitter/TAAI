METHODS: All      HeartMate II left ventricular assist device driveline dysfunctions reported to      Thoratec Corporation were retrospectively reviewed. The location and severity of       driveline failures and their association with adverse clinical outcomes were      examined. Also, the effect of design modifications was evaluated. RESULTS:      Between 2004 and October 2012, 12,969 HeartMate II pumps were implanted      worldwide. The incidence of percutaneous lead dysfunction was 1,418 events      occurring in 1,198 pumps (9.2% of pumps) over a cumulative support period of      13,932 patient-years (maximum, 8 years). Lead failure was mostly in the      externalized part of the cable (87.2%). Lead dysfunction was managed by clamshell      reinforcement of the external connector strain relief or by tape or silicone      cable reinforcement in 76% of cases. Mortality or significant morbidity,      including pump exchange or urgent transplant, or more complex cable repair      occurred in 2.3% of all implanted pumps. The cumulative incidence of lead      failures leading to major adverse clinical events has decreased with two lead      design revisions: at 18 months postimplantation, the incidence was 6.2%+/-1.2%      for the original design versus 2.2%+/-0.5% for the latest design change      introduced in 2010 (log-rank p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lead failures remain an      important factor in the durability of left ventricular assist devices during      long-term support. Most lead failures in the HeartMate II occurred in the      externalized portion of the driveline, suggesting lead fatigue. The incidence of       both internal and external lead failures has diminished since 2004 with      improvements in lead design.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
