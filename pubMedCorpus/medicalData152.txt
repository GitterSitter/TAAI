We evaluated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C      compared with established markers of renal function in patients with heart      failure (HF) because they might improve prognostic assessment of patients with      HF. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 40 patients with stable HF (age:      58 +/- 8 years, body mass index [BMI]: 28.4 +/- 6.4 kg/m(2)), 40 HF patients      undergoing ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation (age: 53 +/- 11 years,      BMI: 26.8 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2)), 40 patients undergoing VAD removal at cardiac      transplantation, and 24 controls (age: 48 +/- 7 years, BMI: 29.4 +/- 4.2      kg/m(2)). Clinical data were collected from institutional medical records. NGAL      and cystatin C levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the Modification of       Diet in Renal Disease formula. RESULTS: Patients with stable HF showed elevated      NGAL and cystatin C levels compared with controls (NGAL: 114.9 +/- 48.3 ng/mL vs       72.0 +/- 36.6 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; cystatin C: 1490.4 +/- 576.1 ng/mL vs 954.7 +/-       414.2 ng/mL, p = 0.0026). Unlike cystatin C, NGAL increased in advanced HF      patients requiring VAD implantation (158.7 +/- 74.8 ng/mL, p < 0.001). On VAD      support, NGAL levels decreased (127.1 +/- 80.4 ng/mL, p = 0.034). NGAL was higher      in patients who developed right ventricular failure (187.8 +/- 66.0 vs 130.9 +/-       67.0 ng/mL, p = 0.03) and irreversible renal dysfunction (190.0 +/- 73.8 ng/mL vs      133.8 +/- 54.2 ng/mL, p < 0.05), whereas cystatin C, creatinine, and eGFR were      not different. NGAL correlated with eGFR (r = -0.2188, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:      NGAL levels correlate with HF severity and hemodynamic improvement after VAD      placement. Our findings suggest a role of this novel biomarker as a marker of      severity and prognosis in patients with HF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
