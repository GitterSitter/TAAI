Hepatic as well as nonhepatic iron overload is associated with       increased infectious and postoperative complications, including cardiac      dysfunction. In this case report, we describe a cirrhotic patient with alpha 1      antitrypsin deficiency and nonhereditary hemochromatosis (non-HFE) that developed      cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support for twenty days after       liver transplant. Upon further investigation, she was found to have significant      iron deposition in both the liver and heart biopsies. Her heart regained complete      and sustained recovery following ten days of mechanical biventricular support.      This case highlights the importance of preoperatively recognizing extrahepatic      iron deposition in patients referred for liver transplantation irrespective of      etiology of liver disease as this may prevent postoperative complications.FAU - Jermyn, RitaAU  - Jermyn RAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7249-7755AD  - Division of Heart Failure, Department of Cardiology, Montefiore Medical Center,      Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.FAU - Soe, EieiAU  - Soe EAD  - Division of Hepatology, Department of Gastroenterology, Montefiore Medical      Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.FAU - D'Alessandro, DavidAU  - D'Alessandro DAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein       College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.FAU - Shin, JuliaAU  - Shin JAD  - Division of Heart Failure, Department of Cardiology, Montefiore Medical Center,      Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.FAU - Jakobleff, WilliamAU  - Jakobleff WAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein       College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.FAU - Schwartz, DanielAU  - Schwartz DAD  - Department of Pathology, Montefiore Medical Center, USA.FAU - Kinkhabwala, MilanAU  - Kinkhabwala MAD  - Division of Hepatology, Department of Gastroenterology, Montefiore Medical      Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.FAU - Gaglio, Paul JAU  - Gaglio PJAD  - Division of Hepatology, Department of Gastroenterology, Montefiore Medical      Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20141109PL  - United StatesTA  - Case Rep TransplantJT  - Case reports in transplantationJID - 101591863PMC - PMC4241562OID - NLM: PMC4241562EDAT- 2014/11/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/29 06:01CRDT- 2014/11/29 06:00PHST- 2014/07/28 [received]PHST- 2014/10/17 [accepted]PHST- 2014/11/09 [epublish]AID - 10.1155/2014/946961 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Case Rep Transplant. 2014;2014:946961. doi: 10.1155/2014/946961.
