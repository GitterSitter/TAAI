METHODS: Between November 1, 2003 and December 1, 2012, we      implanted the HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD in 338 patients, either for      bridging to heart transplantation or for destination therapy. Twenty-three of      these patients (19 men and 4 women; mean age, 47 +/- 16 years) had advanced      hepatic dysfunction, as characterized by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or      aspartate transaminase (AST) levels five times normal; serum total bilirubin      levels three times normal; and/or necessity for a liver biopsy before or during      device implantation. Of this group, 17 patients received the LVAD as a bridge to       transplantation, and six patients received it for destination therapy. RESULTS:      Nine of the 23 patients required either a transjugular or a core liver biopsy      during LVAD implantation. Three patients died within the first postoperative      month; the 20 surviving patients had significant improvements in their hepatic      parameters. The ALT decreased from 238 +/- 296 to 27 +/- 13 U/L (p = 0.022), AST       decreased from 209 +/- 199 to 29 +/- 8 U/L (p = 0.009), and total bilirubin level      decreased from 6.9 +/- 6.0 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/dL (p = 0.044). The serum albumin      level increased from 3.2 +/- 0.6 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 g/dL (p = 0.003), and creatinine       clearance increased from 77.6 +/- 35.2 to 110.2 +/- 35.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p =      0.101). CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD support may significantly improve      hepatic function, allowing patients with poor preimplant liver function to become      better candidates for heart transplantation.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Demirozu, Zumrut TAU  - Demirozu ZTAD  - Department of Cardiopulmonary Transplantation, Texas Heart Institute, Houston,      Texas; Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute, Houston, Texas.FAU - Hernandez, RubenAU  - Hernandez RFAU - Mallidi, Hari RAU  - Mallidi HRFAU - Singh, Steve KAU  - Singh SKFAU - Radovancevic, RajkoAU  - Radovancevic RFAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMFAU - Etheridge, Whitson BAU  - Etheridge WBFAU - Cohn, William EAU  - Cohn WEFAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140319PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)RN  - EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)RN  - RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Alanine Transaminase/bloodMH  - Aspartate Aminotransferases/bloodMH  - Bilirubin/bloodMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Liver Diseases/*complications/diagnosis/*therapyMH  - Liver Function TestsMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Prostheses and ImplantsMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/03/20 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/02 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/20 06:00PHST- 2014/03/19 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/jocs.12318 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2014 May;29(3):419-23. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12318.
