The purpose of this study was to investigate      the effect of right heart unloading and respiratory support with a wearable      integrated artificial pump-lung (APL). METHODS: The APL device was placed      surgically between the right atrium and pulmonary artery in 7 sheep.      Anti-coagulation was performed with heparin infusion. The device's ability to      unload the right ventricle (RV) was investigated by echocardiograms and right      heart catheterization at different bypass flow rates. Hemodynamics and      echocardiographic data were evaluated. APL flow and gas transfer rates were also       measured at different device speeds. RESULTS: Hemodynamics remained stable during      APL support. There was no significant change in systemic blood pressure and      cardiac index. Central venous pressure, RV pressure, RV end-diastolic dimension      and RV ejection fraction were significantly decreased when APL device flow rate      approached 2 liters/min. Linear regression showed significant correlative trends       between the hemodynamic and cardiac indices and device speed. The oxygen transfer      rate increased with device speed. The oxygen saturation from the APL outlet was      fully saturated (>95%) during support. The impact of APL support on blood      elements (plasma free hemoglobin and platelet activation) was minimal.      CONCLUSIONS: APL device support significantly unloaded the RV with increasing      device speed. The device also provided stable hemodynamics and respiratory      support in terms of blood flow and oxygen transfer. The right heart unloading      performance of this wearable device needs to be evaluated further in an animal      model of right heart failure with long-term support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
