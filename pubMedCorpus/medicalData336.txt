Therefore, the development of a ventricular assist device (VAD)       specific to these cases is extremely important for therapeutic effectiveness. We       present 5 cases of severe heart failure that were managed by ventricular assist      device implantation, as a bridge to transplantation. METHODS: We examined the      clinical course of 5 patients (4 boys, 1 girl; mean age, 10.6 +/- 1.5 years;      range, 8-12 years) who underwent implantation of a pneumatic extracorporeal      ventricular assist device between February 2004 and May 2009. Four patients had      dilated cardiomyopathy and one had corrected transposition of the great arteries.      RESULTS: The mean period between onset of heart failure and ventricular assist      device implantation was 594 +/- 750 days (range, 94-1702 days), and the mean      duration of ventricular assist support was 112 +/- 98 days (range, 44-284 days).       Four patients underwent heart transplantation overseas and one died of cerebral      hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Careful management of pediatric VAD patients and      development of a device designed specifically for pediatric patients are      essential for improving clinical outcomes in the future.FAU - Komagamine, MasahideAU  - Komagamine MAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo -      Japan.FAU - Nishinaka, TomohiroAU  - Nishinaka TFAU - Iwata, YusukeAU  - Iwata YFAU - Tsukui, YukiAU  - Tsukui YFAU - Saito, SatoshiAU  - Saito SFAU - Yamazaki, KenjiAU  - Yamazaki KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131212PL  - ItalyTA  - Int J Artif OrgansJT  - The International journal of artificial organsJID - 7802649SB  - IMMH  - Age FactorsMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - MaleMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Time-to-TreatmentMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftEDAT- 2013/12/24 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/19 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/24 06:00PHST- 2013/12/23 [ppublish]PHST- 2013/12/12 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2013/08/22 [accepted]AID - E88E8654-60C4-4F43-877A-A858073C06D6 [pii]AID - 10.5301/ijao.5000263 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Artif Organs. 2013 Dec;36(12):887-91. doi: 10.5301/ijao.5000263.
