In patients with end-stage disease, mechanical circulatory support      may improve survival, quality of life, and serve as bridge to cardiac      transplantation. There are many ethical issues surrounding the use of mechanical       circulatory support in patients with CHD including the use of prospective and      randomized trials, proper oversight of new therapies, and transparency in      reporting. Additionally, there are ethical considerations relevant to the greater      society as these therapies are highly resource intensive in a resource-limited      society. This article will review the burden of disease of heart failure in      patients with CHD, the challenges of mechanical circulatory support and heart      transplantation, and the ethical considerations and problems that arise for this       population.FAU - Rossano, Joseph WAU  - Rossano JWAD  - Division of Cardiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School       of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.      rossanoj@email.chop.eduFAU - Kaufman, Beth DAU  - Kaufman BDFAU - Rame, J EduardoAU  - Rame JELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart SurgJT  - World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgeryJID - 101518415SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - *Ethics, MedicalMH  - Heart Defects, Congenital/*therapyMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*ethicsMH  - HumansOTO - NOTNLMOT  - BVADOT  - RVADOT  - TAH)OT  - circulatory assist devices (LVADOT  - congenital heart diseaseOT  - ethicsOT  - heart failureEDAT- 2013/06/27 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/18 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/27 06:00AID - 4/1/70 [pii]AID - 10.1177/2150135112469040 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg. 2013 Jan;4(1):70-4. doi:      10.1177/2150135112469040.
