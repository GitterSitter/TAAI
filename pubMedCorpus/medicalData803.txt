We reviewed our institutional experience with noncardiac surgical      procedures (NCPs) in patients supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs, n =       198) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 165) between July 1998 and      June 2010. In total, 64 NCPs were performed in 55 VAD patients and 14 NCPs in 14       ECMO patients. Thirty-day mortality was higher for the VAD compared with the ECMO      group (25 vs 86%; P < 0.001) and was greater for emergent compared with      nonemergent procedures (58 vs 19%; P < 0.001). Excluding tracheostomy, no      patients died within 30 days of a nonemergent procedure. Kaplan-Meier survival      showed a trend toward worse survival after NCP in ECMO patients, but NCP did not       alter survival in VAD patients. Fewer VAD patients were bridged to heart      transplantation when NCP was required, and time from device implantation to      transplant was significantly longer than for patients without NCP. In summary,      this is the largest series of NCPs on VAD support and the only series on ECMO.      Mortality is substantial for ECMO patients. Selected procedures can be performed       safely in VAD patients but will delay heart transplantation.FAU - Chestovich, Paul JAU  - Chestovich PJAD  - Department of Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles,      California 90095-6904, USA.FAU - Kwon, Murray HAU  - Kwon MHFAU - Cryer, H GillAU  - Cryer HGFAU - Tillou, AretiAU  - Tillou AFAU - Hiatt, Jonathan RAU  - Hiatt JRLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Am SurgJT  - The American surgeonJID - 0370522SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - California/epidemiologyMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/complications/mortality/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/etiologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Surgical Procedures, Operative/*mortalityMH  - Survival Rate/trendsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/12/01 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/18 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/01 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Am Surg. 2011 Oct;77(10):1314-7.
