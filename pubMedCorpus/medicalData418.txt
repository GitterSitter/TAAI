Although this is an important clinical entity, there are      only a handful of relevant studies on this topic in the literature. METHODS: From      2004 to 2012, 30 device exchanges (HeartMate II to HeartMate II) were performed.       Since June 2011, we have employed the subcostal approach for device exchange if      indicated. Sixteen patients underwent device exchange through a subcostal      approach (S group), whereas 14 patients had devices exchanged through a full      sternotomy (F group). Pre- and post-operative data were retrospectively reviewed.      RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline patient characteristics between the       two groups. Overall, mean duration between primary surgery and device exchange      was 425 +/- 407 days. Surgical indications included device thrombus/hemolysis (N       = 19), device malfunction (N = 9) and infection (N = 2). Cardiopulmonary bypass      time was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 40 +/- 23 minutes, F: 105 +/-      84 minutes; p < 0.05), and post-operative bleeding within 24 hours after surgery       was less in the S group (S: 362 +/- 367 ml, F: 1,286 +/- 971 ml; p < 0.05).      Length of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 4.6 +/- 1.8 days,      F: 8.2 +/- 4.9 days; p < 0.05). There was no difference in post-operative      complications, except for prolonged intubation (F: N = 6 [43%], S: N = 1 [6.3%];       p < 0.05). There were 3 deaths in the F group and 0 in the S group, with no      statistical difference (p = 0.09). Also, there was no significant difference in      other outcomes, including transplantation, device explantation and ongoing LVAD      support. CONCLUSIONS: A subcostal approach may be preferred for HeartMate II      device exchange if indicated.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
