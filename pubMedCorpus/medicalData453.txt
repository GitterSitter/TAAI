However, the course of      cognitive change in HF is not well characterized. The purpose of this systematic       review was to examine the available evidence longitudinal changes in cognitive      function in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: A literature search of several      electronic databases was performed. Studies published from January 1, 1980, to      September 30, 2012, that used validated measures to diagnose HF and assess      cognitive function >/=2x in adults with HF were eligible for inclusion. Change in      cognitive function was examined in the context of HF treatments applied (eg,      medication initiation, left ventricular assist device implantation), length of      follow-up, and comparison group. Fifteen studies met eligibility criteria.      Significant decline in cognitive function was noted among patients with HF      followed up for >1 year. Improvements in cognition were observed among patients      with HF undergoing interventions to improve cardiac function (eg, heart      transplantation) and among patients examined over short time periods (<1 year).      Studies comparing patients' cognition over time with their own baseline tended to      report improvements, whereas studies using a comparison group without HF tended      to report declines or stability in cognition over time among patients with HF.      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF are at increased risk for cognitive decline, but      this risk seems to be modifiable with cardiac treatment. Further research is      needed to identify the mechanisms that cause cognitive changes in HF.FAU - Hajduk, Alexandra MAU  - Hajduk AMAD  - Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Medical      School, Worcester, MA 01655, USA. alexandra.hajduk@umassmed.eduFAU - Kiefe, Catarina IAU  - Kiefe CIFAU - Person, Sharina DAU  - Person SDFAU - Gore, Joel GAU  - Gore JGFAU - Saczynski, Jane SAU  - Saczynski JSLA  - engGR  - K01AG033643/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - U01 HL105268/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - U01HL105268-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - U54RR026088/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - ReviewDEP - 20130709PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual OutcomesJT  - Circulation.
