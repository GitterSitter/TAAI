Pre-operative and post-operative      factors associated with NCs in patients with LVADs were investigated. METHODS: We      reviewed 307 consecutive patients undergoing LVAD surgery (167 HeartMate I and      140 HeartMate II devices) at Columbia University Medical Center between November       2000 and December 2010. Clinical characteristics and hemodynamic and laboratory      indexes were analyzed. NC was defined according to the Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support definition of neurologic dysfunction,      including transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic or hemorrhagic      cerebrovascular accident (CVA). RESULTS: NCs developed in 43 patients (14.0%) at       91.8 +/- 116.3 days post-operatively. The frequency of NC development was similar      in HeartMate I and II patients. Patients with NC showed a higher frequency of      pre-LVAD CVA history (27.9% vs 15.5%, p = 0.046), lower pre-operative sodium      (129.0 +/- 7.0 vs 132.1 +/- 8.1 mg/dl, p = 0.018) and albumin concentrations (3.5      +/- 0.7 vs 3.7 +/- 0.6 mg/dl, p = 0.049), lower post-operative hematocrit (34.9%       +/- 5.1% vs 37.8% +/- 6.1%, p = 0.0034), sodium (131.6 +/- 7.7 vs 134.4 +/- 6.4      mg/dl, p = 0.010) and albumin concentrations (3.7 +/- 0.5 vs 3.9 +/- 0.5 mg/dl, p      = 0.0016), and higher frequency of post-operative infection (39.5% vs 19.3%, p =       0.003) than those without NC. Multiple regression analysis revealed that CVA      history (odds ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.29; p = 0.011) and      post-operative infection (odds ratio, 2.99, 95% confidence interval, 1.16-10.49;       p = 0.011) were highly associated with NC development. The combination of CVA      history, pre-operative and post-operative sodium and albumin, and post-operative       hematocrit and infection could discriminate patients developing NCs with a      probability of 76.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Previous stroke, persistent malnutrition and      inflammation, severity of heart failure, and post-LVAD infections are key factors      associated with development of NCs after LVAD implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
