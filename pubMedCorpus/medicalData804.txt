METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight patients (4 male, 4 female) with Toyobo paracorporeal       LVAD underwent conversion to the third-generation centrifugal (DuraHeart) LVAD.      The apical cuff of the Toyobo was not exchanged because the size was the same as       that of the DuraHeart. All conversion operations were performed safely, but 3      patients who had infection of the Toyobo LVAD cannulation site prior to      conversion suffered later pocket infections and 1 patient died because of sepsis.      One patient underwent heart transplantation and 6 of 8 patients were awaiting      heart transplantation at home. CONCLUSIONS: Conversions from the Toyobo LVAD to      the DuraHeart LVAD were performed safely. Considering that implantable LVADs      provide superior long-term survival and quality of life, conversion is a      reasonable decision for Toyobo LVAD users in whom there are no infections.FAU - Yoshioka, DaisukeAU  - Yoshioka DAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Osaka University      Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.FAU - Sakaguchi, TaichiAU  - Sakaguchi TFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Miyagawa, ShigeruAU  - Miyagawa SFAU - Nishi, HiroyukiAU  - Nishi HFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Fukushima, SatsukiAU  - Fukushima SFAU - Ueno, TakayoshiAU  - Ueno TFAU - Kuratani, ToruAU  - Kuratani TFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20111127PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/microbiology/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureusMH  - *Prosthesis DesignMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/microbiology/*mortalityMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sepsis/mortalityMH  - Staphylococcal Infections/mortalityMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - *Waiting ListsEDAT- 2011/11/30 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/30 06:00CRDT- 2011/11/30 06:00PHST- 2011/11/27 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-11-0833 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2012;76(2):372-6.
