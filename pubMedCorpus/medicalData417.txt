Published data regarding LVAD-associated infections (LVADIs) are       limited by single-center experiences and use of nonstandardized definitions.      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 247 patients who underwent continuous-flow      LVAD implantation from January 2005 to December 2011 at Mayo Clinic campuses in      Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida. LVADIs were defined using the International      Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria. RESULTS: We identified 101      episodes of LVADI in 78 patients (32%) from this cohort. Mean age (+/- standard      deviation [SD]) was 57+/-15 years. The majority (94%) underwent Heartmate II      implantation, with 62% LVADs placed as destination therapy. The most common type       of LVADIs were driveline infections (47%), followed by bloodstream infections      (24% VAD related, and 22% non-VAD related). The most common causative pathogens      included gram-positive cocci (45%), predominantly staphylococci, and nosocomial      gram-negative bacilli (27%). Almost half (42%) of the patients were managed by      chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy. While 14% of the patients had      intraoperative debridement, only 3 underwent complete LVAD removal. The average      duration (+/-SD) of LVAD support was 1.5+/-1.0 years. At year 2 of follow-up, the      cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was estimated to be 43%. CONCLUSION:       Clinical manifestations of LVADI vary on the basis of the type of infection and      the causative pathogen. Mortality remained high despite combined medical and      surgical intervention and chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy. Based on      clinical experiences, a management algorithm for LVADI is proposed to assist in      the decision-making process.FAU - Nienaber, Juhsien Jodi CAU  - Nienaber JJAD  - Division of Infectious Diseases.FAU - Kusne, ShimonAU  - Kusne SFAU - Riaz, TalhaAU  - Riaz TFAU - Walker, Randall CAU  - Walker RCFAU - Baddour, Larry MAU  - Baddour LMFAU - Wright, Alan JAU  - Wright AJFAU - Park, Soon JAU  - Park SJFAU - Vikram, Holenarasipur RAU  - Vikram HRFAU - Keating, Michael RAU  - Keating MRFAU - Arabia, Francisco AAU  - Arabia FAFAU - Lahr, Brian DAU  - Lahr BDFAU - Sohail, M RizwanAU  - Sohail MRCN  - Mayo Cardiovascular Infections Study GroupLA  - engGR  - UL1 RR024150/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1 TR000135/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130813PL  - United StatesTA  - Clin Infect DisJT  - Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases      Society of AmericaJID - 9203213RN  - 0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic useMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effects/microbiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/*etiology/microbiology/*therapyMH  - Retrospective StudiesPMC - PMC3805171OID - NLM: PMC3805171OTO - NOTNLMOT  - LVADOT  - device-related infectionsOT  - driveline infectionsOT  - endocarditisOT  - heart failureEDAT- 2013/08/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/23 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/15 06:00PHST- 2013/08/13 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2013/09/18 [aheadofprint]AID - cit536 [pii]AID - 10.1093/cid/cit536 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Infect Dis. 2013 Nov;57(10):1438-48. doi: 10.1093/cid/cit536.
