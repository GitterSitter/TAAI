Smaller studies have suggested that       advanced age should not be a contraindication to bridge to transplantation (BTT)       LVAD placement. The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes in patients 60       years and older undergoing BTT with continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: The United      Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was reviewed to identify first-time OHT      recipients 60 years of age and older (2005-2010). Patients were stratified by      preoperative support: continuous-flow LVAD, intravenous inotropic agents, and      direct transplantation. Survival after OHT was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier      method. All-cause mortality was examined using multivariable Cox proportional      hazard regression. RESULTS: Of 2,554 patients, 1,142 (44.7%) underwent direct      transplantation, 264 (10.3%) had LVAD BTT, and 1,148 (45.0%) had BTT with      inotropic agents. The mean age was 64+/-3 years, and 460 (18.0%) patients were      women. Mean follow-up was 29+/-19 months. Survival differed significantly among      the 3 groups. Patients with LVAD BTT had significantly lower survival after OHT      compared with the other groups at 30 days and 1 year. This survival difference      was no longer significant at 2 years after OHT or when deaths in the first 30      days were censored. LVAD BTT increased the hazard of death at 1 year by 50%      (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.15; p=0.03),      compared with patients who underwent direct transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: This      study represents the largest modern cohort in which survival after OHT has been      evaluated in patients 60 years or older who received BTT. Older patients have      lower short-term survival after OHT when BTT is carried out with a      continuous-flow LVAD compared with inotropic agents or direct transplantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
