The primary goals of this      analysis were to describe serial post-MCS changes in estimated glomerular      filtration rate (eGFR) and determine their association with all-cause mortality.       METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) with serial creatinine      levels available (n=3363) were studied. Early post-MCS, eGFR improved      substantially (median improvement, 48.9%; P<0.001) with 22.3% of the population      improving their eGFR by >/=100% within the first few weeks. However, in the      majority of patients, this improvement was transient, and by 1 year, eGFR was      only 6.7% above the pre-MCS value (P<0.001). This pattern of early improvement      followed by deterioration in eGFR was observed with both pulsatile and      continuous-flow devices. Interestingly, poor survival was associated with both      marked improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval      [CI], 1.19-2.26; P=0.002) and worsening in eGFR (adjusted HR, 1.63; 95% CI,      1.15-2.13; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Post-MCS, early improvement in renal function      is common but seems to be largely transient and not necessarily indicative of an       improved prognosis. This pattern was observed with both pulsatile and      continuous-flow devices. Additional research is necessary to better understand      the mechanistic basis for these complex post-MCS changes in renal function and      their associated survival disadvantage.
