Hemodynamic,      clinical, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic variables poorly discriminate      patients at risk of RVF. We examined the utility of 3-dimensional      echocardiography (3DE) right ventricular (RV) volumetric assessment to identify      patients at risk for RVF. METHODS AND RESULTS: RVF was defined as the need for      inotropic infusion for >14 days after LVAD surgery or the need for biventricular       assist device support. Preoperative RV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were      measured, blinded to clinical data, from transthoracic 3DE full volume data sets       in 26 patients. Baseline variables and 3DE RV indices were compared between      patients with and without RVF. Twenty-four patients received continuous-flow      LVADs, and 2 required biventricular support devices. Ten patients required      prolonged inotropes after LVAD placement. Baseline characteristics associated      with RVF included higher right atrial pressure, higher right atrial pressure to      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio, and lower cardiac index and RV stroke      work index (RVSWI). Echocardiographic indices associated with RVF included 3DE      indexed RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDVI and RVESVI) and RV      ejection fraction (RVEF). The relationship between 3DE quantification of RV      volumes and the development of RVF was independent from RVSWI: RVEDVI: odds ratio      (OR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.33 (P = .04); RVESVI: OR 1.14, 95%      CI 1.01-1.28 (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 3DE is a promising method for      pre-LVAD RV assessment. RV volumes assessed by 3DE are predictive of RVF in LVAD       recipients independently from hemodynamic correlates of RV function.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
