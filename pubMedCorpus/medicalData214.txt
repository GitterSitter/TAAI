Thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,      refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricular      assist device (VAD) therapy. The program, supported and funded by the national      healthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical Center for      the operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.      Regional VAD coordinators are educated by the National Center. They are in charge      of regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription,       and continuing patients' and caregivers' education, mainly regarding driveline      exit site dressing and driveline stabilization. From November 2011 to November      2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support      (LVAD): HeartMate II, n=70, HeartWare, n=25. Mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37%       of the patients were males. Most patients had INTERMACS profile 4 (55%), followed      by 3 and 2 (17% each). Symptomatic and functional improvement are testified by      changes from baseline to month 3 of NYHA functional class (from III-IV to I-II),       results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and NT-proBNP levels (from      6997 to 1126 pg/ml). Overall 1-year survival was 69%, with a trend for outcome      improvement over time and a relationship with preoperative INTERMACS profile      (1-year survival of 60% in patients with INTERMACS profile 1-2 vs 75% in those      with INTERMACS profile 3-4). In summary, where and when a heart transplant      program cannot be implemented, LVAD represents a realistic therapeutic      alternative. The key points for a successful VAD program are a dedicated, highly       specialized multidisciplinary team at the Cardiac Surgery Center, an      infrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,      adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.FAU - Bekbossynov, SerikAU  - Bekbossynov SFAU - Medressova, AsselAU  - Medressova AFAU - Murzagaliyev, MuradymAU  - Murzagaliyev MFAU - Salov, RomanAU  - Salov RFAU - Dzhetybayeva, SaltanatAU  - Dzhetybayeva SFAU - Andossova, SaltanatAU  - Andossova SFAU - Bekbossynova, MakhabbatAU  - Bekbossynova MFAU - Pya, YuriyAU  - Pya YLA  - itaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Programma chirurgico per il trattamento dell'insufficienza cardiaca -      l'esperienza del Kazakhstan.PL  - ItalyTA  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome)JT  - Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)JID - 101263411SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - KazakhstanMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/04/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/03 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/29 06:00AID - 10.1714/1463.16161 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome). 2014 Mar;15(3):144-8. doi: 10.1714/1463.16161.
