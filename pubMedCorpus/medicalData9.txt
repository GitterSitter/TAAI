VAD implantation in such patients,      especially biventricular VAD (BVAD) placement, can be very challenging,      potentially associated with high morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We      report on a 47-year-old male patient in terminal biventricular failure with      pulmonary hypertension 40 years after a Mustard procedure. The patient was      successfully provided with a HVAD (HeartWare; HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA,      USA) into the systemic ventricle as bridge to transplantation, with the      sub-pulmonary ventricle left unsupported. DISCUSSION: We present our      institutional strategy for VAD selection in these patients and highlight      intra-corporeal VAD implantation technique.FAU - Schweiger, MartinAU  - Schweiger MAD  - Department of Congenital Cardiovascular Surgery, University Children's Hospital      Zurich, Zurich - Switzerland.FAU - Falk, VolkmarAU  - Falk VFAU - Biry, MirkoAU  - Biry MFAU - Hubler, MichaelAU  - Hubler MFAU - Wilhelm, Markus JAU  - Wilhelm MJLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150422TA  - Int J Artif OrgansJT  - The International journal of artificial organsJID - 7802649EDAT- 2015/04/25 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/25 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/25 06:00PHST- 2015/04/22 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2015/02/14 [accepted]AID - 0638535F-175B-45BD-8F92-B60417E01376 [pii]AID - 10.5301/ijao.5000400 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Int J Artif Organs. 2015 Apr 22:0. doi: 10.5301/ijao.5000400.
