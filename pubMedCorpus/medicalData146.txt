We evaluated the association of renal function and      inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on posttransplant graft survival in status 1B      patients. METHODS: The Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients database was      analyzed for posttransplant survival in status 1B patients bridged with inotropes      or CF-LVAD who underwent transplantation between 2003 and 2012. Pretransplant      renal function was measured by estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and      was stratified as less than 45 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2), 45 to 59, and 60 or      greater. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used      to evaluate the main effects of GFR strata and inotropes versus CF-LVAD, and the       interaction effect of GFR strata by CF-LVAD, on graft survival. RESULTS: This      study included 4,158 status 1B patients (74% male, aged 53 +/- 12 years). Of      those, 659 patients had a CF-LVAD (HeartMate-II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], n =      638; HVAD [HeartWare, Framingham, MA], n = 21), and 3,530 were receiving      inotropes (31 CF-LVAD patients were also receiving inotropes). Kaplan-Meier      analyses demonstrated reduced graft survival (p = 0.022) in patients with      pretransplant GFR less than 45 versus GFR 45 to 59 (p = 0.062) and versus GFR 60       or greater (p = 0.007), and no effect of inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on graft      survival (p = 0.402). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, after adjusting      for the main effects of GFR stratum, CF-LVAD, and inotropes, status 1B patients      bridged with a CF-LVAD and GFR in the lowest stratum had reduced graft survival      (interaction effect p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant renal insufficiency      was associated with reduced posttransplant graft survival in status 1B patients.       This risk is increased for patients bridged with a CF-LVAD (versus inotropes) who      have GFR in the lowest stratum.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
