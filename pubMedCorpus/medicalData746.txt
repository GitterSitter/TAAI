We review the incidence and outcomes of post-transplant MCS in our      institution. METHODS: MCS was classified as early (<1 month since transplant) or       late (>1 month since transplant) and the support offered was either veno-arterial      extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) or a ventricular assist device      (VAD). From 2003 to the present, 100 children (<16 years) underwent OHTx. Fifteen      (15%) had 17 episodes of MCS. MCS was instituted early in 10 and late in seven      episodes. Two children required two episodes of support. VA-ECMO was used in 12      episodes (71%). Two children required VAD support alone (12%). In three (17%)      episodes ECMO was subsequently converted from VAD. RESULTS: Among 10 children      with early failure, eight were successfully weaned from support with recovery of       graft function. In the late failure group, three of six patients died. All but      four patients underwent re-transplantation with no perioperative deaths. Overall       survival to discharge was 66%. The early failure group shows a better survival      rate to hospital discharge compared with the late failure group (78 vs 50%; P <      0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of post-transplant MCS for graft failure in      our patients was 15%. Early graft failure has a better outcome than late failure.      Re-transplantation has good mid-term outcomes in children. A stepwise approach      with a multimodality MCS strategy improves survival in this group of patients.FAU - Perri, GianluigiAU  - Perri GAD  - Department of Paediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon      Tyne, UK. giangio81@hotmail.comFAU - Hasan, AsifAU  - Hasan AFAU - Cassidy, JaneAU  - Cassidy JFAU - Kirk, RichardAU  - Kirk RFAU - Haynes, SimonAU  - Haynes SFAU - Smith, JohnAU  - Smith JFAU - Crossland, DavidAU  - Crossland DFAU - Griselli, MassimoAU  - Griselli MLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120320PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Oct;42(4):702-3.
