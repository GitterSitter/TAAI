We report our      initial experience with the DuraHeart as a bridge to heart transplantation.      METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, 23 patients (17 males; mean age 35      years, range 16-53 years) with endstage heart failure underwent implantation with      the DuraHeart LVAD at Osaka University Hospital. Of those, 7 underwent conversion      surgery from a Nipro paracorporeal LVAD to the DuraHeart. There were no deaths      during the mean support period of 559+/-241 days (176-999 days). In total, 17      patients (74%) remain with the LVAD and 5 (22%) underwent heart transplantation      after 580+/-302 days (176-982 days) of support. Major adverse events included 8      (34%) driveline/pocket infections, 4 (17%) cerebrovascular accidents, 4 (17%)      right heart failures requiring mechanical support, and 3 (13%) mechanical device       failures (magnetic levitation failure caused by driveline fracture). Of the 5      patients who developed pump pocket infection, 3 underwent previous conversion      surgery from the Nipro LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with the      DuraHeart LVAD in Japan demonstrated excellent long-term survival with acceptable      rates of adverse events. With refinement of the system, including mechanical      durability, this pump will further enhance the quality of life for patients who      require long-term mechanical circulatory support.FAU - Sakaguchi, TaichiAU  - Sakaguchi TAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of      Medicine, Osaka, Japan.FAU - Matsumiya, GoroAU  - Matsumiya GFAU - Yoshioka, DaisukeAU  - Yoshioka DFAU - Miyagawa, ShigeruAU  - Miyagawa SFAU - Nishi, HiroyukiAU  - Nishi HFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Fukushima, SatsukiAU  - Fukushima SFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Ueno, TakayoshiAU  - Ueno TFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130418PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *MagneticsMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Prosthesis ImplantationMH  - *Quality of LifeEDAT- 2013/04/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/05 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/19 06:00PHST- 2013/04/18 [aheadofprint]AID - DN/JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-12-1410 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2013;77(7):1736-41.
