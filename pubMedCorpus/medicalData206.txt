The Model for End-stage Liver      Disease (MELD) score was assessed as a predictor of bleeding and levels of      haemostatic markers in patients with currently utilized VADs. METHODS:      Sixty-three patients (31 HeartMate II, 15 HeartWare, 17 Thoratec paracorporeal      ventricular assist device) implanted 2001-11 were analysed for preoperative liver      dysfunction (MELD) and blood product administration. Of these patients, 21 had      additional blood drawn to measure haemostatic marker levels. Cohorts were defined      based on high (>/=18.0, n = 7) and low (<18.0, n = 14) preoperative MELD scores.       RESULTS: MELD score was positively correlated with postoperative administration      of red blood cell (RBC), platelet, plasma and total blood product units (TBPU) ,       as well as chest tube drainage and cardiopulmonary bypass time. Age and MELD were      preoperative predictors of TBPU by multivariate analysis. The high-MELD cohort      had higher administration of TBPU, RBC and platelet units and chest tube drainage      postimplant. Similarly, patients who experienced at least one bleeding adverse      event were more likely to have had a high preoperative MELD. The high-MELD group       exhibited different temporal trends in F1 + 2 levels and platelet counts to      postoperative day (POD) 55. D-dimer levels in high-MELD patients became elevated       versus those for low-MELD patients on POD 55. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative MELD      score predicts postoperative bleeding in contemporary VADs. Preoperative liver      dysfunction may also alter postoperative subclinical haemostasis through      different temporal trends of thrombin generation and platelet counts, as well as       protracted fibrinolysis.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
