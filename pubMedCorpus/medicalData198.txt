It was shown that      early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits to patients       with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support LVAD. However,      as it can be inserted via small incisions with no need for sternotomy or      cardiopulmonary bypass, it might be beneficial for selected high-risk patients.      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Synergy Micro-pump in      patients in INTERMACS class 1-2. From February 2012 to August 2013, 13 patients      with severe heart failure were supported with the Synergy Pocket Micro-pump.      Patients were divided into two groups according to INTERMACS class: the high-risk      group (INTERMACS class 1-2) and the low-risk group (INTERMACS class 3-4). There      were seven patients in INTERMACS class 1-2 and six in INTERMACS class 3-4.      Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and postoperative outcomes      were compared. There were no statistically significant differences in patient      demographics, and mean support time was 108 +/- 114 days in the high-risk group      and 238 +/- 198 days in the low-risk group. Also, there were no significant      differences in perioperative characteristics or in the rate of postoperative      adverse events. The overall survival was comparable between the two groups (one      late death in each group, log-rank P = 0.608). Two patients from the high-risk      group were upgraded to a full-support LVAD (P = 0.462) after 65 +/- 84.9 days of       mean support. One patient from the high-risk group and two patients from the      low-risk group were successfully transplanted (P = 0.559). The use of the Synergy      Micro-pump in INTERMACS 1-2 patients is feasible and is associated with similar      postoperative outcome as in patients in INTERMACS 3-4. Carefully selected      patients with severe heart failure could benefit due to the small size of the      pump; however, further studies and medium-term follow-up are required.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support;       Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne.FAU - Popov, Aron-FrederikAU  - Popov AFFAU - Bowles, Christopher TAU  - Bowles CTFAU - Weymann, AlexanderAU  - Weymann AFAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNFAU - Wahlers, ThorstenAU  - Wahlers TFAU - Wittwer, ThorstenAU  - Wittwer TFAU - Zych, BartlomiejAU  - Zych BFAU - Garcia-Saez, DianaAU  - Garcia-Saez DFAU - Patil, Nikhil PAU  - Patil NPFAU - Fatullayev, JavidAU  - Fatullayev JFAU - Amrani, MohamedAU  - Amrani MFAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRFAU - Seidler, TimAU  - Seidler TFAU - Unsoeld, BernhardAU  - Unsoeld BFAU - Bireta, ChristianAU  - Bireta CFAU - Schoendube, Friedrich AAU  - Schoendube FAFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140520PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart failureOT  - INTERMACSOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - Partial flow supportOT  - Synergy Pocket Micro-pumpEDAT- 2014/05/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/21 06:00CRDT- 2014/05/21 06:00PHST- 2014/05/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12316 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Feb;39(2):118-25. doi: 10.1111/aor.12316.
