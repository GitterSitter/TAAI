Patients approaching death,       or their surrogates, may request withdrawal of LVAD support. We sought to study      the attitudes and practices of heart failure clinicians regarding withdrawal of      LVAD support in patients approaching death. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using      internet-based and secure methods, we surveyed members of the European Society of      Cardiology-Heart Failure Association (ESC-HFA), the International Society for      Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), and the Heart Failure Society of America       (HFSA) to assess their attitudes and practices regarding LVAD withdrawal for      patients approaching death. The results indicated that clinicians have varied      attitudes and practices regarding withdrawing LVAD support in these patients.      Furthermore, ESC-HFA clinicians (primarily European) and ISHLT and HFSA      clinicians (primarily North American) differed in their attitudes and practices      regarding withdrawal of LVAD support, particularly its ethical and legal      permissibility. For example, more European clinicians than North American      clinicians regarded withdrawing LVAD support as a form of euthanasia. CONCLUSION:      Opinions and level of comfort with LVAD withdrawal vary among clinicians.      Clinicians should be aware of suggested approaches or guidelines for managing      requests for withdrawal of LVAD therapy.FAU - Swetz, Keith MAU  - Swetz KMAD  - Division of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.FAU - Cook, Katlyn EAU  - Cook KEFAU - Ottenberg, Abigale LAU  - Ottenberg ALFAU - Chang, NouAU  - Chang NFAU - Mueller, Paul SAU  - Mueller PSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130605PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - *Attitude of Health PersonnelMH  - Cardiology/*methodsMH  - *Device RemovalMH  - EuropeMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - North AmericaMH  - *Physician's Practice PatternsMH  - Terminal Care/*methods/psychologyPMC - PMC4023318OID - NLM: PMC4023318OTO - NOTNLMOT  - End of lifeOT  - Mechanical circulatory supportOT  - Medical ethicsOT  - Palliative careOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/06/08 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/11 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/08 06:00PHST- 2013/06/05 [aheadofprint]AID - hft094 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hft094 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2013 Nov;15(11):1262-6. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hft094.
