RECENT FINDINGS: There is a      growing need for a well-tolerated, durable and effective MCS option in patients      with refractory heart failure. In previous years, the primary indication for MCS       therapy supported bridge to transplantation. These early left ventricular assist       devices (LVADs) suffered significant adverse events, thereby limiting their      prolonged use. With the introduction of newer continuous flow LVADs, with lower      morbidity, neurological events, pump failure and the expanded indication use      (i.e. destination therapy), the overall number of implanted patients has grown.      SUMMARY: There has been a dramatic advancement of durability found in the second       and third-generation, continuous flow LVADs, along with improved survival rates      in patients receiving these devices for destination therapy. MCS may soon become       the treatment option of choice in refractory heart failure patients, especially      with further evolution of less invasive approaches, smaller designs, and energy      sources.FAU - Toeg, Hadi DaoodAU  - Toeg HDAD  - aDivision of Cardiac Surgery, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa,      Ontario, Canada bDivision of Cardiac Surgery, Harvard University, Massachusetts      General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.FAU - Al-Atassi, TalalAU  - Al-Atassi TFAU - Garcia, Jose PerezAU  - Garcia JPFAU - Ruel, MarcAU  - Ruel MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin CardiolJT  - Current opinion in cardiologyJID - 8608087SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/*trends/utilizationMH  - HumansMH  - Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping/trendsEDAT- 2014/01/08 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/22 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/08 06:00AID - 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000037 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Cardiol. 2014 Mar;29(2):167-73. doi: 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000037.
