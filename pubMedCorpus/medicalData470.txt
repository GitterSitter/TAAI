Patients as a result are living longer and presenting to emergency medical      services, primary care facilities, emergency departments, and critical care units      more frequently. Currently, health care providers have limited experience in      managing this complex patient population. Thus, we created a standardized method       of initial evaluation and algorithmic approach of management to help in the      management of emergencies in this unique patient population. We present a      comprehensive overview of the types of mechanical assist devices, their      complications, and an algorithmic approach to the emergency management in the      patients with mechanical circulatory support. A systematic method is crucial in      prompt and early recognition of emergencies to ensure appropriate management of      these patients.FAU - Aggarwal, AshimAU  - Aggarwal AAD  - Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn, Illinois 60453, USA.FAU - Kurien, SudhaAU  - Kurien SFAU - Coyle, LauraAU  - Coyle LFAU - Siemeck, RoxanneAU  - Siemeck RFAU - Tatooles, AntoneAU  - Tatooles AFAU - Pappas, Pat SAU  - Pappas PSFAU - Bhat, GeethaAU  - Bhat GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Prog TransplantJT  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)JID - 100909380SB  - NMH  - AlgorithmsMH  - EmergenciesMH  - Emergency Treatment/*methodsMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Patient Care Management/methodsMH  - Prosthesis FailureEDAT- 2013/06/21 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/06 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/21 06:00AID - B43298181319Q555 [pii]AID - 10.7182/pit2013848 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Prog Transplant. 2013 Jun;23(2):119-26; quiz 127. doi: 10.7182/pit2013848.
