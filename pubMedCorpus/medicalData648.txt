We undertook this study to examine the incidence and      impact of repeat sternotomies on OHT outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a      retrospective review of all adult OHT from 2 institutions. Primary stratification      was by the number of prior sternotomies. The primary outcome was survival.      Secondary outcomes included blood product utilization and commonly encountered      postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression      models examined mortality while linear regression models examined blood      utilization. RESULTS: From January 1995 to October 2011, 631 OHT were performed.       Of these, 25 (4.0%) were redo OHT and 182 (28.8%) were bridged to transplant with      a ventricular assist device; 356 (56.4%) had undergone at least 1 prior      sternotomy. On unadjusted analysis, reoperative sternotomy was associated with      decreased 90-day (98.5% vs 90.2%, p<0.001), 1-year (93.1% vs 79.6%, p<0.001), and      5-year (80.4% vs 70.1%, p=0.002) survival. This difference persisted on      multivariable analysis at 90 days (hazard ratio [HR] 2.99, p=0.01), 1 year (HR      2.98, p=0.002), and 5 years (HR 1.62, p=0.049). The impact of an increasing      number of prior sternotomies was negligible. On multivariable analysis, an      increasing number of prior sternotomies was associated with increased      intraoperative blood product utilization. Increasing blood utilization was      associated with decreased 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year survival. CONCLUSIONS:      Reoperative sternotomy is associated with increased mortality and blood      utilization after OHT. Patients with more than 1 prior sternotomy do not      experience additional increased mortality. Carefully selected patients with      multiple prior sternotomies have decreased but acceptable outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
