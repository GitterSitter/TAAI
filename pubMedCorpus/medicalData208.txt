We evaluated our experience to      describe the bleeding complications among pediatric VAD recipients. We      hypothesized that those with bleeding requiring exploration had abnormal      coagulation profile compared with those without bleeding. The retrospective study      included 43 consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure supported on      pediatric mechanical cardiac support as a bridge to transplantation.      Day-/event-based analysis on factors below associated with (i) bleeding and (ii)       bleeding in next 48 h. Cases with bleeding were compared with day-matched      patients without bleeding complications. Among 43 subjects bleeding occurred in      47% of cases, which necessitated exploration or chest tube placement. Twenty of      34 interventions for bleeding occurred in the first seven post-operative days. No      differences in coagulation parameters or use of antiplatelet agents were noted      among those who had bleeding vs. those who did not. Our results indicate that (i)      re-bleeding requiring re-exploration was common, (ii) most of the bleeding      occurred early post-implantation, (iii) there were no differences in coagulation       parameters or the use of antiplatelet agents within 48 h of bleeding compared      with those who did not bleed on each successive post-operative day.CI  - (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
