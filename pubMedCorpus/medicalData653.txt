This study aimed to determine the preoperative risk factors for severe right      heart failure needing biventricular mechanical circulatory support in children      with end-stage heart failure. METHODS: We reviewed data from 84 children      supported with long-term VADs at the German Heart Institute Berlin between      January 1999 and October 2010. Right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support was      needed for 24 (29%) patients, and the other 60 (71%) were implanted with left      ventricular assist devices (LVADs). RESULTS: The median age at implantation was 7      years (12 days-18 years), and the median support time was 41 days (1-432 days).      Of the 84 patients, the overall survival to transplantation or recovery of      ventricular function was 69%. Compared with children implanted with LVAD,      patients receiving biventricular support had significantly higher postoperative      mortality (P = 0.04). The multivariate logistic regression indicated that      decreased milrinone use was the only preoperative factor independently associated      with increased requirement for biventricular support (odds ratio: 0.1, 95%      confidence interval: 0.04-0.64, P = 0.01). Children treated with milrinone      preoperatively showed improved survival after implantation (P = 0.04).      CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric patients needing biventricular support had significantly       higher postoperative mortality. Preoperative milrinone use might decrease the      risk of severe right ventricular failure requiring additional RVAD insertion and       improve postimplantation survival in children with advanced heart failure.FAU - Fan, YeAU  - Fan YAD  - Institute of Respiratory Disease, Chongqing Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military      Medical University, Chongqing, China. fanye2008728@googlemail.comFAU - Zhang, An-MeiAU  - Zhang AMFAU - Weng, Yu-GuoAU  - Weng YGFAU - Huebler, MichaelAU  - Huebler MFAU - Miera, OliverAU  - Miera OFAU - Franz, NorbertAU  - Franz NFAU - Qian, Gui-ShengAU  - Qian GSFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120831PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069RN  - JU9YAX04C7 (Milrinone)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/methodsMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Infant, NewbornMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Milrinone/therapeutic useMH  - Postoperative Complications/drug therapy/prevention & controlMH  - Preoperative PeriodMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/methodsMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/09/04 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/19 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/04 06:00PHST- 2012/08/31 [aheadofprint]AID - ezs481 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs481 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 May;43(5):1028-35. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs481.
