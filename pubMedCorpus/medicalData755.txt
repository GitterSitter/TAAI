Over the       last 25 years great progress has been made in the medical management of heart      failure with the recognition of the benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade,      modulation of the renin-angiotensin and mineralocorticoid axes and judicious      diuretic therapy. In addition, cardiac resynchronization therapy and prophylactic      implantation of cardiac defibrillators have been responsible for measurable      benefits in terms of functional status and dysrhythmia-related mortality,      respectively. Unfortunately, progressive cardiac dysfunction often results in      activity limitation, symptoms at rest, hospital admission, end-organ dysfunction       and death despite maximal implementation of standard therapies. Heart      transplantation has been a dramatic and effective therapy for end-stage heart      failure, but it remains limited by a shortage of donor organs, strict criteria      defining acceptable recipients and often unsatisfactory long-term success.      Mechanical alternatives to support the failing circulation have been sought for      the last 50 years. The history of device development has been marked in general      by the slow progress achieved by a few dedicated and persevering pioneers. In the      past decade, however, evolving technology has dramatically changed the field and       broadened the options for the treatment of advanced heart failure. This review      will detail the important milestones and the current state of the art, with an      emphasis on implantable devices for intermediate to long term support.FAU - Milano, Carmelo AAU  - Milano CAAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.      carmelo.milano@duke.eduFAU - Simeone, Alan AAU  - Simeone AALA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Fail RevJT  - Heart failure reviewsJID - 9612481SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Equipment SafetyMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/*mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/*utilizationMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative Complications/mortality/physiopathologyMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Survival RateMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/03/08 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/26 06:00CRDT- 2012/03/08 06:00AID - 10.1007/s10741-012-9303-5 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2013 Jan;18(1):35-53. doi: 10.1007/s10741-012-9303-5.
