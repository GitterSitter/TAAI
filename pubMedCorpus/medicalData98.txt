Case study.PG  - 537-40LID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments for      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right time      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function       of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular      afterload. The experimental implantation of an innovative Religa Heart EXT      prosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. Too short time      of Religa Heart EXT implantation in the discussed patient prevented the      possibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications and      infections compared to the documented complications of POLVAD implanted until      now. OHT is a safe and efficacious method of treatment of patients previously      supported by ECMO and Religa Heart EXT.FAU - Religa, GrzegorzAU  - Religa GAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Institute of Cardiology,      Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Jasinska, MalgorzataAU  - Jasinska MAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Czyzewski, LukaszAU  - Czyzewski LAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Torba, KrzysztofAU  - Torba KAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.FAU - Rozanski, JacekAU  - Rozanski JAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Institute of Cardiology,      Warsaw, Poland.LA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20141021PL  - PolandTA  - Ann TransplantJT  - Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation SocietyJID - 9802544SB  - IMMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/physiopathology/surgery/therapyMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/instrumentationMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*surgery/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - PolandMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/prevention & controlEDAT- 2014/10/22 06:00MHDA- 2015/05/12 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/22 06:00AID - 891266 [pii]AID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Ann Transplant. 2014 Oct 21;19:537-40. doi: 10.12659/AOT.891266.
