In this study, pump speed modulation algorithms      for generating pulsatility and variation in ventricular end-systolic and      end-diastolic volumes were investigated in an ischemic heart failure (IHF) bovine      model (n = 10) using a clinically implanted centrifugal-flow left ventricular      assist device (LVAD). METHODS: Hemodynamic and hematologic measurements were      recorded during IHF baseline, constant pumps speeds, and asynchronous (19-60      cycles/min) and synchronous (copulse and counterpulse) pump speed modulation      profiles using low relative pulse speed (+/-25%) of 3,200 +/- 800 rpm and high      relative pulse speed (+/-38%) of 2,900 +/- 1,100 rpm. End-organ perfusion,      hemodynamics, and pump parameters were measured to characterize pulsatility,      myocardial workload, and LVAD performance for each speed modulation profile.      RESULTS: Speed modulation profiles augmented aortic pulse pressure, surplus      hemodynamic energy, and end-organ perfusion (p < 0.01) compared with operation at      constant speed. Left ventricular external work and myocardial oxygen consumption       were significantly reduced compared with IHF baseline (p < 0.01) but at the      expense of higher LVAD power consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Pump speed modulation      increases pulsatility and improves cardiac function and end-organ perfusion, but       the asynchronous mode provides the technologic advantage of sensorless control.      Investigation of asynchronous pump speed modulation during long-term support is      warranted to test the hypothesis that operating an LVAD with speed modulation      will minimize adverse events in patients supported by an LVAD that may be      associated with long-term operation at a constant pump speed.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
