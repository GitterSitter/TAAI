All patients on the Eurotransplant      high-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be      relisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated with      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospective      analysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated with      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 117      consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure       unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 %) were stabilized and      delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient's specific characteristics.       After initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as      possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 %      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary      due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 %) needed a left- or      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 %) died while waiting and 87 (84 %)       received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. Cumulative 3 and 12 months      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 %, respectively. CONCLUSION:      Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These data provide the      basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropes in patients      on the HU waiting list.FAU - Hubner, TAU  - Hubner TAD  - Medizinische Abteilung, Kliniken der Barmherzigen Schwestern, Krankenhaus      Neuwittelsbach, Renatastrasse 71a, 80639, Munich, Germany.FAU - Nickel, TAU  - Nickel TFAU - Steinbeck, GAU  - Steinbeck GFAU - Massberg, SAU  - Massberg SFAU - Schramm, RAU  - Schramm RFAU - Reichart, BAU  - Reichart BFAU - Hagl, CAU  - Hagl CFAU - Kiwi, AAU  - Kiwi AFAU - Weis, MichaelAU  - Weis MLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150405TA  - Clin Res CardiolJT  - Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac SocietyJID - 101264123EDAT- 2015/04/07 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/07 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/06 06:00PHST- 2015/01/22 [received]PHST- 2015/03/31 [accepted]PHST- 2015/04/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00392-015-0852-1 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Clin Res Cardiol. 2015 Apr 5.
