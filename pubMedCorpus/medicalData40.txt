As microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in      remodeling processes, a comparative miRNA profiling in transplanted hearts of HF       patients with/without LVAD assistance could aid to comprehend underlying      molecular mechanisms. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze miRNA       differential expression in left ventricles of HF patients who underwent heart      transplantation directly (n = 9) or following a period of LVAD support (n = 8).      After data validation by quantitative real-time PCR, association with functional       clinical parameters was investigated. Bioinformatics' tools were then used for      prediction of putative targets of modulated miRNAs and relative pathway      enrichment. The analysis revealed 13 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs in      failing hearts subjected to LVAD assistance. In particular, the expression level       of some of them (miR-338-3p, miR-142-5p and -3p, miR-216a-5p, miR-223-3p,      miR-27a-5p, and miR-378g) showed correlation with off-pump cardiac index values.       Predicted targets of these miRNAs were involved in focal adhesion/integrin      pathway and in actin cytoskeleton regulation. The identified miRNAs might      contribute to molecular regulation of reverse remodeling and heart recovery      mechanisms.FAU - Barsanti, CristinaAU  - Barsanti CAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, CNR, Via Moruzzi 1,       56124 Pisa, Italy ; Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,      Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, 56127 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Trivella, Maria GiovannaAU  - Trivella MGAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, CNR, Via Moruzzi 1,       56124 Pisa, Italy.FAU - D'Aurizio, RominaAU  - D'Aurizio RAD  - Laboratory of Integrative Systems Medicine, National Research Council, Via      Moruzzi 1, 56124 Pisa, Italy.FAU - El Baroudi, MariamaAU  - El Baroudi MAD  - Laboratory of Integrative Systems Medicine, National Research Council, Via      Moruzzi 1, 56124 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Baumgart, MarioAU  - Baumgart MAD  - Fritz Lipmann Institute for Age Research, Leibniz Institute, Beutenbergstrasse      11, 07745 Jena, Germany.FAU - Groth, MarcoAU  - Groth MAD  - Fritz Lipmann Institute for Age Research, Leibniz Institute, Beutenbergstrasse      11, 07745 Jena, Germany.FAU - Caruso, RaffaeleAU  - Caruso RAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Cardiothoracic and      Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3,      20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Verde, AlessandroAU  - Verde AAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Cardiothoracic and      Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3,      20162 Milan, Italy ; Cardiothoracic and Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca' Granda       Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Botta, LucaAU  - Botta LAD  - Cardiothoracic and Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Piazza      Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Cozzi, LorenaAU  - Cozzi LAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Cardiothoracic and      Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3,      20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Pitto, LetiziaAU  - Pitto LAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, CNR, Via Moruzzi 1,       56124 Pisa, Italy.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20150201PL  - United StatesTA  - Biomed Res IntJT  - BioMed research internationalJID - 101600173SB  - IMPMC - PMC4330954OID - NLM: PMC4330954EDAT- 2015/02/25 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/25 06:00CRDT- 2015/02/25 06:00PHST- 2014/08/29 [received]PHST- 2014/11/07 [revised]PHST- 2014/11/13 [accepted]PHST- 2015/02/01 [epublish]AID - 10.1155/2015/592512 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:592512. doi: 10.1155/2015/592512.
