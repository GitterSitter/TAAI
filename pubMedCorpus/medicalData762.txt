Whether this approach improves risk prediction beyond clinical evaluation is      unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicenter cohort of 1513 chronic systolic      heart failure patients, we measured a contemporary biomarker panel consisting of       high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, B-type natriuretic peptide,      soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1, troponin I, soluble toll-like      receptor-2, creatinine, and uric acid. From this panel, we calculated a      parsimonious multimarker score and assessed its performance in predicting risk of      death, cardiac transplantation, or ventricular assist device placement in      comparison to an established clinical risk score, the Seattle Heart Failure Model      (SHFM). During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, there were 317 outcomes: 187      patients died; 99 were transplanted; and 31 had a ventricular assist device      placed. In unadjusted Cox models, patients in the highest tertile of the      multimarker score had a 13.7-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes compared      with the lowest tertile (95% confidence interval, 8.75-21.5). These effects were       independent of the SHFM (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.80; 95% confidence interval,      4.18-11.1). Addition of the multimarker score to the SHFM led to a significantly       improved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803 versus      0.756 (P=0.003) and appropriately reclassified a significant number of patients      who had the outcome into a higher risk category (net reclassification      improvement, 25.2%; 95% confidence interval, 14.2-36.2%; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:      In ambulatory chronic heart failure patients, a score derived from multiple      biomarkers integrating diverse biological pathways substantially improves      prediction of adverse events beyond current metrics.FAU - Ky, BonnieAU  - Ky BAD  - Penn Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,      Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. bonnie.ky@uphs.upenn.eduFAU - French, BenjaminAU  - French BFAU - Levy, Wayne CAU  - Levy WCFAU - Sweitzer, Nancy KAU  - Sweitzer NKFAU - Fang, James CAU  - Fang JCFAU - Wu, Alan H BAU  - Wu AHFAU - Goldberg, Lee RAU  - Goldberg LRFAU - Jessup, MariellAU  - Jessup MFAU - Cappola, Thomas PAU  - Cappola TPLA  - engGR  - HL088577/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL095661/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23HL095661-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - KL1 RR024132/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL088577/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120223PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
