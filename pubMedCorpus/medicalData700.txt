However, patients with biventricular HF may represent a unique cohort.      METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 113 adult,      end-stage HF patients at University of California Los Angeles Medical Center who       required BIVAD support between 2000 and 2009. RESULTS: Survival to transplant was      66.4%, with 1-year actuarial survival of 62.8%. All patients were Interagency      Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Level 1 or 2      and received Thoratec (Pleasanton, CA) paracorporeal BIVAD as a bridge to      transplant. Univariate analyses showed dialysis use, ventilator use,      extracorporal membrane oxygenation use, low cardiac output, preserved LV ejection      fraction (restrictive physiology), normal-to-high sodium, low platelet count, low      total cholesterol, low high-density and high-density lipoprotein, low albumin,      and elevated aspartate aminotransferase were associated with increased risk of      death. We generated a scoring system for survival to transplant. Our final model,      with age, sex, dialysis, cholesterol, ventilator, and albumin, gave a C-statistic      of 0.870. A simplified system preserved a C-statistic of 0.844. Patients were      divided into high-risk or highest-risk groups (median respective survival, 367      and 17 days), with strong discrimination between groups for death. CONCLUSIONS:      We have generated a scoring system that offers high prognostic ability for      patients requiring BIVAD support and hope that it may assist in clinical decision      making. Further studies are needed to prospectively validate our scoring system.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.
