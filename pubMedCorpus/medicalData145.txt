Indications, limitations and       practical implementation].PG  - 625-35LID - 10.1007/s00101-014-2362-3 [doi]AB  - Due to the technical advances in pumps, oxygenators and cannulas, veno-arterial      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) or extracorporeal life support      (ECLS) has been widely used in emergency medicine and intensive care medicine for      several years. An accepted indication is peri-interventional cardiac failure in      cardiac surgery (postcardiotomy low cardiac output syndrome). Furthermore,      especially the use of va-ECMO for other indications in critical care medicine,      such as in patients with severe sepsis with septic cardiomyopathy or in      cardiopulmonary resuscitation has tremendously increased. The basic indications      for va-ECMO are therapy refractory cardiac or cardiopulmonary failure. The      fundamental purpose of va-ECMO is bridging the function of the lungs and/or the      heart. Consequently, this support system does not represent a causal therapy by      itself; however, it provides enough time for the affected organ to recover      (bridge to recovery) or for the decision for a long-lasting organ substitution by      a ventricular assist device or by transplantation (bridge to decision). Although       the outcome for bridged patients seems to be favorable, it should not be      forgotten that the support system represents an invasive procedure with      potentially far-reaching complications. Therefore, the initiation of these      systems needs a professional and experienced (interdisciplinary) team, sufficient      resources and an individual approach balancing the risks and benefits. This      review gives an overview of the indications, complications and contraindications       for va-ECMO. It discusses its advantages in organ transplantation and transport      of critically ill patients. The reader will learn the differences between      peripheral and central cannulation and how to monitor and manage va-ECMO.FAU - Lunz, DAU  - Lunz DAD  - Klinik fur Anaesthesiologie, Universitatsklinik Regensburg,      Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee 11, 93053, Regensburg, Deutschland.FAU - Philipp, AAU  - Philipp AFAU - Dolch, MAU  - Dolch MFAU - Born, FAU  - Born FFAU - Zausig, Y AAU  - Zausig YALA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Venoarterielle extrakorporale Membranoxygenierung.
