We describe the case of a       35-year-old man with dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy who was supported with an      LVAD for 9 months. After the device was removed, he led a normal life for 13      years and 4 months. However, at 49 years of age, he presented with new signs and       symptoms of heart failure, necessitating implantation of a 2nd LVAD. Afterwards,       he has remained asymptomatic. This case is unique in that the patient lived a      normal life for longer than a decade before renewed left ventricular      decompensation necessitated repeat LVAD therapy. Histologic examination revealed       few changes between the first device's removal in 1999 and the 2nd device's      implantation in 2012.FAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMAD  - Departments of Cardiovascular Pathology (Drs.
