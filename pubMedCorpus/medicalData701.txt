The SHFM is a validated multivariate risk model that uses NYHA      classification to assess functional capacity rather than peak oxygen consumption       (VO(2)). METHODS: Outpatients (n = 1,240) evaluated for transplant at three      centers had their SHFM score calculated and peak VO(2) measured. The outcomes      assessed were death/LVAD/urgent transplant with censoring at the time of elective      transplant. RESULTS: Over the course of 4.0 (mean) years of observation, there      were 571 events. Both the SHFM score (chi(2) = 227) and peak VO(2) (chi(2) = 88,       both p < 0.0001) were highly predictive of outcomes. The SHFM and peak VO(2) were      modestly correlated (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate Cox model, peak      VO(2) added to the SHFM with a hazard ratio of 0.949 (p < 0.0001) for each      1-ml/kg/min increase. Peak VO(2) improved both the net reclassification      improvement and integrated discrimination index (both p </= 0.0002). Peak VO(2)      provided additive prognostic information within each SHFM score (p < 0.05). The      1-year areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were obtained for       peak VO(2) (0.645, 95% CI 0.606 to 0.684), SHFM (0.758, 95% CI 0.721 to 0.795)      and SHFM with peak VO(2) (0.766, 95% CI 0.731 to 0.802). The SHFM-predicted vs      actual survival free of LVAD/UNOS Status 1 transplant at 1 year (86% vs 83%) and       4 years (63% vs 63%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate SHFM is a      powerful predictor of death/LVAD/urgent transplant. Peak VO(2) adds prognostic      information across the spectrum of the SHFM, but changes in decision regarding      transplant listing occur mainly in moderate-risk patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
