The study explored potential benefits of      the therapy at 12 months, and results were previously reported. OBJECTIVE: To      report long-term (3-year) clinical effects and transgene expression in the      patients in CUPID 1. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with advanced      heart failure who were on stable, optimal heart failure therapy were randomized      to receive intracoronary infusion of AAV1/SERCA2a in 1 of 3 doses (low-dose,      6x10(11) DNase-resistant particles; mid-dose, 3x10(12) DNase-resistant particles;      and high-dose, 1x10(13) DNase-resistant particles) versus placebo. The following       recurrent cardiovascular and terminal events were tracked for 3 years in all      groups: myocardial infarction, worsening heart failure, heart failure-related      hospitalization, ventricular assist device placement, cardiac transplantation,      and death. The number of cardiovascular events, including death, was highest in      the placebo group, high but delayed in the low- and mid-dose groups, and lowest      in the high-dose group. Evidence of long-term transgene presence was also      observed in high-dose patients. The risk of prespecified recurrent cardiovascular      events was reduced by 82% in the high-dose versus placebo group (P=0.048). No      safety concerns were noted during the 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: After a      single intracoronary infusion of AAV1/SERCA2a in patients with advanced heart      failure, positive signals of cardiovascular events persist for years.FAU - Zsebo, KrisztinaAU  - Zsebo KAD  - From the Celladon Corporation, San Diego, CA (K.Z., J.J.R., K.W.); AY Statistical      Consulting, San Andreas, CA (A.Y.); The University of California, San Diego      Medical Center, La Jolla (B.G.); Penn Heart and Vascular Center, Hospital of the       University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (M.J.); and Cardiovascular Research      Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (R.J.H.).FAU - Yaroshinsky, AlexAU  - Yaroshinsky AFAU - Rudy, Jeffrey JAU  - Rudy JJFAU - Wagner, KimAU  - Wagner KFAU - Greenberg, BarryAU  - Greenberg BFAU - Jessup, MariellAU  - Jessup MFAU - Hajjar, Roger JAU  - Hajjar RJLA  - engPT  - Clinical Trial, Phase IIPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130924PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ ResJT  - Circulation researchJID - 0047103RN  - EC 3.6.3.8 (ATP2A2 protein, human)RN  - EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)SB  - IMCIN - Circ Res. 2014 Jan 3;114(1):12-4.
