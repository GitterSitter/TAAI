Unfortunately,       device-related complications remain common, with many patients experiencing      adverse events within the first year. New literature suggests that rates of      device-related thrombosis may be increasing since 2011, which is particularly      troublesome given that this pathology can result in a disabling stroke, organ      damage, and death. In 2013, a group of practitioners in the field of mechanical      circulatory support published a treatment algorithm based on their expert      opinion. However, a comprehensive review of the pharmacotherapy of this condition      is lacking. A search of the literature revealed 20 separate publications of case       reports or case series describing outcomes associated with the use of drug      therapy for suspected pump thrombosis. Each of these experiences was limited by      small sample size, nonrandomized treatment allocation, and nonstandardized      medication dosing. Data describing the outcomes of surgical versus medical      management of device thrombosis are also sparse, with only three published      reports identified. Based on the review of this limited literature, surgical      management appears to be the preferred treatment modality, especially in those      with organ hypoperfusion or hemodynamic instability. In patients ineligible for      surgery, pharmacotherapy options remain limited. Use of all drug classes      described in the literature for the HeartMate II device-fibrinolytics,      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors-was hindered by       either marginal efficacy or bleeding. Based on historical experience with      unfractionated heparin in patients under HeartMate II support, we recommend this       agent as a possible option for those with suspected pump thrombosis in lieu of      surgical device exchange. For the HeartWare HVAD, limited data suggest that      direct intraventricular administration of alteplase may be an acceptable      treatment alternative. Additional research is clearly needed to further delineate      the role of pharmacotherapy and to identify the optimal agent for managing this      potentially life-threatening condition.CI  - (c) 2014 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.FAU - Jennings, Douglas LAU  - Jennings DLAD  - Nova Southeastern University, Ft.
