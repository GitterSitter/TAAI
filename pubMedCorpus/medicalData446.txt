We evaluated echocardiographic parameters      associated with adverse outcomes in this population. METHODS: Transthoracic      echocardiograms (TTEs) before continuous-flow LVAD implantation were analyzed in       109 patients. Twenty-six 2-dimensional and Doppler parameters were assessed for      their association with the primary outcome of 30-day RVF, defined as a      requirement of an RV assist device or >/= 14 consecutive days of inotropic      support, and the secondary composite outcome of 30-day death or RVF. Multivariate      analysis adjusted for known clinical risk prediction models was performed.      RESULTS: Overall, 25 (22.9%) and 27 (24.8%) patients reached the primary and      secondary end-points, respectively. An increased RV/LV diameter ratio was the      only TTE variable independently associated with both the primary (odds ratio [OR]      = 5.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.40 to 12.40; p = 0.012) and secondary (OR       = 2.70; 95% CI 1.06 to 6.22; p = 0.03) outcomes after multivariate analysis.      Scatterplot analysis with regression determined the optimal cut-off value for      RV/LV diameter to be 0.75. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, an       increased RV/LV diameter ratio provided an additional predictive value to      clinical risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: A TTE-measured RV/LV diameter ratio of >/=0.75      is independently associated with a higher risk for RVF in patients with      continuous-flow LVAD. When used alone, this simple, easily derived, practical      echocardiographic measurement has a predictive value equivalent to known clinical      risk scores, whereas their combination provides stronger risk prediction for      adverse outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
