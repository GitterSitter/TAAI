Quality of life (QoL) has      not been systematically evaluated in children bridged to heart transplant.      METHODS: All children transplanted for cardiomyopathy during 2001 to 2008 and      currently being followed at our center (n = 84) had QoL assessed during 2006 to      2009, at a median of 3 years post-transplant, using a validated generic measure      (PedsQL4.0). RESULTS: Twenty-six children, aged 2.7 to 18 (median 7.4) years who       were bridged to transplant, were compared with 58 children, aged 2.0 to 18.0      (median 13.0) years, who were transplanted in the same era without bridging.      There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any domains of QoL       assessed by children or parents, although the small number of bridged patients      increases the likelihood of a Type II error. Bridged children who were younger (r      = 0.48, p = 0.02) or more recently transplanted (r = 0.42, p = 0.04) were scored       by their parents as having poorer emotional QoL. Regression analysis indicated      that age at transplant was the only medical or demographic variable associated      with parent-reported total QoL scores (beta = 0.27, p = 0.01). With few links      between QoL scores and medical or demographic factors, other subjective      psychologic factors may be of greater salience in determining QoL. CONCLUSIONS:      Despite greater severity of illness, children who required mechanical bridging to      transplantation report a QoL comparable to that of other children undergoing      heart transplantation. Younger children may require greater psychologic support      to reach their full potential in terms of QoL.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
