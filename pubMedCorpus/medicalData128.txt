The aim of this study was to assess whether Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)      implantation modifies the inflammatory and apoptotic profile in the heart through      the modulation of Casp-1 expression level. METHODS: Cardiac tissue was collected       from end-stage HF patients before LVAD implant (pre-LVAD group, n=22) and at LVAD      removal (post-LVAD, n=6), and from stable HF patients on medical therapy without       prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at heart transplantation, as control. The      cardiac expression of Casp-1, of its inhibitors caspase recruitment domain (CARD)      only protein (COP) and CARD family, member 18 (ICEBERG), was evaluated by      real-time PCR in the three groups of patients. RESULTS: Casp-1 was increased in      the pre-LVAD group compared to HTx (p=0.006), while on the contrary the ICEBERG      level was significantly decreased in pre-LVAD with respect to HTx patients      (p<0.001); no difference in COP expression level was found. CONCLUSIONS: This      study describes a specific pattern of the Casp-1 system associated with      inflammation and apoptosis markers in patients who require LVAD insertion. The      inflammation could be the key process regulating, in a negative loop, Casp-1      signaling and its down-stream effects, apoptosis included.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
