This study investigated the effect of      bloodstream infection on survival of patients with LVAD support and assessed risk      factors for survival in LVAD patients with bloodstream infection. METHODS:      Between 1999 and 2010, 109 consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure were      supported by an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation. Overall survival was      compared between those with and without a bloodstream infection. Risk factors for      survival of patients with bloodstream infection were analyzed. RESULTS: A      bloodstream infection developed in 65 patients (60%) during 584 +/- 389 days of      LVAD support. Compared with patients without a bloodstream infection, overall      survival was significantly worse in those with bloodstream infection (68% vs 84%       at 2 years after LVAD implantation, p = 0.0117). However, of 22 patients bridged       to transplantation, none had bloodstream infection recurrence after      transplantation, and their 3-year survival rate after transplantation was 100%.      Cox multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) identified      postoperative right ventricular failure (2.890 [1.238 to 6.757]; p = 0.0141) and       bloodstream infection caused by a pathogen other than gram-positive cocci (3.336       [1.390 to 8.006] p = 0.0070) as significant risk factors for death in LVAD      patients with a bloodstream infection. CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infection had a      significant effect on survival after LVAD implantation. Our results suggest that       urgent cardiac transplantation should be considered for LVAD patients with a      bloodstream infection based on the causative organism and right ventricular      function.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
