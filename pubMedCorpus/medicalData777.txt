Our experience with SynCardia Total      Artificial Heart implantation documents its indications, safety, and efficacy.      METHODS: Data regarding preoperative condition, mortality, and morbidity have      been reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: From January 1993 to December 2009, 101      patients had bridge to transplant procedures with the SynCardia Total Artificial       Heart. Ninety-one percent of cases were Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support profile 1, and the remaining 9% of cases were      failing medical therapy on multiple inotropic medications. The mean support time       was 87 days (median, 53 days; range, 1-441 days). Pump outputs during support      were 7 to 9 L/min. Adverse events included strokes in 7.9% of cases and take-back      for hemorrhage in 24.7% of cases. Survival to transplantation was 68.3%. Causes      of death of 32 patients on device support included multiple organ failure (13),      pulmonary failure (6), and neurologic injury (4). Survival after transplantation       at 1, 5, and 10 years was 76.8%, 60.5%, and 41.2%, respectively. The longest-term      survivor is currently alive 16.4 years postimplantation. CONCLUSIONS: These      patients were not candidates for left ventricular assist device therapy and were       expected to die. The SynCardia Total Artificial Heart offers a real alternative      for survival with a reasonable complication rate in appropriate candidates who      otherwise might have been assigned to hospice care.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
