ECLS      and MCS can serve as bridges to recovery, transplantation (heart or lung),      destination therapy, or "bridge to bridge" long-term MCS. Dependent on patient      condition, venoarterial ECMO (V-A ECMO) for heart and lung support, venovenous      ECMO (V-V ECMO) for respiratory support, and MCS for uni- and biventricular      support can be selected properly. Considering small patient body size, the access      sites and cannulation should be selected carefully to obtain adequate blood flow,      minimum injury, and easy management. The applying equipment, including tubing,      cannulae, oxygenator and blood pump, need to be selected optimally in order to      enable rapid setup and priming, successful cannulation and early support, and to       reduce the risk of device-related morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review      manuscript was to discuss briefly the current devices for pediatric ECLS and MCS       available in US.FAU - Undar, AkifAU  - Undar AAD  - Penn State Hershey Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center, Department of      Pediatrics, Penn State Milton S.
