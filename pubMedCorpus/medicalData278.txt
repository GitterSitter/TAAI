MCA devices are      capable of supporting heart and lung function and have emerged as potentially      lifesaving instruments, but may prove to be as hazardous as helpful due to their       inherent tendency toward hemolysis, thromboembolism, and hemorrhage. Although MCA      devices are being used regularly at some specialized centers, surgeries involving      MCA are not as common as other routine cardiac surgeries, and even though      professionals implanting and maintaining short-term MCAs are well acquainted with      operating such devices, it is not uncommon to come across complications as a      result of minor mistakes committed while dealing with them. Avoiding simple      mistakes and taking proper precautions while implanting and maintaining these      devices can prevent major catastrophes. We discuss commonly encountered problems       and complications during the implantation and maintenance of short-term MCAs and       offer reasonable and practical solutions. In addition, crucial issues such as      anticoagulation, replacement of the device circuit, and management of the distal       perfusion cannula are discussed. Continuous and efficient monitoring of the MCA      device and the patient supported on MCA, together with anticipation and avoidance      of complications, is key for successful short-term MCA support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical Support, Royal      Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.FAU - Maunz, OlafAU  - Maunz OFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140217PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - ComplicationsOT  - End-stage heart failureOT  - End-stage lung diseaseOT  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenationOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2014/02/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/19 06:00CRDT- 2014/02/19 06:00PHST- 2014/02/17 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12267 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2014 Oct;38(10):829-37. doi: 10.1111/aor.12267.
