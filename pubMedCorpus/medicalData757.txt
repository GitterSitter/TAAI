Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory      Support (INTERMACS) profiles describe patient condition at pre-implant and      outcome. This study assessed the relationship among inflammation patterns and      INTERMACS profiles in LVAD recipients. METHOD: Thirty ESHF patients undergoing      LVAD implantation as bridge to transplant were enrolled. Blood and urine samples       were collected pre-operatively and serially up to 2 weeks post-operatively for      assessment of inflammatory markers (plasma levels of interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8,      IL-10, and osteopontin, a cardiac inflammatory-remodeling marker; and the urine      neopterin/creatinine ratio, a monocyte activation marker). Multiorgan function      was evaluated by the total sequential organ failure assessment (tSOFA) score.      Outcomes of interest were early survival, post-LVAD tSOFA score, and intensive      care unit (ICU) length of stay. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had INTERMACS profiles       1 or 2 (Group A), and 15 had profiles 3 or 4 (Group B). At pre-implant, only IL-6      levels and the IL-6/IL-10 ratio were higher in Group A vs B. After LVAD      implantation, neopterin/creatinine ratio and IL-8 levels increased more in Group       A vs B. Osteopontin levels increased significantly only in Group B. The tSOFA      score at 2 weeks post-LVAD and ICU duration were related with pre-implant IL-6      levels. CONCLUSIONS: The INTERMACS profiles reflect the severity of the      pre-operative inflammatory activation and the post-implant inflammatory response,      affecting post-operative tSOFA score and ICU stay. Therefore, inflammation may      contribute to poor outcome in patients with severe INTERMACS profile.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
