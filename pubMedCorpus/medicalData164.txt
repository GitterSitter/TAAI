It is a relatively frequent complication among patients with      mechanical circulatory support. Herein, we present a patient with severe heart      failure and sepsis who developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia shortly after      implantation of left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation and      who was successfully treated with fondaparinux.FAU - Velagic, VAU  - Velagic VAD  - Department for Cardiovascular Diseases, University Hospital Centre Zagreb,      Croatia.FAU - Samardzic, JAU  - Samardzic JAD  - Department for Cardiovascular Diseases, University Hospital Centre Zagreb,      Croatia ; University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.FAU - Baricevic, ZAU  - Baricevic ZAD  - Department for Cardiovascular Diseases, University Hospital Centre Zagreb,      Croatia.FAU - Skoric, BAU  - Skoric BAD  - Department for Cardiovascular Diseases, University Hospital Centre Zagreb,      Croatia ; University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.FAU - Cikes, MAU  - Cikes MAD  - Department for Cardiovascular Diseases, University Hospital Centre Zagreb,      Croatia ; University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.FAU - Gasparovic, HAU  - Gasparovic HAD  - University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia ; Department of Cardiac       Surgery, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia.FAU - Biocina, BAU  - Biocina BAD  - University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia ; Department of Cardiac       Surgery, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia.FAU - Milicic, DAU  - Milicic DAD  - Department for Cardiovascular Diseases, University Hospital Centre Zagreb,      Croatia ; University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - IranTA  - Int J Organ Transplant MedJT  - International journal of organ transplantation medicineJID - 101535773PMC - PMC4089335OID - NLM: PMC4089335OTO - NOTNLMOT  - AnticoagulationOT  - Heart failureOT  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopeniaOT  - SepsisOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2014/07/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/12 06:01CRDT- 2014/07/12 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Organ Transplant Med. 2014;5(2):83-6.
