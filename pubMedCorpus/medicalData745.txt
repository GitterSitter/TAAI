The Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) estimates liver function but can be      inaccurate in patients receiving oral anti-coagulation. We evaluated the effect      of liver dysfunction on outcomes after ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation and the dynamic changes in liver dysfunction that occur during VAD      support. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 255 patients (147 with pulsatile      devices and 108 with continuous-flow devices) who received a long-term VAD      between 2000 and 2010. Liver dysfunction was estimated by MELD and MELD-eXcluding      INR (MELD-XI), with patients grouped by a score of >/= 17 or < 17. Primary      outcomes were on-VAD, after transplant, and overall survival. RESULTS: MELD and      MELD-XI correlated highly (R >/= 0.901, p < 0.0001) in patients not on oral      anti-coagulation. Patients with MELD or MELD-XI < 17 had improved on-VAD and      overall survival (p < 0.05) with a higher predictive power for MELD-XI. During      VAD support, cholestasis initially worsened but eventually improved. Patients      with pre-VAD liver dysfunction who survived to transplant had lower      post-transplant survival (p = 0.0193). However, if MELD-XI normalized during VAD       support, post-transplant survival improved and was similar to that of patients      with low MELD-XI scores. CONCLUSIONS: MELD-XI is a viable alternative for      assessing liver dysfunction in heart failure patients on oral anti-coagulation.      Liver dysfunction is associated with worse survival. However, if MELD-XI improves      during VAD support, post-transplant survival is similar to those without prior      liver dysfunction, suggesting an important prognostic role. We also found      evidence of a transient cholestatic state after LVAD implantation that deserves      further examination.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
