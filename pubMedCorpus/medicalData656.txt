Routine postoperative care      encompasses patients who have undergone emergency ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation for acute cardiogenic shock, as a bridge to decision making, and      semi-elective patients who have undergone VAD implantation for end-stage heart      failure, either as destination therapy or as a bridge to heart transplantation.      Early postoperative management should focus on haemodynamic optimisation,      including fluid and inotrope therapy, VAD settings and support of right      ventricular function. Echocardiography is an essential tool in optimising      haemodynamics and identifying complications. Early postoperative complications      include bleeding, arrhythmias, right ventricular failure and infection. Late      postoperative problems include bleeding, thrombosis and thrombo-embolism, device       failure and psychological problems. In a small percentage of patients, weaning      and explantation of the VAD are possible. For patients undergoing VAD      implantation for destination therapy, end-of-life care planning should form part       of the multidisciplinary care of the patient.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
