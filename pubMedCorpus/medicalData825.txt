We evaluated renal function and      intrarenal blood flow in five advanced heart failure patients who had been      supported with a Toyobo LVAS for bridge to heart transplantation. Renal function       expressed as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the      modified formula of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease. Mean blood velocities       in the bilateral segmental arteries during systolic and diastolic perfusion were       measured using duplex Doppler sonography, and renal vascular resistance      (resistive index [RI]) of the segmental arteries was defined as (peak systolic      velocity [PSV]-end-diastolic velocity [EDV])/PSV. All studies were performed      before and after implantation (mean duration of support, 15.6+/-10.9 months).      LVAS implantation significantly improved eGFR (42.7+/-7.9 to 64.1+/-16.3mL/min,      P<0.05). Beat-by-beat measurements of heart rate did not change significantly.      Mean PSV decreased significantly (38.2+/-8.9 to 28.3+/-2.2cm/s, P<0.05), and mean      EDV increased significantly (8.3+/-3.2 to 11.3+/-1.3cm/s, P<0.05), and thus, mean      RI was significantly improved (0.79+/-0.06 to 0.60+/-0.04, P<0.01). In      conclusion, in advanced heart failure patients, pulsatile LVAS implantation is      associated with improved renal function, and this improvement may be mediated in       part through an improvement of intrarenal hemodynamics.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.
