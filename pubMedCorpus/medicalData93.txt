Among other factors, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy seems to represent an      important prerequisite for MCS-related cardiac recovery. We have previously shown      that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) leads to adaptive cardiomyocyte      hypertrophy associated with a protective cardiac function in transgenic mice. To       test whether a functional genetic variant in the CTGF promoter impacts      MCS-related cardiac recovery, three groups of iDCM patients with and without      cardiac recovery on MCS were genotyped. METHODS: The CTGF promoter variant      (c.-945C>G) was analysed in 314 patients with iDCM receiving medical treatment      only (Group I). Forty-nine iDCM patients who were either weaned from MCS for more      than 6 months (Group II; n=20) or bridged to cardiac transplantation (Group III:       n=29) were also genotyped. Patients on MCS were followed up for at least 12      months. Clinical characteristics and outcome on MCS were correlated with the      respective genotypes. RESULTS: The c.-945C>G allele frequencies in 314 iDCM      patients (Group I) were similar to controls deposited in the HapMap database or      those published in a recent study. There were no differences in allele prevalence      between patients with mild to moderate iDCM (Group I) compared with patients with      severe iDCM requiring MCS (Groups II and III). Intriguingly, 50% of patients who       were weaned from MCS (Group II) were homozygous for the G allele compared with      only 17.2% of patients included in Group III, which is a significant difference      (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Homozygosity of the promoter-activating G allele in the      CTGF_c.-945C>G variant is overrepresented in patients with cardiac recovery on      MCS when compared with iDCM patients without cardiac recovery. Further studies      are needed to evaluate c.-945C>G as a genetic predictor for clinical outcome on      MCS.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
