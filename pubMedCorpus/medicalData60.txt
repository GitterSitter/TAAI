At the present time, there are      only limited means of quantifying disease severity or the concomitant morbidity      for this population. This study describes the development of a novel pediatric      treatment intensity score (TIS), designed to quantify the burden of illness and      clinical trajectory in children on VAD support. METHODS: There were 5 clinical      domains assessed: nutrition, respiratory support, activity level, cardiovascular       medications, and care environment. A scale was developed through expert      consensus. Higher scores indicate greater morbidity as reflected by intensity of       medical management. To evaluate feasibility and face validity, the TIS was      applied retrospectively to a subset of pediatric inpatients with VADs. The      Bland-Altman method was used to assess limits of agreement. RESULTS: The study      comprised 39 patients with 42 implantations. Bland-Altman interobserver and      intraobserver comparisons showed good agreement (mean differences in scores of      0.02, limits of agreement +/-0.12). Trends in TIS were concordant with the      overall clinical impression of improvement. Scores remained >/=0.6 preceding VAD       implantation and peaked at 0.71 3 days after VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: We      describe a pediatric VAD scoring tool, to assess global patient morbidity and      clinical recovery. We demonstrate feasibility of using this TIS in a test      population of inpatients on VAD support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
