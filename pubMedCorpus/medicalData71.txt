OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: A hermeneutic-phenomenological inquiry guided by van      Manen's methods was used to explore the LVAD-DT family caregiving      experience.Participants/Setting-Seven family caregivers (1 man and 6 women) 50 to      74 years old who cared for an adult with an LVAD-DT in home settings. Recruitment      and data collection occurred in an outpatient mechanical circulatory support      center in the Midwest. METHODS: Data were collected by means of face-to-face      interviews using open-ended questions and 1 follow-up interview. Interviews were       audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis consisted of writing,       rewriting, and reflecting across participants' data, which produced themes      illustrating the experience and meaning of caring for an adult with an LVAD-DT.      Themes were consensually validated. Procedures for trustworthiness are described.      RESULTS: Five main themes were identified from participants' experiences: (1)      advanced heart failure is a life-changing event, (2) self-doubt about LVAD      caregiving improves over time, (3) lifestyle adjustments come with time, (4)      persistent worry and stress, and (5) caregiving is not a burden-it's a part of      life. These main themes were elucidated by 8 subthemes in which participants      described a process of adjustment despite persistent worry and stress and      eventually accepted caregiving as part of their lives. Future studies are needed       to explore caregiver burden, adaptation, and the effects of caregiving outcomes,       such as emotional and physical health and overall quality of life.FAU - Marcuccilli, LindaAU  - Marcuccilli LAD  - Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.FAU - Casida, Jesus JessieAU  - Casida JJAD  - The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.FAU - Bakas, TamilynnAU  - Bakas TAD  - Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.FAU - Pagani, Francis DAU  - Pagani FDAD  - The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.LA  - engGR  - 5T32 NR007066/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - Prog TransplantJT  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)JID - 100909380SB  - NMH  - AgedMH  - Caregivers/*psychologyMH  - Family/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*nursing/*psychologyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedEDAT- 2014/12/10 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/13 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/10 06:00AID - LJH58WH6372L5713 [pii]AID - 10.7182/pit2014684 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Prog Transplant. 2014 Dec;24(4):332-40. doi: 10.7182/pit2014684.
