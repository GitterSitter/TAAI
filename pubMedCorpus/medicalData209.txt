METHODS AND RESULTS: The Penn Heart Failure Study (PHFS) is a prospective cohort       of 1821 chronic HF patients recruited from tertiary HF clinics. Participants were      divided into 3 categories based on echocardiograms: HF-REF if EF was <50%, HF-PEF      if EF was consistently >/=50%, and HF-Recovered if EF on enrollment in PHFS was      >/=50% but prior EF was <50%. A significant portion of HF-Recovered patients had       an abnormal biomarker profile at baseline, including 44% with detectable troponin      I, although in comparison, median levels of brain natriuretic factor, soluble      fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1, troponin I, and creatinine were greater in      HF-REF and HF-PEF patients. In unadjusted Cox models over a maximum follow-up of       8.9 years, the hazard ratio for death, transplantation, or ventricular assist      device placement in HF-REF patients was 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-6.8;      P<0.001) and in HF-PEF patients was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.5;      P=0.013) compared with HF-Recovered patients. The unadjusted hazard ratio for      cardiac hospitalization in HF-REF patients was 2.0 (95% confidence interval,      1.5-2.7; P<0.001) and in HF-PEF patients was 1.3 (95% confidence interval,      0.90-2.0; P=0.15) compared with HF-Recovered patients. Results were similar in      adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: HF-Recovered is associated with a better biomarker       profile and event-free survival than HF-REF and HF-PEF. However, these patients      still have abnormalities in biomarkers and experience a significant number of HF       hospitalizations, suggesting persistent HF risk.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Basuray, AnupamAU  - Basuray AAD  - From the University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Harrington Heart and Vascular       Institute, Cleveland, OH (A.B., J.C.F.);
