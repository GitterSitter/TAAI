METHODS: Small children (</= 10 kg)      bridged to HTx with VADs between 2004 and 2010 were identified in the United      Network for Organ Sharing database. Survival was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier      method, and 2:1 propensity matching was used to compare outcomes with a      well-matched control cohort of nonbridged HTx recipients. RESULTS: Of the 803      small children who underwent HTx during the study period, 59 (7%) were bridged      with a VAD. The proportion of recipients that were bridged with a VAD increased      from 3% in 2004 to 9% in 2010 (p = 0.03). Kaplan-Meier 30-day, 6-month, and      1-year survival was comparable between those bridged with a VAD and 118      well-matched nonbridged children. Rates of postoperative renal failure,      reoperation, infection, and rejection were also comparable. Those bridged with a       VAD had a significantly higher rate of postoperative stroke (8.5% vs 0.9%; p =      0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Small children bridged to HTx with a VAD have early survival      rates that are comparable to nonbridged children; however, this is achieved at      the expense of a higher rate of stroke. Identifying the risk factors for early      death and stroke in small children bridged to HTx with VADs is prudent as more      experience with this patient population accumulates.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
