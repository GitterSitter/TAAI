On the other hand, left ventricular      assist devices (LVADs) have proven to be effective in improving survival and      quality of life in patients with refractory HF. The challenge encountered by      multidisciplinary teams in dealing with advanced HF lies in identifying patients       who could benefit more from HTx as compared to LVAD implantation and the      appropriate timing. The decision-making is based on clinical parameters,      imaging-based data and risk scores. Current outcome of HF patients supported by      LVAD (2-year survival around 70%) is rapidly improving and leads the way to a new      therapeutic strategy. Patients who have a low likelihood to gain access to the      heart graft pool could benefit more from LVAD implantation (defined as bridge to       transplantation indication) than from remaining on HTx waiting list with the      likely risk of clinical deterioration or removal from the list because patients      are no longer suitable for transplantation. LVAD has also demonstrated to be      effective in patients who are not considered eligible candidates for HTx with a      destination therapy indication. HTx should be reserved to those patients for whom      the maximum clinical benefit can be expected, such as young patients with no      comorbidities. Here we discuss the current listing criteria for HTx and      indications to implant of LVAD for patients with refractory acute and chronic HF       based on the guidelines and the practical experience of our center.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 European Federation of Internal Medicine.
