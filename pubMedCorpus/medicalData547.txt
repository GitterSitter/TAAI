Several studies showed that use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      in patients with fixed PH who were initially deemed ineligible for HTx      effectively decreased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), thus permitting HTx. We       recently encountered a candidate for HTx who had severe PH with extremely high      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). A 27-year-old female who had been diagnosed       with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and who was approved for HTx at      age 25 was referred to our institute because of severe fatigability with moderate      dyspnea even at rest due to severe bilateral heart failure. Despite continuous      inotrope infusion, the patient's symptoms were not relieved. Right heart      catheterization (RHC) disclosed a PAP of 62/40 mmHg with severely reduced cardiac      output (1.8 l/min). A PVR of 15.9 Wood units suggested progressive worsening of      left ventricular function with almost irreversible remodeling of the pulmonary      vasculature, and the patient was thought to be contraindicated for HTx. Following      3 weeks of aggressive medical treatment, repeat RHC demonstrated PVR lowering to       8.16 Wood units. This suggested it was likely that PVR could be reversed, and the      patient underwent LVAD implantation. RHC performed after LVAD implantation showed      a fall in PVR from the initial, extremely high measurement of 15.9 Wood units to       3.4 Wood units at 2 months postoperatively, and to 2.2 Wood units at 1 year. The       patient is currently awaiting HTx with favorable LVAD support.FAU - Sato, TakumaAU  - Sato TAD  - Division of Transplantation, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Osaka,       Japan.FAU - Seguchi, OsamuAU  - Seguchi OFAU - Morikawa, NagisaAU  - Morikawa NFAU - Hieda, MichinariAU  - Hieda MFAU - Watanabe, TakuyaAU  - Watanabe TFAU - Sunami, HarukiAU  - Sunami HFAU - Murata, YoshihiroAU  - Murata YFAU - Yanase, MasanobuAU  - Yanase MFAU - Hata, HirokiAU  - Hata HFAU - Fujita, TomoyukiAU  - Fujita TFAU - Nakatani, TakeshiAU  - Nakatani TLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130227PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Hypertension, Pulmonary/*physiopathologyMH  - Vascular Resistance/*physiologyEDAT- 2013/02/28 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/02/28 06:00PHST- 2012/12/06 [received]PHST- 2013/01/30 [accepted]PHST- 2013/02/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-013-0695-3 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2013 Jun;16(2):253-7. doi: 10.1007/s10047-013-0695-3.
