Two therapeutic strategies have emerged with the potential to      improve the landscape of the clinical management of heart failure. First, left      ventricular assist device therapy is able to sustain the circulation of patients       in end-stage heart failure and may promote cardiac recovery. Secondly, stem cell       therapy can potentially be used to induce myocardial regeneration replacing lost       or non-functioning native myocardium. In this review, we present evidence that      these strategies may overlap significantly in their mechanisms of action at the      systems, organ, tissue and cellular levels. We review the current clinical      evidence of their combined use.FAU - Ibrahim, MichaelAU  - Ibrahim MAD  - National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, Heart Science Centre,      Harefield Hospital, London, UK.FAU - Rao, ChristopherAU  - Rao CFAU - Athanasiou, ThanosAU  - Athanasiou TFAU - Yacoub, Magdi HAU  - Yacoub MHFAU - Terracciano, Cesare MAU  - Terracciano CMLA  - engGR  - Wellcome Trust/United KingdomPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20120229PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Heart/*physiologyMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Myocytes, Cardiac/physiologyMH  - Regeneration/*physiologyMH  - Stem Cell Transplantation/*methodsMH  - Ventricular Remodeling/physiologyEDAT- 2012/03/02 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/10 06:00CRDT- 2012/03/02 06:00PHST- 2012/02/29 [aheadofprint]AID - ezs067 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs067 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Aug;42(2):312-8. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs067.
