The short- and      long-term impact of these devices on peripheral blood gene expression has not      been characterized, and may provide insight into the molecular pathways mediated       in response to left ventricular remodeling and an improvement in overall systemic      circulation. We performed RNA sequencing to identify genes and pathways      influenced by these devices. METHODS: RNA was extracted from blood of 9 heart      failure patients (8 male) prior to LVAD implantation, and at 7 and 180 days      postoperatively. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 and sequences       mapped to the human Ensembl GRCh37.67 genome assembly. RESULTS: A specific set of      genes involved in regulating cellular immune response, antigen presentation, and       T cell activation and survival were down-regulated 7 days after LVAD placement. 6      months following LVAD placement, the expression levels of these genes were      significantly increased; yet importantly, remained significantly lower than age      and sex-matched samples from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this      genomic analysis identified a significant decrease in the expression of genes      that promote a healthy immune response in patients with heart failure that was      partially restored 6 months following LVAD implant.FAU - Mitchell, AdamAU  - Mitchell AAD  - Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America ; Division of Cardiology,      Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United      States of America.FAU - Guan, WeihuaAU  - Guan WFAU - Staggs, RodneyAU  - Staggs RFAU - Hamel, AimeeAU  - Hamel AFAU - Hozayen, SamehAU  - Hozayen SFAU - Adhikari, NeetaAU  - Adhikari NFAU - Grindle, SuzanneAU  - Grindle SFAU - Desir, SniderAU  - Desir SFAU - John, RanjitAU  - John RFAU - Hall, Jennifer LAU  - Hall JLFAU - Eckman, PeterAU  - Eckman PLA  - engGR  - 1R21HL104596-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20131021PL  - United StatesTA  - PLoS OneJT  - PloS oneJID - 101285081RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Biological Markers/*bloodMH  - Blotting, WesternMH  - FemaleMH  - *Gene Expression ProfilingMH  - Heart Failure/*blood/*genetics/surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/*adverse effectsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence AnalysisMH  - RNA, Messenger/geneticsMH  - Real-Time Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Time FactorsPMC - PMC3804545OID - NLM: PMC3804545EDAT- 2013/11/10 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/05 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/09 06:00PHST- 2013 [ecollection]PHST- 2013/04/22 [received]PHST- 2013/09/06 [accepted]PHST- 2013/10/21 [epublish]AID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0077951 [doi]AID - PONE-D-13-16384 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - PLoS One. 2013 Oct 21;8(10):e77951. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0077951.      eCollection 2013.
