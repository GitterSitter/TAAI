METHODS:      The ReVOLVE is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm registry performed at      seven centers in Europe and two in Australia. Herein we describe a total of 254      commercial HVAD implants according to labeled indications between February 2009      and November 2012. Summary statistics included patients' demographics, adverse      events, length of support and outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with the clinical trial      supporting the CE Mark of the HeartWare system, patient selection differed in      that patients were older, and there were higher proportions of females and      patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathies in the ReVOLVE cohort. Duration of      support ranged from 1 to 1,057 days, with a mean of 363 +/- 280 days (median      299.5 days). Transplantation was done in 56 patients (22%), explant for recovery       was performed in 3 patients (1%), 43 died while on support (17%), and 152 (60%)      remain on the device. Success in patients with the HeartWare system was 87% at 6       months, 85% at 1 year, 79% at 2 years and 73% at 3 years. Adverse event rates      were low, comparable or improved when compared to the CE Mark Trial. CONCLUSION:       Real-world use of the HeartWare system continues to demonstrate excellent      clinical outcomes in patients supported with the device.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
