The purpose of our      study was to examine differences in HRQOL from before mechanical circulatory      support (MCS) through 1 year after surgery by Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) patient profiles. METHODS:       Data from 1,559 adults with advanced heart failure who received primary      continuous-flow pumps between June 23, 2006, and March 31, 2010, and were      enrolled in INTERMACS were analyzed. HRQOL data were collected using the EQ-5D-3L      survey before implantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation.      Statistical analyses included chi-square and t-tests, using all available data      for each time period. Paired t-tests and sensitivity analyses were also      conducted. RESULTS: HRQOL was poor before MCS implantation among patients with      INTERMACS profiles 1 to 7 and significantly improved after MCS implantation for      all profiles. Stratified by INTERMACS profile, problems within each of the 5      dimensions of HRQOL (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and      anxiety/depression) generally decreased from before to after implantation. By 6      months after implantation, patients with all INTERMACS profiles reported similar       frequencies of problems for all HRQOL dimensions. Paired t-tests and sensitivity       analyses supported almost all of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is poor among      advanced heart failure patients with INTERMACS profiles 1 to 7 before MCS      implantation and improves to similar levels for patients who remained on MCS 1      year after surgery. Patients have problems in HRQOL dimensions before and after      MCS; however, the frequency of reporting problems decreases for all dimensions      within most profiles across time.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Grady, Kathleen LAU  - Grady KLAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, Northwestern University,      Chicago, Illinois.
