Since the arrival of newer ventricular assist devices,      mechanical circulatory support constitutes an alternative therapy for patients      with advanced heart failure. The first-generation of pulsatile-flow devices were       used only for bridging the sickest patients to transplantation. Frequent adverse       events, limited durability and the patients' discomfort made them unsuitable for       lifetime support. The second-generation continuous-flow devices were smaller,      quieter and more durable. Survival rates of patients improved significantly. This      led to a marked growth of device implantations, largely caused by an increase of       lifetime support. Survival of destination therapy patients is somewhat inferior      to the survival of bridge-to-transplant patients, in part due to their co-morbid       conditions which limit life expectancy. A subgroup of patients on destination      therapy with advanced, but stable heart failure and a low-risk profile reach      short-term survival rates equal or superior to the survival after heart      transplantation. These patients may be offered the choice of destination therapy       versus heart transplantation. However it remains unclear if long-term survival,      quality of life and functional status on lifetime support can compete with the      excellent results after transplantation. A trend to implanting devices at earlier      stages of heart failure has begun. In a current trial, patients with advanced,      but stable heart failure are randomised to destination therapy versus optimal      medical therapy. The results of this trial will be expected to more precisely      determine the place of mechanical circulatory support in the treatment of      advanced heart failure.FAU - Wilhelm, Markus JAU  - Wilhelm MJAD  - Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.      markus.wilhelm@usz.chFAU - Ruschitzka, FrankAU  - Ruschitzka FFAU - Falk, VolkmarAU  - Falk VLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130325PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Swiss Med WklyJT  - Swiss medical weeklyJID - 100970884SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Patient Care PlanningMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2013/04/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/11 06:00AID - 10.4414/smw.2013.13729 [doi]AID - smw-13729 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Swiss Med Wkly. 2013 Mar 25;143:w13729. doi: 10.4414/smw.2013.13729.
