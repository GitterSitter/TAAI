Patients seek out      informational resources when considering implantation. The primary study      objective was to characterize the scope and quality of available LVAD educational      materials. METHODS AND RESULTS: In July 2013, we performed a cross-sectional      search of Internet, print, and multimedia resources available to patients      considering LVAD. Written materials <10 sentences, videos <2 minutes, and      materials clearly directed to healthcare professionals were excluded.      Seventy-seven materials met inclusion criteria. Potential benefits of LVAD      therapy were discussed in all (n=77), whereas less often mentioned were risks      (n=43), lifestyle considerations (n=29), surgical details (n=26), caregiver      information (n=9), and hospice or palliative care (n=2). Of the 14 materials that      recognized a decision or alternate treatment option, 7 used outdated statistics,       12 scored above an eighth grade reading comprehension level, and 12 met <50% of      International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. In the survey participants      rated all but one as biased toward accepting LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although       many resources exist for patients considering an LVAD, the content is suboptimal.      Benefits of LVADs are often presented in the absence of risks, alternative      options, and caregiver considerations. Most materials use outdated statistics,      are above the reading level of average Americans, and are biased toward accepting      LVAD therapy. There is no tool that would qualify as a formal decision aid.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Iacovetto, Matthew CAU  - Iacovetto MCAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital,       Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School       of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).FAU - Matlock, Daniel DAU  - Matlock DDAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital,       Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School       of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).FAU - McIlvennan, Colleen KAU  - McIlvennan CKAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital,       Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School       of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).FAU - Thompson, Jocelyn SAU  - Thompson JSAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital,       Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School       of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).FAU - Bradley, WilliamAU  - Bradley WAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital,       Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School       of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).FAU - LaRue, Shane JAU  - LaRue SJAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital,       Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School       of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).FAU - Allen, Larry AAU  - Allen LAAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital,       Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School       of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.). larry.allen@ucdenver.edu.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20141014PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual OutcomesJT  - Circulation.
