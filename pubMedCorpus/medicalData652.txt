A 29-year-old woman had undergone anthracycline-based chemotherapy as a      teenager in 1991 and 1992 and received a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy 10      years later. Optimal medical therapy had initially controlled the symptoms of      heart failure. However, in June 2006, the symptoms worsened to New York Heart      Association functional class IV status. We implanted a continuous-flow left      ventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation; of note, a left      ventricular core biopsy at that time showed no replacement fibrosis. The      patient's clinical status improved thereafter, enabling left ventricular assist      device ex-plantation after 17 months. To our knowledge, this is the first report       of the use of left ventricular assist device support to reverse chronic      anthracycline-induced heart failure.FAU - Khan, NadeemAU  - Khan NAD  - Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's Episcopal      Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.FAU - Husain, Syed ArmanAU  - Husain SAFAU - Husain, Syed ImanAU  - Husain SIFAU - Khalaf, NataliaAU  - Khalaf NFAU - George, JoggyAU  - George JFAU - Raissi, FarshadAU  - Raissi FFAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMFAU - Kar, BiswajitAU  - Kar BFAU - Bogaev, Roberta CAU  - Bogaev RCFAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Tex Heart Inst JJT  - Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke's      Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children's HospitalJID - 8214622RN  - 0 (Anthracyclines)RN  - 0 (Antineoplastic Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Anthracyclines/*adverse effectsMH  - Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effectsMH  - BiopsyMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/chemically induced/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - Device RemovalMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/chemically induced/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Ventricles/drug effects/physiopathology/ultrastructureMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hodgkin Disease/drug therapyMH  - HumansMH  - Microscopy, ElectronMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Remission InductionMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftPMC - PMC3423291OID - NLM: PMC3423291OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Anthracyclines/adverse effectsOT  - cardiomyopathies/chemically inducedOT  - heart failure/chemically inducedOT  - heart-assist devicesOT  - heart/drug effectsOT  - recovery of functionOT  - treatment outcomeOT  - ventricular dysfunction, leftEDAT- 2012/09/06 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/23 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/06 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Tex Heart Inst J. 2012;39(4):554-6.
