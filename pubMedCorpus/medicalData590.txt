Bearings obtained       from HMII pumps explanted after clinical use in the Destination Therapy and      Bridge to Transplantation clinical trials were analyzed for wear using surface      profilometry. Geometric profile variations measured on the inlet bearing ball      were used to calculate the wear. Bearing wear was normalized to the total pump      support duration to obtain an annualized bearing wear rate. Bearing life was      estimated assuming a linear wear rate, as the time to reach a wear limit of 25      microm, which includes a 3x safety factor, to ensure that there is no contact      between the rotor blades and the blood bore housing. One hundred and eighty-three      bearings from left ventricular assist devices implanted in 181 patients were      analyzed. Average age of the patients was 56.3 +/- 14.6 years, 76% were male, 46%      had an ischemic etiology of heart failure. Mean support duration for the pumps      was 363 +/- 349 days (median: 238, range: 1-1,621 days). Sixty pumps (33%) were      explanted at heart transplantation, 20 (11%) after device replacement, 6 (3%) for      ventricular recovery, 94 (51%) after patient death, and 3 (2%) were explanted for      other reasons. Mean bearing wear was 0.59 +/- 0.37 microm (median: 0.46 microm      [5-95% interval: 0.25-1.48]). The median bearing wear rate for patients supported      for at least 1 year was 0.30 [5-95% interval: 0.09-0.94] microm/yr. The 5-95%      limits of the bearing wear rate corresponded to an estimated bearing life between      27 and 269 years. The pump having the highest bearing wear rate (1.46 microm/yr)       had an estimated bearing life of at least 17 years. HMII bearing wear is      extremely small, with an estimated bearing life well in excess of 17 years; it is      not a limiting factor for long-term support with the HMII left ventricular      assistive system.FAU - Sundareswaran, Kartik SAU  - Sundareswaran KSAD  - Department of Research and Development, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton,      California, USA.
