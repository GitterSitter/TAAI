These      carry significant cost and quality of life implications. We sought to describe      the etiology and pattern of readmission among patients receiving CF-LVADs.      METHODS: Frequency, reason, urgency, and duration of readmission as well as      freedom from readmission were examined in a retrospective review of our      institutional experience. As an indirect means of quality of life, the ratio of      days out of hospital (OOH)/days alive with device was calculated. RESULTS: From      2006 to 2011, 71 adult patients implanted with a CF device were included.      Indication for device implantation was bridge to transplant (n=19), potential      bridge to transplant (n=25), or destination therapy (n=27). Length of support      averaged 359 days. Total support time was 69.7 patient years. One hundred      fifty-five readmissions accounted for a total of 1,659 hospital days. Fifty-six      patients were readmitted during the study period. Median time to first      readmission was 48 days (range 2 to 663 days). Median length of stay was 5 days.       The single most common etiology for readmission was gastrointestinal bleeding      accounting for 14% of readmissions. Readmissions were urgent (87%), elective      (10%), or life-threatening (3%). Patients on the average enjoyed 92% of their      time OOH. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing CF-LVAD support are often readmitted      within 6 months of discharge. Readmissions tend to be of short duration and the      most common reason is for gastrointestinal bleeding. Importantly, following      discharge after implant procedure, 51 patients spent at least 90% of days OOH.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
