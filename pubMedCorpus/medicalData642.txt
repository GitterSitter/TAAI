However, the effect       of long-term CF with lack of peripheral arterial wall motions on blood pressure      regulation and end-organ arterial wall sclerosis, especially in the case of      long-term support (> 3 years), remains unclear. METHODS: Tissue samples obtained       at autopsy from liver, kidney, coronary arteries, and brain from 27 VAD      recipients supported for > 180 days between 2000 and 2010 were histologically      examined to assess vascular alterations, including perivascular infiltrate,      intravascular infiltrate, wall thickness, thrombosis, endothelial cell swelling,       vessel wall necrosis, and peri-vascular fibrosis. Pulsatile-flow (PF) devices had      been inserted in 9 patients and CF devices had been inserted in 16. The      pathologist was blinded to the group distribution. Demographic, pharmacologic,      and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed before surgery and during the      follow-up period of up to 24 months. RESULTS: Median duration of support was 467       days (range, 235-1,588 days) in the PF group and 263 days (range, 182-942 days)      in the CF group. Demographic and clinical data before and after surgery were      similar. Amiodarone was more often used during follow-up in CF group than in the       PF group (61% vs 10%, p = 0.009). Throughout the follow-up period, mean arterial       pressure did not differ between recipients of the 2 pump types, nor did systolic       and diastolic pressure, except at 2 weeks after VAD implantation, when systolic      blood pressure was higher (p = 0.05) and diastolic lower (p = 0.03) in the PF      group. Histologic studies did not identify any relevant differences in arterial      wall characteristics between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Long-term mechanical      circulatory support with CF devices does not adversely influence arterial wall      properties of the end-organ vasculature.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
