There are numerous devices available that offer patients short-, intermediate-,      and long-term duration of support depending on their clinical needs and cardiac      recovery. Each device has its own technical considerations and the decision which      device to use depends on several factors, including what is available, the degree      of support required, and expected duration of support. Additional issues that      need to be considered in choosing level of support include right heart function,       respiratory failure, and multi-organ derangements. A widespread availability of      short-term ventricular assist devices and timely institution for effective      hemodynamic support will translate into improved patient outcomes whether that is      successful transfer to a tertiary care facility or recovery of inherent cardiac      function. Implantable ventricular assist devices have and will continue to evolve      into smaller and more durable devices, and the future for patients with advanced       heart failure looks ever-more promising.FAU - Stulak, John MAU  - Stulak JMAD  - John M.
