We investigated whether additional clinical      variables might further specify risk of death, ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation (INTERMACS <4) or heart transplantation (HTx, Status 1A or 1B)      within 1 year after HTx evaluation. We hypothesized that right ventricular stroke      work index (RVSWI), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and the model for      end-stage liver disease-albumin score (MELD-A) would be additive prognostic      predictors. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on 151 ambulatory patients      undergoing HTx evaluation. Primary outcomes were defined as HTx, LVAD or death      within 1 year after evaluation. RESULTS: Average age in our cohort was 55 +/-      11.1 years, 79.1% were male and 39% had an ischemic etiology (LVEF 21 +/- 10.5%      and peak VO(2) 12.6 +/- 3.5 ml/kg/min). Fifty outcomes (33.1%) were observed (27       HTxs, 15 VADs and 8 deaths). Univariate logistic regression showed a significant       association of RVSWI (OR 0.47, p = 0.036), PCWP (OR 2.65, p = 0.007) and MELD-A      (OR 2.73, p = 0.006) with 1-year events. Stepwise regression showed an      independent correlation of RVSWI<5gm-m(2)/beat (OR 6.70, p < 0.01), PCWP>20 mm Hg      (OR 5.48, p < 0.01), MELD-A>14 (OR 3.72, p< 0.01) and peak VO(2)<14 ml/kg/min (OR      3.36, p = 0.024) with 1-year events. A scoring system was developed: MELD-A>14      and peak VO(2)<14-1 point each; and PCWP>20 and RVSWI<5-2 points each. A cut-off       at>/=4 demonstrated a 54% sensitivity and 88% specificity for 1-year events.      CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory HF patients have significant 1-year event rates. Risk      stratification based on exercise performance, left-sided congestion, right      ventricular dysfunction and liver congestion allows prediction of 1-year      prognosis. Our findings support early and timely referral for VAD and/or      transplant.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.
