We      explored the hypothesis that certain patient profiles are more likely to exhibit       LV recovery during LVAD support. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of      data from the HeartMate II bridge to transplant (BTT) and destination therapy      (DT) trials was conducted, including 490 BTT, 600 DT, and 18 compassionate-use      patients. Of the 1,108 patients, 20 (1.8%; 10 BTT, 10 DT) were explanted owing to      LV recovery. The median age was 33 years, and 12 patients (60%) were <40 years of      age. History of heart failure was <1 year for 11 patients (61%), and the primary       etiology was nonischemic (90%). Of the patients with nonischemic etiologies and      <1-year history of heart failure, 13% were explanted. Three patients required      LVAD reimplantation; of the remaining 17, 16 remain alive. At follow-up (median      510 days), the mean ejection fraction was 42% (20%-67%) and the mean left      ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 55 +/- 8 mm. At the 2-year follow-up (n =       13), patients were New York Heart Association functional class I or II and      overall survival rate was 85 +/- 11%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study      suggest that LV recovery is most likely to occur in young patients (<40 years)      with nonischemic cardiomyopathy of <1 year duration. Two-year postexplant      survival was excellent.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
