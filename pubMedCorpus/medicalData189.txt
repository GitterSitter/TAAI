We sought to determine CRT response in      patients with a prior history of CVS. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a      retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired cohort of CRT patients with      history of CVS. Echocardiographic response was evaluated at baseline and 6      months. The coprimary endpoints were time to first heart failure (HF)      hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality, transplantation and left       ventricular assist device (LVAD) assessed over a 3-year follow-up period. The      study group consisted of 569 patients undergoing CRT. Of these, 86 patients had a      history of CVS (46.5% aortic, 37.2% mitral, 16.3% combined, and tricuspid), and      were compared to 483 patients with no history of CVS. Baseline clinical and      echocardiographic characteristics were not significantly different between the      groups except for a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF; 74.4% vs. 55.3%;      P = 0.001), coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG; 58.1% vs. 38.7%; P = 0.001),      and longer QRS duration (167.6 +/- 29.3 milliseconds vs. 159.4 +/- 27.5      milliseconds; P = 0.01) in those with prior CVS. Survival with respect to HF      hospitalization and composite outcome was comparable in both groups.      Echocardiographic response (improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction of       >/=10%) was similar. No difference in clinical or echocardiographic outcome was      found by type of valve surgery performed. CONCLUSION: Despite a higher incidence       of AF, CABG, and longer QRS duration, history of CVS is not associated with worse      clinical or echocardiographic outcome after CRT.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Bose, AbhishekAU  - Bose AAD  - Cardiac Arrhythmia Service, Corrigan Minehan Institute Heart Center,      Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.FAU - Upadhyay, Gaurav AAU  - Upadhyay GAFAU - Kandala, JagdeshAU  - Kandala JFAU - Heist, Edwin KAU  - Heist EKFAU - Mela, TheofanieAU  - Mela TFAU - Parks, Kimberly AAU  - Parks KAFAU - Singh, Jagmeet PAU  - Singh JPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140707PL  - United StatesTA  - J Cardiovasc ElectrophysiolJT  - Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiologyJID - 9010756SB  - IMCIN - J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol. 2014 Nov;25(11):1214-5.
