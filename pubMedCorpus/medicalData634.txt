Myocardial recovery is      more evident in recent onset nonischemic cardiomyopathy (ROCM); however, the      prevalence of BTR in this subset has not been addressed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We       examined the use of LVAD support for subjects with ROCM in the Intervention in      Myocarditis and Acute Cardiomyopathy 2 (IMAC2) study. The overall cohort (n =      373) was 38% female, 21% black, with a mean age of 45 +/- 14 years. LVAD support       was used in 3.8% (n = 14, 43% female, age 32 +/- 10). Of LVAD subjects, 57%      (8/14) were BTR, including 73% (8/11) of subjects with symptoms </=4 months at      the time of support. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was smaller       in BTR than nonrecovered (NR) subjects (P = .04). Myocardial inflammation was      more common in BTR (75% versus 0%, P = .005), whereas fibrosis was less evident      (25% versus 100%, P = .005). Of BTR subjects, 7/8 (87.5%) were alive and free of       transplant with median follow-up of 19 months. CONCLUSION: In a multicenter      registry of ROCM, BTR was common and occurred in the majority of subjects      requiring LVAD support. Histology and LVEDD may assist in predicting potential      for BTR in ROCM.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012.
