Little is known about the      incidence, risk factors and outcomes of NA in large numbers of pediatric heart      transplant (HT) recipients. METHODS: Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN)       data were used to identify all children <18 years of age in the U.S.A. who      underwent HT from October 1999 to January 2007. Cox proportional hazards analysis      was used to identify risk factors for NA and the effect on graft survival.      RESULTS: Of 2,070 pediatric heart transplants performed the median age at      transplant was 6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 13 years); 40% had      congenital heart disease (CHD), 7% were re-transplants, 42% were non-white and      43% had Medicaid insurance. Overall, 186 (9%) children had a report of NA at a      median age of 15 years with more than two-thirds of NA episodes occurring after      12 years of age. Factors independently associated with NA were: adolescent age at      transplant (hazard ratio [HR] 7.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 12,      compared with infants); black race (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.3, compared with      white); Medicaid insurance (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.7, compared with non-Medicaid      insurance); and ventilator or ventricular assist device (VAD) support at      transplant. The risk of mortality conditional upon report of NA was 26% at 1 year      and 33% at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Medication NA is an important problem in      pediatric HT recipients and is associated with high mortality. Adolescent age,      black race, Medicaid insurance and invasive hemodynamic support at transplant      were associated with NA, whereas time on the wait list and gender were not.      Targeted interventions among at-risk populations may be warranted.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.
