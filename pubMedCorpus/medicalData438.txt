Ventricular assist device therapy is fast      becoming an accepted alternative treatment to treat end-stage heart failure and      is being implemented as a bridge to decision, bridge to myocardial recovery,      bridge to heart transplantation or as a destination therapy. LVADs not only      enable hemodynamic stabilization and recovery of secondary organ failure in      severely ill patients, but have also been shown to reduce pulmonary vascular      resistance in nontransplantable candidates. Technology of ventricular assist      devices has evolved over several decades of time and generations of devices. The       HVAD(R) Pump (HeartWare International, Inc., MA, USA) is a third-generation,      miniaturized, continuous-flow ventricular assist device. Due to its miniaturized       housing and intrapericardial placing, it can be used proficiently to support the       right ventricle and has also demonstrated great utility in minimally invasive and      off-pump implantation, exchange and explantation. It is favored for similar      reasons in adolescents and in heart failure due to complex congenital heart      disease. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical use of      HeartWare(R) Ventricular Assist System (HeartWare System; HeartWare      International, Inc.) with different strategies pertaining to its advantages and      adverse events in comparison with contemporary devices.FAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation & Mechanical Circulatory Support,      Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Harefield Hospital, Hill End      Road, Harefield, Middlesex UB9 6JH, UK.FAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARFAU - Popov, Aron FAU  - Popov AFLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Med DevicesJT  - Expert review of medical devicesJID - 101230445SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AnimalsMH  - *Heart Defects, Congenital/physiopathology/therapyMH  - *Heart Failure/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*trendsMH  - HumansMH  - *MiniaturizationMH  - *Vascular ResistanceEDAT- 2013/07/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/19 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/31 06:00AID - 10.1586/17434440.2013.811851 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2013 Jul;10(4):441-52. doi: 10.1586/17434440.2013.811851.
