Destination mechanical circulatory support is often the only      therapy available for these patients who are not transplant candidates. The      outcomes after continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF LVAD) implant      in older patients remains unclear. We undertook this multi-institutional study to      quantify short-term and midterm outcomes after CF LVAD implant in the elderly.      METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients in the Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) national registry that      underwent implant of a CF LVAD (June 2006 to April 2012). Patients were divided      into 2 cohorts based upon age (<70 years [n = 4,439] and >/= 70 years (n = 590]).      Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed. The      primary endpoint, survival, was compared between cohorts. RESULTS: Patients age      70 and older were more hemodynamically stable pre-VAD implant as evidenced by      INTERMACS profile and inotrope dependence. Perioperative outcomes, including      median bypass time (89 vs 89 minutes) and length of stay (0.657 vs 0.657 months)       were similar between cohorts (p = not significant). Kaplan-Meier analysis      revealed a significant difference in 2-year survival between patients aged 70      years or greater (63%) and less than 70 (71%, p < 0.001). Multivariable Cox      proportional hazard analysis revealed age as an independent predictor of      mortality during follow-up (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, midterm cumulative survival       in the older cohort was still reasonable (63% at 2 years). CONCLUSIONS:      Multi-institutional analysis revealed advanced age as a predictor of increased      mortality after CF LVAD implantation. Careful patient selection is critical in      the elderly to optimize long-term outcomes after CF LVAD implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
