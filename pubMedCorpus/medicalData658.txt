CVD is the main cause of the disease burden (illness and death) in      Europe (23% of all the disease burdens) and the second main cause of the disease       burden in those European Union (EU) countries with very low child and adult      mortality (17%).(1) Heart disease is a common health problem worldwide. According      to the most recent Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2011 update,(2) greater      than 82 000 000 adults living in the United States of America (USA) have one or      more types of CVD. Many resources have been invested in attempting to understand       and curtail the progression of congestive HF. This article attempts to address      the growing concern over HF by looking at the epidemiology, pathophysiology and      available therapies as anaesthesiologists encounter these patients more often      nowadays in the operating room and intensive care units. Mechanical circulatory      assistance and heart transplantation are two established treatment methods for      end-stage HF. In this review, we also address the indications and      contraindications for mechanical circulatory assistance, types and spectrum of      available ventricular assist devices, efficacy, safety and cost analysis of      circulatory support therapy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
