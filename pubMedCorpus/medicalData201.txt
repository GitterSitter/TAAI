How      patients decide whether or not to proceed with device implantation is unknown. We      aimed to understand the decision-making processes of patients who either accept      or decline DT LVADs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2012 and September      2013, we conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews to understand patients'      decision-making experiences. Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and      deductive approach. Twenty-two eligible patients were interviewed, 15 with DT      LVADs and 7 who declined. We found a strong dichotomy between decision processes       with some patients (11 accepters) being automatic and others (3 accepters, 7      decliners) being reflective in their approach to decision making. The automatic      group was characterized by a fear of dying and an over-riding desire to live as      long as possible: "[LVAD] was the only option I had...that or push up      daisies...so I automatically took this." By contrast, the reflective group went      through a reasoned process of weighing risks, benefits, and burdens: "There are      worse things than death." Irrespective of approach, most patients experienced the      DT LVAD decision as a highly emotional process and many sought support from their      families or spiritually. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients offered a DT LVAD face the      decision by reflecting on a process and reasoning through risks and benefits. For      others, the desire to live supersedes such reflective processing. Acknowledging      this difference is important when considering how to support patients who are      faced with this complex decision.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - McIlvennan, Colleen KAU  - McIlvennan CKAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., A.B.), Division of General Internal Medicine (C.N.,      D.D.M.), and Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (J.C.C.), University of Colorado       School of Medicine, Aurora; and Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.). colleen.mcilvennan@ucdenver.edu.FAU - Allen, Larry AAU  - Allen LAAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., A.B.), Division of General Internal Medicine (C.N.,      D.D.M.), and Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (J.C.C.), University of Colorado       School of Medicine, Aurora; and Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.).FAU - Nowels, CarolynAU  - Nowels CAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., A.B.), Division of General Internal Medicine (C.N.,      D.D.M.), and Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (J.C.C.), University of Colorado       School of Medicine, Aurora; and Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.).FAU - Brieke, AndreasAU  - Brieke AAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., A.B.), Division of General Internal Medicine (C.N.,      D.D.M.), and Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (J.C.C.), University of Colorado       School of Medicine, Aurora; and Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.).FAU - Cleveland, Joseph CAU  - Cleveland JCAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., A.B.), Division of General Internal Medicine (C.N.,      D.D.M.), and Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (J.C.C.), University of Colorado       School of Medicine, Aurora; and Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.).FAU - Matlock, Daniel DAU  - Matlock DDAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., A.B.), Division of General Internal Medicine (C.N.,      D.D.M.), and Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (J.C.C.), University of Colorado       School of Medicine, Aurora; and Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research      Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.).LA  - engGR  - 1 K07 AG030337-01A2/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - 1K23AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - 1K23HL105896-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20140513PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual OutcomesJT  - Circulation.
