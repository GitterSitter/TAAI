An artificial vasculature device (AVD) is being      developed that may better facilitate myocardial recovery than VAD by controlling       the afterload experienced by the native heart and controlling the pulsatile      energy entering into the arterial system from the device, potentially      reconditioning the arterial system properties. The AVD is a valveless, 80 ml      blood chamber with a servo-controlled pusher plate connected to the ascending      aorta by a vascular graft. Control algorithms for the AVD were developed to      maintain any user-defined systemic input impedance (IM) including resistance,      elastance, and inertial components. Computer simulation and mock circulation      models of the cardiovascular system were used to test the efficacy of two control      strategies for the AVD: 1) average impedance position control (AIPC)-to maintain       an average value of resistance during left ventricular (LV) systole and 2)      instantaneous impedance force feedback (IIFF) and position control (IIPC)-to      maintain a desired value or profile of resistance and compliance. Computer      simulations and mock loop tests were performed to predict resulting      cardiovascular pressures, volumes, flows, and the resistance and compliance      experienced by the native LV during ejection for simulated normal, failing, and      recovering LV. These results indicate that the LV volume and pressure decreased,       and the LV stroke volume increased with decreasing IM, resulting in an increased       ejection fraction. Although the AIPC algorithm is more stable and can tolerate      higher levels of sensor errors and noise, the IIFF and IIPC control algorithms      are better suited to maintain any instantaneous IM or an IM profile. The      developed AVD impedance control algorithms may be implemented with current VADs      to promote myocardial recovery and facilitate weaning.FAU - Giridharan, Guruprasad AAU  - Giridharan GAAD  - Department of Bioengineering, University of Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.FAU - Cheng, Rolando ChipAU  - Cheng RCFAU - Glower, Jacob SAU  - Glower JSFAU - Ewert, Daniel LAU  - Ewert DLFAU - Sobieski, Michael AAU  - Sobieski MAFAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSFAU - Koenig, Steven CAU  - Koenig SCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AlgorithmsMH  - Aorta/*pathologyMH  - Computer SimulationMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Ventricles/pathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Models, CardiovascularMH  - Myocardium/pathologyMH  - PressureMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - SystoleMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftEDAT- 2012/05/29 06:00MHDA- 2012/11/08 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/29 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318256bb50 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2012 Jul-Aug;58(4):353-62. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e318256bb50.
