Patient-reported adherence to 8      recommendations related to exercise, alcohol, medications, smoking, diet, weight,      and symptoms was assessed among 308 HF patients using the Medical Outcomes Study       Specific Adherence Scale questionnaire (0="never" to 5="always," maximum      score=40). A baseline cumulative score of >/=32/40 (average >/=80%) defined good       adherence. Clinical events (death/transplantation/ventricular assist device),      resource utilization, functional capacity (6-minute walk distance), and health      status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) were compared among      patients with and without good adherence. The mean follow-up was 2.0+/-1.0 years,      and adherence ranged from 26.3% (exercise) to 89.9% (medications). A cumulative      score indicating good adherence was reported by 35.7%, whereas good adherence      with every behavior was reported by 9.1% of patients. Good adherence was      associated with fewer hospitalizations (all-cause 87.8 vs 107.6; P=.018; HF 29.6       vs 43.8; P=.007) and hospitalized days (all-cause 422 vs 465; P=.015; HF 228 vs      282; P<.001) per 100-person-years and better health status (KCCQ overall score      70.1+/-24.6 vs 63.8+/-22.8; P=.011). Adherence was not associated with clinical      events or functional capacity. Patient-reported adherence with HF self-care      recommendations is alarmingly low and selective. Good adherence was associated      with lower resource utilization and better health status.CI  - (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Marti, Catherine NAU  - Marti CNAD  - Division of Cardiology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.FAU - Georgiopoulou, Vasiliki VAU  - Georgiopoulou VVFAU - Giamouzis, GrigoriosAU  - Giamouzis GFAU - Cole, Robert TAU  - Cole RTFAU - Deka, AnjanAU  - Deka AFAU - Tang, W H WAU  - Tang WHFAU - Dunbar, Sandra BAU  - Dunbar SBFAU - Smith, Andrew LAU  - Smith ALFAU - Kalogeropoulos, Andreas PAU  - Kalogeropoulos APFAU - Butler, JavedAU  - Butler JLA  - engGR  - KL2 RR025009/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - KL2 RR025009/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - KL2 TR000455/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - TL1 RR025010/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - TL1 RR025010/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - TL1 TR000456/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - U10 HL110302/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1 RR025008/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1 RR025008/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1 TR000454/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120909PL  - United StatesTA  - Congest Heart FailJT  - Congestive heart failure (Greenwich, Conn.)JID - 9714174SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - GeorgiaMH  - *Health StatusMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Patient Compliance/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Self Care/*methodsPMC - PMC3519965MID - NIHMS393007OID - NLM: NIHMS393007OID - NLM: PMC3519965EDAT- 2012/09/11 06:00MHDA- 2013/12/16 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/11 06:00PHST- 2012/09/09 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1751-7133.2012.00308.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Congest Heart Fail. 2013 Jan-Feb;19(1):16-24. doi:      10.1111/j.1751-7133.2012.00308.x.
