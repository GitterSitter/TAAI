A systematic search was conducted in five      databases for the period 2003 to 2012. Fifty-three publications with data for 999      patients, supported with CentriMag, were included. In 72% studies, CentriMag was       used as a VAD and in 25% as part of ECMO circuit. Mean duration of VAD support      was 25.0 days in precardiotomy group, 10.9 days in postcardiac surgery      cardiogenic shock group, 8.8 days in post-transplant graft failure and rejection       group, and 16.0 days in post-LVAD placement right ventricular failure group.      Survival on support was 82% (95% CI 70-92) for VAD support in precardiotomy      cardiogenic shock indication, 63% (95% CI 46-78) in VAD support in postcardiac      surgery cardiogenic shock indication, 62% (95% CI 46-76) in VAD support in      post-transplant graft rejection or failure indication, and 83% (95% CI 73-92) in       VAD support in post-LVAD placement right ventricular failure indication.      CentriMag is an effective technology for temporary support of patients with      cardiac and cardiorespiratory failure.FAU - Borisenko, OlegAU  - Borisenko OAD  - From the *Synergus AB, Danderyd, Sweden; daggerScottish Extracorporeal Life      Support Service, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, United Kingdom;      double daggerScottish National Advanced Heart Failure Service, Golden Jubilee      National Hospital, Clydebank, United Kingdom; section signMedical Management      Centre, Department of Learning Informatics, Management and Ethics, Karolinska      Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; paragraph signPaediatric and Neonatal ECMO      Service, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom; ||Department of      Cardiothoracic Transplant, Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom; and       #Emeritus Cardiothoracic Surgeon, Glenfield General Hospital, Leicester, United      Kingdom.FAU - Wylie, GillianAU  - Wylie GFAU - Payne, JohnAU  - Payne JFAU - Bjessmo, StaffanAU  - Bjessmo SFAU - Smith, JonAU  - Smith JFAU - Yonan, NizarAU  - Yonan NFAU - Firmin, RichardAU  - Firmin RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMPMC - PMC4154791OID - NLM: PMC4154791EDAT- 2014/07/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/11 06:00CRDT- 2014/07/11 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000117 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Sep-Oct;60(5):487-97. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000117.
