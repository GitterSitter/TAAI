METHODS: The cost analysis presented was based on evaluation of the time required      to provide circulatory support for the following indications: post-cardiac      surgery cardiogenic shock, postacute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock,      deteriorating end-stage heart failure (ESHF) and the ability of different blood      pumps to provide support for the necessary duration. The maximum length of      support for each device was based on the manufacturers' recommendations. Direct      medical cost of each treatment was evaluated only for the period of mechanical      circulatory support in adults and children. Only the cost of device, placement      and replacement procedures were considered. List prices were used for devices;      resource use was based on expert opinion; unit costs were obtained from official       UK sources and Wythenshawe hospital, Manchester, UK. Hospital perspective was      utilized for analysis. Three VADs were selected for comparison in adults and two       in children. Four centrifugal ECLS systems were selected for comparison in adults      and two in children. RESULTS: In both VAD and ECLS indications, the CentriMag(R)       was the least expensive when used for support of patients with end-stage heart      failure. Compared with Cardiohelp(R) for ECLS (which has the same maximum claim      duration of support of 30 days), CentriMag(R) lead to cost savings of pound4294      per patient in all three clinical conditions considered. In post-cardiac surgery       cardiogenic shock, CentriMag(R) VAD lead to savings of pound5014 per patient      compared with BPX-80. Results were robust in one-way sensitivity analysis in      comparison with Cardiohelp(R). CONCLUSIONS: CentriMag(R) and PediVAS(R) blood      pumps can lead to significant cost savings to the National Health Service, when      used instead of other pumps for short-term VAD or ECLS treatment.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
