Percutaneous implantation of an extracorporeal life support (ECLS)      system achieves immediate cardiopulmonary stabilization, sufficient end-organ      perfusion and reduction of subsequent multiorgan failure (MOF). METHODS:      Forty-one patients undergoing percutaneous ECLS implantation for cardiogenic      shock from February 2012 until August 2013 were retrospectively analysed. Mean      age was 52 +/- 13 years, 6 (15%) were female. Mean pH values obtained before ECLS      implantation were 7.15 +/- 0.24, mean lactate concentration was 11.7 +/- 6.4      mmol/l. Levels obtained 6 h after ECLS implantation were 7.30 +/- 0.14 and 8.7      +/- 5.0 mmol/l, respectively. In 23 patients (56%) cardiogenic shock resulted      from an acute coronary syndrome in 13 (32%) from cardiomyopathy, in 5 (12%) from       other causes. Twenty-seven (66%) had been resuscitated, in 14 (34%) implantation       was performed under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Of note, 97% of       the acute coronary syndrome patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention      (PCI) either before ECLS implantation or under ECLS support. Extracorporeal life       support implantation was performed on scene (Emergency Department, Cath Lab,      Intensive Care Unit) by a senior cardiac surgeon and a trained perfusionist, in 8      cases (20%) in the referring hospital. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 51% [21       patients, due to MOF (n = 14), cerebral complications (n = 6) and heart failure      (n = 1)]. Logistic regression analysis identified 6-h pH values as an independent      risk factor of 30-day mortality (P < 0.001, OR = 0.000, 95% CI 0.000-0.042).      Neither CPR nor implantation under ongoing CPR resulted in significant      differences. In 26 cases (63%), the ECLS system could be explanted, after mean      support of 169 +/- 67 h. Seven of these patients received cardiac surgery      [ventricular assist device implantation (n = 4), heart transplantation (n = 1),      other procedures (n = 2)]. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the evolution of transportable      ECLS systems and percutaneous techniques implantation on scene is feasible.      Extracorporeal life support may serve as a bridge-to-decision and      bridge-to-treatment device. Neurological evaluation before ventricular assist      device implantation and PCI under stable conditions are possible. Despite      substantial mortality, ECLS implantation in selected patients by an experienced      team offers additional support to conventional therapy as well as CPR and allows       survival in patients that otherwise most likely would have died. This concept has      to be implemented in cardiac survival networks in the future.FAU - Guenther, SabinaAU  - Guenther SAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital Munich,      Ludwig-Maximilian-University, Munich, Germany.FAU - Theiss, Hans DAU  - Theiss HDFAU - Fischer, MatthiasAU  - Fischer MFAU - Sattler, StefanAU  - Sattler SFAU - Peterss, SvenAU  - Peterss SFAU - Born, FrankAU  - Born FFAU - Pichlmaier, MaximilianAU  - Pichlmaier MFAU - Massberg, SteffenAU  - Massberg SFAU - Hagl, ChristianAU  - Hagl CFAU - Khaladj, NawidAU  - Khaladj NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131213PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)SB  - IMMH  - Acute Coronary Syndrome/complicationsMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - Cardiomyopathies/complicationsMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/adverse effects/instrumentation/mortalityMH  - FemaleMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Hydrogen-Ion ConcentrationMH  - Lactic Acid/bloodMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Oxygenators, MembraneMH  - *Patient Care TeamMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/blood/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC3930215OID - NLM: PMC3930215OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cardiogenic shockOT  - CardiomyopathyOT  - Extracorporeal life supportOT  - Myocardial infarctionEDAT- 2013/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/17 06:00PHST- 2013/12/13 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt505 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt505 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2014 Mar;18(3):283-91. doi:      10.1093/icvts/ivt505.
