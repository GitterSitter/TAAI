From March 2006 through      November 2011, one hundred patients with chronic heart failure underwent      implantation of a HeartMate II (HM II) LVAD (Thoratec Corp.) as a bridge to      transplant (BTT; n = 65) or destination therapy (DT; n = 35). Records were      reviewed to determine the prevalence and type of postimplant stroke, anatomic      cerebral location of strokes, and associated morbidity and mortality. Cox      multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent      predictors of postoperative stroke. Strokes occurred in 12 patients (12.0%): four      embolic and eight hemorrhagic. Median duration of support at the time of stroke      was 281.0 days for embolic strokes and 380.5 days for hemorrhagic strokes (p =      0.028). Stroke patients had a significantly higher incidence of diabetes (66.7%      vs. 40.9%; p = 0.024), history of preimplant stroke (16.7% vs. 4.5%; p = 0.046),       and aortic cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest during their LVAD implant      (50.0% vs. 20.2%; p = 0.034) compared with patients without postoperative      strokes. Mean international normalized ratio (INR) at the time of stroke was      subtherapeutic in all four patients with embolic strokes (mean: 1.5 +/- 0.1 IU;      range 1.3-1.6 IU) and supratherapeutic in four of eight patients with hemorrhagic      strokes (mean: 3.2 +/- 2.2 IU, range: 1.4-7.0 IU; p = 0.024). There was a 25.0%      30 day mortality after stroke. Diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 6.36; p = 0.029), aortic      cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest (OR 4.75; p = 0.025), duration of LVAD      support (OR 1.00; p = 0.008), and INR (OR 4.42; p = 0.020) were independent      predictors of stroke in multivariate analysis with a trend toward significance      for history of stroke (OR 6.25; p = 0.075). Stroke represented an important      source of morbidity and mortality for patients on HM II LVAD support. As      long-term device therapy continues to gain popularity for both BTT and DT, a      better understanding of the predictors of stroke, more strict control of      postoperative anticoagulation, and the establishment of a risk stratification      model may aid in minimizing its occurrence.FAU - Morgan, Jeffrey AAU  - Morgan JAAD  - From the *Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery and daggerDivision of Cardiovascular      Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan.FAU - Brewer, Robert JAU  - Brewer RJFAU - Nemeh, Hassan WAU  - Nemeh HWFAU - Gerlach, BrentAU  - Gerlach BFAU - Lanfear, David EAU  - Lanfear DEFAU - Williams, Celeste TAU  - Williams CTFAU - Paone, GaetanoAU  - Paone GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Anticoagulants)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Anticoagulants/chemistry/therapeutic useMH  - Aorta/pathologyMH  - Diabetes Complications/diagnosisMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/surgery/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - International Normalized RatioMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Proportional Hazards ModelsMH  - RiskMH  - Stroke/*complications/*epidemiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2014/03/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/15 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000074 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 May-Jun;60(3):284-9. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000074.
