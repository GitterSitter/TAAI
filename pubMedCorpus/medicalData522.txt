However, mechanisms underlying      this benefit are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a model of mechanical unloading      of the left ventricle, we observed progressive myocyte atrophy, autophagy, and      robust activation of the transcription factor FoxO3, an established regulator of       catabolic processes in other cell types. Evidence for FoxO3 activation was      similarly detected in unloaded failing human myocardium. To determine the role of      FoxO3 activation in cardiac muscle in vivo, we engineered transgenic mice      harboring a cardiomyocyte-specific constitutively active FoxO3 mutant      (caFoxO3(flox);alphaMHC-Mer-Cre-Mer). Expression of caFoxO3 triggered dramatic      and progressive loss of cardiac mass, robust increases in cardiomyocyte      autophagy, declines in mitochondrial biomass and function, and early mortality.      Whereas increases in cardiomyocyte apoptosis were not apparent, we detected      robust increases in Bnip3 (Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3), an       established downstream target of FoxO3. To test the role of Bnip3, we crossed the      caFoxO3(flox);alphaMHC-Mer-Cre-Mer mice with Bnip3-null animals. Remarkably, the       atrophy and autophagy phenotypes were significantly blunted, yet the early      mortality triggered by FoxO3 activation persisted. Rather, declines in cardiac      performance were attenuated by proteasome inhibitors. Consistent with involvement      of FoxO3-driven activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we detected      time-dependent activation of the atrogenes program and sarcomere protein      breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, these data point to FoxO3, a protein      activated by mechanical unloading, as a master regulator that governs both the      autophagy-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasomal pathways to orchestrate cardiac      muscle atrophy.FAU - Cao, Dian JAU  - Cao DJAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,      Dallas, TX 75390-8573, USA.FAU - Jiang, NanAU  - Jiang NFAU - Blagg, AndrewAU  - Blagg AFAU - Johnstone, Janet LAU  - Johnstone JLFAU - Gondalia, RajAU  - Gondalia RFAU - Oh, MisookAU  - Oh MFAU - Luo, XiangAU  - Luo XFAU - Yang, Kai-ChunAU  - Yang KCFAU - Shelton, John MAU  - Shelton JMFAU - Rothermel, Beverly AAU  - Rothermel BAFAU - Gillette, Thomas GAU  - Gillette TGFAU - Dorn, Gerald WAU  - Dorn GWFAU - Hill, Joseph AAU  - Hill JALA  - engGR  - HL-080144/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - HL-097768/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - HL-0980842/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - HL-100401/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130408PL  - EnglandTA  - J Am Heart AssocJT  - Journal of the American Heart AssociationJID - 101580524RN  - 0 (BNip3 protein, mouse)RN  - 0 (FOXO3 protein, human)RN  - 0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)RN  - 0 (FoxO3 protein, mouse)RN  - 0 (Membrane Proteins)RN  - 0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)RN  - EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)RN  - EC 6.3.2.19 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - AtrophyMH  - AutophagyMH  - Disease Models, AnimalMH  - Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism/physiologyMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiologyMH  - MiceMH  - Mice, TransgenicMH  - Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiologyMH  - Myocardium/metabolism/pathologyMH  - Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism/pathology/physiologyMH  - Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiologyMH  - Signal TransductionMH  - Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes/physiologyMH  - Ventricular Remodeling/*physiologyPMC - PMC3647287OID - NLM: PMC3647287EDAT- 2013/04/10 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/21 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/10 06:00AID - 2/2/e000016 [pii]AID - 10.1161/JAHA.113.000016 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2013 Apr 8;2(2):e000016. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.113.000016.
