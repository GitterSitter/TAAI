OBJECTIVES: We      determined whether Doppler and 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography      reliably assess hemodynamics in patients supported with CF-LVADs. METHODS:      Simultaneous echocardiography and right heart catheterization were prospectively       performed in 50 consecutive patients supported by using the HeartMate II CF-LVAD       at baseline pump speeds. The first 40 patients were assessed to determine the      accuracy of Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiography parameters to estimate      hemodynamics and to derive a diagnostic algorithm for discrimination between mean      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure </=15 versus >15 mm Hg. Ten patients served as      a validation cohort. RESULTS: Doppler echocardiographic and invasive measures of       mean right atrial pressure (RAP) (r = 0.863; p < 0.0001), systolic pulmonary      artery pressure (sPAP) (r = 0.880; p < 0.0001), right ventricular outflow tract      stroke volume (r = 0.660; p < 0.0001), and pulmonary vascular resistance (r =      0.643; p = 0.001) correlated significantly. Several parameters, including mitral       ratio of the early to late ventricular filling velocities >2, RAP >10 mm Hg, sPAP      >40 mm Hg, left atrial volume index >33 ml/m(2), ratio of mitral inflow early      diastolic filling peak velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity >14,      and pulmonary vascular resistance >2.5 Wood units, accurately identified patients      with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >15 mm Hg (area under the curve: 0.73 to       0.98). An algorithm integrating mitral inflow velocities, RAP, sPAP, and left      atrial volume index was 90% accurate in distinguishing normal from elevated left       ventricular filling pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler echocardiography accurately      estimated intracardiac hemodynamics in these patients supported with CF-LVAD. Our      algorithm reliably distinguished normal from elevated left ventricular filling      pressures.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
