METHODS AND RESULTS: In 416 patients with chronic systolic heart      failure, we performed speckle-tracking analyses of left ventricular longitudinal,      circumferential, and radial strain and strain rate on archived echocardiography      images (30 frames per second). Cox regression models were used to determine the      associations between strain and strain rate and risk of all-cause mortality,      cardiac transplantation, and ventricular-assist device placement. The area under       the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) was also calculated at 1 year and 5 years.      Over a maximum follow-up of 8.9 years, there were 138 events (33.2%). In      unadjusted models, all strain and strain rate parameters were associated with      adverse outcomes (P<0.001). In multivariable models, all parameters with the      exception of radial strain rate (P=0.11) remained independently associated, with       patients in the lowest tertile of strain or strain rate parameter having a      approximately 2-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes compared with the      reference group (P<0.05). Addition of strain to ejection fraction (EF) led to a      significantly improved AUC at 1 year (0.697 versus 0.633, P=0.032) and 5 years      (0.700 versus 0.638, P=0.001). In contrast, strain rate did not provide      incremental prognostic value to EF alone. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal and      circumferential strain and strain rate, and radial strain are associated with      chronic heart failure prognosis. Strain provides incremental value to EF in the      prediction of adverse outcomes, and with additional study may be a clinically      relevant prognostic tool.FAU - Zhang, Kathleen WAU  - Zhang KWAD  - Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of      Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.FAU - French, BenjaminAU  - French BFAU - May Khan, AbigailAU  - May Khan AFAU - Plappert, TedAU  - Plappert TFAU - Fang, James CAU  - Fang JCFAU - Sweitzer, Nancy KAU  - Sweitzer NKFAU - Borlaug, Barry AAU  - Borlaug BAFAU - Chirinos, Julio AAU  - Chirinos JAFAU - St John Sutton, MartinAU  - St John Sutton MFAU - Cappola, Thomas PAU  - Cappola TPFAU - Ky, BonnieAU  - Ky BLA  - engGR  - K23 HL095661/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - KL1 RR024132/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - NIH HL088577/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - NIH K23 HL095661-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140113PL  - EnglandTA  - J Am Heart AssocJT  - Journal of the American Heart AssociationJID - 101580524SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - *Echocardiography, DopplerMH  - ElasticityMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure, Systolic/mortality/physiopathology/therapy/*ultrasonographyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - *Myocardial ContractionMH  - Predictive Value of TestsMH  - PrognosisMH  - Proportional Hazards ModelsMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Stress, MechanicalMH  - *Stroke VolumeMH  - Time FactorsMH  - United StatesMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftPMC - PMC3959676OID - NLM: PMC3959676OTO - NOTNLMOT  - echocardiographyOT  - heart failureOT  - strainEDAT- 2014/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/15 06:00AID - jah3397 [pii]AID - 10.1161/JAHA.113.000550 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2014 Jan 13;3(1):e000550. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.113.000550.
