The SynCardia() TAH is a pneumatically driven, pulsatile system capable of      flows of >9L/min. The TAH is indicated for use as a bridge to transplantation      (BTT) in patients at imminent risk of death from non-reversible bi-ventricular      failure. In the Pivotal US approval trial the TAH achieved a BTT rate of >79%.      Recently a multi-center, post-market approval study similarly demonstrated a      comparable BTT rate. A major milestone was recently achieved for the TAH, with      over 1100 TAHs having been implanted to date, with the bulk of implantation      occurring at an ever increasing rate in the past few years. The TAH is most      commonly utilized to save the lives of patients dying from end-stage      bi-ventricular heart failure associated with ischemic or non-ischemic dilated      cardiomyopathy. Beyond progressive chronic heart failure, the TAH has      demonstrated great efficacy in supporting patients with acute irreversible heart       failure associated with massive acute myocardial infarction. In recent years      several diverse clinical scenarios have also proven to be well served by the TAH       including severe heart failure associated with advanced congenital heart disease.      failed or burned-out transplants, infiltrative and restrictive cardiomyopathies      and failed ventricular assist devices. Looking to the future a major unmet need      remains in providing total heart support for children and small adults. As such,       the present TAH design must be scaled to fit the smaller patient, while providing      equivalent, if not superior flow characteristics, shear profiles and overall      device thrombogenicity. To aid in the development of a new "pediatric," TAH an      engineering methodology known as "Device Thrombogenicity Emulation (DTE)", that      we have recently developed and described, is being employed. Recently, to further      our engineering understanding of the TAH, as steps towards next generation      designs we have: (1) assessed of the degree of platelet reactivity induced by the      present clinical 70 cc TAH using a closed loop platelet activity state assay, (2)      modeled the motion of the TAH pulsatile mobile diaphragm, and (3) performed      fluid-structure interactions and assessment of the flow behavior through inflow      and outflow regions of the TAH fitted with modern bi-leaflet heart valves.      Developing a range of TAH devices will afford biventricular replacement therapy      to a wide range of patients, for both short and long-term therapy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013.
