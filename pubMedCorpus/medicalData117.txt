However, the specific effects of combined Cl+beta1 blockade      during MU are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the chronic effects (4      weeks) of beta2-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation via Cl (2 mg/kg/day) alone, and in       combination with beta1-AR blockade using metoprolol ((Met), 250 mg/kg/day), on      whole heart/cell structure, function and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in       failing (induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation), and unloaded (induced      by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)) failing rat hearts.      Combined Cl+Met therapy displayed favourable effects in HF: Met enhanced Cl's      improvement in ejection fraction (EF) whilst preventing Cl-induced hypertrophy      and tachycardia. During MU combined therapy was less beneficial than either      mono-therapy. Met, not Cl, prevented MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with      increased atrophy occurring during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+       transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+      content was enhanced equally by Cl or Met mono-therapy, but these benefits,      together with Cl's enhancement of sarcomeric contraction speed, and MU-induced      recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency, disappeared during combined therapy.      CONCLUSIONS: Combined Cl+Met therapy shows superior functional effects to      mono-therapy in rodent HF, but appears inferior to either mono-therapy in      enhancing MU-induced recovery of EC coupling. These results suggest that combined      beta2-AR simulation +beta1-AR blockade therapy is likely to be a safe and      beneficial therapeutic HF strategy, but is not as effective as mono-therapy in      enhancing myocardial recovery during LVAD support.FAU - Navaratnarajah, ManorajAU  - Navaratnarajah MAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Siedlecka, UrszulaAU  - Siedlecka UAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Ibrahim, MichaelAU  - Ibrahim MAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - van Doorn, CarinAU  - van Doorn CAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Soppa, GopalAU  - Soppa GAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Gandhi, AjayAU  - Gandhi AAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Shah, AdarshAU  - Shah AAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Kukadia, PunamAU  - Kukadia PAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Yacoub, Magdi HAU  - Yacoub MHAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.FAU - Terracciano, Cesare MAU  - Terracciano CMAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140930PL  - United StatesTA  - PLoS OneJT  - PloS oneJID - 101285081SB  - IMPMC - PMC4181979OID - NLM: PMC4181979EDAT- 2014/10/01 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/01 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/01 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2013/12/24 [received]PHST- 2014/02/26 [accepted]PHST- 2014/09/30 [epublish]AID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0092909 [doi]AID - PONE-D-13-54466 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - PLoS One. 2014 Sep 30;9(9):e92909. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092909. eCollection      2014.
