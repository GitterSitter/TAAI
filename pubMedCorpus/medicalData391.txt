METHODS: This was a retrospective      cohort study of 7 years' experience with the Berlin Heart (BH) EXCOR (Berlin      Heart AG, Berlin Germany) paracorporeal ventricular assist device (VAD) in 2      United Kingdom (UK) pediatric heart transplant centers and the effect of this      program on the UK pediatric heart transplant service. RESULTS: Of 102 children      who received BH support, 84% survived to transplant or BH explant and 81%      survived to discharge. Neither age nor duration of support influenced outcome.      Stroke, ongoing requirement for ventilation while on BH, and diagnosis other than      dilated cardiomyopathy were the only independent mortality risk factors. Children      who weighed < 20 kg had significantly (p = 0.03) longer support times than bigger      children. The number of children treated with a BH increased over time (p =      0.01). Currently > 50% of pediatric heart transplants are bridged with a BH;      however, pediatric transplants per year have not increased significantly (p =      0.07) CONCLUSIONS: BH use in the UK has allowed significant increases in the      number of children with end-stage heart failure who can be successfully bridged      to transplant and the length of time they can be supported. The total number of      transplants has not increased.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
