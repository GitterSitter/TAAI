From its first      utilization, several implantation techniques have been elaborated, starting from       a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support and moving towards       a minimally invasive access with an off-pump strategy. Here we present the      favored surgical technique used in our department to implant the Jarvik-2000, in       a step-by-step fashion.FAU - Zucchetta, FabioAU  - Zucchetta FAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiology, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.FAU - Tarzia, VincenzoAU  - Tarzia VAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiology, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.FAU - Bottio, TomasoAU  - Bottio TAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiology, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.FAU - Gerosa, GinoAU  - Gerosa GAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiology, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ChinaTA  - Ann Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101605877PMC - PMC4229469OID - NLM: PMC4229469OTO - NOTNLMOT  - JarvikOT  - implantationOT  - off-pumpOT  - techniqueEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/03 06:01CRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00PHST- 2014/05/28 [received]PHST- 2014/09/05 [accepted]AID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.09 [doi]AID - acs-03-05-525 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Sep;3(5):525-31. doi:      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.09.
