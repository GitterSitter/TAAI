METHODS: The investigation was       a single-centre, retrospective study of 77 patients who required ECLS for AMI      with CS. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent      variables associated with 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Between February 2006 and      November 2009, 745 patients in our establishment received ECLS. In the      single-centre cohort, we retrospectively reviewed 77 patients who had required      ECLS support for AMI with CS. The delay between AMI and CS ECLS was 15 +/- 4 h.      PCI was performed in 58 patients (75.3%) and isolated emergency CABG in 12      (15.6%). The remaining 7 patients (9.1%) did not undergo revascularization. ECLS       duration averaged 9.8 +/- 7.1 days. Nineteen patients were successfully weaned      from ECLS (24%). Fifty-eight patients did not undergo or did not tolerate the      weaning trial (76%). Forty patients died during ECLS support, 13 were implanted      with a mono-ventricular (n = 9) or biventricular assist device (n = 4) and 5 were      bridged to heart transplantation. Complications consisted primarily in pneumonia       (51.3%) and acute renal failure requiring haemofiltration (46.1%). Pulmonary      oedema occurred in 24 patients (31.6%) and major bleeding in 16 (21.33%). 30-day       and in-hospital survival rates were, respectively, 38.9 and 33.8%. Multivariable       analysis identified preimplantation lactate serum level, preimplantation      creatinine serum level and previous cardiopulmonary resuscitation as independent       predictors of 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Prompt ECLS support is an effective       strategy and provides a reasonable chance of survival in patients with AMI      associated with profound CS. As shown in our results pertaining to predictive      risk factors for 30-day mortality, reducing the duration of end-organ ischaemia      is the keystone to management of this patient population. A major remaining      challenge will consist in preventing pulmonary oedema following peripheral ECLS.FAU - Demondion, PierreAU  - Demondion PAD  - Division of Thoracic and Cardio-Vascular Surgery, Institute of Cardiology, Pierre      and Marie Curie University, Paris VI, APHP, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris,      France.FAU - Fournel, LudovicAU  - Fournel LFAU - Golmard, Jean-LouisAU  - Golmard JLFAU - Niculescu, MichaelaAU  - Niculescu MFAU - Pavie, AlainAU  - Pavie AFAU - Leprince, PascalAU  - Leprince PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130424PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - Coronary Artery BypassMH  - Extracorporeal Circulation/*mortalityMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - Myocardial Infarction/complications/epidemiology/*mortality/*surgeryMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality/*surgeryMH  - Survival AnalysisOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Acute myocardial infarctionOT  - Cardiogenic shockOT  - Extracorporeal life supportEDAT- 2013/04/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/23 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/26 06:00PHST- 2013/04/24 [aheadofprint]AID - ezt207 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt207 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Jan;45(1):47-54. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt207.
