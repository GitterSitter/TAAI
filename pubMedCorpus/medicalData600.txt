We sought to identify the factors that affect outcomes of ECLS for      postoperative LCOS. METHODS: From 2005 to 2011, of a total of 9267 adult patients      underwent major cardiac surgery, 93 patients (aged, 60.6 +/- 13.8 years; 47      women) underwent ECLS to treat postoperative LCOS. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (41.9%)      patients were weaned off ECLS successfully, and 1 patient underwent heart      transplantation. A final total of 23 patients (24.3%), including 1 heart      transplantation recipient, survived until the end of the follow-up period      (median, 611 days; range, 125-2247 days). On logistic regression analysis, old      age (P = .001), a high blood lactate level before ECLS initiation (P < .001),      cardiopulmonary bypass weaning failure after surgery (P < .001), and      postoperative bleeding (P = .012) were independent factors associated with      mortality. In contrast, administration of anticoagulant nafamostat mesilate (P =       .040) was found to be associated with improved outcomes of ECLS. When the      predictive value of pre-ECLS blood lactate level for mortality was assessed using      the receiver operating characteristic curve, the greatest accuracy was obtained      at the cutoff value of 7.9 mmol/L, with 63% sensitivity and 68% specificity.      CONCLUSIONS: High lactate level before ECLS is an independent predictor of      mortality after ECLS, necessitating earlier ECLS implementations before profound       lactic acidosis develops. Moreover, nafamostat mesilate should be considered as      alternative to heparin to reduce the risk of bleeding in these high-risk      patients.CI  - Crown Copyright (c) 2014.
