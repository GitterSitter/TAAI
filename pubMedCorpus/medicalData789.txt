Through November 2012,      881 orthotopic cardiac transplantations have been performed, with an annual rate       of about 40 procedures. Current legislation concerning solid organ      transplantations in the Czech Republic is described. Like other centers, we have       noticed an increasing age of donors, and, reflecting the shortage of grafts, we      have expanded our selection criteria for heart transplantation. The advent of a      mechanical circulatory support program at our center in April 2003 has given us      another valuable tool in the management of chronic heart failure patients.      Currently, around half of our patients are transplanted from mechanical support.       Nonischemic etiology of heart failure is a leading cause of transplantation at      our center, followed by ischemic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart lesions, and      adult congenital heart diseases. Our current immunosupression protocol, including      induction therapy, is outlined in detail and survival rates, as well as most      common complications and our treatment strategies, are also discussed.FAU - Pirk, JAU  - Pirk JAD  - Heart Center of Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (lKEM), Prague,       Czech Republic. japx@ikem.czFAU - Malek, IAU  - Malek IFAU - Netuka, IAU  - Netuka IFAU - Hoskova, LAU  - Hoskova LFAU - Pokorna, EAU  - Pokorna EFAU - Kotulak, TAU  - Kotulak TFAU - Urban, MAU  - Urban MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Clin TransplJT  - Clinical transplantsJID - 8812419SB  - IMMH  - Academic Medical Centers/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Atherosclerosis/epidemiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Czech Republic/epidemiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Graft Rejection/epidemiology/mortality/therapyMH  - Heart Failure/*epidemiology/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data/*trendsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*statistics & numerical data/trendsMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - Infection/epidemiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Neoplasms/epidemiologyMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Tissue and Organ Procurement/statistics & numerical data/trendsMH  - Transplantation, HomologousMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2013/06/21 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/01 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Transpl. 2012:135-43.
