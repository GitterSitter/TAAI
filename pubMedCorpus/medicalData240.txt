Two      new measures of left ventricular (LV) chamber contractility in the      cfLVAD-unloaded ventricle include IQ, a regression coefficient between maximum      flow acceleration and flow pulsatility at different pump speeds; and K, a      logarithmic relationship between volumes moved in systole and diastole. We sought      to optimize these indices. We also propose RIQ, a ratio between maximum flow      acceleration and flow pulsatility at baseline pump speed, as an alternative to      IQ. Eleven patients (mean age 49 +/- 11 years) were studied. The K index was      derived at baseline pump speed by defining systolic and diastolic onset as time      points at which maximum and minimum volumes move through the pump. IQ across the       full range of pump speeds was markedly different between patients. It was      unreliable in three patients with underlying atrial fibrillation (coefficient of       determination R(2) range: 0.38-0.74) and also when calculated without pump speed       manipulation (R(2) range: 0.01-0.74). The K index was within physiological      ranges, but poorly correlated to both IQ (P = 0.42) and RIQ (P = 0.92). In four      patients there was excellent correspondence between RIQ and IQ, while four other       patients showed a poor relationship between these indices. As RIQ does not      require pump speed changes, it may be a more clinically appropriate measure.      Further studies are required to determine the validity of these indices.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Gupta, SunilAU  - Gupta SAD  - Heart Failure and Transplant Unit, St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, New South      Wales, Australia; Faculty of Medicine, The University of New South Wales, Sydney,      New South Wales, Australia.FAU - Muthiah, KavithaAU  - Muthiah KFAU - Woldendorp, KeiAU  - Woldendorp KFAU - Robson, DesireeAU  - Robson DFAU - Jansz, PaulAU  - Jansz PFAU - Hayward, Christopher SAU  - Hayward CSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140324PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Continuous flowOT  - ContractilityOT  - Heart failure.OT  - Left ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2014/03/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/26 06:00PHST- 2014/03/24 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12292 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2014 Dec;38(12):1029-34. doi: 10.1111/aor.12292.
