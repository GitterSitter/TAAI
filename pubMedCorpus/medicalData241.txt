In this prospective study, we attempted to determine whether PS+      microparticle levels correlate with clinical outcomes in LVAD-supported patients.      METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients undergoing implantation of the HeartMate II LVAD      (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) and 10 healthy controls who provided reference      values for the microparticle assays. Plasma was collected before LVAD      implantation, at discharge, at the 3-month follow-up, and when an adverse      clinical event occurred. We quantified PS+ microparticles in the plasma using      flow cytometry. RESULTS: During the study period, 8 patients developed adverse      clinical events: ventricular tachycardia storm in 1, non-ST-elevation myocardial       infarction in 2, arterial thrombosis in 2, gastrointestinal bleeding in 2, and      stroke in 3. Levels of PS+ microparticles were higher in patients at baseline      than in healthy controls (2.11% +/- 1.26% vs 0.69% +/- 0.46%, p = 0.007). After      LVAD implantation, patient PS+ microparticle levels increased to 2.39% +/- 1.22%       at discharge and then leveled to 1.97% +/- 1.25% at the 3-month follow-up.      Importantly, levels of PS+ microparticles were significantly higher in patients      who developed an adverse event than in patients with no events (3.82% +/- 1.17%      vs 1.57% +/- 0.59%, p < 0.001), even though the 2 patient groups did not markedly      differ in other clinical and hematologic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results      suggest that an elevation of PS+ microparticle levels may be associated with      adverse clinical events. Thus, measuring PS+ microparticle levels in      LVAD-supported patients may help identify patients at increased risk for adverse       events.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
