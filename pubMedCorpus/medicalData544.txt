The use of bivalirudin and      epoprostenol infusions as an alternate anti-thrombotic (AT) regimen in pediatric       VAD patients was reviewed. METHODS: This was a retrospective record review of 6      pediatric patients (aged </=17 years) at 2 institutions treated with bivalirudin       and epoprostenol infusions while being supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR      (Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin, Germany) VAD. RESULTS: Six patients (age, 0.8-14      years; weight, 6.7-29.7 kg) were treated. Diagnoses included cardiomyopathy in 2       and congenital heart disease in 4. VAD support was left VAD in 2 and bi-VAD in 4,      with duration of support of 21 to 155 days. Three patients required      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before VAD support. Bivalirudin/epoprostenol       was used after recurrent thromboses on conventional medication in 3 patients,      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in 2, and in 1 patient considered high risk with      a prosthetic mitral valve. The bivalirudin dose was titrated to partial      thromboplastin time (PTT) of 1.5- to 2-times baseline (0.1-0.8 mg/kg/hour); the      epoprostenol dose was 2 to 10 ng/kg/min. Additional anti-platelet agents included      acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and clopidogrel in 5 patients each. No      bleeding complications occurred. One patient sustained a cerebrovascular infarct       on therapy, with subsequent complete recovery. No other complications occurred.      Five patients underwent successful transplantation, and 1 patient died of      multisystem organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides data on estimated      safety and efficacy of bivalirudin and epoprostenol as an AT strategy in      pediatric patients on extended VAD support. The short drug half-life and      predictable AT response facilitated conversion to standard AT regimens at the      time of transplantation (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-negative patients).      These agents should be considered for management of pediatric VAD patients when      standard regimens fail.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
