However, the model has not been externally validated,      and its suitability as a selection tool for heart transplantation (HT) and left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated      the UCLA risk score (based on B-type natriuretic peptide, peak VO2, New York      Heart Association class, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or      angiotensin receptor blocker) in 180 patients referred for HT. The outcome was      survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival      was compared to Kaplan-Meier's estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model      discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1      years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival      was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97,      respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses      demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year,      0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was      poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to      +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results       were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate      imputation of missing data. CONCLUSIONS: The UCLA 4-variable risk model      calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external      validation cohort. Further model assessment is warranted before widespread use.CI  - (c) 2014 The Authors.
