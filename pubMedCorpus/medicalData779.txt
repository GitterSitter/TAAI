Although LVADs have been      shown to increase quality of life and survival, the associated treatment burdens       and complications deserve careful consideration. The current study illustrates      myriad clinical challenges that can arise during long-term mechanical support      using an older adult case history. Current data on LVAD use in older adults is      reviewed, and a discussion of relevant points to consider before LVAD      implantation in older adults, including advance care planning, assessment of gait      and cognition, and the potential for substantial caregiver burden, is undertaken.CI  - (c) 2012, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation (c) 2012, The American      Geriatrics Society.FAU - Vitale, Caroline AAU  - Vitale CAAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Geriatric Medicine, University of      Michigan Health System, Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center,      VeteransAffairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System, 2215 Fuller Road, GRECC (11G), Ann      Arbor, MI 48105, USA. cavitale@umich.eduFAU - Chandekar, RashmiAU  - Chandekar RFAU - Rodgers, Phillip EAU  - Rodgers PEFAU - Pagani, Francis DAU  - Pagani FDFAU - Malani, Preeti NAU  - Malani PNLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PL  - United StatesTA  - J Am Geriatr SocJT  - Journal of the American Geriatrics SocietyJID - 7503062SB  - IMCIN - J Am Geriatr Soc. 2012 Jan;60(1):154-5.
