Both temporary and permanent mechanical support      has been gaining wide clinical application in this patient population. Although      mechanical circulatory support technology is rapidly evolving, this approach is      associated with multiple issues such as the optimal duration of temporary      support, ideal timing to bridge these patients to a long-term device, and      selection of the right device for the right patient. The currently available      devices are categorized into two major groups: temporary and long-term devices      (including destination therapy). Heart failure is a dynamic condition, and the      therapeutic approach may need to be modified depending on the patient's      condition. Furthermore, the patient's preexisting morbidity, age, socioeconomic      status, and family support are confounding factors that need to be considered      when making such decisions. Clinical trials including prospective studies, as      well as meticulous analysis of existing data, may help develop universal      guidelines to select the right device. This manuscript will review the most      widely used ventricular assist devices.FAU - Neragi-Miandoab, SiyamekAU  - Neragi-Miandoab SAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Albert Einstein College of      Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, 3400 Bainbridge Ave, MAP 5 Building, Bronx,       NY 10467, USA. sneragi@yahoo.comLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20120720PL  - JapanTA  - Surg TodayJT  - Surgery todayJID - 9204360SB  - IMMH  - Decision Support TechniquesMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/mortalityMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/07/21 06:00MHDA- 2013/02/21 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/21 06:00PHST- 2011/09/29 [received]PHST- 2012/02/13 [accepted]PHST- 2012/07/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00595-012-0256-z [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Surg Today. 2012 Oct;42(10):917-26. doi: 10.1007/s00595-012-0256-z.
