We analyzed the midterm      outcome of patients implanted with these implantable LVADs at the University of      Tokyo Hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 31 patients who underwent      implantation of LVADs (10 DuraHeart, 21 EVAHEART) as a bridge to transplantation       at our institution between April 2011 and August 2013 were retrospectively      reviewed. All patients were followed up through December 2013. Seven patients      underwent conversions from NIPRO paracorporeal LVAD (Nipro, Osaka, Japan) to an      implantable LVAD. The mean observation period was 483+/-239 days (41.0 patient      years). Eight patients were transplanted and one patient showed functional      recovery with subsequent LVAD explantation. Four patients died due to      cerebrovascular accident, empyema, or device malfunction due to pump thrombosis      after cerebral bleeding. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed 6-, 12-, and 24-month      survival rates of 93%, 86%, and 86%, respectively. The rates of freedom from      cerebrovascular accidents and device-related infections at 1 year after LVAD      implantation were 65% and 36%, respectively. Twenty-nine patients were discharged      home after LVAD implantation. During the period of this study, there were 59      readmissions (53 urgent, 6 elective) among 22 patients (76%). The overall and      urgent readmission rates were 1.66 and 1.49 per patient year, respectively. The      common reason for readmission was device-related infection (31%), followed by      cerebrovascular accidents (17%). The total out-of-hospital time after the primary      discharge was 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Our midterm survival rate after LVAD implantation      is satisfactory. However, patients undergoing LVAD support were often readmitted       with adverse events.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
