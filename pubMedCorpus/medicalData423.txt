METHODS: Left ventricular (LV) core samples were collected from      177 patients with severe heart failure at the time of LVAD implantation, and      samples were histologically examined and graded for severity of hypertrophy and      fibrosis. Granulomatous myocarditis incidentally seen in a subset of samples was       characterized by staining and culturing for mycobacteria and fungi. Various      clinical parameters in these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 177 LV core       samples examined, 6 (3.4%) showed nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in      the myocardial wall. Stains and cultures for mycobacteria and fungi were      negative. All six patients [three women, three men; five African American, one      Asian; mean age, 52+/-9 years (range, 41-61 years)] had arrhythmias and required       an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Before LVAD implantation,      the patients' mean cardiac index was 1.8+/-0.4 l/min/m(2); cardiac output,      2.9+/-0.6 l/min; and ejection fraction, 20+/-2%. One year after LVAD      implantation, one patient had undergone heart transplantation. At 2 years, a      second patient was transplanted, and one died. At 3 years, a third patient was      transplanted and died postoperatively; two patients remained on support. No      clinical evidence indicated involvement of other organs or recurrence in the      transplanted patients. CONCLUSION: The incidental diagnosis of granulomatous      myocarditis in our patients indicates that histological study of LV core samples       in patients who undergo LVAD implantation may contribute to the diagnosis and be       a consideration in the management of the underlying cause of heart failure.CI  - (c) 2013.FAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Pathology Research, Texas Heart Institute at St.      Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston, TX.
