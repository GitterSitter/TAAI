Our aim was to      calculate the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: A      cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective was performed. A lifetime      Markov model was set up in which continuous-flow LVAD was compared with optimal      medical therapy (OMT). The treatment effect was modeled indirectly combining the       results of the REMATCH trial comparing OMT with a pulsatile-flow LVAD and the      HeartMate II Destination Therapy Trial comparing a pulsatile-flow LVAD with a      continuous-flow LVAD. Cost data were based on real-world financial data of      sixty-nine patients with a HeartMate II implantation from the University Medical       Centre Utrecht (the Netherlands). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses       were performed. RESULTS: Comparing the continuous-flow HeartMate II with OMT,      3.23 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2.18-4.49) life-years were gained      (LYG) or 2.83 (95 percent CI, 1.91-3.90) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The      cost of an LVAD implant was approximately euro126,000, of which the device itself      represented the largest cost, being euro70,000. Total incremental costs amounted       to euro299,100 (95 percent CI, 190,500-521,000). This resulted in an incremental       cost-effectiveness ratio of euro94,100 (95 percent CI, 59,100-160,100) per LYG or      euro107,600 (95 percent CI, 66,700-181,100) per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed      these results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Although LVAD destination therapy      improves survival and quality of life, it remains a relatively expensive      intervention which renders the reimbursement of this therapy questionable.FAU - Neyt, MattiasAU  - Neyt MAD  - ME-TA, Medical Evaluation and Technology Assessment, Belgium.      mattias.neyt@me-ta.euFAU - Van den Bruel, AnnAU  - Van den Bruel AFAU - Smit, YolbaAU  - Smit YFAU - De Jonge, NicolaasAU  - De Jonge NFAU - Erasmus, MichielAU  - Erasmus MFAU - Van Dijk, DiederikAU  - Van Dijk DFAU - Vlayen, JoanAU  - Vlayen JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130614PL  - EnglandTA  - Int J Technol Assess Health CareJT  - International journal of technology assessment in health careJID - 8508113SB  - IMMH  - Confidence IntervalsMH  - Cost-Benefit AnalysisMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*economicsMH  - HumansMH  - Markov ChainsMH  - NetherlandsMH  - Quality-Adjusted Life YearsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*surgeryEDAT- 2013/06/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/15 06:00PHST- 2013/06/14 [aheadofprint]AID - S0266462313000238 [pii]AID - 10.1017/S0266462313000238 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2013 Jul;29(3):254-60. doi:      10.1017/S0266462313000238.
