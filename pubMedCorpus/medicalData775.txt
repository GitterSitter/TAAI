It is      characterized by maladaptive remodeling of cardiomyocytes, extracellular collagen      matrix (ECCM) and left ventricular (LV) geometry which contributes to further      dysfunction. LV assist devices (LVADs) can reverse adverse remodeling in      end-stage DCM. However, there is a disconnect between the benefits of prolonged      unloading with LVAD at molecular and cellular levels and the low rate of bridge      to recovery (BTR). Potential explanations for this paradox include insufficient      reverse ECCM remodeling and/or excessive reverse cardiomyocyte remodeling with      atrophy. LVAD therapy is associated with decreased collagen turnover and      cross-linking and increased tissue angiotensin II (AngII), whereas LVAD combined       with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition results in decreased tissue AngII      and collagen cross-linking, normalizes LV end-diastolic pressure volume      relationships and is associated with modestly higher rates of BTR. Much remains      to be learned about ventricular reverse remodeling after LVAD. This can be      facilitated through systematic collection and comparison of recovered and      unrecovered myocardium. Importantly, vigilant monitoring for ventricular recovery      among LVAD patients is needed, particularly in older patients receiving LVAD for       destination therapy. In addition, prospective multicenter trials are needed to      clarify the potential benefit of concomitant heart failure therapy with selective      beta2 agonism on ventricular recovery.FAU - Butler, Craig RAU  - Butler CRAD  - Division of Cardiology, Walter C.
