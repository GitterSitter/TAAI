Medical therapies intended to slow or reverse      disease progression have been shown to improve prognosis in prospective trials.      Improvement in prognosis has also been observed in large cohorts across time      strata. However, near-term mortality for those with advanced disease remains      unacceptably high. Prognosis in advanced heart failure may be assessed with the      appropriate use of clinical prediction tools. Optimal timing of evaluation for      heart transplantation and/or mechanical circulatory support depends on an      understanding of these issues.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
