However, the well-described      complications of CPB may exacerbate multiple organ failure and increase blood      product transfusions especially in end-stage heart failure patients. METHODS: We       describe our successful experience in six consecutive patients with profound      cardiogenic shock, who were provided on an emergency basis with a percutaneous      extracorporeal life support (ECLS) system via the peripheral vessels. After      stabilization, a VAD was implanted using ECLS without switching to a conventional      CPB system to reduce its side effects. We compared the data with those of 11      patients in whom the VAD was placed with the aid of an additional CPB system.      RESULTS: The six patients demonstrated a shorter duration of operating room time       compared with the patients requiring CPB for device placement. During and after      surgery, blood loss and blood product transfusions were lower in these patients.       The need for mechanical ventilation and inotropic support was shorter and the      survival rate (100% at 30 days, 83.3% at 3 months and 83.3% at 6 months) was      higher when compared with patients who were operated upon with CPB. Two patients       were successfully bridged to transplantation. One patient died due to cerebral      bleeding after 7 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that VAD      implantation using percutaneous ECLS without switching to conventional CPB is a      safe alternative in the bridge to bridge concept, especially in high-risk      patients with cardiogenic shock who would benefit from the avoidance of the      adverse sequels associated with conventional CPB.FAU - Haneya, AssadAU  - Haneya AAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Medical Center Regensburg,      Regensburg, Germany. assadhaneya@web.deFAU - Philipp, AloisAU  - Philipp AFAU - Puehler, ThomasAU  - Puehler TFAU - Ried, MichaelAU  - Ried MFAU - Hilker, MichaelAU  - Hilker MFAU - Zink, WolfgangAU  - Zink WFAU - Hirt, Stephan WAU  - Hirt SWFAU - Schmid, ChristofAU  - Schmid CLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120106PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - Blood Loss, SurgicalMH  - Cardiopulmonary Bypass/adverse effectsMH  - EmergenciesMH  - Extracorporeal Circulation/adverse effects/*methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/complications/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/methodsMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/etiology/*surgery/therapyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/01/10 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/29 06:00CRDT- 2012/01/10 06:00PHST- 2012/01/06 [aheadofprint]AID - ezr203 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezr203 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jun;41(6):1366-70. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezr203.
