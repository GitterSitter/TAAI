While awaiting transplantation, his heart failure decompensated to such a degree       that left ventricular assist device support was necessary. He did well on device       support until a pump-pocket infection (methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative      staphylococci) developed at 10 months. At that time, echocardiograms showed      normal heart size and an ejection fraction of 0.45 to 0.49 without pump support.       The pump was, therefore, explanted emergently. The patient has remained      clinically stable with preserved ventricular function nearly 13 years after the      explantation procedure.FAU - Demirozu, Zumrut TAU  - Demirozu ZTAD  - Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's Episcopal      Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.FAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Tex Heart Inst JJT  - Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke's      Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children's HospitalJID - 8214622SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/diagnosis/physiopathology/surgery/*therapyMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - Device RemovalMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/physiopathology/surgery/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/microbiology/therapyMH  - Remission InductionMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Staphylococcal Infections/microbiology/therapyMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Waiting ListsPMC - PMC3384055OID - NLM: PMC3384055OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cardiomyopathy, dilated/complications/physiopathologyOT  - cardiovascular agents/therapeutic useOT  - device removalOT  - heart failure/therapyOT  - heart-assist devicesOT  - treatment outcomeOT  - ventricular dysfunction, left/physiopathologyEDAT- 2012/06/29 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/10 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/29 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Tex Heart Inst J. 2012;39(2):268-70.
