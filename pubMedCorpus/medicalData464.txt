As more and more devices are implanted, there is a need to address      effective discharge planning, arrange appropriate follow-up, anticipate and      address complications, and develop strategies for long-term care. In this      article, we will discuss issues surrounding discharge and challenges of managing       patients with MCS in the outpatient setting.FAU - Bellumkonda, LavanyaAU  - Bellumkonda LAD  - Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale School of      Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.
