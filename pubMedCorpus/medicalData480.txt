This review provides an overview of these two modalities, including a      discussion of indications, contraindications, timing, and device selection, as      part of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society/Extracorporeal Life Support       Organization Joint Statement on Mechanical Circulatory Support. DATA SOURCES,      STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION: PubMed was searched using the following terms:       ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ventricular assist device, VAD, and      pediatric. Case reports, single-center series, multicenter studies, and registry       reports were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: The two technologies have unique advantages      and disadvantages and may be considered complementary devices, although they are       frequently used in sequence. Either modality may be used as bridge-to-transplant       or bridge-to-recovery, and the choice of device and device timing is influenced      by the acuity of illness, comorbidities, potential for recovery, and anticipated       duration of support.FAU - Jaquiss, Robert D BAU  - Jaquiss RDAD  - Department of Surgery, Duke Children's Hospital and Duke University School of      Medicine, Durham, NC, USA. robert.jaquiss@duke.eduFAU - Bronicki, Ronald AAU  - Bronicki RALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Pediatr Crit Care MedJT  - Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care      Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care      SocietiesJID - 100954653SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansEDAT- 2013/06/14 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/12 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/06 06:00AID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e318292dca5 [doi]AID - 00130478-201306001-00002 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2013 Jun;14(5 Suppl 1):S3-6. doi:      10.1097/PCC.0b013e318292dca5.
