In addition, females have been underrepresented in most      multicenter randomized controlled trials for mechanical circulatory support      (MCS). The objective of our study was to analyze our experience implanting 130      continuous-flow LVADs and to determine the impact of sex on survival. We      identified 130 patients who underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD at      our institution. Patients were stratified into two groups based on sex. Variables      were compared using two-sided t-tests, chi(2) tests, Cox proportional hazards      models, and log-rank tests to determine whether there was a difference between      the two groups and if sex was a significant independent predictor of outcome. Of       the 130 patients, 35 were females and 95 were males. Female patients had worse      pre-LVAD cardiac output and cardiac index and were more likely to be on MCS at      the time of implantation. Male patients had worse renal function. Survival was      analogous for both cohorts with 30 day, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year survivals of       97%, 90.8%, 90.8%, and 84.3%, respectively, for female patients versus 94.7%,      87.9%, 78.4%, and 72.8%, respectively, for male patients. The incidence of other       LVAD-related complications was also similar in both groups. Gender did not      predict postoperative mortality on univariate analysis. Contrary to most      published reports, female and male LVAD patients have similar postoperative and      midterm survival, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and postoperative      complications. It appears that females have gained more benefit from newer      generation devices compared to males.FAU - Tsiouris, AthanasiosAU  - Tsiouris AAD  - From the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Henry Ford Hospital, Heart and      Vascular Institute, Detroit, Michigan.FAU - Morgan, Jeffrey AAU  - Morgan JAFAU - Nemeh, Hassan WAU  - Nemeh HWFAU - Hodari, ArielleAU  - Hodari AFAU - Brewer, Robert JAU  - Brewer RJFAU - Paone, GaetanoAU  - Paone GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures/adverse effectsMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Length of StayMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Patient ReadmissionMH  - Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/etiologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC3942347OID - NLM: PMC3942347EDAT- 2014/03/01 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/25 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/01 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000048 [doi]AID - 00002480-201403000-00011 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Mar-Apr;60(2):199-206. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000048.
