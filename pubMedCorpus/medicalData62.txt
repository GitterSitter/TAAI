Surgical and device-based approaches have been introduced with the aim of      increasing systemic perfusion and in some circumstances promoting left      ventricular recovery by inducing reverse remodelling. Innovative counterpulsation      devices based on the established principle of the intra-aortic balloon pump have       been developed, and of these, the CardioVad and the C-Pulse System have been      introduced in clinical practice with convincing evidence of haemodynamic      efficacy. The evolution from pulsatile to continuous-flow left ventricular assist      devices has been associated with improved survival rates during the first 2 years      of support with the potential of matching heart transplantation outcomes.      However, blood contact with the device remains a significant challenge despite      the highly sophisticated technology currently available. Innovative      extra-vascular counterpulsation devices have been shown to overcome the      limitations of the intra-aortic balloon pump and rend the device suitable for      prolonged support. Monitoring of the performance of these novel devices is      essential, and carotid Doppler ultrasonography is of utility in assessing the      haemodynamic performance of the devices in a clinical setting. Computational      modelling has played a role in the simulation of these devices and should      continue to assist with their optimisation and implementation in clinical      practice.FAU - Capoccia, MAU  - Capoccia MAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery, Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, UK,      capoccia@doctors.org.uk.FAU - Bowles, C TAU  - Bowles CTFAU - Pepper, J RAU  - Pepper JRFAU - Banner, N RAU  - Banner NRFAU - Simon, A RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Fail RevJT  - Heart failure reviewsJID - 9612481SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/18 06:00AID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9468-1 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2015 May;20(3):323-35. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9468-1.
