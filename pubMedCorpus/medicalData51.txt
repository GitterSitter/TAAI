It       is important to understand the management and complications observed in this      population that eventually progresses to systemic ventricular failure requiring      cardiac transplantation. Our case focuses on the rapid right ventricle (RV)      deterioration of a patient with corrected D-TGA following a surgical procedure      requiring systemic support. With such patients awaiting heart transplantation,      there are limited assist devices available for RV support and no right      ventricular assist device is approved for destination therapy yet. Current      indications for implantation of the HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD)      are limited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the left ventricle      support as a bridge to transplantation. However, its use in the United States for      right-sided support has rarely been described for adult congenital defects. In      this case, a HeartWare assist device was used to provide systemic support as a      bridge to cardiac transplant. The size and implantation design of the HVAD makes       it a promising option for patients with this challenging patient population and      RV failure as a late complication.CI  - (c) The Author(s) 2015.FAU - Sehgal, SankalpAU  - Sehgal SAD  - Hahnemann University Hospital/Drexel University College of Medicine,      Philadelphia, PA, USA sehgal_sankalp@yahoo.com.FAU - Ramachandran, SujathaAU  - Ramachandran SAD  - Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.FAU - Leff, Jonathan DAU  - Leff JDAD  - Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.LA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150118TA  - Semin Cardiothorac Vasc AnesthJT  - Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesiaJID - 9807630OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Mustard procedureOT  - adult congenital heart diseaseOT  - dextro-transposition of great arteries (D-TGA)OT  - transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)OT  - ventricular assist device (VAD)EDAT- 2015/01/21 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/21 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/21 06:00AID - 1089253214566886 [pii]AID - 10.1177/1089253214566886 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Semin Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 2015 Jan 18. pii: 1089253214566886.
