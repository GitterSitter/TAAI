BACKGROUND: RVF is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Limited      data regarding efficacy of the CF-RVSD for RVF exist. METHODS: We retrospectively      reviewed data from 46 patients receiving a CF-RVSD for RVF from a registry      comprising data from 8 tertiary-care hospitals in the United States. CF-RVSD use       was recorded in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; myocarditis; chronic       left heart failure; after valve surgery, orthotopic heart transplantation, left      ventricular assist device surgery, coronary bypass grafting. Devices were      implanted via the percutaneous (n = 22) or surgical (n = 24) route. RESULTS: No      intraprocedural mortality was observed. Mean time from admission to CF-RVSD      implantation was 5.7 +/- 8.5 days, with a mean of 6,769 +/- 789 rotations/min,      providing 4.2 +/- 1.3 l/min of flow. Mean duration of support was 5.4 +/- 5.1      days. Mean arterial pressure (65 +/- 12 mm Hg vs. 73 +/- 14 mm Hg; p < 0.05),      right atrial pressure (21 +/- 8 mm Hg vs. 16 +/- 7 mm Hg; p = 0.05), pulmonary      artery systolic pressure (43 +/- 15 mm Hg vs. 33 +/- 15 mm Hg; p = 0.01), and      cardiac index (1.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.6; p = 0.01) were improved within 48 h      of CF-RVSD implantation. Total in-hospital mortality was 57% and was lowest in      the setting of left ventricular assist device implantation, chronic left heart      failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Increased age, biventricular failure,      and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-defined major bleeding were associated       with increased in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the CF-RVSD for RVF is       clinically feasible and associated with improved hemodynamic status. Observations      from the registry of patients who have received this device may support the      development of prospective studies that will examine the role of percutaneous      circulatory support for RVF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
