The incidence of right ventricular dysfunction after left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation that fails to resolve in the      operating room is reported to be as frequent as 20% to 50% and imposes a      considerable burden in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Should      this syndrome supervene, the mortality of an LVAD operation increases from 19% to      43%. Although most patients can be maintained with prolonged inotropic support,      10% to 15% may require implantation of a separate right ventricular support      device.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011.
