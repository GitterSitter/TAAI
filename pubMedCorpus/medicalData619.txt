In order to provide an update and insight on this      question, we briefly review from where the field has come, and in more detail      describe its current state and where we are heading. We believe the short answer       to this question is 'Yes', but like many things, a short answer is not adequate.       Here we attempt to deliver a more comprehensive answer, providing some historical      context, outlining the great achievements that have been made, as well as the      many challenges that still remain before LVADs become a truly mainstream therapy.FAU - Hrobowski, TaraAU  - Hrobowski TAD  - Henry Ford Heart and Vascular Institute, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.FAU - Lanfear, David EAU  - Lanfear DELA  - engGR  - K23 HL085124/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 HL103871/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Heart Fail RepJT  - Current heart failure reportsJID - 101196487SB  - IMMH  - Cost-Benefit AnalysisMH  - Heart Failure/economics/history/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/economics/historyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - History, 21st CenturyMH  - HumansMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC3568259MID - NIHMS419770OID - NLM: NIHMS419770OID - NLM: PMC3568259EDAT- 2012/11/07 06:00MHDA- 2013/07/11 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/07 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11897-012-0123-7 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2013 Mar;10(1):101-7. doi: 10.1007/s11897-012-0123-7.
