These devices may be used as a      bridge to transplant, destination therapy, or to recovery, providing either      pulsatile or nonpulsatile support. Because of the increasing frequency of left      ventricular assist device utilization and the improved short-term and long-term      survival after placement, there has been a parallel increase in the radiologic      imaging of patients with these devices, mandating radiologists' awareness of the       manifestations of common complications, including infection, thrombosis and      embolism, cannula obstruction, hemorrhage, and complications of adjacent vessels       and viscera, all of which will be discussed in this pictorial essay.FAU - Mellnick, Vincent MAU  - Mellnick VMAD  - Washington University School of Medicine, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology ,      St. Louis, MO 63110, USA. vinniemellnick@yahoo.comFAU - Raptis, Demetrios AAU  - Raptis DAFAU - Raptis, ConstantineAU  - Raptis CFAU - Bhalla, SanjeevAU  - Bhalla SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Thorac ImagingJT  - Journal of thoracic imagingJID - 8606160SB  - IMMH  - CathetersMH  - Embolism/radiographyMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effects/microbiologyMH  - Hemorrhage/etiology/radiographyMH  - HumansMH  - Radiography, InterventionalMH  - Surgical Wound Infection/epidemiologyMH  - Thrombosis/radiographyEDAT- 2011/12/27 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/28 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/27 06:00AID - 10.1097/RTI.0b013e318232e5e4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Thorac Imaging. 2013 Mar;28(2):W35-41. doi: 10.1097/RTI.0b013e318232e5e4.
