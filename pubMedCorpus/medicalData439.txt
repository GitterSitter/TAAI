We      report the case of a patient who was supported with the same Levitronix CentriMag      pump for 119 days without changing any components of the circuit or the pump head      because of an anatomical condition which precluded the feasibility of pump      exchange and who did not experience any mechanical failure of the impeller but      eventually died due to the rupture of the cannulae. This is the first report of      failure of paracorporeal short-term LVAD due to disruption of one cannula with a       properly functioning pump.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Pappalardo, FedericoAU  - Pappalardo FAD  - Cardiac Surgery ICU, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.FAU - Nisi, TeodoraAU  - Nisi TFAU - Melisurgo, GiulioAU  - Melisurgo GFAU - Calabrese, MariachiaraAU  - Calabrese MFAU - De Bonis, MicheleAU  - De Bonis MLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - Catheters/*adverse effectsMH  - *Equipment FailureMH  - Fatal OutcomeMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2013/07/25 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/22 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/25 06:00AID - 10.1111/jocs.12149 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2013 Jul;28(4):472-4. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12149.
