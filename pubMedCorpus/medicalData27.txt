However, little is known on the impact of      continuous-flow LVADs on the vascular supply of the colon for anastomoses. In      this case, a 67-year-old male supported on an LVAD underwent four successful      noncardiac operations including two intestinal anastomoses; left colon and small       bowel anastomosis. To the best of our knowledge, no existing literature has      reported successful colonic anastomosis on a continuous-flow LVAD. This case      illustrates the plausibility of performing colonic anastomoses with appropriately      selected patients supported on an LVAD. A 67-year-old male with congestive heart       failure underwent LVAD placement for decompensated heart failure while awaiting      orthotopic transplantation. During his recovery, he developed a stage IV sacral      decubitus ulcer which required a sigmoid loop colostomy placement and a      rotational flap. Subsequent stoma closure with partial sigmoid colectomy and      stapled anastomosis was performed, and healed without evidence of anastomotic      leak. This case illustrates the potential for colonic anastomoses for patients on      continuous-flow LVAD support. Although oxygenation is known to be an important      aspect of healing, this patient's outcome suggests that intestinal anastomoses      can be performed on the induced pulseless environment of an LVAD. Further studies      will be needed to further elucidate the success of longer segment resections and       appropriate surgical candidates.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015.
