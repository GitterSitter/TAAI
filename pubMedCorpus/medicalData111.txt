However, expansion of this technology is still limited by      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential to      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor       may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditional      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may       also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.      Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to       outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base to      support these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potential      predictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely a      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive      techniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,      recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements and      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting of      CF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) consider      potential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTN      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new      reliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research and      management possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the       CF-LVAD patient population move forward.FAU - Wasson, Lauren TAU  - Wasson LTAD  - NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center, 622 West 168th Street,       PH12-134, New York, NY, 10032-3720, USA.FAU - Yuzefpolskaya, MelanaAU  - Yuzefpolskaya MFAU - Wakabayashi, MichiyoriAU  - Wakabayashi MFAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HFAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YFAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NFAU - Jorde, Ulrich PAU  - Jorde UPFAU - Demmer, Ryan TAU  - Demmer RTFAU - Colombo, Paolo CAU  - Colombo PCLA  - engGR  - T32 HL007343/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Fail RevJT  - Heart failure reviewsJID - 9612481SB  - IMPMC - PMC4385742MID - NIHMS633555OID - NLM: NIHMS633555 [Available on 05/01/16]OID - NLM: PMC4385742 [Available on 05/01/16]EDAT- 2014/10/07 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/07 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/07 06:00PMCR- 2016/05/01 00:00AID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2015 May;20(3):317-22. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3.
