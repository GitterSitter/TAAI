With better understanding of heart failure      pathophysiology, new pharmacological agents have been introduced that have      resulted in improvements in survival. For those patients that fail to improve,      mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices and total      artificial hearts (TAHs) have served as a beneficial bridge to transplantation.      The TAH has continued to play a significant role as a bridge to transplantation      in patients with biventricular failure and more selected indications that could      not be completely helped with left ventricular assist devices. Improved survival       with the TAH has resulted in more patients benefiting from this technology.      Improvements will eventually lead to a totally implantable device that will      permanently replace the failing human heart.FAU - Arabia, Francisco AAU  - Arabia FAAD  - Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute,      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 127 S.
