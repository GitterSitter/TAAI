Recently, left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation has been increasingly used in      reducing pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with PH unresponsive to      medical therapy. Herein, we aimed to compare the efficacy of continuous-flow and       pulsatile-flow blood pumps on the improvement of PH in mechanical circulatory      support patients. Twenty-seven patients with end-stage heart failure who      underwent LVAD implantation surgery were enrolled. Fifteen of them (55.6%) had      continuous-flow pump (HeartWare Ventricular Assist System, HeartWare, Inc.,      Miramar, FL, USA), and 12 of them (44.4%) had pulsatile pump (Berlin Heart EXCOR       ventricular assist device, Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany). The efficacy of      LVADs on the improvement of PH was compared between continuous-flow and pulsatile      pumps by the evaluation of systolic PAP, tricuspid annular plane systolic      excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular systolic motion (RVSM), right ventricular      ejection fraction (RVEF), and grade of tricuspid insufficiency (TI) for each of      the study participants. All of the 15 patients who underwent continuous-flow      blood pump implantation surgery (Group 1) were male with a mean age of 46.9 +/-      11.7 years, and in pulsatile-flow blood pump implanted participants (Group 2),      the mean age was 40.6 +/- 16.8 years, all of whom were also male (P=0.259). Mean       follow-up was 313.7 +/- 241.3 days in Group 1 and 448.7 +/- 120.7 days in Group 2      (P=0.139). In Group 1, mean preoperative and postoperative systolic PAP were      measured as 51.7 +/- 12.2 mm Hg and 22.2 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, while those      in Group 2 were 54.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg and 33.9 +/- 6.4 mm Hg, respectively. A      significantly greater decrease in systolic PAP was noticed in patients with      continuous-flow blood pumps (P=0.023); however, no statistically significant      difference was found when we considered the change in TAPSE between study groups       (P=0.112). A statistical significance in the alteration of RVEF, RVSM, and the      grade of TI during study visits was not found between the study groups (P=0.472,       P=0.887, and P=0.237, respectively). Although the two studied types of LVADs were      found to be effective in reducing PAP in heart transplantation candidates with      PH, lesser postoperative systolic PAP values were achieved in patients who      underwent continuous-flow pump implantation surgery.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs      and Transplantation.FAU - Ozturk, PelinAU  - Ozturk PAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Ege University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.FAU - Engin, Aysen YaprakAU  - Engin AYFAU - Nalbantgil, SanemAU  - Nalbantgil SFAU - Oguz, EmrahAU  - Oguz EFAU - Ayik, FatihAU  - Ayik FFAU - Engin, CagatayAU  - Engin CFAU - Yagdi, TahirAU  - Yagdi TFAU - Erkul, SinanAU  - Erkul SFAU - Balcioglu, OzlemAU  - Balcioglu OFAU - Ozbaran, MustafaAU  - Ozbaran MLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130911PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Blood PressureMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/complications/*surgeryMH  - Heart Ventricles/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Hypertension, Pulmonary/complications/*physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Pulmonary Artery/*physiopathologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart failureOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - Pulmonary artery pressureOT  - Pulmonary hypertensionEDAT- 2013/09/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/17 06:00PHST- 2013/09/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12164 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2013 Sep;37(9):763-7. doi: 10.1111/aor.12164.
