The aim was to assess the use of levosimendan vs.      conventional inotropes and the use as planned repetitive vs. acute treatment, in       Sweden. METHODS: We performed a descriptive study with individual patient      validation assessing the use of levosimendan and conventional intravenous      inotropes, indications for levosimendan, clinical characteristics and survival in      the Swedish Heart Failure Registry between 2000 and 2011. For repetitive      levosimendan, we assessed potential indications for alternative interventions.      RESULTS: Of 53,548 total registrations, there were 655 confirmed with inotrope      use (597 levosimendan, 37 conventional, 21 both) from 22 hospitals responding to       validation, and 6069 in-patient controls with New York Heart Association III-IV      and ejection fraction <40%. The indications for levosimendan were acute HF in 384      registrations (306 patients), and planned repetitive in 234 registrations (87      patients). Planned repetitive as a proportion of total levosimendan registrations      ranged 0-65% and of total levosimendan patients ranged 0-54% in different      hospitals. Of planned repetitive patients without existing cardiac      resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, transplant      and/or assist device, 46-98% were potential candidates for such interventions.      CONCLUSION: In HF in cardiology and internal medicine in Sweden, levosimendan was      the overwhelming inotrope of choice, and the use of planned repetitive      levosimendan was extensive, highly variable between hospitals and may have      pre-empted other interventions. Potential effects of and indications for planned       repetitive levosimendan need to be evaluated in prospective studies.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
