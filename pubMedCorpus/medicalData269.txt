METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 141      patients who received LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplant from May 1999      to January 2013. We assessed short- and long-term right heart function in 69 of      these patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair because of moderate-to-severe      tricuspid regurgitation (TR) or severe dilatation of the tricuspid annulus. RVF      was defined as the need for a right ventricular assist device or >30 days of      intravenous inotropic support. TR was graded from 0 to 4, while fibrosis in      myocardial biopsy samples was graded pathologically from 0 to 3. RESULTS: The      average duration of LVAD support was 595 days. Twenty-seven patients developed      RVF and their survival rate was significantly worse than that of patients who did      not develop RVF (65 vs 91% at 1 year). RVF was significantly related to high      preoperative ratio of central venous pressure (CVP) to pulmonary capillary wedge       pressure, high total bilirubin, high fibrosis score and high TR grade. In      patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair, the TR grade was significantly      reduced from 2.6 to 1.0, and this decrease was maintained for 2 years. Although      patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair had significantly higher TR grades,      ratios of CVP to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and fibrosis scores      preoperatively, no survival impairment was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid valve      repair is a useful and durable adjuvant procedure for restoring deteriorated      right ventricular function in patients requiring LVAD implantation.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
