The most significant advance in this      field has been the longer durability of devices secondary to a simpler pump      design with fewer or no mechanical bearings and valves. Continuous-flow LVADs      have recently been shown to provide safe and effective circulatory support and      have replaced the first-generation fill-to-empty devices. The Thoratec HeartMate       II and the HeartWare HVAD are currently the 2 most commonly implanted LVADs      worldwide. As LVAD technology moves forward and new miniaturized, more durable,      and reliable pumps are being developed, the number of recipients who will benefit      from this technology continues to grow. Elimination of the driveline with fully      implantable pumps, implantation of miniature pumps with minimally invasive      surgical techniques, wireless data transmission, and improved patient selection      will further transform this field in the next few years.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
