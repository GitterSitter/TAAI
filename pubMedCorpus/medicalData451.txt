Conversion of very complex congenital heart anatomy, such      as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, double-outlet right ventricle or double-inlet      left ventricle, to a single ventricle has grown in popularity as morbidity and      mortality have improved. As these patients grow, survivors are at risk for      impaired ventricular dysfunction, plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy       and late failure. Late failing Fontan patients represent a particularly vexing      scenario for clinicians, as the only durable treatment option is cardiac      transplantation. However, in the short-term, some of these patients require      support beyond medical management, with mechanical circulatory support via      extracorporeal life support or a ventricular assist device. We report the      successful bridge of an adolescent female post-Fontan conversion with late severe      cardiac failure. The patient was initially resuscitated with extracorporeal life       support, transitioned to a single Berlin Heart EXCOR(R) ventricular assist device      and, subsequently, underwent successful cardiac transplantation.FAU - Sanders, D BAU  - Sanders DBAD  - 1Scott and Laura Eller Congenital Heart Center, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical      Center, Phoenix, AZ, USA.FAU - Sowell, S RAU  - Sowell SRFAU - Park, S SAU  - Park SSFAU - Derby, CAU  - Derby CFAU - Willis, B CAU  - Willis BCFAU - Lane, J EAU  - Lane JEFAU - Pierce, C NAU  - Pierce CNFAU - Arabia, F AAU  - Arabia FAFAU - Pophal, S GAU  - Pophal SGFAU - Nigro, J JAU  - Nigro JJLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130710PL  - EnglandTA  - PerfusionJT  - PerfusionJID - 8700166SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*methods/standardsMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/standardsMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/standardsMH  - HumansMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - bridge to transplantOT  - cardiac transplantOT  - extracorporeal life supportOT  - late failed Fontan circulationOT  - single ventricleOT  - ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/07/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/04 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/12 06:00PHST- 2013/07/10 [aheadofprint]AID - 0267659113495913 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0267659113495913 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Perfusion. 2014 Jan;29(1):89-93. doi: 10.1177/0267659113495913.
