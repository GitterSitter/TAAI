The aim of      this study was to present our institutional experience and mid-term outcomes      after implantation of 139 continuous-flow (cf) LVADs as a bridge to      transplantation. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-nine consecutive LVAD      implantations were performed in our institution between July 2007 and August      2013. The mean age of the population was 44.0 +/- 13.7 years and 24 (17%) of the       patients were female. A substantial number of the patients were on preoperative      mechanical support: 35 (25%) with an intra-aortic balloon pump, 9 (6.5%) with an       extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and 25 (18%) with previous LVAD, for LVAD      exchange. RESULTS: The mean support duration was 514 +/- 481 days, whereas the      longest support duration was 2493 days (>6 years). The overall cumulative      survival rate following cfLVAD implantation was 89% at 30 days, 76% at 1 year and      66% at 2 years (Fig. 1). There was a statistically significant difference in      survival in favour of first LVAD implantation compared with VAD exchange: 91 vs      80% at 30 days, 79 vs 57% at 1 year and 70 vs 43% at 2 years (log-rank P =      0.010). Postoperatively, patients had a significant improvement in end-organ      function 1 month after LVAD implantation. In addition, comparison of two      different devices [HeartMate II (HM II) and HeartWare] using propensity score      matching showed no significant differences in survival and most postoperative      adverse events. However, patients supported with HM II required significantly      more units of fresh frozen plasma (P = 0.020) with a trend towards a higher use      of red blood cells (P = 0.094), and were also more likely to develop percutaneous      site infections (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: HM II and HeartWare cfLVADs have      excellent early postoperative outcomes and good mid-term survival, despite a      considerable number of patients needing VAD exchange.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
