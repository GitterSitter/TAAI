However, there are       only limited data on MV support among children after ventricular assist device      (VAD) implantation. We report the duration of MV after VAD placement, indications      for respiratory support in the postimplantation period, and associated patient      factors. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 43 consecutive       children (aged <18 years) with end-stage heart failure who were supported with a       VAD as a bridge to transplantation from January 2005 to December 2011.      Multivariable analysis was performed using the multiple Poisson regression model       for the duration of MV. RESULTS: Overall, 33% (n = 14) remained on MV until heart      transplant or death. Of those requiring pre-VAD extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation (ECMO) support, 63% (n = 12 of 19) remained on MV until heart      transplant or death compared with 8% (n = 2 of 24) among those not on ECMO before      VAD (p < 0.001). Patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation while on      VAD support had 1.7-times more MV days compared with those with none or trivial      on-VAD mitral regurgitation. In addition, previous support on ECMO, those with      moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants      had an increased risk of prolonged MV. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VAD       recipients previously supported on ECMO, those with moderate or severe mitral      regurgitation, moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, and those with only      left VAD implants had an increased risk of prolonged MV. Future studies in larger      cohorts are necessary to confirm the findings from this single-institutional      experience.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
