This study      documented changes in cognitive performance in DT patients from that trial to      determine if there were differences between continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow      support. METHODS: Data were collected in a sub-study from 96 HeartMate II      continuous-flow and 30 HeartMate XVE pulsatile-flow LVAD patients from 12 of the       35 trial sites that followed the same serial neurocognitive (NC) testing protocol      at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after LVAD implantation. Spatial perception,      memory, language, executive functions, and processing speed were the domains      assessed with 10 standard cognitive measures. Differences over time and between      LVAD type were evaluated with linear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: From 1 to      24 months after LVAD implantation, changes in NC functions were stable or showed       improvement in all domains, and there were no differences between the      continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow groups. Data at 24 months were only available       from patients with the continuous-flow LVAD due to the limited durability of the       HeartMate XVE device. There was no decline in any NC domain over the time of LVAD      support. Missing data not collected from patients who died could have resulted in      a bias toward inflated study results. CONCLUSIONS: The NC performance of advanced      heart failure patients supported with continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow LVADs      shows stabilization or improvement during support for up to 24 months.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
