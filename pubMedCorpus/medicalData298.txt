Data from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support.PG  - 300-9LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000721 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe the characteristics and outcomes of peripartum      cardiomyopathy (PPCMP) patients who received durable mechanical circulatory      support and compared it with other etiologies of advanced heart failure. METHODS       AND RESULTS: We analyzed 1258 women who were registered in Interagency Registry      for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support between June 2006 and March 2012.      Baseline characteristics, implant strategies, hemodynamics, echocardiographic      data, and outcomes were compared. Ninety-nine women had PPCMP and 1159 had      non-PPCMP as primary diagnosis. PPCMP women were younger (P<0.001), more likely      to be blacks, and had less comorbidities than non-PPCMP patients. PPCMP women had      better survival than non-PPCMP women (P=0.01) with a 2-year survival of 83%.      Multivariable risk factor adjustment analysis showed that the improved survival      was likely because of younger age and fewer comorbidities. At 36 months, a      proportion of 48% PPCMP received heart transplantation. Recovery occurred at a      frequency of 6% and 2% in the PPCMP and non-PPCMP groups (P=0.1). Adverse event      rates were similar in PPCMP and non-PPCMP patients except for higher cardiac      arrhythmias and respiratory failure in the non-PPCMP in the first 3 months post      implant. CONCLUSIONS: PPCMP women who receive durable mechanical circulatory      support have a better survival than women with non-PPCPM. The improved survival      observed in PPCMP is likely related to their fewer comorbidities and younger age.      Myocardial recovery was uncommon and less than half of women with end-stage PPCPM      received heart transplantation after 3 years of mechanical support.FAU - Loyaga-Rendon, Renzo YAU  - Loyaga-Rendon RYAD  - Cardiovascular Diseases Division, Cardiothoracic Surgery Division, Department of       Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham; and      Section of Heart Failure, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH.FAU - Pamboukian, Salpy VAU  - Pamboukian SVFAU - Tallaj, Jose AAU  - Tallaj JAFAU - Acharya, DeepakAU  - Acharya DFAU - Cantor, RyanAU  - Cantor RFAU - Starling, Randall CAU  - Starling RCFAU - Naftel, DavidAU  - Naftel DFAU - Kirklin, JamesAU  - Kirklin JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20140117PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
