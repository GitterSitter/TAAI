However, the effect of hemodynamic unloading with a LVAD on       myocardial viability and LV function in chronically supported LVAD patients has      not been fully characterized. We aimed to develop a non-invasive imaging protocol      to serially quantify native cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability      while at reduced LVAD support. METHODS: Clinically stable (n = 18) ambulatory      patients (83% men, median age, 61 years) supported by a HeartMate II (Thoratec,      Pleasanton, CA) LVAD (median durations of heart failure 4.6 years and LVAD      support 7 months) were evaluated by echocardiography and technetium-99m      ((99m)Tc)-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging at      baseline and after an interval of 2 to 3 months. Echocardiographic measures of LV      size and function, including speckle tracking-derived circumferential strain,      were compared between ambulatory and reduced LVAD support at baseline and between      baseline and follow-up at reduced LVAD support. The extent of myocardial      viability by SPECT was compared between baseline and follow-up at reduced LVAD      support. RESULTS: With reduction in LVAD speeds (6,600 rpm; interquartile range:       6,200, 7,400 rpm), LV size increased, LV systolic function remained stable, and      filling pressures nominally worsened. After a median 2.1 months, cardiac      structure, function, and the extent of viable myocardium, globally and      regionally, was unchanged on repeat imaging while at reduced LVAD speed.      CONCLUSIONS: In clinically stable chronically supported LVAD patients, intrinsic       cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability did not significantly      change over the pre-specified time frame. Echocardiographic circumferential      strain and (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT myocardial viability imaging may provide      useful non-invasive end points for the assessment of cardiac structure and      function, particularly for phase II studies of novel therapies aimed at promoting      reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery in LVAD patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
