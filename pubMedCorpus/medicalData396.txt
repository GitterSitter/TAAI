We present      our remote monitoring experience with an axial-flow LVAD (HeartAssist-5, MicroMed      Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA). Five consecutive patients who were      implanted a HeartAssist-5 LVAD because of end-stage heart failure due to ischemic      (n=4) or idiopathic (n=1) cardiomyopathy, and discharged from hospital between      December 2011 and January 2013 were analyzed. The data (pump speed, pump flow,      power consumption) obtained from clinical visits and remote monitoring were      studied. During a median follow-up of 253 (range: 80-394) days, fine tuning of      LVADs was performed at clinical visits. All patients are doing well and are in      New York Heart Association Class-I/II. A total of 39 alarms were received from      three patients. One patient was hospitalized for suspected thrombosis and was      subjected to physical examinations as well as laboratory and echocardiographic      evaluations; however, no evidence of thrombus washout or pump thrombus was found.      The patient was treated conservatively. Remaining alarms were due to insufficient      water intake and were resolved by increased water consumption at night and summer      times, and fine tuning of pump speed. No alarms were received from the remaining       two patients. We believe that remote monitoring is a useful technology for early       detection and treatment of serious problems occurring out of hospital thereby      improving patient care. Future developments may ease troubleshooting, provide      more data from the patient and the pump, and eventually increase physician and      patient satisfaction. Despite all potential clinical benefits, remote monitoring       should be taken as a supplement to rather than a substitute for routine clinical       visits for patient follow-up.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs      and Transplantation.FAU - Pektok, ErmanAU  - Pektok EAD  - Heart Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support Center, Sisli Florence      Nightingale Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.FAU - Demirozu, Zumrut TubaAU  - Demirozu ZTFAU - Arat, NurcanAU  - Arat NFAU - Yildiz, OmerAU  - Yildiz OFAU - Oklu, EmineAU  - Oklu EFAU - Eker, DenizAU  - Eker DFAU - Ece, FerahAU  - Ece FFAU - Ciftci, CavlanAU  - Ciftci CFAU - Yazicioglu, NuranAU  - Yazicioglu NFAU - Bayindir, OsmanAU  - Bayindir OFAU - Kucukaksu, Deniz SuhaAU  - Kucukaksu DSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130822PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/surgeryMH  - Heart Ventricles/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Remote Sensing Technology/*methodsOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Continuous-flow pumpOT  - HeartAssist-5 left ventricular assist deviceOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - Remote monitoringEDAT- 2013/09/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/17 06:00PHST- 2013/08/22 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12144 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2013 Sep;37(9):820-5. doi: 10.1111/aor.12144.
