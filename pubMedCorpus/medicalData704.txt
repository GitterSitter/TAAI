METHODS: The aim of the study is to investigate the      significance of pre-existing RV dysfunction, tricuspid valve (TV) insufficiency,       and the severity of septal deviation following LVAD implantation on RV      dysfunction, as well as the outcome and short-term complications in 51 patients      from June 2006 to August 2010. Student t test was used to compare the data and      estimate the p value. RESULTS: Mean age was 55.1 +/- 13, with a male to female      ratio of 3.25. The 30-day mortality was 13.7% (7/51 patients), and the overall      mortality was 23.5% (12/51 patients). Meanwhile, 21 patients (21/51; 41.2%) have       undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. The mean time of support was      314.5+/-235 days with a median of 240 days at the time of closing this study.      Echocardiographic evaluation of RV function pre- and post-implantation of an LVAD      demonstrated septal deviation towards the left ventricle in immediate      postoperative phase, which correlated with acute RV dysfunction (p = 0.002).      Preoperative RV dysfunction was a significant predictor of postoperative right      heart dysfunction following implantation of an LVAD (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION:      Preoperative RV dysfunction is a predictor of RV failure in LVAD patients. The      adjustment of septal deviation through gradual increase of the LVAD flow can      prevent the acute RV dysfunction following LVAD placement.FAU - Neragi-Miandoab, SiyamekAU  - Neragi-Miandoab SAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New      York, NY 10467, USA. sneragi@yahoo.comFAU - Goldstein, DanielAU  - Goldstein DFAU - Bello, RicardoAU  - Bello RFAU - Michler, RobertAU  - Michler RFAU - D'Alessandro, DavidAU  - D'Alessandro DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120627PL  - EnglandTA  - J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Journal of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101265113SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*instrumentation/methodsMH  - Cardiomyopathies/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart Septum/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/physiopathology/*surgeryPMC - PMC3403957OID - NLM: PMC3403957EDAT- 2012/06/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/31 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/29 06:00PHST- 2011/11/19 [received]PHST- 2012/06/27 [accepted]PHST- 2012/06/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 1749-8090-7-60 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jun 27;7:60. doi: 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60.
