This study evaluated the      efficacy of the Jarvik 2000 ventricular assist device (VAD) as a pulmonary pump      to power a Fontan circuit in a large animal model. METHODS: Without the use of      cardiopulmonary bypass, Fontan circulations were surgically created in 4 pigs (50      kg) using synthetic grafts from the inferior and superior vena cavas to the main       pulmonary artery. Subsequently, the VAD was implanted within the common Fontan      graft to provide a pulmonary pump. Direct chamber pressures and epicardial      Doppler images were taken during the various phases of the experiment. Heart      rate, femoral artery blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and aortic flow rate were      continuously recorded. The outflow cannula of the VAD was then partially banded      by 50% and then 75% to mimic increased afterload. RESULTS: Fontan and VAD      implantation was successfully performed in all 4 animals. Arterial pressure and      aortic flow decreased dramatically with institution of the Fontan but were      restored to baseline upon activation of the VAD. The pressure within the systemic      venous circulation rose precipitously with institution of the Fontan circulation       and improved appropriately with activation of the VAD. Adequate perfusion was      maintained during increased afterload. CONCLUSIONS: An axial flow VAD can restore      normal hemodynamics and cardiac output when used as a pulmonary pump in a Fontan       circulation. A VAD can rescue a failing Fontan as a bridge to transplant or      recovery, even in the setting of high pulmonary resistance.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
