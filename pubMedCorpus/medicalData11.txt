Many LVAD programs       require patients to have a caregiver before receiving a device. There are few      studies exploring the experience, burden, and impacts on caregivers of patients      with LVADs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to synthesize the qualitative      literature regarding caregiver's perceptions about caring for an adult LVAD      patient. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Web of Science to      find English articles on the topic of LVAD caregiver's perceptions. The articles       were then synthesized using a formal process of qualitative meta-synthesis.      RESULTS: Eight articles met criteria for inclusion. The meta-synthesis across the      articles resulted in 8 themes categorized under 3 domains. Many of the articles      suggested a longitudinal process of caregiving with perceptions largely dependent      upon the time of interview in relation to the LVAD. The first domain of      caregiving is the "early" stage, covering the life before the LVAD through the      procedure. This phase is characterized by the pre-LVAD "emotional rollercoaster,"      the decision seen as "no option," and the thought of "leave it [the LVAD] at the       hospital." The second domain is the "middle" stage, covering the time frame after      discharge from the hospital. This phase is characterized by fragility of the      patient, recognition of a need to adapt, and a transformed life. The final domain      is "late LVAD" and describes how late in the LVAD process the LVAD indication      (bridge to transplant or destination therapy) brings in to focus what is      important to caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Existing literature indicates that the LVAD      caregiver experience is intense as well as burdensome and entails the need to      adapt to a new life. Given the burdens caregivers experience, clinicians and      future research should explore strategies to support these important individuals.FAU - Magid, MollyAU  - Magid MAD  - Molly Magid High School Student, Colorado Academy, Denver.
