Despite the availability of various pump sizes, information on the impact of pump      size on clinical outcome is still lacking. We aimed to evaluate whether pump size      in relation to body surface area (BSA) has an impact on clinical outcome.      METHODS: Children requiring implantation of a BH between 2000 and 2013 were      included in this retrospective study. Primary end-points were events leading to      BH explantation (transplantation, recovery or death) and the secondary end-point       was occurrence of thromboembolic events. Patients were categorized into three      groups according to BH stroke volume per BSA: optimal (30 to 50 ml/m(2)); small      (<30 ml/m(2)); and large (>50 ml/m(2)). RESULTS: Eighty children (median age 2.2       years, median BSA 0.50 m(2)) underwent BH implantation. Fifty-five (69%) children      had an optimally sized pump implanted, whereas 8 children (10%) had small pump      and 17 (21%) large pump implantation. Overall survival rate was 69%. Weaning was       possible in 15 children (19%), and 39 children (49%) were transplanted.      Mortality, myocardial recovery and transplantation were not related to age, BSA      or pump size. Thromboembolic events occurred significantly more frequently in      children treated with large pumps. CONCLUSIONS: The broad range of body sizes in       children from newborns to adolescents requires a wide choice of appropriately      sized devices. Large pump size in relation to BSA is an independent risk factor      for occurrence of thromboembolic events.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
