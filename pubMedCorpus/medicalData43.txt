We report our experience with MCS in      children eligible for HTx and its effect on waiting list mortality. METHODS:      Retrospective single-centre cohort study, National Paediatric HTx Programme      including all children eligible for HTx, since the introduction of MCS-VAD in      2006. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were eligible for HTx, median age 11.7      years [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 3.0-14.7]. In 18 patients, (42%) a VAD was      implanted, 11 (61%) survived to HTx (n = 9) or recovery (n = 2). Techniques and      devices used were left ventricular assist device (n = 16, 89%), in 4 cases      preceded by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and biventricular assist       device (n = 2, 11%), both preceded by ECMO. In the VAD group, median time to      death (n = 7) was 18 days (IQR 7-75), median time to HTx (n = 9) 66 days (IQR      33-223) and 2 patients recovered after 30 and 308 days. The main cause of death      on MCS was neurological injury in 4 patients (22%) and systemic thrombo-embolic      events in 2 (11%). The most common serious adverse events included confirmed      thrombus requiring pump replacement (in 11 patients, 61%) and pericardial      effusion leading to rethoracotomy (in 5 patients, 28%). Compared with the era      before MCS (1998-2006), waiting list mortality decreased from 44 to 21%, and is      now mainly related to complications of VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Since the      introduction of MCS-VAD, waiting list mortality halved and more children with      end-stage heart failure survived to heart transplantation, thus improving      outcome. Although there is substantial mortality and morbidity, overall mortality      decreases, making MCS-VAD an essential therapeutic tool. The need for donor      organs remains critically urgent.CI  - (c) The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the      European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
