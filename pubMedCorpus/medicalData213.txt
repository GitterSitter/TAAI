The objective of       this study was to test the hypothesis that mechanical dyssynchrony after CRT-D is      a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: A total of 266 consecutive      CRT-D patients with class III or IV heart failure, QRS duration >/=120 msec, and       ejection fractions </= 35% were prospectively studied. Dyssynchrony was assessed       before and 6 months after CRT-D using speckle-tracking radial strain      anteroseptal-to-posterior wall delay, predefined as >/=130 msec. Ventricular      arrhythmias were predefined as appropriate antitachycardia pacing or shock, and      the combined end point of ventricular arrhythmias, death, transplantation, or      left ventricular assist device implantation was followed over 2 years. RESULTS:      Of the initial 266 patients, 11 died, five underwent transplantation, three      received left ventricular assist devices before their 6-month echocardiographic      examinations, 19 (7%) had inadequate speckle-tracking at 6-month follow-up, and      27 (10%) were lost to follow-up. Accordingly, the study group consisted of 201      patients. Dyssynchrony after CRT-D was observed in 79 (39%) and was associated      with a significantly higher ventricular arrhythmic event rate: 21% (P < .001)      with persistent dyssynchrony and 35% (P < .001) with new dyssynchrony, compared      with 8% with no dyssynchrony after CRT-D. The combined end point of ventricular      arrhythmias, death, transplantation, or left ventricular assist device      implantation was significantly associated with dyssynchrony after CRT-D (hazard      ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-4.28; P = .001). Dyssynchrony after      CRT-D was associated with ventricular arrhythmias or death in patient subgroups      by cardiomyopathy type, QRS width, and morphology (P < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS:      Persistent or new radial dyssynchrony after CRT-D in severely symptomatic      patients with heart failure with widened QRS complexes and reduced ejection      fractions was associated with an increased rate of ventricular arrhythmias or      death and appears to be a marker for a less favorable prognosis.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014.
