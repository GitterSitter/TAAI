This is      particularly challenging for full-flow support. In this study, a minimally      invasive implantation technique was developed for a microaxial rotary pump. The      system was evaluated in a chronic sheep model. METHODS: A HeartWare MVAD      (HeartWare, Miami Lakes, FL) pump (length, 50 mm; diameter, 21 mm; maximum flow,       7-8 liters/min) was combined with a novel inflow cannula, including a new      flow-optimized tip. The device was implanted into sheep (range, 60-80 kg, mean,      71.6 +/- 6.8 kg) through a right-sided minithoracotomy. The inflow cannula was      inserted through the superior pulmonary vein, passing through the left atrium      into the left ventricle. Scheduled implant period was 30 days for 8 sheep and 100      days for 3 sheep. Mean support flow was set to half of the nominal cardiac      output. RESULTS: Six of 8 sheep finished the scheduled 30-day investigation      period (one failed due to early non-pump-related post-operative bleeding and one       due to prototype controller failure). The 3 sheep scheduled for 100 days reached       the study end point. Peak pump flows of up to 6.9 liters/min were achieved. At      necropsy, no signs of mitral valve lesions or thrombus formation around the      cannula, the tip, or the insertion site were observed, except for valve leaflet      erosion in 1 animal, where the cannula had been entangled in the sub-valvular      chords due to lack of ultrasound monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive       implantation technique using the HeartWare MVAD pump, together with a new      cannula, provided excellent results in a chronic animal model.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Schima, HeinrichAU  - Schima HAD  - Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering; Department of      Cardiothoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria;      Ludwig-Boltzmann-Cluster for Cardiovascular Research, Vienna, Austria.
