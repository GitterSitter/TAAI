They are used in      the clinical setting as destination therapy, as bridge to transplant, or more      recently as bridge to recovery to allow for myocardial remodeling. Recent      developments in computational simulation allow for detailed assessment of VAD      hemodynamics for device design and optimization for both children and adults.      Here, we provide a focused review of the recent literature on finite element      methods and optimization for VAD simulations. As VAD designs typically fall into       two categories, pulsatile and continuous flow devices, we separately address      computational challenges of both types of designs, and the interaction with the      circulatory system with three representative case studies. In particular, we      focus on recent advancements in finite element methodology that have increased      the fidelity of VAD simulations. We outline key challenges, which extend to the      incorporation of biological response such as thrombosis and hemolysis, as well as      shape optimization methods and challenges in computational methodology.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Marsden, Alison LAU  - Marsden ALAD  - Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California San       Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.FAU - Bazilevs, YuriAU  - Bazilevs YFAU - Long, Christopher CAU  - Long CCFAU - Behr, MarekAU  - Behr MLA  - engGR  - R21 HL102596/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PT  - ReviewDEP - 20140121PL  - United StatesTA  - Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol MedJT  - Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.
