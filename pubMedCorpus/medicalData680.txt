Significant recent device development has increased patient       support times, shifting further development focus toward physiologically      sensitive control of the pump operation. Sensorless control of these devices      would benefit from increased observability of the ventricular volume/preload to      the pump, in order to regulate flow based on preload, imitating the native      Frank-Starling flow control. Monitoring the transmitted flow pulse through the      pump has been used as a surrogate for preload, although means of maximizing its      transmission are not clear. However, it is known that a flat hydraulic      performance curve of the rotary pump induces high changes in flow for a given      change in pressure head. The aim of this study was to determine geometric pump      parameters responsible for increasing this flow pulse transmission and to      demonstrate this increase in vitro. The sensitivity of the performance gradient      to blade angles, blade heights, blade clearance, and channel areas were studied.       Resulting pressure head, flow, and hydraulic efficiency were analyzed with      respect to textbook designed procedures. Then pumps with comparably "flat" and      "steep" performance curves were used to simulate LVAD support in vitro over a      range of pump flow rates to observe the transmitted flow pulsatility. It was      found that an outlet blade angle of 90 degrees , inlet blade angle between 25 and      45 degrees , and large throat area generated a "flatter" performance curve. The      transmitted flow pulsatility through a pump with a flat performance curve was 68%      higher than that of a steep performance curve at a flow rate of 5 L/min.      Substantial gains in the observability of LVAD preload/resident blood volume in      the ventricle exist through the careful selection of specific pump geometries.CI  - (c) 2012, Copyright the Authors.
