We retrospectively sought predictors of long-term outcome in a cohort       of 83 patients who had undergone LVAD treatment. We subjected patients'      perioperative clinical data to statistical analysis to establish parameters      associated with all-cause mortality, and the cut-off values, sensitivity and      specificity of those that had a statistically significant relationship with      survival. Mean follow up was 717 days (standard deviation 334 days, range 17-1592      days). Fourteen patients (16.8%) died, but nine (10.8%) were weaned from support.      Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration measured 60 days after      implantation was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The optimal      BNP cut-off value to predict death during LVAD support was 322 pg/ml, with a      sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 79.8%. Two-year survival was 92.0% in      those with 60-day serum BNP concentration <322 pg/ml compared with 70.5% in those      in whom it was >==322 pg/ml (p = 0.003). The relationship between BNP and      survival likely reflects recovery of native myocardial function and improvements       in global health, and should assist clinicians in the on-going management of      long-term LVAD therapy.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms      of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 License,      where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly      cited.
