The composite Model for End-Stage Liver Disease      excluding INR (MELD-XI) is a robust scoring system of liver function, and a high       score is associated with poor prognosis in advanced HF patients with a heart      transplantation and/or ventricular assist device. However, the impact of MELD-XI       on the prognosis of HF patients in general remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS:       We retrospectively analyzed 562 patients who were admitted to our hospital for      the treatment of decompensated HF. A MELD-XI score was graded, and patients were       divided into two groups based on the median value of MELD-XI score: Group L      (MELD-XI <10, n = 289) and Group H (MELD-XI >/=10, n = 273). We compared      all-cause mortality and echocardiographic findings between the two groups. In the      follow-up period (mean 471 days), 104 deaths (62 cardiac deaths and 42      non-cardiac deaths) were observed. The event (cardiac death, non-cardiac death,      all-cause death)-free rate was significantly higher in group L than in group H      (logrank P<0.05, respectively). In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, a high      MELD-XI score was found to be an independent predictor of cardiac deaths and      all-cause mortality in HF patients. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, right      atrial and ventricular areas, inferior vena cava diameter, and systolic pulmonary      artery pressure were higher in group H than in group L (P<0.05, respectively).      CONCLUSIONS: The MELD-XI scoring system, a marker of liver function, can identify      high-risk patients with right heart volume overload, higher pulmonary arterial      pressure and multiple organ failure associated with HF.FAU - Abe, SatoshiAU  - Abe SAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Yoshihisa, AkiomiAU  - Yoshihisa AAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan; Department of Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics, Fukushima Medical University,      Fukushima, Japan.FAU - Takiguchi, MaiAU  - Takiguchi MAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Shimizu, TakeshiAU  - Shimizu TAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Nakamura, YuichiAU  - Nakamura YAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Yamauchi, HiroyukiAU  - Yamauchi HAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Iwaya, ShojiAU  - Iwaya SAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Owada, TakashiAU  - Owada TAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Miyata, MakikoAU  - Miyata MAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Sato, TakamasaAU  - Sato TAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Suzuki, SatoshiAU  - Suzuki SAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan; Department of Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics, Fukushima Medical University,      Fukushima, Japan.FAU - Oikawa, MasayoshiAU  - Oikawa MAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Kobayashi, AtsushiAU  - Kobayashi AAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Yamaki, TakayoshiAU  - Yamaki TAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Sugimoto, KoichiAU  - Sugimoto KAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Kunii, HiroyukiAU  - Kunii HAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Nakazato, KazuhikoAU  - Nakazato KAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Suzuki, HitoshiAU  - Suzuki HAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Saitoh, Shu-ichiAU  - Saitoh SAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan.FAU - Takeishi, YasuchikaAU  - Takeishi YAD  - Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,      Japan; Department of Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics, Fukushima Medical University,      Fukushima, Japan.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140623PL  - United StatesTA  - PLoS OneJT  - PloS oneJID - 101285081SB  - IMPMC - PMC4067358OID - NLM: PMC4067358EDAT- 2014/06/24 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/24 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/24 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/02/14 [received]PHST- 2014/05/27 [accepted]PHST- 2014/06/23 [epublish]AID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0100618 [doi]AID - PONE-D-14-06078 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - PLoS One. 2014 Jun 23;9(6):e100618. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100618.      eCollection 2014.
