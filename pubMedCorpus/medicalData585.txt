The injury to the heart-wall muscle after MI       is permanent, as after an abundant cell loss the myocardial tissue lacks the      intrinsic capability to regenerate. New therapeutics are required for functional       improvement and regeneration of the infarcted myocardium, to overcome harmful      diagnosis of patients with heart failure, and to overcome the shortage of heart      donors. In the past few years, myocardial tissue engineering has emerged as a new      and ambitious approach for treating MI. Several left ventricular assist devices      and epicardial patches have been developed for MI. These devices and      acellular/cellular cardiac patches are employed surgically and sutured to the      epicardial surface of the heart, limiting the region of therapeutic benefit. An      injectable system offers the potential benefit of minimally invasive release into      the myocardium either to restore the injured extracellular matrix or to act as a       scaffold for cell delivery. Furthermore, intramyocardial injection of      biomaterials and cells has opened new opportunities to explore and also to      augment the potentials of this technique to ease morbidity and mortality rates      owing to heart failure. This review summarizes the growing body of literature in       the field of myocardial tissue engineering, where biomaterial injection, with or       without simultaneous cellular delivery, has been pursued to enhance functional      and structural outcomes following MI. Additionally, this review also provides a      complete outlook on the tissue-engineering therapies presently being used for      myocardial regeneration, as well as some perceptivity into the possible issues      that may hinder its progress in the future.FAU - Ravichandran, RajeswariAU  - Ravichandran RAD  - Healthcare and Energy Materials Laboratory, National University of Singapore,      Singapore.FAU - Venugopal, Jayarama ReddyAU  - Venugopal JRFAU - Sundarrajan, SubramanianAU  - Sundarrajan SFAU - Mukherjee, ShayantiAU  - Mukherjee SFAU - Ramakrishna, SeeramAU  - Ramakrishna SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20121213PL  - New ZealandTA  - Int J NanomedicineJT  - International journal of nanomedicineJID - 101263847SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cells, CulturedMH  - Guided Tissue Regeneration/*instrumentation/methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Injections, IntralesionalMH  - Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/*methodsMH  - Myocardial Ischemia/*surgeryMH  - Myocytes, Cardiac/*transplantationMH  - Pericardium/*surgeryMH  - Tissue Engineering/instrumentation/methodsMH  - *Tissue ScaffoldsPMC - PMC3526148OID - NLM: PMC3526148OTO - NOTNLMOT  - biomaterialsOT  - cardiac-tissue engineeringOT  - injectable systemOT  - myocardial infarctionEDAT- 2012/12/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/09 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/29 06:00PHST- 2012/12/13 [epublish]AID - 10.2147/IJN.S37575 [doi]AID - ijn-7-5969 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Nanomedicine. 2012;7:5969-94. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S37575.
