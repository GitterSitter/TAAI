We present data comparing results after      implantation of HeartMate II (HM II) versus HVAD (HW) left ventricular assist      devices (LVADs) for the past 7 years at our institution. METHODS: From July 2006       to August 2012, 121 consecutive patients underwent LVAD implantation: 70 (57.9%)       received HM II and 51 (42.1%) HW. Patient demographics, perioperative      characteristics, and laboratory parameters as well as postoperative outcome were       compared retrospectively. RESULTS: Patients in the HM II group were significantly      younger (P < .01), with more deranged liver function (higher bilirubin [P = .02]       and alanine aminotransferase [P = .01] levels), and had a significantly higher      rate of preoperative infections requiring antibiotic treatment (P = .02) and a      higher body core temperature (P < .01). Other demographic and preoperative      parameters did not show statistical differences. Most postoperative      characteristics were also similar between the two groups. HM II patients had a      significantly higher transfusion rate, but there were no differences in incidence      of resternotomy (P = .156). Recovery and VAD explantation were more likely in the      HM II group (P = .02). Although there was no significant difference in survival      (log rank test: P = .986; Breslow test: P = .827), HM II patients were more      likely to develop a percutaneous site infection (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both HM      II and HW provide similar early postoperative outcome and good long-term      survival. The differences observed between the groups may be related to      demographic and preoperative factors rather than the type of the device used.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
