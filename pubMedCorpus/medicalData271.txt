Novel cardiac support      strategies such as pharmacologic agents, mechanical circulatory support (MCS),      and cell- or matrix-based therapies are promising for these patients. The      indications, types, and timing of MCS implantation depend to a large extent on      the presentation, clinical status of the patient, underlying etiology, and      long-term prospects. The presence or absence of end-organ damage has a      significant impact on prognosis following MCS initiation. Although many patients       with acute AHF may have end-organ damage, their prospect of recovery, once      appropriate therapy is instituted, is better than for patients who had AHF for      longer periods of time. We consider the multidisciplinary approaches used for the      management of AHF and the novel cardiac support strategies (eg, MCS). Appropriate      selection of patient, device, time, and end point is essential for better      outcomes.CI  - (c) The Author(s) 2014.FAU - El-Menyar, AymanAU  - El-Menyar AAD  - Clinical Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Doha, Qatar Clinical Research,       Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar Cardiology Unit, Internal Medicine, Ahmed      Maher Teaching Hospital, Cairo, Egypt aymanco65@yahoo.com.FAU - Carr, CorneliaAU  - Carr CAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.FAU - AlKhulaifi, AbdulazizAU  - AlKhulaifi AAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20140224PL  - United StatesTA  - AngiologyJT  - AngiologyJID - 0203706SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy/standardsMH  - *Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices/standardsMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/standardsMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Regenerative MedicineMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - advanced heart failureOT  - mechanical supportOT  - multidisciplinaryEDAT- 2014/02/27 06:00MHDA- 2015/03/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/02/27 06:00PHST- 2014/02/24 [aheadofprint]AID - 0003319714521494 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0003319714521494 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Angiology. 2015 Feb;66(2):104-13. doi: 10.1177/0003319714521494.
