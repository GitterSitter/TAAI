METHODS: Between April 2004 and September 2013,       192 patients underwent HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) CF-LVAD placement       as a bridge to transplant at our center. Of these, 122 (63%) successfully bridged      patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups      according to their waiting time with CF-LVAD support of <1 year or >/=1 year.      RESULTS: The study cohort was a mean age of 54 +/- 13 years, 79% were male, and      35% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of CF-LVAD support before      transplantation was 296 days (range, 27-1,413 days). The overall 30-day mortality      was 4.1%. Overall post-transplant survival was 88%, 84%, 78% at 1, 3, and 5      years, respectively. The 32 patients (26%) with >/=1 year of CF-LVAD support      (mean, 635 days) were more likely to have blood type O, a larger body size, and      to have been readmitted due to recurrent heart failure and device failure      requiring exchange than those with <1 year of CF-LVAD support. Patients who      required prolonged support time also had worse in-hospital mortality (16% vs      6.7%, p = 0.12) and significantly lower survival at 3 years after transplantation      (68% vs 88%, p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: The overall short-term and long-term      cardiac transplant outcomes of patients supported with CF-LVAD are satisfactory.       However, patients who require prolonged CF-LVAD support may have diminished      post-transplant survival due to adverse events occurring during device support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015.
