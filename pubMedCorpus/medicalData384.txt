However, outcomes depending on the preoperative       level of stability can substantially differ, resulting in a limited analysis of      potentialities and drawbacks of a given device. In the present study we sought to      compare in our single-center experience the survival results of this      third-generation device with previous left ventricular systems taking into      account the different preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) levels. Between February 1993 and March 2012, 287      patients underwent assist device implantation in our university hospital      (INTERMACS Level 1-2 = 158 patients; INTERMACS Level 3-4-5 = 129 patients).      Assist devices implanted were: Group A (HVAD HeartWare, n = 52), group B      (previous continuous-flow ventricular assist device [VAD], InCor [Berlin Heart,      Berlin, Germany], n = 37; VentrAssist [VentraCor, Inc., Chatswood, NSW,      Australia], n = 7; DeBakey [MicroMed Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA], n =      32), and group C (pulsatile systems, n = 159). After cumulative support duration       of 54 436 days and a mean follow-up of 6.21 +/- 7.46 months (range 0-45.21      months), log-rank analysis revealed a survival for group A of 82.0%, 70.4%, and      70.4%; for group B of 84.0%, 48.2%, 33.7%; and for group C of 71.6%, 46.1%,      33.8%, at 1, 12, and 24 months respectively, with a significantly (P = 0.013)      better outcome for group A. When stratifying the survival on the basis of      INTERMACS level, no significant survival improvement was observed among all      patients who underwent VAD implantation in INTERMACS 1-2 (P = 0.47). However,      among patients who underwent elective VAD implantation (INTERMACS 3-4-5), group A      had a significantly better outcome (P = 0.005) compared with the other      INTERMACS-matched groups (B,C) with a survival rate of 88.8% in group A versus      34.2% in group B and 45.6% in group C at 24 months, respectively. Elective HVAD      system implantation shows improved survival benefit over the other      INTERMACS-matched devices. Moreover, preoperative unstable hemodynamics resulted       in a poor prognosis independently from the pump generation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Dell'Aquila, Angelo MAU  - Dell'Aquila AMAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.FAU - Schneider, Stefan R BAU  - Schneider SRFAU - Stypmann, JorgAU  - Stypmann JFAU - Ellger, BjornAU  - Ellger BFAU - Redwan, BassamAU  - Redwan BFAU - Schlarb, DominikAU  - Schlarb DFAU - Martens, SvenAU  - Martens SFAU - Sindermann, Jurgen RAU  - Sindermann JRLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131011PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Diseases/*surgery/therapyMH  - Heart Ventricles/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - RegistriesMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart failureOT  - Heart transplantationOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/15 06:00PHST- 2013/10/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12188 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2014 May;38(5):383-90. doi: 10.1111/aor.12188.
