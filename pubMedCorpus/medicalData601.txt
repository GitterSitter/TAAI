This regulatory process requires a judicious balance between      assuring safety and efficacy, while providing efficient review to facilitate      access to innovative therapies. Recent contrasting views of the regulatory      process have emphasized the difficulties in obtaining an optimal balance.      Mechanical circulatory support has evolved to become an important therapy for      patients who have advanced heart failure with the advent of more durable,      implantable ventricular assist devices. The regulatory oversight of these new      technologies has been difficult owing to the complexities of these devices,      associated adverse event profile, and severity of illness of the intended patient      population. Maintaining a regulatory environment to foster efficient introduction      of safe and effective technologies is critical to the success of ventricular      assist device therapy and the health of patients with advanced heart failure.      Physicians representing key surgical and cardiology societies, and      representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, National Heart Lung, and      Blood Institute, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Inter-agency      Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, and industry partners      gathered to discuss relevant issues regarding the current regulatory environment       assessing ventricular assist devices. The goal of the meeting was to explore      innovative ways to foster the introduction of technologically advanced, safe, and      effective ventricular assist devices. The following summary reflects opinions and      conclusions endorsed by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association      for Thoracic Surgery, American Heart Association, Heart Failure Society of      America, International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and      Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012.
