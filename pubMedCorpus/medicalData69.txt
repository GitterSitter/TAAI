Cellular      proteases, such as cathepsins, are involved in the progression of HF. The aim of       this study was to evaluate the role of cathepsin system in HF patients supported       by LVAD, in order to determine their involvement in cardiac remodeling. METHODS:       The expression of cysteine (CatB, CatK, CatL, CatS) and serine cathepsin (CatG),       and relative inhibitors (Cystatin B, C and SerpinA3, respectively) was determined      in cardiac biopsies of 22 patients submitted to LVAD (pre-LVAD) and compared      with: 1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at the moment of      heart transplantation without prior LVAD (HT, n = 7); 2) patients supported by      LVAD at the moment of transplantation (post-LVAD, n = 6). RESULTS: The expression      of cathepsins and their inhibitors was significantly higher in pre-LVAD compared       to the HT group and LVAD induced a further increase in the cathepsin system.      Significant positive correlations were observed between cardiac expression of      cathepsins and their inhibitors as well as inflammatory cytokines. In the      pre-LVAD group, a relationship of cathepsins with dilatative etiology and length       of hospitalization was found. CONCLUSIONS: A parallel activation of cathepsins      and their inhibitors was observed after LVAD support. The possible clinical      importance of these modifications is confirmed by their relation with patients'      outcome. A better discovery of these pathways could add more insights into the      cardiac remodeling during HF.FAU - D'Amico, AndreaAU  - D'Amico AAD  - Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Institute of Life Sciences, 56100, Pisa, Italy.      andrea.damico@ifc.cnr.it.FAU - Ragusa, RosettaAU  - Ragusa RAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca - Via Moruzzi, 1,      56100, Pisa, Italy. rosetta.ragusa@gmail.com.FAU - Caruso, RaffaeleAU  - Caruso RAD  - Cardiovascular Department, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale       delle Ricerche (CNR), Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162, Milan, Italy.      raffaele.caruso@ospedaleniguarda.it.FAU - Prescimone, TommasoAU  - Prescimone TAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca - Via Moruzzi, 1,      56100, Pisa, Italy. tommaso.prescimone@ifc.cnr.it.FAU - Nonini, SandraAU  - Nonini SAD  - Cardiovascular Department, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, 20162, Milan, Italy.      sandra.nonini@ospedaleniguarda.it.FAU - Cabiati, ManuelaAU  - Cabiati MAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca - Via Moruzzi, 1,      56100, Pisa, Italy. manuela.cabiati@ifc.cnr.it.FAU - Del Ry, SilviaAU  - Del Ry SAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca - Via Moruzzi, 1,      56100, Pisa, Italy. delry@ifc.cnr.it.FAU - Trivella, Maria GiovannaAU  - Trivella MGAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca - Via Moruzzi, 1,      56100, Pisa, Italy. trivella@ifc.cnr.it.FAU - Giannessi, DanielaAU  - Giannessi DAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca - Via Moruzzi, 1,      56100, Pisa, Italy. danielag@ifc.cnr.it.FAU - Caselli, ChiaraAU  - Caselli CAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca - Via Moruzzi, 1,      56100, Pisa, Italy. chiara.caselli@ifc.cnr.it.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20141212PL  - EnglandTA  - J Transl MedJT  - Journal of translational medicineJID - 101190741SB  - IMPMC - PMC4274696OID - NLM: PMC4274696EDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/16 06:00PHST- 2014/09/11 [received]PHST- 2014/12/02 [accepted]PHST- 2014/12/12 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1186/s12967-014-0350-7 [doi]AID - s12967-014-0350-7 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - J Transl Med. 2014 Dec 12;12(1):350. doi: 10.1186/s12967-014-0350-7.
