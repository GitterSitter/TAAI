METHODS: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum free hemoglobin (sfHg) values were      tallied monthly in 182 patients on HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD      support. Peak values for each marker were identified, and 2 hemolysis definitions      were applied to the cohort: Hemolysis according to Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) criteria (sfHg > 40 mg/dl      with signs/symptoms) and/or hemolysis defined by an LDH >/= 600 IU/liter      (2.5-times the upper limit of laboratory normal). Kaplan-Meier survival free from      death, urgent United Network of Organ Sharing 1A transplant for thrombosis,      device exchange for thrombosis, and stroke/peripheral embolism was estimated, and      Cox hazard ratios (HR) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated.      Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for predicting      1-year event-free survival were calculated. RESULTS: Hemolysis occurred in 32      patients (18%) by INTERMACS criteria and in 68 (37%) patients by LDH criteria.      Over a median (25(th), 75(th)) support of 427 days (245, 793 days), there were 78      events. One year event-free survival after the onset of INTERMACS-defined      hemolysis was 16% +/- 8.3% compared with 85% +/- 3.2% in non-hemolyzers (HR,      14.7; 95% CI, 7.9-27; AUC 0.70 +/- 0.05; p < 0.001; ). One year event-free      survival after the onset of LDH-defined hemolysis was 32% +/- 7.2% compared with       89% +/- 3.2% in those with persistent LDH values < 600 IU/liter (HR, 8.0; 95% CI,      4.4-14; AUC 0.87 +/- 0.04; p < 0.001). Patients who met the LDH hemolysis      definition had longer times from hemolysis onset to clinical events and larger      magnitudes of risk for embolism and device exchange for thrombosis than those      with INTERMACS hemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Serum hemolysis marker elevations are      associated with increased events in LVAD patients. LDH monitoring provides an      earlier diagnosis of adverse events than sfHg, supporting need for a new      INTERMACS definition of VAD-associated hemolysis.CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Cowger, Jennifer AAU  - Cowger JAAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann      Arbor, Michigan.
