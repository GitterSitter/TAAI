BACKGROUND: EF is a potent predictor of      HF outcomes, but represents a complex summary measure that integrates several      components including left ventricular size, contractile function, and VA      coupling. The relative importance of each of these parameters in determining      prognosis is unknown. METHODS: In 466 participants with chronic systolic HF, we      derived quantitative echocardiographic measures of EF: cardiac size      (end-diastolic volume [EDV]); contractile function (the end-systolic pressure      volume relationship slope [Eessb] and intercept [V0]); and VA coupling (arterial       elastance [Ea]/Eessb). We determined the association between these parameters and      the following adverse outcomes: 1) the combined endpoint of death, cardiac      transplantation, or ventricular assist device (VAD) placement; and 2) cardiac      hospitalization. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, there were 76      deaths, 52 transplantations, 14 VAD placements, and 684 cardiac hospitalizations.      EF was independently associated with death, transplantation, and VAD placement      (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 5.0      comparing third and first tertiles), as were EDV (HR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5 to 4.2);      V0 (HR: 3.6; 95% CI: 2.1 to 6.1); and Ea/Eessb (HR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.3).      EDV, V0, and Ea/Eessb were also associated with risk of cardiac hospitalization.       Eessb was not significantly associated with any adverse outcomes in adjusted      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular size, V0, and VA coupling are associated       with prognosis in systolic HF, but end-systolic elastance (Eessb) is not.      Assessment of VA coupling via Ea/Eessb is an additional noninvasively derived      metric that can be used to gauge prognosis in human HF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
