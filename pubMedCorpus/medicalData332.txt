Ventricular assist devices provide mechanical support for a failing      heart either as a bridge to transplant or now as a long-term support if      transplant is not available, so-called destination therapy. These devices can add      significant technical challenges to abdominal surgery, in that the power supply      and drivelines crossing the abdomen can potentially be damaged. The use of      preoperative or intraoperative imaging may aid in locating these devices and      increase patient safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a laparoscopic      cholecystectomy in two patients supported with HeartMate((R)) II (Thoratec Corp.,      Pleasanton, CA) left ventricular assist devices. Our use of fluoroscopic guidance      in port placement is also described. A literature review was performed to assess       the frequency of laparoscopic procedures performed on patients with similar      ventricular assist devices and of complications associated with the device and      other comorbidities. RESULTS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed without       significant intraoperative hemodynamic changes. The use of imaging, such as      fluoroscopy, can identify the location of the ventricular assist device and its      associated drive wires to assure they are not damaged intraoperatively.      CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely on patients      with ventricular assist devices. Complications due to damage to the device can be      avoided with the assistance of fluoroscopy to identify the implanted abdominal      portions of the ventricular assist device. Each laparoscopic procedure performed       on these patients presents the surgeon with unique obstacles in which careful      operative planning and intraoperative monitoring are essential.FAU - Eck, Dustin LAU  - Eck DLAD  - Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic , Jacksonville, Florida.FAU - Belli, Erol VAU  - Belli EVFAU - Smith, C DanielAU  - Smith CDFAU - Stauffer, John AAU  - Stauffer JALA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20131224PL  - United StatesTA  - J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech AJT  - Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.
