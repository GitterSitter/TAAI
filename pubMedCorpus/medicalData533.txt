BACKGROUND: The      magnitude, timeline, and sustainability of changes induced by continuous-flow      LVAD on the structure and function of the failing human heart are unknown.      METHODS: Eighty consecutive patients with clinical characteristics consistent      with chronic heart failure requiring implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD were       prospectively enrolled. Serial echocardiograms (at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12      months) and right heart catheterizations were performed after LVAD implant.      Cardiac recovery was assessed on the basis of improvement in systolic and      diastolic function indices on echocardiography that were sustained during LVAD      turn-down studies. RESULTS: After 6 months of LVAD unloading, 34% of patients had      a relative LV ejection fraction increase above 50% and 19% of patients, both      ischemic and nonischemic, achieved an LV ejection fraction >/= 40%. LV systolic      function improved as early as 30 days, the greatest degree of improvement was      achieved by 6 months of mechanical unloading and persisted over the 1-year follow      up. LV diastolic function parameters also improved as early as 30 days after LVAD      unloading, and this improvement persisted over time. LV end-diastolic and      end-systolic volumes decreased as early as 30 days after LVAD unloading (113 vs.       77 ml/m(2), p < 0.01, and 92 vs. 60 ml/m(2), p < 0.01, respectively). LV mass      decreased as early as 30 days after LVAD unloading (114 vs. 95 g/m(2), p < 0.05)       and continued to do so over the 1-year follow-up but did not reach values below      the normal reference range, suggesting no atrophic remodeling after prolonged      LVAD unloading. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous-flow LVAD unloading induced in a subset      of patients, both ischemic and nonischemic, early improvement in myocardial      structure and systolic and diastolic function that was largely completed within 6      months, with no evidence of subsequent regression.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
