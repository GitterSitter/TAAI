Women with HF have unique characteristics compared       with men, and it is unknown whether common prognostic factors are equally useful       in both populations. We aimed to investigate whether sex-specific risk models are      more accurate for risk prediction in patients with advanced HF. METHODS AND      RESULTS: Patients with advanced HF referred to University of California, Los      Angeles (UCLA; n=2255), were stratified by sex into derivation (referred in      2000-2007) and validation (referred in 2008-2011) cohorts. Cox regression      analysis was used to ascertain key variables predictive of the primary end point       of death/urgent transplantation/ventricular assist device in the derivation      cohorts and confirmed in the validation cohorts in men, women, and the total      population. Women were younger, with higher ejection fraction and better      event-free survival. Despite differences in baseline characteristics, the 4      strongest predictors of outcome in both women and men, as well as in the total      cohort, were B-type natriuretic peptide, peak oxygen consumption by      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (pkVO2), New York Heart Association (NYHA)      classification, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin      receptor blocker. In addition, the UCLA model performed better than the Seattle      Heart Failure Model (SHFM) and the Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) in our      cohort (c-indices of 0.791[UCLA] versus 0.758 [SHFM], 0.607 [noninvasive HFSS],      and 0.625 [invasive HFSS]). CONCLUSIONS: A simple risk model assessing 4 clinical      variables-B-type natriuretic peptide, pkVO2, NYHA, and angiotensin-converting      enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use-is well suited to provide      prognostic information in both men and women with advanced HF.FAU - Chyu, JenniferAU  - Chyu JAD  - Division of Cardiology, University of Washington, Seattle.FAU - Fonarow, Gregg CAU  - Fonarow GCFAU - Tseng, Chi HongAU  - Tseng CHFAU - Horwich, Tamara BAU  - Horwich TBLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20131126PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
