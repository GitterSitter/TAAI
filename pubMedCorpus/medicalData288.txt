As more children are placed on       mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to transplant, the risk factors       for development of sensitization warrant further study. A single-center      retrospective review of 36 children who received MCS identified 22 patients      supported with either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (n = 15) or      ECMO-ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 7) with paired (pre-MCS/post-MCS) panel      reactive antibodies (PRA) or only negative post-MCS PRAs. Four patients (18%)      became sensitized post-MCS (one ECMO-only patient, three ECMO-VAD patients). No      difference was found between sensitized and nonsensitized patients in terms of      congenital heart disease versus primary cardiomyopathy (p = 0.096), duration of      MCS (38 days vs. 14 days, p = 0.233), or volume of blood product transfusions      (358.6 ml/kg vs. 612.7 ml/kg, p = not significant). By multivariable analysis,      the association of sensitization with older age at MCS (p = 0.076) and history of      homograft (p = 0.064) approached significance. Pediatric patients supported with       MCS are at low risk of developing HLA sensitization. Diagnosis, MCS duration, and      volume of transfused blood products do not appear to be associated with HLA      sensitization, but there is a suggestion of an association with older age at MCS       and history of a homograft.FAU - Hong, Borah JAU  - Hong BJAD  - From the *Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor      College of Medicine, Houston, Texas; daggerPuget Sound Blood Center, Seattle,      Washington; double daggerUniversity of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle,      Washington; section signDivision of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Seattle      Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; and paragraph      signDivision of Pediatric Cardiology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of       Washington, Seattle, Washington.FAU - Delaney, MeghanAU  - Delaney MFAU - Guynes, AnthonyAU  - Guynes AFAU - Warner, PaulAU  - Warner PFAU - McMullan, David MAU  - McMullan DMFAU - Kemna, Mariska SAU  - Kemna MSFAU - Boucek, Robert JAU  - Boucek RJFAU - Law, Yuk MAU  - Law YMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Antibodies)RN  - 0 (HLA Antigens)SB  - IMMH  - Antibodies/chemistryMH  - Blood TransfusionMH  - Cardiomyopathies/therapyMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - HLA Antigens/*chemistryMH  - Heart Defects, Congenital/therapyMH  - Heart Failure/congenital/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - MaleMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk FactorsEDAT- 2014/01/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/29 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000053 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 May-Jun;60(3):317-21. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000053.
