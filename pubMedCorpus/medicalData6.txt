So long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been proposed as an       alternative treatment option to assist patients scheduled on HTx waiting list      bridging them for a variable time period to cardiac transplantation-the so-called      bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) strategy. Nowadays approximately 90% of patients       being considered for MCS receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). In      fact, LVAD experienced several improvements in the last decade and the      predominance of continuous-flow over pulsatile-flow technology has been evident      since 2008. The aim of the present report is to give an overview of      continuous-flow LVAD utilization in the specific setting of the BTT strategy      taking into consideration the most representative articles of the scientific      literature and focusing the attention on the evolution, clinical outcomes,      relevant implications on the HTx strategy and future perspectives of the      continuous-flow LVAD technology.FAU - Pozzi, MatteoAU  - Pozzi MAD  - 1 Department of Cardiac Surgery, "Louis Pradel" Cardiologic Hospital, Hospices      Civils de Lyon, "Claude Bernard" University, Lyon, France ;
