Although availability of heart      donor for transplantation has declined over the past several years, innovations      in ventricular assist device (VAD) technology has provided an alternative      therapeutic option for patients with advanced heart failure. Initiated as a      mechanical option to "bridge" critically ill patients awaiting transplantation,      VADs are being increasingly deployed as "destination" devices to provide      long-term support. With technical advances resulting in improved mechanical      reliability, reduced postoperative morbidity and greater likelihood of patient      acceptance, there is interest in expanding the applicability of VAD beyond the      current indication, as destination therapy for severely ill patients who are not       candidates for transplant. This review examines the rational as well as the      technical details of the different generation of VADs for mechanical cardiac      support, implanted either surgical or percutaneously. These devices are at      various stages of development and clinical investigation. One or more of these      newer devices is likely to emerge as an important development in the treatment of      patients with advanced heart failure.FAU - Tarantini, GAU  - Tarantini GAD  - Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, Cardiology Clinic,      University of Padua, Padua, Italy - giuseppe.tarantini.1@unipd.it.FAU - Fraccaro, CAU  - Fraccaro CFAU - Napodano, MAU  - Napodano MFAU - Buja, PAU  - Buja PFAU - Tarzia, VAU  - Tarzia VFAU - Isabella, GAU  - Isabella GFAU - Gerosa, GAU  - Gerosa GFAU - Iliceto, SAU  - Iliceto SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ItalyTA  - Minerva CardioangiolJT  - Minerva cardioangiologicaJID - 0400725SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2013/11/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/12 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/21 06:00AID - R05Y2013N06A0691 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Minerva Cardioangiol. 2013 Dec;61(6):691-700.
