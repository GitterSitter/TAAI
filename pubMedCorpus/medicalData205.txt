Long-term reliability of VADs will become increasingly vital as      the population of destination therapy patients expands. In this study, eight HVAD      pumps (n = 8) completed a 6-year reliability test in the HeartWare Life Cycle      Testing System, an in-vitro mock circulatory loop that simulated physiologic      pressures and flows. Cumulative runtime for the pumps was 2,408 +/- 60 days.      During this time, no device failures of any type occurred. These results strongly      support the durability of the pump design.FAU - Reyes, CarlosAU  - Reyes CAD  - From the HeartWare, Inc., Pearland, Texas.FAU - Chorpenning, KatherineAU  - Chorpenning KFAU - LaRose, Jeffrey AAU  - LaRose JAFAU - Gomez, RamiroAU  - Gomez RFAU - Tamez, DanielAU  - Tamez DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/05/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/13 06:00CRDT- 2014/05/13 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000100 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Sep-Oct;60(5):541-4. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000100.
