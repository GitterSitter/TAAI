These can be classified into heart diseases affecting the liver, liver      diseases affecting the heart, and conditions affecting the heart and the liver at      the same time. In chronic and acute cardiac hepatopathy, owing to cardiac      failure, a combination of reduced arterial perfusion and passive congestion leads      to cardiac cirrhosis and cardiogenic hypoxic hepatitis. These conditions may      impair the liver function and treatment should be directed towards the primary      heart disease and seek to secure perfusion of vital organs. In patients with      advanced cirrhosis, physical and/or pharmacological stress may reveal a reduced      cardiac performance with systolic and diastolic dysfunction and electrophysical      abnormalities termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Electrophysiological abnormalities      include prolonged QT interval, chronotropic incompetance, and electromechanical      uncoupling. No specific therapy can be recommended, but it should be supportive      and directed against the heart failure. Numerous conditions affect both the heart      and the liver such as infections, inflammatory and systemic diseases, and chronic      alcoholism. The risk and prevalence of coronary artery disease are increasing in       cirrhotic patients and since the perioperative mortality is high, a careful      cardiac evaluation of such patients is required prior to orthotopic liver      transplantation.FAU - Moller, SorenAU  - Moller SAD  - Centre of Functional and Diagnostic Imaging and Research, Department of Clinical       Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Hvidovre Hospital, The Faculty of Health      Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.FAU - Bernardi, MauroAU  - Bernardi MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20130712PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - Heart Diseases/*complications/physiopathologyMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hemochromatosis/complicationsMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Infection/complicationsMH  - Inflammation/complicationsMH  - Liver Diseases/*complications/physiopathologyMH  - Liver TransplantationOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Alcoholic heart muscle diseaseOT  - Cardiac hepatopathyOT  - CirrhosisOT  - Cirrhotic cardiomyopathyOT  - Congestive hepatopathyOT  - Hepatopulmonary syndromeOT  - Hyperdynamic circulationOT  - Liver transplantationOT  - Portal hypertensionOT  - Portopulmonary hypertensionEDAT- 2013/07/16 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/17 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/16 06:00PHST- 2013/07/12 [aheadofprint]AID - eht246 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht246 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Heart J. 2013 Sep;34(36):2804-11. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/eht246.
