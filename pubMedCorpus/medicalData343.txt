The FDA has recently approved the designations of the Thoratec HeartMate      II ventricular assist device (VAD) for both bridge-to-transplant and destination       therapy (DT) due to its mechanical durability and improved hemodynamics. However,      incidence of pump thrombosis and thromboembolic events remains high, and the      life-long complex pharmacological regimens are mandatory in its VAD recipients.      We have previously successfully applied our device thrombogenicity emulation      (DTE) methodology for optimizing device thromboresistance to the Micromed Debakey      VAD, and demonstrated that optimizing device features implicated in exposing      blood to elevated shear stresses and exposure times significantly reduces      shear-induced platelet activation and significantly improves the device      thromboresistance. In the present study, we compared the thrombogenicity of the      FDA-approved HeartMate II VAD with the DTE-optimized Debakey VAD (now labeled      HeartAssist 5). With quantitative probability density functions of the stress      accumulation along large number of platelet trajectories within each device which      were extracted from numerical flow simulations in each device, and through      measurements of platelet activation rates in recirculation flow loops, we      specifically show that: (a) Platelets flowing through the HeartAssist 5 are      exposed to significantly lower stress accumulation that lead to platelet      activation than the HeartMate II, especially at the impeller-shroud gap regions      (b) Thrombus formation patterns observed in the HeartMate II are absent in the      HeartAssist 5 (c) Platelet activation rates (PAR) measured in vitro with the VADs      mounted in recirculation flow-loops show a 2.5-fold significantly higher PAR      value for the HeartMate II. This head to head thrombogenic performance      comparative study of the two VADs, one optimized with the DTE methodology and one      FDA-approved, demonstrates the efficacy of the DTE methodology for drastically      reducing the device thrombogenic potential, validating the need for a robust in      silico/in vitro optimization methodology for improving cardiovascular devices      thromboresistance.FAU - Chiu, Wei-CheAU  - Chiu WCFAU - Girdhar, GauravAU  - Girdhar GFAU - Xenos, MichalisAU  - Xenos MFAU - Alemu, YaredAU  - Alemu YFAU - Soares, Joao SAU  - Soares JSFAU - Einav, ShmuelAU  - Einav SFAU - Slepian, MarvinAU  - Slepian MFAU - Bluestein, DannyAU  - Bluestein DLA  - engGR  - 1U01EB012487-0/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - EB008004-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - U01 EB012487/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - J Biomech EngJT  - Journal of biomechanical engineeringJID - 7909584SB  - IMMH  - Blood Flow VelocityMH  - Blood PressureMH  - Computer SimulationMH  - Equipment Failure AnalysisMH  - Heart Ventricles/*physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - *Models, CardiovascularMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Thrombosis/*etiology/*physiopathology/prevention & controlPMC - PMC4023653OID - NLM: PMC4023653EDAT- 2013/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/17 06:00PHST- 2013/09/08 [received]AID - 1790329 [pii]AID - 10.1115/1.4026254 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Biomech Eng. 2014 Feb;136(2):021014.
