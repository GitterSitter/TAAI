Current treatment      options include pharmacological (catecholamines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors)      and mechanical assist device support. Pharmacological support with catecholamines      is related to elevated myocardial oxygen consumption and regional hypoperfusion      leading to organ damage. On the other hand, levosimendan, as a      calcium-sensitizing agent increases cardiac contractility without altering      intracellular Ca(2+) levels and increase in oxygen demand. We present a case of a      51-year-old man, who was suffering from acute right-heart failure in the early      postoperative period after heart transplantation. As a rescue therapy at the late      stage of a low cardiac output state, levosimendan was started as continuous      infusion at 0.1 mug/kg/min for 12 h and thereafter, at 0.2 mug/kg/min for the      following 36 h. Levosimendan demonstrated an advanced pharmacological option as      was portrayed in this case, where the right ventricle was under a prolonged      severe depression and acutely overloaded after heart transplantation.FAU - Barisin, StjepanAU  - Barisin SAD  - Clinical Department of Cardiovascular Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University      Department of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care, Dubrava      University Hospital, Av.
