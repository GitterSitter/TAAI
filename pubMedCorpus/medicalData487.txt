Ventricular assist devices (VADs) for      adults have evolved dramatically over the last decade, both as a bridge to      transplantation and for permanent support. In contrast, VADs designed for      children, especially for all age groups, are still in their infancy. The Medos      HIA and the Berlin Heart Excor are specially designed for children with a body      surface area <1.2 m2. Increased experience with existing paediatric VADs and the       introduction of third-generation VADs for the paediatric age group offer new      possibilities for children suffering from end-stage heart failure. We review the       literature on this topic, summarise the indications and contraindications for      long-term support VADs and describe the decision-making algorithm used at our      institution for use of long-term VADs in children.FAU - Schweiger, MAU  - Schweiger MAD  - Department for Congenital Cardiovascular Surgery, University Children's Hospital       Zurich, Switzerland. martinschweig88@hotmail.comFAU - Dave, HAU  - Dave HFAU - Lemme, FAU  - Lemme FFAU - Romanchenko, OAU  - Romanchenko OFAU - Hubler, MAU  - Hubler MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130605PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Swiss Med WklyJT  - Swiss medical weeklyJID - 100970884SB  - IMMH  - Cardiomyopathies/*therapyMH  - ChildMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart, ArtificialMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Pediatrics/*instrumentationEDAT- 2013/06/07 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/07 06:00AID - 10.4414/smw.2013.13804 [doi]AID - smw-13804 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Swiss Med Wkly. 2013 Jun 5;143:w13804. doi: 10.4414/smw.2013.13804.
