Mechanical circulatory      support devices were introduced into practice for the heart failure patients to      bridge the time between the decision to transplant and the actual transplantation      which is not sufficient due to the state of donor organ supply. In this study,      the hemodynamic response of a cardiovascular system that includes a dilated      cardiomyopathic heart under support of a newly developed continuous flow left      ventricular assist device--Heart Turcica Axial--was evaluated employing computer       simulations. For the evaluation, a numerical model which describes the      pressure-flow rate relations of Heart Turcica Axial, a cardiovascular system      model describing the healthy and pathological hemodynamics, and a baroreflex      model regulating the heart rate were used. Heart Turcica Axial was operated      between 8000 rpm and 11,000 rpm speeds with 1000 rpm increments for assessing the      pump performance and response of the cardiovascular system. The results also give      an insight about the range of the possible operating speeds of Heart Turcica      Axial in a clinical application. Based on the findings, operating speed of Heart       Turcica Axial should be between 10,000 rpm and 11,000 rpm.FAU - Bozkurt, SelimAU  - Bozkurt SAD  - Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yeditepe University, 34755 Kadikoy,      Istanbul, Turkey.FAU - Safak, Koray KAU  - Safak KKAD  - Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yeditepe University, 34755 Kadikoy,      Istanbul, Turkey.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20131202PL  - United StatesTA  - Comput Math Methods MedJT  - Computational and mathematical methods in medicineJID - 101277751SB  - IMMH  - AlgorithmsMH  - Aortic Valve/pathologyMH  - Blood PressureMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/physiopathologyMH  - Cardiovascular Diseases/*physiopathologyMH  - Cardiovascular SystemMH  - Computer SimulationMH  - Heart Failure/*physiopathologyMH  - Heart Ventricles/physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Models, CardiovascularMH  - Models, TheoreticalMH  - Stress, MechanicalPMC - PMC3864087OID - NLM: PMC3864087EDAT- 2013/12/24 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/24 06:00PHST- 2013/06/29 [received]PHST- 2013/10/19 [revised]PHST- 2013/10/21 [accepted]PHST- 2013/12/02 [epublish]AID - 10.1155/2013/986430 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Comput Math Methods Med. 2013;2013:986430. doi: 10.1155/2013/986430.
