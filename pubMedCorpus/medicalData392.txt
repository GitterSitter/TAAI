Understanding the hemostatic defects contributing to NSB      after CF-LVAD implantation is crucial for prevention of this adverse event. The      aim of this study was to examine the link between platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha      (GPIbalpha) ectodomain shedding and NSB in CF-LVAD recipients and to identify a      potential biomarker of NSB. METHODS: Serial blood samples were collected from 35       HF patients supported with CF-LVADs. Platelet function was evaluated by a      platelet function analysis device and thromboelastography (TEG). Platelet      GPIbalpha shedding, von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen and vWF collagen binding       capacity were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The      structural analysis of vWF was performed by gel electrophoresis. These platelet      function measures with vWF parameters of the patients who had NSB between 4 and      32 days after CF-LVAD implantation (bleeder) were analyzed against those without       NSB (non-bleeder). Blood samples from 7 healthy individuals were collected to      obtain healthy reference values for the laboratory assays. RESULTS: Elevated      GPIbalpha shedding was found to be a pre-existing condition in all HF patients      prior to CF-LVAD implantation. Post-operative level of GPIbalpha shedding      increased and remained elevated in the bleeder group, whereas a consistent      decrease was found in the non-bleeder group. A receiver operating characteristic       (ROC) analysis indicated that the level of GPIbalpha shedding had a predictive      power of NSB in patients on CF-LVAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet GPIbalpha      ectodomain shedding which attenuates platelet reactivity is associated with NSB.       Plasma GPIbalpha level may potentially be used to refine bleeding risk      stratification in CF-LVAD patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
