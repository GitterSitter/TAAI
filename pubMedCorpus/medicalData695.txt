Between July 2009      and March 2011, 46 patients with advanced heart failure had implantation of the      HVAD. Of these patients, 30 had subsequent assessments for transplantation and      these patients formed the study cohort. Thirty patients had assessments at a mean      of 201+/-86 days and 13 went on to have a second assessment at 351+/-86 days.      There were marked improvements in hemodynamics and exercise capacity at both      assessments, with significant decreases in right and left heart filling      pressures; increases in cardiac index, New York Heart Association class, and peak      exercise oxygen consumption; and reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (all       P<.05). Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were unchanged      at the first assessment, although there was a significant reduction in      end-diastolic diameter at the second assessment (P<.01). There were no      significant changes in a visual grade of right ventricular function. After up to       1 year of support, the HVAD system results in significant benefits in overall      heart failure status, with improved hemodynamics and exercise capacity. This      occurs in the absence of marked changes in left ventricular size or right      ventricular function.CI  - (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - McDiarmid, AdamAU  - McDiarmid AAD  - Department of Cardiology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.FAU - Gordon, BrianAU  - Gordon BFAU - Wrightson, NeilAU  - Wrightson NFAU - Robinson-Smith, NicolaAU  - Robinson-Smith NFAU - Pillay, ThaseeAU  - Pillay TFAU - Parry, GarethAU  - Parry GFAU - Schueler, StephanAU  - Schueler SFAU - MacGowan, Guy AAU  - MacGowan GALA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120713PL  - United StatesTA  - Congest Heart FailJT  - Congestive heart failure (Greenwich, Conn.)JID - 9714174SB  - IMMH  - Echocardiography/*methodsMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Exercise TestMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/*physiopathology/surgery/ultrasonographyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hemodynamics/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/07/19 06:00MHDA- 2013/12/16 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/19 06:00PHST- 2012/07/13 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1751-7133.2012.00302.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Congest Heart Fail. 2013 Jan-Feb;19(1):11-5. doi:      10.1111/j.1751-7133.2012.00302.x.
