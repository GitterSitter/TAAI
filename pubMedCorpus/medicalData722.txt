Expansion of the donor pool requires an understanding of the impact on      survival likely to result from extending one or more high risk factors. Use of      extended donor pool results in shorter waiting list times and limits the      morbidity and mortality associated with long-term mechanical support needed to      support diseased organs. In this report, we present one such example of expanding      donor pool in which a pediatric patient donated a solid organ after two heart      transplants and successful use of ECMO and VAD.CI  - (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Gupta, PunkajAU  - Gupta PAD  - Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, University of      Arkansas Medical Center, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA. pgupta2@uams.eduFAU - Blanco, CarlosAU  - Blanco CFAU - Madigan, MelissaAU  - Madigan MFAU - Dodgen, AndrewAU  - Dodgen AFAU - Hanson, MariAU  - Hanson MFAU - Frazier, Elizabeth AAU  - Frazier EAFAU - Bhutta, Adnan TAU  - Bhutta ATFAU - Fiser, William PAU  - Fiser WPLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120517PL  - DenmarkTA  - Pediatr TransplantJT  - Pediatric transplantationJID - 9802574RN  - S88TT14065 (Oxygen)SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - ChildMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*methodsMH  - Fatal OutcomeMH  - FemaleMH  - Graft SurvivalMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Liver Transplantation/methodsMH  - Organ TransplantationMH  - Oxygen/*chemistryMH  - Pulmonary Valve/pathologyMH  - ReoperationMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Tetralogy of Fallot/therapyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/05/19 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/27 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/19 06:00PHST- 2012/05/17 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2012.01720.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Transplant. 2012 Dec;16(8):E368-71. doi:      10.1111/j.1399-3046.2012.01720.x.
