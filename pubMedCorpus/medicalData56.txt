If weaning off ECLS is not possible, heart      transplantation or implantation of long-term mechanical circulatory support      (LTMCS) is required. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the      bridge-to-bridge (BTB) concept. METHODS: Between 1 January 2004 and 1 August      2010, 97 patients were assisted by LTMCS. The implantation was the first-line      intervention in 48 patients (the bridge group), and was performed after a period       of ECLS support in 49 others (the BTB group). RESULTS: The long-term survival      rate was 51.6%, with a mean follow-up of 30.7 months, and there were no      differences for biological parameters between the two groups. Patients in the BTB      group whose condition was initially more severe, improved under ECLS support, and      those in whom biological parameters did not revert to normal died after LTMCS.      Risk factors for mortality in the BTB group were total bilirubin and lactate      before LTMCS, and alkaline phosphatase before ECLS support. CONCLUSIONS: The BTB       concept allows the implementation of LTMCS in severe patients, for whom it was      not originally envisaged, with the same long-term survival as in first-line      settings. ECLS in the evolution of patients is predictive of survival after      LTMCS.CI  - (c) The Author 2015.
