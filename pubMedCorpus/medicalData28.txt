As the availability of LVADs for advanced      heart failure has expanded to nontransplantation mechanical circulatory support      centers, concerns have been expressed about maintaining good outcomes.      Demographics and outcomes were evaluated in 276 patients with advanced heart      failure who underwent implantation of LVADs as bridge to transplantation or      destination therapy at 27 open-heart centers. Baseline characteristics, operative      mortality, length of stay, readmission rate, adverse events, quality of life, and      survival were analyzed. The overall 30-day mortality was 3% (8 of 276), and      survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were 92 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 3%,       and 84 +/- 4% for the bridge-to-transplantation group and 81 +/- 3%, 70 +/- 5%,      and 63 +/- 6% for the destination therapy group, comparable with results      published by the national Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS). The median length of stay for all patients was      21 days. Bleeding was the most frequent adverse event. Stroke occurred in 4%      (bridge to transplantation) and 6% (destination therapy) of patients.      Quality-of-life measures and 6-minute walk distances showed sustained      improvements throughout support. In conclusion, outcomes with LVAD support at      open-heart centers are acceptable and comparable with results from the INTERMACS       registry. With appropriate teams, training, center commitment, and certification,      LVAD therapy is being disseminated in a responsible way to open-heart centers.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
