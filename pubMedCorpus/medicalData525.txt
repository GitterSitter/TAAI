Axial and centrifugal CVADs have been successfully used as bridge-to-transplant      and destination therapy. CVADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than       the first-generation pulsatile-flow ventricular assist devices. Despite their      recent clinical success, arteriovenous malformations, gastrointestinal bleeding,       hemorrhagic strokes, aortic valve insufficiency, and valve fusion have been      reported in heart failure patients supported by CVADs. It has been hypothesized      that diminished arterial pressure and flow pulsatility delivered by CVAD may be a      contributing factor to these adverse events. Subsequently, the clinical      significance of vascular pulsatility continues to be highly debated. Studies      comparing pulsatile-flow and continuous-flow support have presented conflicting      findings, largely due to variations in device operation, support duration, and      the criteria used to quantify pulsatility. Traditional measurements of pulse      pressure and pulsatility index are less effective at quantifying pulsatility for       mechanically derived flows, particularly with the growing trend of CVAD speed      modulation to achieve various pulsatile flow patterns. Kinetic measurements of      energy equivalent pressure and surplus hemodynamic energy can better quantify      pulsatile energies, yet technologic and conceptual challenges are impeding their       clinical adaption. A review of methods for quantifying vascular pulsatility and      their application as a research tool for investigating physiologic responses to      CVAD support are presented.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
