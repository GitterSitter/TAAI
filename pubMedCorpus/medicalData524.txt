Between 2007 and 2011, 77       patients (age range: 25-70 years) with preoperative evidence of biventricular      dysfunction (University of Pennsylvania score >50; University of Michigan score      >5) were included. Forty-six patients (38 men; median age 54.5 years, range:      25-70 years) underwent LVAD placement combined with temporary RVAD support (group      A); in 31 patients (25 men; median age 56.7 years, range: 28-68 years), a      permanent BVAD or TAH implantation (group B) was performed. Within 30 days, 12      patients from group A (26.08%) and 14 patients from group B (45.1%) died on      mechanical support (P = 0.02). Thirty patients (65.2%) in group A were weaned      from temporary RVAD support and three (6.5%) underwent permanent RVAD (HeartWare,      Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) placement. A total of 26 patients (56.5%) were      discharged home in group A versus 17 (54.8%) in group B (P = 0.56). Three      patients (8.5%) received heart transplantation in group A and six (19.3%) in      group B (P = 0.04). In group A, 90-day and 6-month survival was 54.3% (n = 25)      versus 51.6% (n = 16) in group B (P = 0.66). In group A, 1-year survival was      45.6% (n = 21) versus 45.1% (n = 14) in group B (P = 0.81). The strategy of      planned temporary RVAD support in LVAD recipients showed encouraging results if      compared with those of a similar permanent BVAD/TAH population. Weaning from and       removal of the temporary RVAD support may allow patients to be on LVAD support      only despite preoperative biventricular dysfunction.CI  - (c) 2013, Copyright the Authors.
