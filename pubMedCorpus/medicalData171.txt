In the UK, there was a      significant reduction in heart transplantation rates over the last decade, so      that transplantation from VADs is much less frequent. The objective of this study      was to determine outcomes and their predictors in this situation of low BTT      rates, and as patients were exposed to long-term support, the incidence and      outcomes of VAD thrombosis. METHODS: We analysed outcomes for 102 consecutive      patients between 2009 and 2013 (mean age 47 +/- 13; VentrAssist n = 6 and      HeartWare n = 96). The median duration of support was 462 +/- 426 days. RESULTS:       Survival rates on the device were 75 and 66% at 1 and 2 years, respectively.      Older age and more acute INTERMACS groups were significantly related to reduced      survival within the first 90 days (P = 0.030 and 0.010, respectively). Poor      preoperative right ventricular (RV) function had a negative effect on survival      after 1 year (P = 0.009), though not earlier. VAD thrombosis (n = 24 HeartWare      and n = 1 VentrAssist) occurred at 0.18 events per patient-year for HeartWare and      0.07 for VentrAssist devices at a median time of onset at 404 +/- 281 days. There      was no significant effect of VAD thrombosis on survival. Only 14 of 102 patients       were transplanted at a median of 334 +/- 347 days, and only 3 were transplanted      within the first 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation left ventricular assist       device implants with a low rate of transplantation have similar survival to      destination therapy, and are susceptible to long-term complications of VAD      thrombosis and right heart failure.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
