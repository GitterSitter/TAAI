Problems with device-related infection, bleeding, neurologic events,      right-sided heart failure, and device malfunction have dominated the clinical      care of patients living on mechanical support. Even as adoption of durable LVADs       accelerated globally, we began to encounter a growing dilemma of pump malfunction      caused by thrombosis. In early 2011, clinicians began to notice a spike in the      incidence of pump thrombosis with the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton,      CA) LVAD. By 2012, the problem of thrombosis in LVADs began to consume most of      the scientific direction as centers and collaborative groups began to dissect      this nascent phenomenon. In this perspective, we describe the magnitude and      implications of pump thrombosis, discuss secular and management trends in this      unique population, attempt to dissect the problem at its root, offer guidance on       surveillance and therapeutic principles, and outline issues that deserve our      immediate and collaborative attention.CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Mehra, Mandeep RAU  - Mehra MRAD  - The Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and Harvard Medical      School, Boston, Massachusetts.
