The      indications and subsequent benefits of performing valvular procedures in these      patients are unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of       performing concurrent surgical valve procedures in a large cohort of patients      receiving LVADs. METHODS: One thousand one hundred six patients received the      HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD in the bridge to transplant (n = 470) and destination      therapy (n = 636) clinical trials. Of these, 374 patients (34%) had concurrent      cardiac surgery procedures as follows: 242 patients (21%) with 281 concurrent      valve procedures (VP) (aortic 80, mitral 45, and tricuspid 156), and 641 patients      had only HMII LVAD. The focus of this study was to determine the clinical      outcomes of patients undergoing HMII + VP compared with those who received HMII      alone. RESULTS: Patients undergoing HMII + VP were significantly older, had      higher blood urea nitrogen levels and central venous pressure, and decreased      right ventricular stroke work index; intraoperatively, the median cardiopulmonary      bypass times were also longer. The unadjusted 30-day mortality was significantly       higher in patients undergoing HMII + VP (10.3% vs 4.8% for LVAD alone, P = .005).      Subgroup analysis of individual VPs showed that higher mortality occurred in      patients with HMII plus 2 or more VPs (13.5%, P = .04) followed by trends for      increased mortality with HMII plus mitral alone (11.5%, P = NS), HMII plus aortic      alone (10.9%, P = NS), and HMII plus tricuspid (8.9%, P = NS) procedures. Of      these various groups, only patients undergoing HMII + isolated aortic VP (P =      .001) and HMII + multiple VPs (P = .046) had significantly worse long-term      survival compared with patients undergoing HMII alone. Right heart failure and      right ventricular assist device use was increased in patients undergoing VPs, but      there was no difference in the incidence of bleeding or stroke. CONCLUSIONS:      Patients frequently require concurrent VPs at the time of LVAD placement; these      patients are sicker and have higher early mortality. Furthermore, right      ventricular dysfunction is increased in these patients. Further studies to      develop selection criteria for concurrent valve interventions are important to      further improve clinical outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
