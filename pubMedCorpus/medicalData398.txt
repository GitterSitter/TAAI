The objective of this study was to evaluate      outcomes of pediatric patients supported by the HMII LVAD. METHODS: This was a      retrospective review of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) of patients supported with a HMII from April 2008      to September 2011. The primary cohort comprised pediatric patients aged 11 to 18       years. Outcomes were compared with a group of young adults aged 19 to 39 years      who underwent HMII implant during the same period. Ischemic etiologies for heart       failure were excluded. RESULTS: There were 28 pediatric patients, of whom 19      (68%) were males, 14 (46%) were African American, and 7 (25%) underwent device      placement in a pediatric hospital. Competing outcomes analysis showed that at 6      months of follow-up, the composite of survival to transplantation, ongoing      support, or recovery was 96% for the pediatric group, which was not significantly      different from the young adult group (96%, p = 0.330). The 2 groups had similar      INTERMACS profiles but differed in diagnosis, weight, and morbidities. Bleeding      complications requiring surgical intervention were more common in the pediatric      group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric outcomes with a HMII LVAD are comparable to that of      young adults. As we continue to monitor this growing group, more sophisticated      characterization and comparisons will be possible. Also, as technology progress      and second- and third-generation devices are introduced, the number of children      who will benefit from mechanical support will continue to grow.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
