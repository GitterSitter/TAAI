There is a paucity of data, however, regarding the ability of      continuous flow (CF) pumps to adequately decompress the LV to induce similar      reverse remodeling. We sought to evaluate the effects of CF-LVADs on LV reverse      remodeling. From March 2006 through July 2011, one hundred patients with chronic       heart failure underwent implantation of CF-LVAD (93 HeartMate II LVADs and seven       HeartWare LVADs) as bridge-to-transplant (n = 68) and destination therapies (n =       32). Echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations were reviewed      preoperatively and at 1 and 6 months post-LVAD implantation. Mean age was 52.1      +/- 12.1 years; etiology of heart failure was ischemic cardiomyopathy in 34      patients and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in 66 patients. Median LVAD      support time was 378.3 days; 371.5 days for patients who received      bridge-to-transplant therapy and 422.2 days for patients who underwent      destination therapy. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension significantly      decreased at 1 month post-LVAD implantation from 71.6 +/- 12.4 to 58.3 +/- 13.8      mm (p < 0.001). Severity of MR also significantly decreased from 76.0% of      patients having moderate or severe MR preoperatively to 8.0% with moderate or      severe MR at 1 month post-LVAD (p < 0.001). These reductions were maintained at 6      months. These data demonstrate the ability of a CF-LVAD to significantly      decompress the LV, leading to significant reductions in LVEDD and severity of MR.      This reverse remodeling was apparent in the early postoperative period and was      sustained at 6 months. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether this       correlates with clinical LV recovery.FAU - Morgan, Jeffrey AAU  - Morgan JAAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart and Vascular Institute, Henry Ford      Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, USA. jmorgan2@hfhs.orgFAU - Brewer, Robert JAU  - Brewer RJFAU - Nemeh, Hassan WAU  - Nemeh HWFAU - Murthy, RaghavAU  - Murthy RFAU - Williams, Celeste TAU  - Williams CTFAU - Lanfear, David EAU  - Lanfear DEFAU - Tita, CristinaAU  - Tita CFAU - Paone, GaetanoAU  - Paone GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - *DiastoleMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Mitral Valve Insufficiency/*physiopathologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - *Ventricular RemodelingEDAT- 2012/10/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/25 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/30 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31826e4267 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2012 Nov-Dec;58(6):574-7. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31826e4267.
