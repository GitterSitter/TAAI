The conventional LVADs are      designed to provide full hemodynamic support for the end-stage failing heart.      However, full-support LVAD implantation requires major surgery, sternotomy and      cardiopulmonary bypass in majority of cases. The Synergy Micro-pump is the      smallest implantable LVAD and provides partial flow support up to 3 l/min. It was      shown that early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits      to patients with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support      LVAD. Due the small dimensions it can be implanted without cardiopulmonary bypass      or a sternotomy. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical use of the      Synergy Micro-pump as partial hemodynamic support.FAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical support, Royal      Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.FAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AFAU - Simon, Andre RuedigerAU  - Simon ARFAU - Weymann, AlexanderAU  - Weymann AFAU - Patil, Nikhil PrakashAU  - Patil NPFAU - Unsoeld, BernhardAU  - Unsoeld BFAU - Bireta, ChristianAU  - Bireta CFAU - Popov, Aron FrederikAU  - Popov AFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20141202PL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Med DevicesJT  - Expert review of medical devicesJID - 101230445SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - LVADOT  - circulateOT  - partial support deviceOT  - synergyEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/03 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00PHST- 2014/12/02 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1586/17434440.2015.985208 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2015 Jan;12(1):49-60. doi: 10.1586/17434440.2015.985208.
