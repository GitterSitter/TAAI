As the field of mechanical circulatory support      has evolved in children, the frequency of ventricular assist device use has been       increasing steadily with excellent results. Ventricular assist devices are being       used with increasing frequency in children with cardiac failure refractory to      medical therapy for primary treatment as a long-term bridge to recovery or      transplantation. This review, part of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care      Society/Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Joint Consensus Statement on      Mechanical Circulatory Support, focuses on ventricular assist device implantation      and management, as well as anticipation and management of complications.FAU - Cooper, David SAU  - Cooper DSAD  - The Heart Institute, Division of Cardiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital      Medical Center, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.
