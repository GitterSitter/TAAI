Primarily owing to the presence      of a driveline that connects the device to an external battery through an open      skin incision, the rates of LVAD-related infections (LVADRIs) are high, ranging      from 30 to 50%. LVADRIs can be broadly classified into driveline infection, pump       pocket infection, bloodstream infection and endocarditis/pump or cannula      infection. Diagnostic evaluation and management of these complicated infections      can be quite challenging for clinicians involved in the care of these patients.      Here, the authors summarize the current epidemiology, microbiology, diagnostic      approach and management strategies for each type of LVADRI. The authors also      review current concepts regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for LVAD implantation.      Finally, the authors highlight the gaps in the knowledge of LVADRI and provide      directions for future studies.FAU - Nienaber, JuhsienAU  - Nienaber JAD  - Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of      Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.FAU - Wilhelm, Mark PAU  - Wilhelm MPFAU - Sohail, M RizwanAU  - Sohail MRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Anti Infect TherJT  - Expert review of anti-infective therapyJID - 101181284RN  - 0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)SB  - IMMH  - Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic useMH  - Antibiotic Prophylaxis/methodsMH  - Endocarditis/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*microbiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapyMH  - Risk FactorsEDAT- 2013/02/16 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/09 06:00CRDT- 2013/02/16 06:00AID - 10.1586/eri.12.163 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2013 Feb;11(2):201-10. doi: 10.1586/eri.12.163.
