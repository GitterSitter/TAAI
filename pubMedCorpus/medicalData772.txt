Because of the increasing number of heart failure patients and      the limited supply of donor hearts, a ventricular assist device (VAD) is used as       a bridge to transplantation, recovery, or decision. Newer generation VADs have      lower risk of fatal adverse events and are also smaller in size. We present our      experience with the intrapericardial HeartWare VAD (HeartWare, Framingham, MA)      and its clinical outcome. METHODS: The clinical outcome of HeartWare VAD      implantations for end-stage heart failure patients performed at Harefield      Hospital from March 2007 to June 2011 was studied. The study design was a      retrospective review of the prospectively collected data. RESULTS: Thirty-four      patients with a mean age of 51+/-10 years were included in this study.      Twenty-nine patients were male (85%). The mean duration of mechanical support was      261+/-64 days. Five patients (15%) were successfully bridged to heart      transplantation. The overall mortality was 24% (8 patients). There were 1 case of      mechanical device failure (2%) and 3 cases of device failure due to thrombus      formation (8%). Postoperative complications included 5 reoperations for bleeding       (15%), 12 acute renal failures (36%), 7 respiratory failures (21%), 2 hepatic      dysfunctions (6%), 3 neurologic dysfunctions (9%), 7 right-side heart failures      (21%), and 5 driveline infections (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Although cardiac      transplantation remains the gold standard for treatment of end-stage heart      failure patients, the HeartWare VAD can be used as a safe alternative with a      satisfactory clinical outcome.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
