Although the reference standard for      treatment of advanced heart failure remains cardiac transplantation, the      increasing shortage of donor organs and the unsuitability of many patients for      transplantation surgery has led to a search for alternative therapies. One such      therapy is mechanical circulatory support, which helps relieve the load on the      ventricle and thereby allows it to recover function. In addition, there is      increasing evidence supporting the use of mechanical devices as a bridge to      recovery in patients with acute refractory heart failure. In this article, the      imaging evaluation of various commonly used short- and long-term cardiac assist      devices is discussed, and their relevant mechanisms of action and physiology are       described. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), plays a crucial role      in preoperative evaluation for assessment of candidacy for implantation of a left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH). Also,      echocardiography and CT are indispensable in assessment of complications      associated with cardiac devices. Complications commonly associated with      short-term assist devices include bleeding and malpositioning, whereas long-term       devices such as LVADs may be associated with infection, pump thrombosis, and      cannula malfunction, as well as bleeding. CT is also commonly performed for      preoperative planning before LVAD or TAH explantation, replacement of a device or      one of its components, and cardiac transplantation.
