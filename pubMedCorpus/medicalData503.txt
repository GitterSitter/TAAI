These      devices are mainly used in patients with late stage heart failure (HF). We are      developing a novel percutaneous intra-aortic micro-axial fluid entrainment pump      intended for long-term MCS in patients with earlier stage HF. This study examined      the pump's hemodynamic effects in a porcine model of acute HF. In three porcine      experiments, the pump was deployed in the thoracic aorta by standard cardiac      catheterization techniques and was anchored with self-expanding struts. Acute      cardiac dysfunction was induced by infusing esmolol continuously. Pump support      increased cardiac output (+10.4%), stroke volume (+8.9%), and ejection fraction      (+10.8%) while decreasing cardiac stroke work (-10.8%) and afterload (-22.7%).      Furthermore, pump support significantly enhanced renal perfusion through      sustained increases in both renal artery flow (+36.4%) and pressure (+73.6%). In       a porcine model of acute HF, the catheter-based intra-aortic fluid entrainment      pump improved hemodynamics and renal perfusion. These results suggest that the      pump could improve HF outcomes and patients' quality of life by resting the      heart, promoting reverse remodeling, and augmenting end-organ perfusion.      Furthermore, the enhanced renal perfusion may help disrupt the cardiorenal      syndrome cycle and improve HF treatment.FAU - Shabari, Farshad RaissiAU  - Shabari FRAD  - Department of Cardiopulmonary Transplantation and Center for Cardiac Support,      Texas Heart Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.FAU - George, JoggyAU  - George JFAU - Cuchiara, Michael PAU  - Cuchiara MPFAU - Langsner, Robert JAU  - Langsner RJFAU - Heuring, Jason JAU  - Heuring JJFAU - Cohn, William EAU  - Cohn WEFAU - Hertzog, Benjamin AAU  - Hertzog BAFAU - Delgado, ReynoldsAU  - Delgado RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AnimalsMH  - Aorta/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - Cardiac Catheterization/*methodsMH  - Disease Models, AnimalMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Hemodynamics/*physiologyMH  - Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping/*instrumentationMH  - Prosthesis Design/*methodsMH  - SwineMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - Ventricular Function, Left/*physiologyEDAT- 2013/05/07 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/02 06:00CRDT- 2013/05/07 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31828a6e74 [doi]AID - 00002480-201305000-00008 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2013 May-Jun;59(3):240-5. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31828a6e74.
