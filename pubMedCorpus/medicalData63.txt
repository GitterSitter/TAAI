This shortage has led to the development of effective mechanical      circulatory support (MCS). Currently, various implantable ventricular-assist      devices (VADs) are able to provide temporary or long-term circulatory support for      many end-stage heart-failure patients. Implantation of a total artificial heart      (TAH) currently represents the surgical treatment option for patients requiring      biventricular MCS as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT).      However, the clinical applicability of available versions of positive      displacement pumps is limited by their size and associated complications.      Application of advanced technology is aimed at solving some of these issues,      attempting to develop a new generation of smaller and more effective TAHs to suit      a wider patient population. Particular targets for improvement include      modifications to the biocompatibility of device designs and materials in order to      decrease hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. Meanwhile, new systems to       power implanted driving units which are fully operational without interruption of      skin barriers represent a potential means of decreasing the risk of infections.      In this review, we will discuss the history of the TAH, its development and      clinical application, the implications of the existing technological solutions,      published outcomes and the future outlook for TAHs.FAU - Gerosa, GinoAU  - Gerosa GAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of       Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai      Hospital, New York, USA.FAU - Scuri, SilviaAU  - Scuri SAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of       Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai      Hospital, New York, USA.FAU - Iop, LauraAU  - Iop LAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of       Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai      Hospital, New York, USA.FAU - Torregrossa, GianlucaAU  - Torregrossa GAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of       Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai      Hospital, New York, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ChinaTA  - Ann Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101605877PMC - PMC4250545OID - NLM: PMC4250545OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Mechanical circulatory support (MCS)OT  - heart failureOT  - total artificial heart (TAH)EDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:01CRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00PHST- 2014/06/11 [received]PHST- 2014/08/21 [accepted]AID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.05 [doi]AID - acs-03-06-595 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Nov;3(6):595-602. doi:      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.05.
