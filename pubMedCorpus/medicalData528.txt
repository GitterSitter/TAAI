Published data are limited to 1 in 4 children who received      the device as part of the US clinical trial. We analyzed outcomes for all US      children who received the EXCOR to characterize device outcomes in an unselected       cohort and to identify risk factors for mortality to facilitate patient      selection. METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study      involved all children implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular      assist device at 47 centers from May 2007 through December 2010. Multiphase      nonproportional hazards modeling was used to identify risk factors for early (<2       months) and late mortality. Of 204 children supported with the EXCOR, the median       duration of support was 40 days (range, 1-435 days). Survival at 12 months was      75%, including 64% who reached transplantation, 6% who recovered, and 5% who were      alive on the device. Multivariable analysis identified lower weight,      biventricular assist device support, and elevated bilirubin as risk factors for      early mortality and bilirubin extremes and renal dysfunction as risk factors for       late mortality. Neurological dysfunction occurred in 29% and was the leading      cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR has risen dramatically      over the past decade. The EXCOR has emerged as a new treatment standard in the      United States for pediatric bridge to transplantation. Three-quarters of children      survived to transplantation or recovery; an important fraction experienced      neurological dysfunction. Smaller patient size, renal dysfunction, hepatic      dysfunction, and biventricular assist device use were associated with mortality,       whereas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before implantation and congenital      heart disease were not.FAU - Almond, Christopher SAU  - Almond CSAD  - The Heart Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Harvard      Medical School, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115, USA.      christopher.almond@childrens.harvard.eduFAU - Morales, David LAU  - Morales DLFAU - Blackstone, Eugene HAU  - Blackstone EHFAU - Turrentine, Mark WAU  - Turrentine MWFAU - Imamura, MichiakiAU  - Imamura MFAU - Massicotte, M PatriciaAU  - Massicotte MPFAU - Jordan, Lori CAU  - Jordan LCFAU - Devaney, Eric JAU  - Devaney EJFAU - Ravishankar, ChitraAU  - Ravishankar CFAU - Kanter, Kirk RAU  - Kanter KRFAU - Holman, WilliamAU  - Holman WFAU - Kroslowitz, RobertAU  - Kroslowitz RFAU - Tjossem, ChristineAU  - Tjossem CFAU - Thuita, LucyAU  - Thuita LFAU - Cohen, Gordon AAU  - Cohen GAFAU - Buchholz, HolgerAU  - Buchholz HFAU - St Louis, James DAU  - St Louis JDFAU - Nguyen, KhanhAU  - Nguyen KFAU - Niebler, Robert AAU  - Niebler RAFAU - Walters, Henry L 3rdAU  - Walters HL 3rdFAU - Reemtsen, BrianAU  - Reemtsen BFAU - Wearden, Peter DAU  - Wearden PDFAU - Reinhartz, OlafAU  - Reinhartz OFAU - Guleserian, Kristine JAU  - Guleserian KJFAU - Mitchell, Max BAU  - Mitchell MBFAU - Bleiweis, Mark SAU  - Bleiweis MSFAU - Canter, Charles EAU  - Canter CEFAU - Humpl, TilmanAU  - Humpl TLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.DEP - 20130328PL  - United StatesTA  - CirculationJT  - CirculationJID - 0147763SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Circulation. 2013 Nov 12;128(20):e405.
