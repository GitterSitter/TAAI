Increasing the availability of      cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5)      is a relatively new, but promising therapeutic strategy. Preclinical studies      suggest a favorable myocardial effect of PDE5 inhibitors by blocking adrenergic,       hypertrophic and pro-apoptotic signaling, thereby supporting their use in HF. The      clinical benefits of acute and chronic PDE5 inhibition on lung diffusion      capacity, exercise performance and ejection fraction in humans are emerging and      appear promising. Larger, controlled trials are now on-going to assess the      safety, efficacy and tolerability of PDE5 inhibitors on morbidity and mortality      in patients with both systolic and diastolic heart failure. If the results of      these trials are positive, a new avenue for the treatment of HF will open, which       will help curtail the societal effects of this costly and morbid disease.FAU - Kanwar, ManreetAU  - Kanwar MAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, The Cardiovascular      Institute at Allegheny General Hospital, 320 East North Ave, Pittsburgh, PA      15212, USA.FAU - Agarwal, RichaAU  - Agarwal RFAU - Barnes, MeganAU  - Barnes MFAU - Coons, JamesAU  - Coons JFAU - Raina, AmreshAU  - Raina AFAU - Sokos, GeorgeAU  - Sokos GFAU - Murali, SrinivasAU  - Murali SFAU - Benza, Raymond LAU  - Benza RLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Heart Fail RepJT  - Current heart failure reportsJID - 101196487RN  - 0 (Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors)RN  - 31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)RN  - H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)SB  - IMMH  - Cyclic GMP/physiologyMH  - Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Nitric Oxide/physiologyMH  - Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors/*therapeutic useMH  - Signal Transduction/physiologyEDAT- 2012/11/02 06:00MHDA- 2013/07/11 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/02 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11897-012-0121-9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2013 Mar;10(1):26-35. doi: 10.1007/s11897-012-0121-9.
