As a non-stopping      pumping machine, it operates continuously to pump blood through our bodies to      supply all cells with oxygen and necessary nutrients. When the heart fails, the      supplement of blood to the body's organs to meet metabolic demands will      deteriorate. The treatment of the participating causes is the ideal approach to      treat heart failure (HF). As this often cannot be done effectively, the medical      management of HF is a difficult challenge. Implantable rotary blood pumps (IRBPs)      have the potential to become a viable long-term treatment option for bridging to       heart transplantation or destination therapy. This increases the potential for      the patients to leave the hospital and resume normal lives. Control of IRBPs is      one of the most important design goals in providing long-term alternative      treatment for HF patients. Over the years, many control algorithms including      invasive and non-invasive techniques have been developed in the hope of      physiologically and adaptively controlling left ventricular assist devices and      thus avoiding such undesired pumping states as left ventricular collapse caused      by suction. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the      developments of control systems and techniques that have been applied to control       IRBPs.FAU - AlOmari, Abdul-Hakeem HAU  - AlOmari AHAD  - Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of      Dammam, Dammam 31451, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ahalomari@ud.edu.saFAU - Savkin, Andrey VAU  - Savkin AVFAU - Stevens, MichaelAU  - Stevens MFAU - Mason, David GAU  - Mason DGFAU - Timms, Daniel LAU  - Timms DLFAU - Salamonsen, Robert FAU  - Salamonsen RFFAU - Lovell, Nigel HAU  - Lovell NHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20121217PL  - EnglandTA  - Physiol MeasJT  - Physiological measurementJID - 9306921SB  - IMMH  - Coronary CirculationMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Ventricles/*physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansEDAT- 2012/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/18 06:00PHST- 2012/12/17 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1088/0967-3334/34/1/R1 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Physiol Meas. 2013 Jan;34(1):R1-27. doi: 10.1088/0967-3334/34/1/R1.
