Little is known about the effects of an LV assist device (LVAD) on      cardiac sympathetic innervations and norepinephrine transporter dysfunction. This      study examines the effects of continuous-flow HeartMate II LVAD on cardiac      sympathetic innervations using [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine ([(123)I]MIBG)      nuclear imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS: After injecting 431 +/- 21 MBq of      [(123)I]MIBG, planar scintigraphy was performed at 15 min and 4 h in 14      consecutive non-diabetic non-ischaemic DCM patients. Scans were executed early      post-LVAD implantation (T1) and prior to either device explantation for      myocardial recovery or transplant listing (T2). [(123)I]MIBG measured parameters       included early and delayed heart-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate (W/O).      Catecholamine levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.      Following 208.4 +/- 85.5 days of LVAD support, both early and delayed H/M ratios       increased by 42.1% (P < 0.001) and 54.7% (P < 0.001), respectively. The W/O rate       decreased by 46% (P = 0.003). Plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine      decreased significantly in correlation with [(123)I]MIBG parameters. Ten patients      had recovered and had their device explanted as they had demonstrated a higher      percentage change in delayed H/M ratio, W/O rate, and norepinephrine levels.      Linear regression analysis revealed a strong correlation between percentage      changes in both norepinephrine and epinephrine and myocardial recovery.      CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with LVAD and drug resulted in enhancement of      [(123)I]MIBG uptake in DCM patients.FAU - George, Robert SAU  - George RSAD  - Heart Science Centre, Imperial College, London, UK.FAU - Birks, Emma JAU  - Birks EJFAU - Cheetham, AndrewAU  - Cheetham AFAU - Webb, CaroleAU  - Webb CFAU - Smolenski, Ryszad TAU  - Smolenski RTFAU - Khaghani, AsgharAU  - Khaghani AFAU - Yacoub, Magdi HAU  - Yacoub MHFAU - Kelion, AndrewAU  - Kelion ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130421PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595RN  - 0 (Catecholamines)RN  - 35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)SB  - IMMH  - 3-Iodobenzylguanidine/diagnostic useMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*physiopathology/radionuclide imaging/therapyMH  - Catecholamines/bloodMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart/*physiopathology/radionuclide imagingMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardium/*pathologyMH  - Sympathetic Nervous System/*physiopathology/radionuclide imagingOTO - NOTNLMOT  - MIBGOT  - Non-ischaemic cardiomyopathyOT  - Nuclear medicineOT  - Sympathetic innervationOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/04/24 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/07 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/24 06:00PHST- 2013/04/21 [aheadofprint]AID - hft059 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hft059 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2013 Sep;15(9):1035-43. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hft059.
