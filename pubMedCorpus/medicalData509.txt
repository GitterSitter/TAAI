METHODS: Between      February 2011 and August 2012, implantation of a VAD was performed in 10 children      of mean age 8.6 years. This retrospective review analyzed their perioperative      anesthetic care. RESULTS: All patients had end-stage heart failure due to dilated      cardiomyopathy. We used invasive arterial and central venous pressure monitoring       and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in conjunction with      intravenous administration of either ketamine (1 mg/kg) and midazolam (n = 3) or       thiopental (3-5 mg/kg; n = 7). The mean intraoperative fentanyl dose was 434 +/-       264.27 mug. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. Dopamine, dobutamine, and      epinephrine were infused in 8, 10, and 5 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric      oxide was administered to all patients. The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh      frozen plasma, and thrombocyte suspension transfusions were be 2.3 +/- 0.82      (range, 1-4), 1.6 +/- 0.69 (range, 1-3), and 2.4 +/- 1.42 (range, 0-4) units,      respectively. On average, patients were extubated 23 hours after arrival in the      intensive care unit and exited there on day 6. Six patients were successfully      bridged to heart transplantation, 2 died during the follow-up, and 2 patients      remain on VAD support. CONCLUSION: VAD is increasingly being used as a bridge to       heart transplantation in the pediatric population. Anesthesiologists must be      vigilant about the pathophysiology of heart failure, the operative procedure, and      the implanted device.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
