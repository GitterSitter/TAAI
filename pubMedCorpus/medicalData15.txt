While      there have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage      cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has      increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the       setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardium      also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to      its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets       of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to      summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery      following VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric      myocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients.      Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions of      their cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of information      about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to      determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or      just recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult gene      expression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40% of genes to be      oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.      These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling       specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical      strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Weia, Benjamin CAU  - Weia BCAD  - Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.FAU - Adachi, IkiAU  - Adachi IFAU - Jacot, Jeffrey GAU  - Jacot JGLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150410TA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Bridge to recoveryOT  - Gene expressionOT  - Heart failureOT  - Pediatric cardiomyopathyOT  - Reverse remodelingOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00AID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/aor.12451.
