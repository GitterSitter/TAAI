Further reductions in pump size, centrifugal design, and      intrapericardial positioning may reduce complications and improve outcomes.      METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a small, intrapericardially positioned,      continuous-flow centrifugal pump in patients requiring an implanted ventricular      assist device as a bridge to heart transplantation. The course of investigational      pump recipients was compared with that of patients implanted contemporaneously      with commercially available devices. The primary outcome, success, was defined as      survival on the originally implanted device, transplantation, or explantation for      ventricular recovery at 180 days and was evaluated for both noninferiority and      superiority. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of survival between groups       and functional and quality-of-life outcomes and adverse events in the      investigational device group. A total of 140 patients received the      investigational pump, and 499 patients received a commercially available pump      implanted contemporaneously. Success occurred in 90.7% of investigational pump      patients and 90.1% of controls, establishing the noninferiority of the      investigational pump (P<0.001; 15% noninferiority margin). At 6 months, median      6-minute walk distance improved by 128.5 m, and both disease-specific and global       quality-of-life scores improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: A small,      intrapericardially positioned, continuous-flow, centrifugal pump was noninferior       to contemporaneously implanted, commercially available ventricular assist      devices. Functional capacity and quality of life improved markedly, and the      adverse event profile was favorable. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:      http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
