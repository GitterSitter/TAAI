METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from patients receiving      the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device in the ADVANCE bridge to transplant (BTT)      trial and continued access protocol were reviewed. Of 382 consecutive patients      who completed follow-up between August 2008 and June 2013 (mean time on support      389 days, median 271 days), 262 (68.6%) underwent isolated HeartWare Ventricular       Assist Device implantation, 75 (19.6%) a concurrent valve procedure, and 45      (11.8%) concurrent nonvalvular procedures. Of the concurrent valve procedures, 56      were tricuspid, 13 aortic, and 6 mitral. Survival was similar between groups (79%      for concurrent valve procedures and 85% for HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device      only at 1 year; P=0.33). Concurrent valve procedures were also associated with      increased unadjusted early right heart failure (RHF). A multivariable analysis      for death and RHF (121 total events) identified female sex (odds ratio=2.0 [95%      confidence interval, 1.2-3.3; P=0.0053]) and preimplant tricuspid regurgitation      severity (odds ratio=2.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.8, P<0.0001]) as      independent predictors while concurrent tricuspid valve procedures (TVP) were not      predictors. Furthermore, patients with significant preimplant tricuspid      regurgitation who did not receive a TVP experienced an increased rate of late RHF      compared with those who received TVP (0.19 versus 0.05 events per patient-year,      respectively; P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HeartWare Ventricular Assist      Device alone, survival was equivalent for the concurrent valve procedure group.      Tricuspid regurgitation severity was the most important predictor of increased      postoperative RHF, and concurrent TVP was not an independent predictor of RHF      overall. Concurrent TVP may reduce the rate of late RHF for patients with      significant preimplant tricuspid insufficiency. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL:       http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
