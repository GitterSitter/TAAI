We      evaluated the association between serial measurements of CPCs and functional      capacity and outcomes in heart failure (HF). METHODS: We included 156 consecutive      consenting ambulatory HF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%). We       evaluated CPCs and functional capacity (peak VO2) every 6 months for up to 2      years. CPCs were measured as early-outgrowth colony-forming units (EO-CFUs) and      circulating CD34+, VEGFR2+ and/or CD133+ cells. We recorded mortality, HF      hospital admissions, transplant, and ventricular assist device. RESULTS: The mean      age was 55 +/- 15 years. A decrease in CD34+VEGFR2+ cells was independently      associated with increased functional capacity; a 10-cell decrease in CD34+VEGFR2+      cells was associated with an increase of 0.2 mL/kg/min in peak VO2 (P < 0.05). We      found an interaction effect (P = 0.02) between EO-CFUs and diabetes: in patients       without diabetes, a 10-EO-CFU increase was independently associated with      increased peak VO2 of 0.28 mL/kg/min (P = 0.01), and in patients with diabetes, a      decrease in EO-CFUs was associated with an increased peak VO2 (P < 0.05). Higher       EO-CFUs were associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95%      confidence interval, 0.09-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: We noted differential relations      between CPCs and outcomes in patients with vs without diabetes. Higher EO-CFUs      and lower CD34+VEGFR2+ cells were associated with improved functional capacity      and reduced mortality in nondiabetic patients. In patients with diabetes, lower      EO-CFUs were associated with improved functional capacity. The basis for these      differences requires further examination.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.
