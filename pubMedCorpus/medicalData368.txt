BACKGROUND: Conceptual and operational      definitions of QoL with an LVAD are lacking. METHODS: A grounded theory method      was used. Adult, outpatient LVAD recipients (n = 11) participated twice in      individual or paired interviews. RESULTS: A conceptual definition of QoL while      living with an LVAD was established as: "Being well enough to do and enjoy      day-to-day activities that are important to me." Participants described 5      important life domains consistent with QoL literature: physical, emotional,      social, cognitive, and spiritual/meaning. However, participants identified unique      concerns not addressed by generic or heart failure disease specific measures      typically used in the LVAD population. CONCLUSION: Existing generic and      heart-failure specific QoL measures are not adequate for understanding QoL among       LVAD patients. Cognition and spiritual/meaning domains were significant; these      need inclusion for comprehensive QoL assessment in the LVAD population.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
