The patient did not meet the criteria for heart      transplantation and declined left ventricular assist device implantation. We      decided to conduct cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D)      implantation. Under general anaesthesia for CRT-D implantation, cardiac function       worsened. Due to deteriorating haemodynamics, CRT-D implantation was aborted and       emergent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) implantation      was performed. Subsequent weaning from ECMO was not possible. We decided to      proceed with CRT-D implantation while still on ECMO support. With biventricular      stimulation, cardiac function improved promptly and the patient could be weaned      from ECMO the same day.FAU - Pecha, SimonAU  - Pecha SAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, University Heart Center Hamburg, Hamburg,      Germany. s.pecha@uke.deFAU - Yildirim, YalinAU  - Yildirim YFAU - Reichenspurner, HermannAU  - Reichenspurner HFAU - Deuse, TobiasAU  - Deuse TLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120730PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMCIN - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2012 Nov;15(5):923-4.
