However, non-optimal pumping speeds can reduce the efficacy of circulatory      support or cause dangerous ventricular arrhythmias. Optimal flow control for      continuous flow LVADs has not been defined and calls for an implantable pressure       sensor integrated with the LVAD for real-time feedback control of pump speed      based on ventricular pressure. A MEMS pressure sensor prototype is designed,      fabricated and seamlessly integrated with LVAD to enable real-time control,      optimize its performance and reduce its risks. The pressure sensing mechanism is       based on Fabry-Perot interferometer principle. A biocompatible parylene diaphragm      with a silicon mirror at the center is fabricated directly on the inlet shell of       the LVAD to sense pressure changes. The sensitivity, range and response time of      the pressure sensor are measured and validated to meet the requirements of LVAD      pressure sensing.FAU - Zhou, Ming-DaAU  - Zhou MDAD  - Department of Bioengineering and Material Research Institute, Pennsylvania State       University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.FAU - Yang, ChuanAU  - Yang CFAU - Liu, ZhiwenAU  - Liu ZFAU - Cysyk, Joshua PAU  - Cysyk JPFAU - Zheng, Si-YangAU  - Zheng SYLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Biomed MicrodevicesJT  - Biomedical microdevicesJID - 100887374SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - PressureEDAT- 2011/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2012/06/19 06:00CRDT- 2011/10/15 06:00AID - 10.1007/s10544-011-9601-z [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Biomed Microdevices. 2012 Feb;14(1):235-45. doi: 10.1007/s10544-011-9601-z.
