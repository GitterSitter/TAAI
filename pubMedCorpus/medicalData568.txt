During an acute critical event,      percutaneous devices are preferred because of their rapid deployment, since      implantable devices require more extensive procedures. Implantable devices are      used for patients with established end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart      transplantation, recovery or destination therapy. This report reviews mechanical       principles and clinical studies regarding percutaneous VAD to address their      potential renal effects. Since the focus of this study is set on devices that are      dedicated to cardiac support only, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems      are not included.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 S.
