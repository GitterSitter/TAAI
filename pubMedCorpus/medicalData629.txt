However, the anatomic and      physiologic consequences of long-term LVAD support have yet to be fully      clarified. Despite the clinical success of these devices, it has been reported      that many patients bridged to transplantation with mechanical support develop      circulating antibodies with potential donor reactivity. Transplanting against      existing or historic donor-specific antibodies is associated with increased risk       of antibody-mediated rejection, graft dysfunction, and decreased survival. Safe      transplantation of allosensitized patients is dependent on using prospective      crossmatching and antibody titer reduction techniques (desensitization). Strict      protocols requiring a negative prospective crossmatch before transplantation      result in a decreased donor pool and a longer duration of support in sensitized      LVAD recipients with increased inherent morbidity such as infections and      thromboembolic complications. The aim of this review is to present the current      state of knowledge of possible immunologic mechanisms involved in      alloimmunization of LVAD recipients, outline new methods of antibody detection,      compare various desensitization strategies, and present an overview of clinical      data assessing the impact of sensitization on posttransplantation outcome.FAU - Urban, MarianAU  - Urban MAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental      Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic. maub@ikem.czFAU - Gazdic, TomasAU  - Gazdic TFAU - Slimackova, EvaAU  - Slimackova EFAU - Pirk, JanAU  - Pirk JFAU - Szarszoi, OndrejAU  - Szarszoi OFAU - Maly, JiriAU  - Maly JFAU - Netuka, IvanAU  - Netuka ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (HLA Antigens)RN  - 0 (Isoantibodies)SB  - IMCIN - ASAIO J. 2012 Nov-Dec;58(6):548-9.
