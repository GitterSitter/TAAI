Although the Fontan      operation has created a generation of survivors of complex single-ventricle      disease, recognition of the limitation of this circulation is increasing. Most      commonly, survivors suffer from ventricular dysfunction, protein-losing      enteropathy, plastic bronchitis and arrhythmias. Although several medical      therapies exist to palliate these long-term complications, surgical treatments      are becoming increasingly useful, including the introduction of mechanical      devices and cardiac transplantation. Currently, there are a variety of options      available for mechanical support of the failing Fontan. Further developments in      mechanical support technology will be required to tailor-make specific devices      for this unique population. Owing to the fact that availability of donor hearts      for transplantation is limited, mechanical support will play an increasingly      important role in the management of complications of the Fontan circulation.FAU - Fuller, StephanieAU  - Fuller SAD  - Perelman School of Medicine, The Cardiac Center, Division of Cardiothoracic      Surgery, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania,      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Cardiol YoungJT  - Cardiology in the youngJID - 9200019SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - *Fontan ProcedureMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - ReoperationMH  - Treatment FailureEDAT- 2014/01/10 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/04 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/10 06:00AID - S1047951113001674 [pii]AID - 10.1017/S1047951113001674 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Cardiol Young. 2013 Dec;23(6):847-51. doi: 10.1017/S1047951113001674.
