post fartum depression 
The sense of let down after your cat, dog, or spouse does not recognize your fart with as much enthusiasm as you were feeling it deserved.

Pray punt 
To offer prayer as a concrete solution to a problem. To, literally, run the issue "up the ladder" and wait for God to figure it out, thereby relieving you of taking any real action.
I asked the director off my daughter's school if we could switch teachers. She smiled and told me she would pray about it. She totally pray punted the issue.

Office Hit List 
A list of people with whom you work and whom you would also like to murder. But you never would because you're not a murderer so it's an "office hit list" instead of just a regular hit list.
By the end of the week I had so many people on my office hit list that the entire company would be dead if I were actually a murderer. Good thing I'm not.
