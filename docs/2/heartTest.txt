Essential update: FDA approves I(f) "funny" current inhibitor for patients with worsening heart failure
In April 2015, the FDA approved ivabradine (Corlanor) to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or lower, who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 70 bpm or higher, and who are either on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use.[1, 2] This drug blocks the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel responsible for the cardiac pacemaker I(f) "funny" current, which regulates heart rate without any effect on ventricular repolarization or myocardial contractility.

Approval for ivabradine was based on the international, placebo-controlled SHIFT trial published in 2010, which randomized more than 6500 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV heart failure and an LVEF of 35% or lower.[1, 2] The trial saw a highly significant 18% drop in risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure over an average of 23 months in patients treated with ivabradine.

Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms of heart failure include the following:

Exertional dyspnea and/or dyspnea at rest
Orthopnea
Acute pulmonary edema
Chest pain/pressure and palpitations
Tachycardia
Fatigue and weakness
Nocturia and oliguria
Anorexia, weight loss, nausea
Exophthalmos and/or visible pulsation of eyes
Distention of neck veins
Weak, rapid, and thready pulse
Rales, wheezing
S 3 gallop and/or pulsus alternans
Increased intensity of P 2 heart sound
Hepatojugular reflux
Ascites, hepatomegaly, and/or anasarca
Central or peripheral cyanosis, pallor
See Clinical Presentation for more detail.

Diagnosis
Heart failure criteria, classification, and staging

The Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure consists of the concurrent presence of either 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria.[3]

Major criteria include the following:

Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
Weight loss of 4.5 kg in 5 days in response to treatment
Neck vein distention
Rales
Acute pulmonary edema
Hepatojugular reflux
S 3 gallop
Central venous pressure greater than 16 cm water
Circulation time of 25 seconds
Radiographic cardiomegaly
Pulmonary edema, visceral congestion, or cardiomegaly at autopsy
Minor criteria are as follows:

Nocturnal cough
Dyspnea on ordinary exertion
A decrease in vital capacity by one third the maximal value recorded
Pleural effusion
Tachycardia (rate of 120 bpm)
Bilateral ankle edema
The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system categorizes heart failure on a scale of I to IV,[4] as follows:

Class I: No limitation of physical activity
Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity
Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity
Class IV: Symptoms occur even at rest; discomfort with any physical activity
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) staging system is defined by the following 4 stages[5, 6] :

Stage A: High risk of heart failure but no structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure
Stage B: Structural heart disease but no symptoms of heart failure
Stage C: Structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure
Stage D: Refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions
Testing

The following tests may be useful in the initial evaluation for suspected heart failure[5, 7, 8] :

Complete blood count (CBC)
Urinalysis
Electrolyte levels
Renal and liver function studies
Fasting blood glucose levels
Lipid profile
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels
B-type natriuretic peptide levels
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
Electrocardiography
Chest radiography
2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography
Nuclear imaging [9]
Maximal exercise testing
Pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas
See Workup for more detail.

Management
Treatment includes the following:

Nonpharmacologic therapy: Oxygen and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, dietary sodium and fluid restriction, physical activity as appropriate, and attention to weight gain
Pharmacotherapy: Diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic agents, anticoagulants, beta blockers, and digoxin
Surgical options

Surgical treatment options include the following:

Electrophysiologic intervention
Revascularization procedures
Valve replacement/repair
Ventricular restoration
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
Ventricular assist devices
Heart transplantation
Total artificial heart
