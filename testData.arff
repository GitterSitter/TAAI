'\r\nWhat Is Heart Failure?\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart can\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\'s needs. In some cases, the heart can\'t fill with enough blood. In other cases, the heart can\'t pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems.\r\n\r\nThe term \"heart failure\" doesn\'t mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nHeart failure develops over time as the heart\'s pumping action grows weaker. The condition can affect the right side of the heart only, or it can affect both sides of the heart. Most cases involve both sides of the heart.\r\n\r\nRight-side heart failure occurs if the heart can\'t pump enough blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Left-side heart failure occurs if the heart can\'t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nRight-side heart failure may cause fluid to build up in the feet, ankles, legs, liver, abdomen, and the veins in the neck. Right-side and left-side heart failure also may cause shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness).\r\n\r\nThe leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart. Examples include coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\r\n\r\nOutlook\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a very common condition. About 5.1 million people in the United States have heart failure.\r\n\r\nBoth children and adults can have the condition, although the symptoms and treatments differ. This article focuses on heart failure in adults.\r\n\r\nCurrently, heart failure has no cure. However, treatments—such as medicines and lifestyle changes—can help people who have the condition live longer and more active lives. Researchers continue to study new ways to treat heart failure and its complications.',2

If your condition is serious and other treatments are not managing to improve things or control your symptoms, your cardiologist may send you to a heart transplant centre for a transplant assessment. \r\n\r\nHow do I know if I\'m eligible for a heart transplant?\r\nYour assessment will determine whether you need a transplant and whether you are suitable for one. Based on your assessment, you may be considered:\r\n\r\nsuitable for a transplant, in which case you will be put onto the transplant waiting list. This means you could be called for a transplant at any time.\r\nsuitable for a transplant, but the consultants do not think your condition is severe enough to warrant being put on the waiting list. If this happens your case will be reviewed regularly. If your condition gets worse, you will go on the waiting list.\r\nin need of further investigations or treatment. If your condition changes you can be assessed again.\r\nan unsuitable case for a heart transplant. This could be for a number of reasons. The transplant team will explain why you are not suitable and discuss how you can be treated further. You can also be referred to another centre for a second opinion.\r\nHow long is the wait for a heart transplant?\r\nIf you are considered suitable for a heart transplant you will be added to the transplant waiting list. Once you are on the list, a suitable heart may come along within a few days or it may take many months or even years.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, suitable hearts do not become available for everyone and only 8 out of 10 people receive the heart transplant they require. In the UK, adults and children can wait over a year for a transplant.\r\n\r\nWhat happens during a heart transplant operation?\r\nIllustration of a heart\r\nIt’s natural for you to feel excited, emotional or anxious about your surgery and life afterwards.\r\n\r\nRemember that a transplanted heart is no more than a new pump - it does not change your personality or behaviours.\r\n\r\nA heart transplant operation usually takes between four and six hours:\r\n\r\nAt the start of the procedure you’ll be given a general anaesthetic.\r\nThe surgeon will make a cut in your breastbone to get access to your heart.You will be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine which makes the blood circulate around your body.\r\nYour surgeon will then work on transplanting your new heart.\r\nWhen this is finished, they will start your heart beating again. When you heart begins to take over pumping and your condition is stable, the heart-lung machine will be turned off. \r\nThe surgeon will then close your breastbone with wire, which will stay there for the rest of your life.\r\nAfter the operation you will be moved to the intensive care unit. Most people wake the following day. You will be sedated and breathe with the help of a ventilator machine until you are able to breathe for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or if anything is worrying you, you can talk to your transplant team or call our Heart Helpline on 0300 330 3311.\r\n\r\nWhat happens after the transplant?\r\nMost people leave hospital within about four weeks of the operation, but depending on your condition, you may need to stay in hospital for longer.\r\n\r\nIn the first few months after your surgery you will need to spend a lot of time visiting the hospital – you might even need to stay near the transplant centre. Your transplant team will talk to you about practical arrangements for after your surgery.\r\n\r\nAlthough you will be weak after the operation, recovery can be very quick. It is important to build up your level of activity gradually. You should avoid activities involving lifting and pushing until your breastbone is fully healed, which can take up to three or four months.\r\n\r\nOnce you feel fit and able, you can start doing things like light vacuuming or light gardening.\r\n\r\nWhat is life like after a heart transplant?\r\nOnce you’ve recovered from surgery you should be able to return to a wide range of activities including driving, holidays and physical activity - some people are even able to go back to work. \r\n\r\nYou will need to take a number of medicines, including immunosuppressants, for the rest of your life.  Without them your body would rapidly recognise your new heart as ‘foreign’ and try to reject it.  This type of medicine can have side-effects which your doctor will discuss with you.\r\n\r\nMany people who have had a successful heart transplant go on to live long and healthy lives.  Over three-quarters of heart transplant patients live for over five years.\r\n\r\nWhere can I find out more?\r\nOur heart transplantation booklet talks in detail about heart transplantation and is for people who have had, or are waiting for, a heart transplant. It\'s also suitable for family and friends.\r\nThe NHS Blood and Transplant special health authority within the NHS provides support to transplantation services across the UK and makes sure that donated organs are matched and used in a fair way. They also provide information and statistics on heart and other transplants.\r\nDo you want to help find donor hearts?\r\nDid you know that on average, three people die every day in the UK whilst waiting for an organ transplant? That\'s 1,000 people a year, dying due to a shortage of donor organs. 9 out of 10 people say they support organ donation but only 3 in 10 actually go on to sign the register.\r\n\r\nYou can help by signing up to the NHS Organ Donation Register, and spreading the word to your family and friends. This is a register for anyone who wants to donate their heart or other organs.\r\n\r\nWant to know more?\r\nOrder or download our publications:\r\n\r\n \t \r\n      \r\nSkip to top\r\nFIGHT FOR EVERY HEARTBEAT\r\nOur privacy and cookies policy\r\nTerms and conditions\r\nWork for us\r\nContact us\r\nSign up for email updates\r\nLog in\r\nFooterLogo\r\n  \r\nBritish Heart Foundation is a registered Charity No. 225971.
