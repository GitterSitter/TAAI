Suck in, declares the latest audit from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps), for 2013 recorded a 41% rise in liposuction procedures.

According to Baaps, there were 50,122 surgical procedures performed in 2013 - a rise of 17% on average since 2012. The association represents one in three cosmetic surgeons in the UK.

The audit which highlights an "impressive double-digit rise in all cosmetic procedures", reports that not a single individual procedure saw a decrease on the year - a trend it claims has not been seen since pre-recession.

Breast augmentation (otherwise known as 'boob jobs') remained the most popular procedure overall. Denis Campbell writes today:

Demand [for cosmetic surgery] grew despite the scandal over potentially hazardous PIP breast implants and grew by levels unseen since before the recession began in 2008.

Breast enlargement remains the most popular procedure, with 11,135 augmentations performed in 2013 – up 13% year-on-year – according to figures collected by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS).

But the biggest increase on the year was for liposuction. A total of 4,326 liposuction procedures were performed last year - an increase of 41% on the year. It was the sixth most popular procedure among women and the fourth most popular among men.

The Baaps credit the rise in liposuction with a possible backlash against non-surgical treatments for body contouring, claiming that patients may have found these "less effective than advertised." Rajiv Grover, consultant plastic surgeon and president of the Bapps said:

The continued double digit rise of cosmetic surgery underlines the fact that whether it is breast augmentation or antiageing procedures like facelifting the public are choosing tried and tested surgical methods rather than the magical-sounding quick fixes that fail to deliver promised results.

The Baaps data does not include non-surgical "lunchtime" cosmetic procedures, such as botox injections.

According to the review of the regulation of cosmetic interventions by the Department of Health in 2013, the value of UK cosmetic procedures was worth £2.3bn in 2010 and is estimated to rise to £3.6bn by 2015. The report also stated that non-surgical procedures account for nine out of ten procedures and 75% of the market value.

Although the Baaps figures only include surgical procedures, these still provide an interesting insight into cosmetic surgery trends. We've picked out some of the key numbers from its 2013 audit below.

Women
In the UK, women accounted for 90.5% of all cosmetic procedures in 2013 with a total of 45,365 procedures.

Breast augmentation was the most popular with 11,123 surgical procedures carried out in 2013 - a rise of 13% on the previous year. Blepharoplasty (eyelid ops) were the second most popular cosmetic procedure followed by face or neck lifts in third place.

Liposuction procedures saw the biggest increase - 3,772 procedures were performed in 2013 (an increase of 43% since 2012). Although none of the top ten surgical procedures for women recorded a decrease, some did see a slight decline in popularity; abdominoplasty dropped from sixth most popular in 2012 to seventh in 2013 and fat transfer procedures have dropped from seventh place to eighth.

Men
Men had 9.5% of all cosmetic procedures in 2013 with a total of 4,757 in total - a rise of 16% on 2012.

Rhinoplasty was the most popular with 1,037 surgical procedures carried out last year. Eyelid ops were the second most popular procedure for men in 2013, followed by breast reduction.

Liposuction procedures saw the biggest rise with a 28% increase on 2012. 554 men opted for liposuction last year according to the Bapps data. Although none of the top ten surgical procedures for men saw a decrease in numbers, otoplasty (ear correction) dropped from fourth most popular procedure for more men to fifth.

The downloadable spreadsheet has the Bapps data going back to 2008.

10,000 boob jobs a year? That seems insane. What percentage of the population have had 'work done', I wonder . . .
