The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat.[1] Most beer is also flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called brewing.\r\n\r\nBeer is the world\'s most widely consumed alcoholic beverage,[2] and is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[3] It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage.[4][5][6][7]\r\n\r\nSome of humanity\'s earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.[9][10] Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.\r\n\r\nThe strength of beer is usually around 4\% to 6\% alcohol by volume (abv) although it may vary between 0.5\% (de-alcoholized) and 20\%, with some breweries creating examples of 40\% abv and above in recent years.\r\n\r\nBeer forms part of the culture of beer-drinking nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n2 Brewing\r\n3 Ingredients\r\n3.1 Water\r\n3.2 Starch source\r\n3.3 Hops\r\n3.4 Yeast\r\n3.5 Clarifying agent\r\n4 Production and trade\r\n4.1 International breweries\r\n5 Varieties\r\n6 Measurement\r\n6.1 Colour\r\n6.2 Strength\r\n7 Serving\r\n7.1 Draught\r\n7.2 Packaging\r\n7.3 Temperature\r\n7.4 Vessels\r\n8 Beer and society\r\n8.1 Health effects\r\n9 Nutritional information\r\n10 Related beverages\r\n11 Chemistry\r\n12 See also\r\n13 References\r\n14 Bibliography\r\n15 Further reading\r\nHistory\r\nMain article: History of beer\r\n\r\nEgyptian wooden model of beer making in ancient Egypt, Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, San Jose, California\r\n\r\nWilliam Hogarth, Beer Street, 1751. Brooklyn Museum\r\nBeer is one of the world\'s oldest prepared beverages, possibly dating back to the early Neolithic or 9500 BC, when cereal was first farmed,[11] and is recorded in the written history of ancient Iraq and ancient Egypt.[12] Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilizations.[13]\r\n\r\nThe earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa 3500–3100 BC from the site of Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran.[14][15] Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess Ninkasi, known as \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\",[16] which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people,[9][10] and the ancient advice (Fill your belly. Day and night make merry) to Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh, by the ale-wife Siduri may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer.[17] The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC.[18] A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike sake, mold was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting.[19][20]\r\n\r\nAlmost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It is likely that many cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch, independently invented beer. Bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilizations.[21][22][23][24]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Café by Édouard Manet\r\nBeer was spread through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes as far back as 3000 BC,[25] and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.[26] The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs.[27] What they did not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot[28] and again in 1067 by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen.[29]\r\n\r\nIn 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, adopted the Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality regulation still in use in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt.[30] Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century.[31] The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.\r\n\r\nToday, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.[32] As of 2006, more than 133 billion liters (35 billion gallons), the equivalent of a cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion).[33]\r\n\r\nIn 2010, China\'s beer consumption hit 450 million hectoliters (45 billion liters) or nearly twice that of the United States but only 5 percent sold were Premium draught beers, compared with 50 percent in France and Germany.[34]\r\n\r\nBrewing\r\nMain article: Brewing\r\n\r\nA 16th-century brewery\r\nThe process of making beer is known as brewing. A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the USA in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.[35]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagram illustrating the process of brewing beerHot Water TankMash TunMaltHopsCopperHopbackAdd Yeast to\r\nFermenterHeat\r\nexchangerBottlingCask or Keg\r\nThe first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as \"mashing\". Hot water (known as \"liquor\" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as \"grist\") in a mash tun.[36] The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours,[37] during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as \"sparging\". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.[38]\r\n\r\nMost modern breweries use a continuous sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.[39]\r\n\r\nThe sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle, or \"copper\", (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper)[40] and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage. Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.[41]\r\n\r\nAfter boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.[42]\r\n\r\nFermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity.[43] When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.[44]\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n\r\nMalted barley before roasting\r\nThe basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer\'s yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops.[45] A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley.[46] Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others.[47] The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.\r\n\r\nWater\r\n\r\nCsíki beer - brewed with the water of the Carpathian Highlands\r\nBeer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character.[48] For example, Dublin has hard water well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness; while the Plzeň Region has soft water well-suited to making Pilsner (pale lager), such as Pilsner Urquell.[48] The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.[49]\r\n\r\nStarch source\r\nMain articles: Malt and Mash ingredients\r\nThe starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars.[50] Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.[51]\r\n\r\nNearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.[52]\r\n\r\nHops\r\nMain article: Hops\r\n\r\nHop cone in a Hallertau, Germany, hop yard\r\nFlavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops.[53] The flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. The flowers themselves are often called \"hops\".\r\n\r\nThe first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie,[31][54] though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century.[31][54] Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, Glechoma hederacea. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used.[55] Some beers today, such as Fraoch\' by the Scottish Heather Ales company[56] and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company,[57] use plants other than hops for flavouring.\r\n\r\nHops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer\'s yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in \"head retention\",[58][59] the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.[60][61]\r\n\r\nYeast\r\nMain articles: Brewer\'s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum\r\nYeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thereby turns wort into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.[62]\r\n\r\nThe dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the top-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottom-fermenting Saccharomyces uvarum.[63] Brettanomyces ferments lambics,[64] and Torulaspora delbrueckii ferments Bavarian weissbier.[65]\r\n\r\nBefore the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts. A few styles such as lambics rely on this method today, but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures.[66]\r\n\r\nClarifying agent\r\nMain article: Finings\r\nSee also: Vegetarianism and beer\r\nSome brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.[67]\r\n\r\nExamples of clarifying agents include isinglass, obtained from swimbladders of fish; Irish moss, a seaweed; kappa carrageenan, from the seaweed Kappaphycus cottonii; Polyclar (artificial); and gelatin.[68] If a beer is marked \"suitable for Vegans\", it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents.[69]\r\n\r\nProduction and trade\r\n\r\nAnnual beer consumption per capita by country\r\n\r\nBanner of a Microbrewery in the Franconian Switzerland, Germany\r\nThe Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.[70] The oldest brewery with discontinuous production is the Břevnov Monastery in the Czech Republic, which was founded in 993.\r\n\r\nThe brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.[32] More than 133 billion liters (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) as of 2006.[33]\r\n\r\nA microbrewery, or craft brewery, is a modern brewery which produces a limited amount of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year.[71] A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment.\r\n\r\nThe highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries.[72][73]\r\n\r\nBrewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries. Restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963,[74] Australia followed suit in 1972,[75] and the USA in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.[76]\r\n\r\nInternational breweries\r\nSince the globalisation of the beer market near the end of the 20th century, becoming the largest brewery has been a game of merging with and overtaking other large breweries.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the foundation of South African Breweries bought the North American Miller Brewing Company to found SABMiller, becoming the second largest brewery, after North American Anheuser-Bush.\r\nIn 2004, the Belgian Interbrew was the third largest brewery by volume and the Brazilian AmBev was the fifth largest. They merged into InBev, becoming the largest brewery.\r\nIn 2007, SABMiller surpassed InBev and Anheuser-Bush when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand Grolsch in 2007.[77]\r\nIn 2008, InBev (the second-largest) bought Anheuser-Busch (the third largest), the new Anheuser-Busch InBev company became again the largest brewer in the world.[78]\r\nCurrently, AB InBev is still the largest brewery, with a second place for SABMiller and a third place for Heineken International.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeer Imports by Nation.

From MIT/Harvard MIT/Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity\r\nVarieties\r\nMain article: Beer style\r\n\r\nKriek, a variety of beer brewed with cherries\r\nWhile there are many types of beer brewed, the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries.[79] The traditional European brewing regions—Germany, Belgium, England and the Czech Republic—have local varieties of beer.[80]\r\n\r\nEnglish writer Michael Jackson, in his 1977 book The World Guide To Beer, categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names.[81] Fred Eckhardt furthered Jackson\'s work in The Essentials of Beer Style in 1989.\r\n\r\n\r\nCask ale hand pumps with pump clips detailing the beers and their breweries\r\nTop-fermented beers are most commonly produced with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a top-fermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface,[82] typically between 15 and 24 °C (60 and 75 °F). At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result is often a beer with slightly \"fruity\" compounds resembling apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or prune, among others.[83]\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of hops into England from the Netherlands in the 15th century, the names \"ale\" and \"beer\" were exclusively applied to unhopped fermented beverages, the term beer being gradually shifted to describe a brew with an infusion of hops.[84]\r\n\r\nThe word ale comes from Old English ealu (plural ealoþ), in turn from Proto-Germanic *alu (plural *aluþ), ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European base *h₂elut-, which holds connotations of \"sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication\".[85][86][87] The word beer comes from Old English bēor, from Proto-Germanic *beuzą, probably from Proto-Indo-European *bʰeusóm, originally \"brewer\'s yeast, beer dregs\", although other theories have been provided connecting the word with Old English bēow, \"barley\", or Latin bibere, \"to drink\".[88][89] On the currency of two words for the same thing in the Germanic languages, the 12th-century Old Icelandic poem Alvíssmál says, \"Ale it is called among men, but among the gods, beer.\"[90]\r\n\r\nReal ale is the term coined by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) in 1973[91] for \"beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide\". It is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers.\r\n\r\nPale Ale\r\nPale ale is a beer which uses a top-fermenting yeast[92] and predominantly pale malt. It is one of the world\'s major beer styles.\r\n\r\nStout\r\nStout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, dry stout, and Imperial stout. The name Porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of London.[93] This same beer later also became known as stout, though the word stout had been used as early as 1677.[94] The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.[95]\r\n\r\nMild\r\nMild ale has a predominantly malty palate. It is usually dark coloured with an abv of 3\% to 3.6\%, although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching 6\% abv and higher.\r\n\r\nWheat\r\nWheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley. Wheat beers are usually top-fermented (in Germany they have to be by law).[96] The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.\r\n\r\nLager\r\nLager is the English name for cool fermenting beers of Central European origin. Pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world. The name \"lager\" comes from the German \"lagern\" for \"to store\", as brewers around Bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months. These brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment, and to also clear of sediment, when stored in cool conditions.[97]\r\n\r\nLager yeast is a cool bottom-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) and typically undergoes primary fermentation at 7–12 °C (45–54 °F) (the fermentation phase), and then is given a long secondary fermentation at 0–4 °C (32–39 °F) (the lagering phase). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts, resulting in a \"cleaner\"-tasting beer.[98]\r\n\r\nModern methods of producing lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager (now known as Vienna lager), probably of amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.\r\n\r\nLambic\r\nLambic, a beer of Belgium, is naturally fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many of these are not strains of brewer\'s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as Lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.[99]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamous Bastar Beer prepared from Caryota urens\r\nMeasurement\r\nMain article: Beer measurement\r\nBeer is measured and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived bitterness is measured by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the European Brewery Convention.[100] The international scale was a development of the European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.[101]\r\n\r\nColour\r\n\r\nPaulaner dunkel – a dark lager\r\nBeer colour is determined by the malt.[102] The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with coke. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it was not until around 1703 that the term pale ale was used.[103][104]\r\n\r\nIn terms of sales volume, most of today\'s beer is based on the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic.[105] The modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5\%. The Pilsner Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.\r\n\r\nDark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.[106][107]\r\n\r\nStrength\r\nSee also: Beer measurement § By strength\r\nBeer ranges from less than 3\% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14\% abv, though this strength can be increased to around 20\% by re-pitching with champagne yeast,[108] and to 55\% abv by the freeze-distilling process.[109] The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style.[110] The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4–6\%, with a typical abv of 5\%.[111] The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4\% abv.[112] Some beers, such as table beer are of such low alcohol content (1\%–4\%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.[113]\r\n\r\nThe alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily \"light\" beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12\% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.\r\n\r\nStrongest beer\r\nThe strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the 20th century. Vetter 33, a 10.5\% abv (33 degrees Plato, hence Vetter \"33\") doppelbock, was listed in the 1994 Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest beer at that time,[114][115] though Samichlaus, by the Swiss brewer Hürlimann, had also been listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest at 14\% abv.[116][117][118] Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. Samuel Adams reached 20\% abv with Millennium,[108] and then surpassed that amount to 25.6\% abv with Utopias. The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz\'s Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23\% abv beer.[119][120] In September 2011, the Scottish brewery BrewDog produced Ghost Deer, which, at 28\%, they claim to be the world\'s strongest beer produced by fermentation alone.[121]\r\n\r\nThe product claimed to be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu\'s 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5\%.[122][123] It was preceded by The End of History, a 55\% Belgian ale,[109] made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had previously made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41\% abv IPA,[124] and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32\% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached,[125][126] a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer.[127] The German brewery Schorschbräu\'s Schorschbock, a 31\% abv eisbock,[128][129][130] and Hair of the Dog\'s Dave, a 29\% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method.[131] A 60\% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.[132][133]\r\n\r\nServing\r\nDraught\r\nMain articles: Draught beer, Keg beer and Cask ale\r\n\r\nDraught beer keg fonts at the Délirium Café in Brussels\r\nDraught beer from a pressurised keg is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, Guinness introduced the beer widget, a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system.[134] The words draft and draught can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised.\r\n\r\n\r\nA selection of cask beers\r\nCask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed \"real ale\" by the CAMRA organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a \"stillage\" which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between 11–13 °C or 52–55 °F),[135] before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to \"drop\" (clear) again, as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being \"gravity-fed\" directly into the glass.\r\n\r\nDraught beer\'s environmental impact can be 68\% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences.[136][137] A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, shows that the CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds).[138] The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer is estimated to be 2.5 square meters (26 square feet).[139] Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45\% of a bottled micro-brew beer\'s CO2 emissions.[138] Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption.[140]\r\n\r\nPackaging\r\nMain articles: Beer bottle and Beverage can\r\n\r\nAssortment of beer bottles\r\nMost beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans.[141] However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast.[142] It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90\% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.\r\n\r\nMany beers are sold in cans, though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden in 2001, 63.9\% of beer was sold in cans.[143] People either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass. A recent technology developed by Crown Holdings for the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the \'full aperture\' can, so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process, turning the can into a drinking cup.[144] Cans protect the beer from light (thereby preventing \"skunked\" beer) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles. Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer, then became commonly associated with less expensive, mass-produced beers, even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles.[145] Plastic (PET) bottles are used by some breweries.[146]\r\n\r\nTemperature\r\n\r\nÉdouard Manet\'s The Waitress showing a woman serving beer\r\nThe temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinker\'s experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength pale ale to be served cool, while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature.[147]\r\n\r\nBeer writer Michael Jackson proposed a five-level scale for serving temperatures: well chilled (7 °C or 45 °F) for \"light\" beers (pale lagers); chilled (8 °C or 46 °F) for Berliner Weisse and other wheat beers; lightly chilled (9 °C or 48 °F) for all dark lagers, altbier and German wheat beers; cellar temperature (13 °C or 55 °F) for regular British ale, stout and most Belgian specialities; and room temperature (15.5 °C or 60 °F) for strong dark ales (especially trappist beer) and barley wine.[148]\r\n\r\nDrinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the 1870s, was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager.[149] Chilling beer makes it more refreshing,[150] though below 15.5 °C the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness[151] and reduces it significantly below 10 °C (50 °F).[152] Beer served unchilled—either cool or at room temperature, reveal more of their flavours. Cask Marque, a non-profit UK beer organisation, has set a temperature standard range of 12°–14 °C (53°–57 °F) for cask ales to be served.[153]\r\n\r\nVessels\r\nMain article: Beer glassware\r\nBeer is consumed out of a variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can. The shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style.[154] Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales.[155]\r\n\r\nThe pouring process has an influence on a beer\'s presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.[156]\r\n\r\nA beer tower is a beer dispensing device usually found in bars and pub that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel.\r\n\r\nBeer and society\r\n\r\nA tent at Munich\'s Oktoberfest—the world\'s largest beer festival\r\nSee also: Category:Beer culture\r\nIn most societies, beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; visiting a series of pubs in one evening; joining an organisation such as CAMRA; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer.[157] Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular.[158] A relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.\r\n\r\nBeer is considered to be a social lubricant in many societies[159][160] and is consumed in countries all over the world. There are breweries in Middle Eastern countries such as Iran and Syria, and in African countries. Sales of beer are four times those of wine, which is the second most popular alcoholic beverage.[161]\r\n\r\nA study published in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.[162]\r\n\r\nSome breweries have developed beers to pair with food.[163][164][165][166] Wine writer Malcolm Gluck disputed the need to pair beer with food, while beer writers Roger Protz and Melissa Cole contested that claim.[167][168][169]\r\n\r\nHealth effects\r\nMain article: Long-term effects of alcohol\r\nThe main active ingredient of beer is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to beer. The moderate consumption of alcohol, including beer, is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and cognitive decline.[170][171][172][173] The long term health effects of continuous, heavy alcohol consumption can, however, include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview of possible long-term effects of ethanol. Click to enlarge.\r\nBrewer\'s yeast is known to be a rich source of nutrients; therefore, as expected, beer can contain significant amounts of nutrients, including magnesium, selenium, potassium, phosphorus, biotin, chromium and B vitamins. In fact, beer is sometimes referred to as \"liquid bread\".[174] Some sources maintain that filtered beer loses much of its nutrition.[175]\r\n\r\nA 2005 Japanese study found that low alcohol beer may possess strong anti-cancer properties.[176] Another study found nonalcoholic beer to mirror the cardiovascular benefits associated with moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages.[177] However, much research suggests that the primary health benefit from alcoholic beverages comes from the alcohol they contain.[178]\r\n\r\nIt is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A recent study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself.[179] Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.[180]\r\n\r\nNutritional information\r\nBeers vary greatly in their nutritional content.[181]\r\n\r\nNutritional information of different beers\r\n(serving size 12 oz/355ml)\r\n Beer Brand \t Carbs (g) \t Alcohol \t Calories \r\n Budweiser Select 55 \t 1.8\t 2.4\%\t 55\t\r\n Coors Light \t 5\t 4.2\%\t 102\t\r\n Guinness Draught \t 10\t 4\%\t 126\t\r\n Sierra Nevada Bigfoot \t 30.3\t 9.6\%\t 330\t\r\nRelated beverages\r\nSee also: Category:Types of beer\r\nAround the world, there are a number of traditional and ancient starch-based beverages classed as beer. In Africa, there are various ethnic beers made from sorghum or millet, such as Oshikundu[182] in Namibia and Tella in Ethiopia.[183] Kyrgyzstan also has a beer made from millet; it is a low alcohol, somewhat porridge-like drink called \"Bozo\".[184] Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet and Sikkim also use millet in Chhaang, a popular semi-fermented rice/millet drink in the eastern Himalayas.[185] Further east in China are found Huangjiu and Choujiu—traditional rice-based beverages related to beer.\r\n\r\nThe Andes in South America has Chicha, made from germinated maize (corn); while the indigenous peoples in Brazil have Cauim, a traditional beverage made since pre-Columbian times by chewing manioc so that an enzyme (amylase) present in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars;[186] this is similar to Masato in Peru.[187]\r\n\r\nSome beers which are made from bread, which is linked to the earliest forms of beer, are Sahti in Finland, Kvass in Russia and Ukraine, and Bouza in Sudan.\r\n\r\nChemistry\r\nBeer contains the phenolic acids 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid. Alkaline hydrolysis experiments show that the most of the phenolic acids are present as bound forms and only a small portion can be detected as free compounds.[188]\r\n\r\nHops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen.[189] Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.[190]\r\n\r\nBarley, in the form of malt, brings the condensed tannins prodelphinidins B3, B9 and C2.\r\n\r\nTryptophol, tyrosol and phenylethanol are aromatic higher alcohols found in beer[191] as secondary products of alcoholic fermentation[192] (products also known as congeners) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nPortal icon\tBeer portal\r\nPortal icon\tDrink portal\r\nPortal icon\tCulture portal\r\nPortal icon\tWine portal\r\nBeer and breweries by region\r\nList of barley-based beverages\r\nList of beverages\r\nList of microbreweries\r\nSeasonal beer\r\n'
beer1.txt,'\r\nBrewery\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\n\r\nKettles in a modern Trappist brewery\r\nA brewery is a building used to make beer, though beer can be made at home, and has been for much of beer\'s history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of size in breweries is matched by the diversity of processes, degrees of automation, and kinds of beer produced in breweries. A brewery is typically divided into distinct sections, with each section reserved for one part of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n1.1 The industrialization of the brewery\r\n1.2 Major technological advances\r\n2 The modern brewery\r\n3 Brewing process\r\n3.1 Fermenting\r\n3.2 Conditioning\r\n3.3 Filtering\r\n3.4 Filling\r\n4 Brewing companies\r\n4.1 Largest brewing companies\r\n4.2 Gypsy brewery\r\n5 See also\r\n6 References\r\n7 Further reading\r\n8 External links\r\nHistory[edit]\r\n\r\nA 16th-century brewery.\r\nSee also: History of beer\r\nThe oldest, still functional, brewery in the world is believed to be the German state-owned Weihenstephan brewery in the city of Freising, Bavaria. It can trace its history back to 1040 AD (this is disputed by the nearby Weltenburg Abbey brewery, who can trace back its beer-brewing tradition to at least 1050 AD, claiming the Weihenstephan document is at least controversial. The Žatec brewery in the Czech Republic claims it can prove that it paid a beer tax in 1004 AD).\r\n\r\nThe industrialization of the brewery[edit]\r\nBeer, in some form, can be traced back almost 5000 years to Mesopotamian writings describing daily rations of beer and bread to workers. Before the rise of production breweries, the production of beer took place at home and was the domain of women, as baking and brewing were seen as \"women\'s work\". Breweries, as production facilities reserved for making beer, did not emerge until monasteries and other Christian institutions started producing beer not only for their own consumption but also to use as payment. This industrialization of brewing shifted the responsibility of making beer to men.\r\n\r\nEarly breweries were almost always built on multiple stories, with equipment on higher floors used earlier in the production process, so that gravity could assist with the transfer of product from one stage to the next. This layout often is preserved in breweries today, but mechanical pumps allow more flexibility in brewery design.\r\n\r\nEarly breweries typically used large copper vats in the brewhouse, and fermentation and packaging took place in lined wooden containers. Such breweries were common until the Industrial Revolution, when better materials became available, and scientific advances led to a better understanding of the brewing process. Today, almost all brewery equipment is made of stainless steel.\r\n\r\nMajor technological advances[edit]\r\n\r\n19th century brewery installations\r\nA handful of major breakthroughs have led to the modern brewery and its ability to produce the same beer consistently.\r\n\r\nThe steam engine, vastly improved in 1775 by James Watt, brought automatic stirring mechanisms and pumps into the brewery. It gave brewers the ability to mix liquids more reliably while heating, particularly the mash, to prevent scorching, and a quick way to transfer liquid from one container to another. Almost all breweries now use electric-powered stirring mechanisms and pumps. The steam engine also allowed the brewer to make greater quantities of beer, as human power was no longer a limiting factor in moving and stirring.\r\n\r\nCarl von Linde, along with others, is credited with developing the refrigeration machine in 1871. Refrigeration allowed beer to be produced year-round, and always at the same temperature. Yeast is very sensitive to temperature, and, if a beer were produced during summer, the yeast would impart unpleasant flavors onto the beer. Most brewers would produce enough beer during winter to last through the summer, and store it in underground cellars, or even caves, to protect it from summer\'s heat.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of microbes by Louis Pasteur was instrumental in the control of fermentation. The idea that yeast was a microorganism that worked on wort to produce beer led to the isolation of a single yeast cell by Emil Christian Hansen. Pure yeast cultures allow brewers to pick out yeasts for their fermentation characteristics, including flavor profiles and fermentation ability. Some breweries in Belgium, however, still rely on \"spontaneous\" fermentation for their beers (see lambic).\r\n\r\nThe modern brewery[edit]\r\n\r\nThis section does not cite any references or sources.

(April 2012)\r\nFile:Spendrup Vårby 2013.webm\r\nA visit in \"Spendrups bryggeri\" in Stockholm.\r\nBreweries today are made predominantly of stainless steel, although vessels often have a decorative copper cladding for a nostalgic look. Stainless steel has many favorable characteristics that make it a well-suited material for brewing equipment. It imparts no flavor in beer, it reacts with very few chemicals, which means almost any cleaning solution can be used on it (concentrated chlorine [bleach] being a notable exception) and it is very sturdy. Sturdiness is important, as most tanks in the brewery have positive pressure applied to them as a matter of course, and it is not unusual that a vacuum will be formed incidentally during cleaning.\r\n\r\nHeating in the brewhouse usually is achieved through pressurized steam, although direct-fire systems are not unusual in small breweries. Likewise, cooling in other areas of the brewery is typically done by cooling jackets on tanks, which allow the brewer to control precisely the temperature on each tank individually, although whole-room cooling is also common.\r\n\r\nToday, modern brewing plants perform myriad analyses on their beers for quality control purposes. Shipments of ingredients are analyzed to correct for variations. Samples are pulled at almost every step and tested for [oxygen] content, unwanted microbial infections, and other beer-aging compounds. A representative sample of the finished product often is stored for months for comparison, when complaints are received.\r\n\r\nBrewing process[edit]\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the Karlsruhe Moninger brewery, Germany. An old boil kettle has been placed outside as decoration.\r\nMain article: Brewing\r\nBrewing is typically divided into 9 steps: milling, malting, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and filling.\r\n\r\nMashing is the process of mixing milled, usually malted, grain with water, and heating it with rests at certain temperatures to allow enzymes in the malt to break down the starches in the grain into sugars, especially maltose.\r\n\r\nLautering is the separation of the extracts won during mashing from the spent grain to create wort. It is achieved in either a lauter tun, a wide vessel with a false bottom, or a mash filter, a plate-and-frame filter designed for this kind of separation. Lautering has two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract that remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water.\r\n\r\nBoiling the wort ensures its sterility, helping to prevent contamination with undesirable microbes. During the boil, hops are added, which contribute aroma and flavor compounds to the beer, especially their characteristic bitterness. Along with the heat of the boil, they cause proteins in the wort to coagulate and the pH of the wort to fall, and they inhibit the later growth of certain bacteria. Finally, the vapors produced during the boil volatilize off-flavors, including dimethyl sulfide precursors.\r\n\r\nThe boil must be conducted so that it is even and intense. The boil lasts between 60 and 120 minutes, depending on its intensity, the hop addition schedule, and volume of wort the brewer expects to evaporate.\r\n\r\nFermenting[edit]\r\n\r\nRoyal Brewery in Moss Side, Manchester, UK, with steel fermentation vessels.\r\nFermentation begins as soon as yeast is added to the cooled wort. This is also the point at which the product is first called beer. It is during this stage that fermentable sugars won from the malt (maltose, maltotriose, glucose, fructose and sucrose) are metabolized into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation tanks come in many shapes and sizes, from enormous cylindroconical vessels that can look like storage silos, to five-gallon glass carboys used by homebrewers.\r\n\r\nMost breweries today use cylindroconical vessels (CCVs), which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone\'s aperture is typically around 70°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow smoothly out through the cone\'s apex at the end of fermentation, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids have fallen to the cone\'s apex can be simply flushed out through a port at the apex.\r\n\r\nOpen fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, making it easy to harvest top-fermenting yeasts. The open tops of the vessels increase the risk of contamination, but proper cleaning procedures help to control the risk.\r\n\r\nFermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. Simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends are arranged vertically, and conditioning tanks are usually laid out horizontally. A very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation but wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched often, perhaps yearly.\r\n\r\nAfter high kräusen, the point at which fermentation is most active and copious foam is produced, a valve known in German as the spundapparat may be put on the tanks to allow the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer. This bung device can regulate the pressure to produce different types of beer; greater pressure produces a more carbonated beer.\r\n\r\nConditioning[edit]\r\nWhen the sugars in the fermenting beer have been almost completely digested, the fermentation process slows and the yeast cells begin to die and settle at the bottom of the tank. At this stage, especially if the beer is cooled to around freezing, most of the remaining live yeast cells will quickly become dormant and settle, along with the heavier protein chains, due simply to gravity and molecular dehydration.\r\n\r\nConditioning can occur in fermentation tanks with cooling jackets. If the whole fermentation cellar is cooled, conditioning must be done in separate tanks in a separate cellar.\r\n\r\nSome beers are conditioned only lightly, or not at all. An active yeast culture from an ongoing batch may be added to the next boil after a slight chilling in order to produce fresh and highly palatable beer in mass quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hook Norton Brewery is one of Britain\'s last working tower breweries\r\nFiltering[edit]\r\nFiltering the beer stabilizes flavor and gives it a polished, shiny look. It is an optional process. Many craft brewers simply remove the coagulated and settled solids and forgo active filtration.\r\n\r\nIn localities where a tax assessment is collected by government pursuant to local laws, any additional filtration may be done using an active filtering system, the filtered product finally passing into a calibrated vessel for measurement just after any cold conditioning and prior to final packaging.\r\n\r\nFilters come in many types. Many use pre-made filtration media such as sheets or candles. Kieselguhr, a fine powder of diatomaceous earth, can be introduced into the beer and circulated through screens to form a filtration bed. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filters remove yeasts and other solids, leaving some cloudiness, while finer filters can remove body and color. Sterile filters remove almost all microorganisms.\r\n\r\nFilling[edit]\r\nFilling or \"packaging\" is the process of putting the beer into the containers for shipment or sale. It can be bottling or canning, or filling of kegs or bulk tanks.\r\n\r\nBrewing companies[edit]\r\n\r\nThis section has an unclear citation style. The references used may be made clearer with a different or consistent style of citation, footnoting, or external linking. (June 2013)\r\n\r\nBrewery promotion, Salt Lake City, 1912\r\nBrewing companies range widely in the volume and variety of beer produced, ranging from small breweries, such as Ringwood Brewery, to massive multinational conglomerates, like SABMiller in London or Anheuser-Busch InBev, that produce hundreds of millions of barrels annually. The biggest brewer in the world is the Belgian-Brazilian company Anheuser-Busch InBev. Some commonly used descriptions of breweries are:\r\n\r\nMicrobrewery –A late-20th-century name for a small brewery. The term started to be replaced with craft brewer at the start of the 21st century.[citation needed]\r\nFarmhouse brewery –A farmhouse brewery, or farm brewery, is a brewery that primarily brews its beer on a farm. Crops grown on the farm, such as barley, wheat and hops, are usually used in the beers brewed. A farmhouse brewery is similar in concept to a vineyard which grows its own grapes and uses them to make wine.\r\nGypsy brewery - A company or individual that brews at the facilities of other brewers on a transient basis.\r\nBrewpub –A brewery whose beer is brewed primarily on the same site from which it is sold to the public, such as a pub or restaurant. If the amount of beer that a brewpub distributes off-site exceeds 75\%, it may also be described as a craft or microbrewery.\r\nContract brewing company or contract brewery –A business that hires another brewery to produce its beer. The contract brewing company generally handles all of the beer\'s marketing, sales, and distribution, while leaving the brewing and packaging to the producer-brewery (which confusingly is also sometimes referred to as a contract brewer). Contract breweries have been criticized by traditional brewing companies for avoiding the costs associated with a physical brewery.[1]\r\nRegional brewery –An established term for a brewery that supplies beer in a fixed geographical location.\r\n\r\nYuengling Brewery, a regional brewery in Pottsville, Pennsylvania\r\nCraft brewer\' is a term coined by the American Brewers Association; it gives a definition of \"small, independent and traditional\": small defined as an \"annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less\", independent defined as at least 75\% owned or controlled by a craft brewer, and traditional defined as at least 50\% of its volume being all malt beer.[22] The Brewers Association further groups craft brewers as microbrewery: annual production less than 15,000 US beer barrels (1,800,000 L); brewpub: sells 25\% or more of its beer on site; regional craft brewery: at least 50\% of its volume is all malt beers.[4] Of the 2,538 breweries in America (as of June 2013), only 55 are not defined as craft brewers.[2]\r\nMacrobrewery or Megabrewery –Terms for a brewery that is too large or economically diversified to be a microbrewery, which sometimes carry a negative connotation.\r\nA brewmaster (German: braumeister) is a person who is in charge of the production of beer. The major breweries employ engineers with a Chemistry/Biotechnology background. The title of Brewmaster is given to a person after 2½ years of extra study in the art of brewing thus earning a degree equivalent to a master\'s degree.[citation needed]\r\nThere are organizations that assist the development of brewing, such as the Siebel Institute of Technology in the USA and the Institute of Brewing and Distilling in the UK.\r\n\r\nLargest brewing companies[edit]\r\nIn 2012 the four largest brewing companies controlled 50\% of the market[3]\r\n\r\nAnheuser-Busch InBev\r\nSABMiller\r\nHeineken International\r\nCarlsberg Group\r\nGypsy brewery[edit]\r\nA gypsy brewery does not have its own equipment or premises; it operates on a temporary or itinerant basis out of the facilities of another brewery, generally making \"one-off\" special occasion beers.[4] The term may refer to the brewmaster, or to the brand of beer. The trend of gypsy brewing spread early in Scandinavia.[5] Their beers, and collaborations later spread to America and Australia.[6] Gypsy brewers typically use facilities of larger makers with excess capacity.[6] Often, their beers are made with herbs, spices, and fruits, use experimental styles, are high in alcohol, or are aged in old wine or liquor barrels.[6]\r\n\r\nProminent examples include Pretty Things, Stillwater Artisanal Ales, Gunbarrel Brewing Company, Mikkeller and Evil Twin.[7] For example, the \"legendary\"[8] One of Mikeller\'s founders, Mikkel Borg Bjergsø, has travelled around the world between 2006 and 2010, brewing more than 200 different beers at other breweries.[9]\r\n\r\nSee also[edit]\r\nPortal icon\tBeer portal\r\nPortal icon\tDrink portal\r\nBeer and breweries by region\r\nBreweriana—the hobby of brewery advertising collecting\r\nHomebrewing\r\nList of breweries in the United States\r\nList of microbreweries\r\nReferences[edit]\r\nJump up ^ Acitelli, Tom (2013).

beerHis.txt,'Beer, or more specifically, ale, is one of the oldest beverages humans have produced, dating back to at least the fifth millennium BC and recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. As almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, it is possible that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran, and is one of the first-known biological engineering tasks to utilize the process of fermentation. In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people drinking a beverage through reed straws from a communal bowl. A 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from barley via bread.\r\n\r\nThe invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanity\'s ability to develop technology and build civilization.[2][3][4] The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at Godin Tepe in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran, where fragments of a jug, at least 5,000 years old was found to be coated with beerstone, a by-product of the brewing process.[5]\r\n\r\nBeer may have been known in Neolithic Europe as far back as 5,000 years ago,[6] and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.[7]\r\n\r\nAle produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century.[8] The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process, and greater knowledge of the results.\r\n\r\nToday, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.[9] More than 133 billion liters (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006.[10]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n2 Etymology\r\n3 Early beers\r\n4 Medieval Europe\r\n5 Early modern Europe\r\n6 Asia\r\n7 The Industrial Revolution\r\n8 Modern beer\r\n9 Mythology\r\n10 See also\r\n11 References\r\n12 Bibliography\r\n13 External links\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, clay tablets indicate that brewing was a fairly well respected occupation during the time, and that the majority of brewers were probably women.[11] Indeed, the brewer\'s craft was the only profession in Mesopotamia which derived social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, specifically: Ninkasi, who covered the production of beer, Siris, who was used in a metonymic way to refer to beer, and Siduri, who covered the enjoyment of beer.[12] Mesopotamian brewing appears to have incorporated the usage of a twice-baked barley bread called bappir, which was exclusively used for brewing beer.[13] It was discovered early that reusing the same container for fermenting the mash would produce more reliable results; brewers on the move carried their tubs with them.[14]\r\n\r\nThe Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC.[15] Early traces of beer and the brewing process have been found in ancient Babylonia as well. At the time, brewers were women as well, but also priestesses. Some types of beers were used especially in religious ceremonies. In 2100 BC, the Babylonian king Hammurabi included regulations governing tavern keepers in his law code for the kingdom.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nA funerary model of a bakery and brewery, from the Eleventh dynasty of Egypt, circa 2009–1998 BC\r\nBeer was part of the daily diet of Egyptian Pharaohs over 5,000 years ago. Then, it was made from baked barley bread, and was also used in religious practices.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Greek writer Sophocles (450 BCE) discussed the concept of moderation when it came to consuming beer in Greek culture, and believed that the best diet for Greeks consisted of bread, meats, various types of vegetables, and beer or \"ζῦθος\" (zythos) as they called it.[18] The ancient Greeks also made barleywine (Greek: \"κ?ίθινος οἶνος\" - krithinos oinos, \"barley wine\"[19][20]) mentioned by Greek historian Polybius in his work The Histories, where he states that Phaeacians kept barleywine in silver and golden kraters.[21]\r\n\r\nIn Europe during the Middle Ages, a brewers\' guild might adopt a patron saint of brewing. Arnulf of Metz (c. 582–640) and Arnulf of Oudenburg (c. 1040–1087) were recognized by some French and Flemish brewers.[22] Belgian brewers, too, venerated Arnulf of Oudenburg (aka Arnold of Soissons),[23] who is also recognized as the patron saint of hop-pickers. Christian monks built breweries, to provide food, drink, and shelter to travelers and pilgrims.[17]\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, Frankish king and ruler of the Holy Roman Empire during the 8th century, considered beer to be an important part of living, and is often thought to have trained some brewers himself.[16]\r\n\r\nEtymology[edit]\r\nThe word beer comes from old Germanic languages, and is with variations used in continental Germanic languages, bier in German and Dutch, but not in Nordic languages. The word was imported into the British Isles by tribes such as the Saxons. It is disputed where the word originally comes from.\r\n\r\nMany other languages have borrowed the Dutch/German word, such as French bière, Italian birra, Romanian \"bere\" and Turkish bira. The Nordic languages have öl or øl, related to the English word ale. Spanish, Portugues and Catalan have words that evolved from Latin cervisia, maybe of Celtic origin. Slavic languages use pivo with small variations, based on an old Slavic word meaning beverage.\r\n\r\nEarly beers[edit]\r\nSee also: Ancient Egyptian cuisine\r\n\r\nA replica of ancient Egyptian beer, brewed from emmer wheat by the Courage brewery in 1996\r\nAs almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, it is possible that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced about 3,500 BC in what is today Iran, and was one of the first-known biological engineering tasks where the biological process of fermentation is used. Also recent archaeological findings showing that Chinese villagers were brewing fermented alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scale, with the production process and methods similar to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.[24]\r\n\r\nIn Mesopotamia (Ancient Iraq), early evidence of beer is a 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honoring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, which contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from barley via bread.[25]\r\n\r\nNinkasi, you are the one who pours out the filtered beer of the collector vat\r\n\r\nIt is [like] the onrush of Tigris and Euphrates.[26]\r\n\r\nBeer is also mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh, in which the \'wild man\' Enkidu is given beer to drink. \"... he ate until he was full, drank seven pitchers of beer, his heart grew light, his face glowed and he sang out with joy.\"\r\n\r\nConfirmed written evidence of ancient beer production in Armenia can be obtained from Xenophon in his work Anabasis (5th century B.C.) when he was in one of the ancient Armenian villages in which he wrote:\r\n\r\n“\t\r\nThere were stores within of wheat and barley and vegetables, and wine made from barley in great big bowls; the grains of barley malt lay floating in the beverage up to the lip of the vessel, and reeds lay in them, some longer, some shorter, without joints; when you were thirsty you must take one of these into your mouth, and suck. The beverage without admixture of water was very strong, and of a delicious flavour to certain palates, but the taste must be acquired.[27][28]\r\n\r\n?\r\nBeer became vital to all the grain-growing civilizations of Eurasian and North African antiquity, including Egypt—so much so that in 1868 James Death put forward a theory in The Beer of the Bible that the manna from heaven that God gave the Israelites was a bread-based, porridge-like beer called wusa.\r\n\r\nThese beers were often thick, more of a gruel than a beverage, and drinking straws were used by the Sumerians to avoid the bitter solids left over from fermentation. Though beer was drunk in Ancient Rome, it was replaced in popularity by wine.[29] Tacitus wrote disparagingly of the beer brewed by the Germanic peoples of his day. Thracians were also known to consume beer made from rye, even since the 5th century BC, as Hellanicus of Lesbos says. Their name for beer was brutos, or brytos. The Romans called their brew cerevisia, from the Celtic word for it.\r\n\r\nAncient Nubians had used beer as an antibiotic medicine.[30]\r\n\r\nMedieval Europe[edit]\r\nBeer was one of the most common drinks during the Middle Ages. It was consumed daily by all social classes in the northern and eastern parts of Europe where grape cultivation was difficult or impossible.[citation needed] Though wine of varying qualities was the most common drink in the south, beer was still popular among the lower classes. The idea that beer was consumed more commonly than water during medieval times is a myth. Water was cheaper than beer, and towns/villages were built close to sources of fresh water such as rivers, springs, and wells to facilitate easy access to the resource.[31] Though probably one of the most popular drinks in Europe, beer was disdained by science as being unhealthy, mostly because ancient Greek and more contemporary Arab physicians had little or no experience with the drink. In 1256, the Aldobrandino of Siena described the nature of beer in the following way:\r\n\r\n“\tBut from whichever it is made, whether from oats, barley or wheat, it harms the head and the stomach, it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth, it fills the stomach with bad fumes, and as a result anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly; but it does have the property of facilitating urination and makes one\'s flesh white and smooth.[32]\t?\r\nThe use of hops in beer was written of in 822 by a Carolingian Abbot. Flavoring beer with hops was known at least since the 9th century, but was only gradually adopted because of difficulties in establishing the right proportions of ingredients. Before that, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used, but did not have the same preserving properties as hops. Beer flavored without it was often spoiled soon after preparation and could not be exported. The only other alternative was to increase the alcohol content, which was rather expensive. Hopped beer was perfected in the medieval towns of Bohemia by the 13th century. German towns pioneered a new scale of operation with standardized barrel sizes that allowed for large-scale export. Previously beer had been brewed at home, but the production was now successfully replaced by medium-sized operations of about eight to ten people. This type of production spread to Holland in the 14th century and later to Flanders, Brabant and reached England by the late 15th century.[33]\r\n\r\nEnglish ale and beer brewing were carried out separately, no brewer being allowed to produce both. The Brewers Company of London stated \"no hops, herbs, or other like thing be put into any ale or liquore wherof ale shall be made – but only liquor (water), malt, and yeast.\" This comment is sometimes misquoted as a prohibition on hopped beer.[citation needed] However, hopped beer was opposed by some, e.g.\r\n\r\nAle is made of malte and water; and they the which do put any other thynge to ale than is rehersed, except yest, barme, or goddesgood [three words for yeast], doth sophysticat there ale. Ale for an Englysshe man is a naturall drinke. Ale muste haue these properties, it muste be fresshe and cleare, it muste not be ropy, nor smoky, nor it must haue no wefte nor tayle. Ale shulde not be dronke vnder .v. dayes olde …. Barly malte maketh better ale than Oten malte or any other corne doth … Beere is made of malte, of hoppes, and water; it is a naturall drynke for a doche [Dutch] man, and nowe of late dayes it is moche vsed in Englande to the detryment of many Englysshe men … for the drynke is a colde drynke. Yet it doth make a man fatte, and doth inflate the bely, as it doth appere by the doche mennes faces and belyes.\r\n\r\n[34]\r\n\r\nEarly modern Europe[edit]\r\n\r\nA 16th-century brewery\r\nIn Europe, beer largely remained a home activity, in medieval times. The oldest still operating commercial brewery is the Weihenstephan (Bavaria) abbey brewery, which obtained the brewing rights from the nearby town of Freising in 1040. By the 14th and 15th centuries, beermaking was gradually changing from a family-oriented activity to an artisan one, with pubs and monasteries brewing their own beer for mass consumption.\r\n\r\nIn the late Middle Ages, the brewing industry in northern Europe changed from a small-scale domestic industry to a large-scale export industry. The key innovation was the introduction of hops, which began in northern Germany in the 13th century. Hops sharply improved both the brewing process and the quality of beer. Other innovations from German lands involved larger kettle sizes and more frequent brewing. Consumption went up, while brewing became more concentrated because it was a capital-intensive industry. Thus in Hamburg per capita consumption increased from an average of 300 liters per year in the 15th century to about 700 in the 17th century.[35]\r\n\r\nThe use of hops spread to the Netherlands and then to England. In 15th century England, an unhopped beer would have been known as an ale, while the use of hops would make it a beer. Hopped beer was imported to England from the Netherlands as early as 1400 in Winchester, and hops were being planted on the island by 1428. The popularity of hops was at first mixed—the Brewers Company of London went so far as to state \"no hops, herbs, or other like thing be put into any ale or liquore wherof ale shall be made—but only liquor (water), malt, and yeast.\" However, by the 16th century, ale had come to refer to any strong beer, and all ales and beers were hopped, giving rise to the verse noted by the antiquary John Aubrey:\r\n\r\nGreeks, Heresie, Turkey-cocks and Beer\r\n\r\nCame into England all in a year.\r\n\r\nthe year, according to Aubrey, being the fifteenth of Henry VIII (1524).[36]\r\n\r\n\r\nAchel trappist beer (Belgium) with glass\r\nIn 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, adopted the Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food regulation still in use through the 20th century (the Reinheitsgebot passed formally from German law in 1987). The Gebot ordered that the ingredients of beer be restricted to water, barley, and hops; yeast was added to the list after Louis Pasteur\'s discovery in 1857. The Bavarian law was applied throughout Germany as part of the 1871 German unification as the German Empire under Otto von Bismarck, and has since been updated to reflect modern trends in beer brewing. To this day, the Gebot is considered a mark of purity in beers, although this is controversial.\r\n\r\nMost beers until relatively recent times were top-fermented. Bottom-fermented beers were discovered by accident in the 16th century after beer was stored in cool caverns for long periods; they have since largely outpaced top-fermented beers in terms of volume.\r\n\r\nAsia[edit]\r\nThere is pre-historic evidence that shows brewing began around 5400 BC in Sumer (southern Iraq). However, as with the history of corn whiskey, the production of other alcoholic beverages is often seen as a way to preserve excess grain, rather than an occupation in and of itself.\r\n\r\nDocumented evidence and recently excavated tombs indicate that the Chinese brewed alcoholic beverages from both malted grain and grain converted by mold from prehistoric times, but that the malt conversion process was largely considered inefficient in comparison with the use of molds specially cultivated on rice carrier (the resulting molded rice being called 酒麴 (Jiǔ qū) in Chinese and Koji in Japanese) to convert cooked rice into fermentable sugars, both in the amount of resulting fermentable sugars and the residual by products (the Chinese use the dregs left after fermenting the rice, called 酒糟 (Jiǔz?o), as a cooking ingredient in many dishes, frequently as an ingredient to sauces where Western dishes would use wine), because the rice undergoes starch conversion after being hulled and cooked, rather than whole and in husks like barley malt. Furthermore, the hop plant being unknown in East Asia, malt-based alcoholic beverages did not preserve well over time, and the use of malt in the production of alcoholic beverages gradually fell out of favor in China until disappearing from Chinese history by the end of the Tang Dynasty. The use of rice became dominant, such that wines from fruits of any type were historically all but unknown except as imports in China.\r\n\r\nThe production of alcoholic beverage from cooked rice converted by microbes continues to this day, and some classify such beverages (米酒 (M?jiǔ) in Chinese and Sake in Japanese) as beers since they are made from converted starch rather than fruit sugars. However, this is a debatable point, and such beverages are generally referred to as \"rice wine\" or \"sake\" which is really the generic Chinese and Japanese word for all alcoholic beverages.\r\n\r\nSome Pacific island cultures ferment starch that has been converted to fermentable sugars by human saliva, similar to the chicha of South America. This practice is also used by many other tribes around the world, who either chew the grain and then spit it into the fermentation vessel or spit into a fermentation vessel containing cooked grain, which is then sealed up for the fermentation. Enzymes in the spittle convert the starch into fermentable sugars, which are fermented by wild yeast. Whether or not the resulting product can be called beer is sometimes disputed, since:\r\n\r\nAs with Asian rice-based liquors, it does not involve malting.\r\nThis method is often used with starches derived from sources other than grain, such as yams, taro, or other such root vegetables.\r\nSome Taiwanese tribes have taken the process a step further by distilling the resulting alcoholic beverage, resulting in a clear liquor. However, as none of the Taiwanese tribes are known to have developed systems of writing, there is no way to document how far back this practice goes, or if the technique was brought from Mainland China by Han Chinese immigrants. Judging by the fact that this technique is usually found in tribes using millet (a grain native to northern China) as the ingredient, the latter seems much more likely.\r\n\r\nAsia\'s first brewery was incorporated in 1855 (although it was established earlier) by Edward Dyer at Kasauli in the Himalayan Mountains in India under the name Dyer Breweries. The company still exists and is known as Mohan Meakin, today comprising a large group of companies across many industries.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Revolution[edit]\r\n\r\nThe Caledonian Brewery, founded in 1869, Edinburgh, Scotland\r\nFollowing significant improvements in the efficiency of the steam engine in 1765, industrialization of beer became a reality. Further innovations in the brewing process came about with the introduction of the thermometer in 1760 and hydrometer in 1770, which allowed brewers to increase efficiency and attenuation.\r\n\r\nPrior to the late 18th century, malt was primarily dried over fires made from wood, charcoal, or straw, and after 1600, from coke.\r\n\r\nIn general, none of these early malts would have been well shielded from the smoke involved in the kilning process, and consequently, early beers would have had a smoky component to their flavors; evidence indicates that maltsters and brewers constantly tried to minimize the smokiness of the finished beer.\r\n\r\nWriters of the period describe the distinctive taste derived from wood-smoked malts, and the almost universal revulsion it engendered. The smoked beers and ales of the West Country were famous for being undrinkable – locals and the desperate excepted. This is from \"Directions for Brewing Malt Liquors\" (1700):\r\n\r\nIn most parts of the West, their malt is so stenched with the Smoak of the Wood, with which \'tis dryed, that no Stranger can endure it, though the inhabitants, who are familiarized to it, can swallow it as the Hollanders do their thick Black Beer Brewed with Buck Wheat.\r\n\r\nAn even earlier reference to such malt was recorded by William Harrison, in his \"Description of England\", 1577:\r\n\r\nIn some places it [malt] is dried at leisure with wood alone, or straw alone, in other with wood and straw together, but, of all, the straw-dried is the most excellent. For the wood-dried malt, when it is brewed, beside that the drink is higher of colour, it doth hurt and annoy the head of him that is not used thereto, because of the smoke. Such also as use both indifferently do bark, cleave, and dry their wood in an oven, thereby to remove all moisture that should procure the fume ...\r\n\r\n\"London and Country Brewer\" (1736) specified the varieties of \"brown malt\" popular in the city:\r\n\r\nBrown Malts are dryed with Straw, Wood and Fern, etc. The straw-dryed is the best, but the wood sort has a most unnatural Taste, that few can bear with, but the necessitous, and those that are accustomed to its strong smoaky tang; yet it is much used in some of the Western Parts of England, and many thousand Quarters of this malt has been formerly used in London for brewing the Butt-keeoing-beers with, and that because it sold for two shillings per Quarter cheaper than Straw-dryed Malt, nor was this Quality of the Wood-dryed Malt much regarded by some of its Brewers, for that its ill Taste is lost in nine or twelve Months, by the Age of the Beer, and the strength of the great Quantity of Hops that were used in its preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hydrometer measures beer\'s specific gravity\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first photograph of men drinking beer, circa 1844 in Scotland, by Hill & Adamson.\r\nThe hydrometer transformed how beer was brewed. Before its introduction beers were brewed from a single malt: brown beers from brown malt, amber beers from amber malt, pale beers from pale malt. Using the hydrometer, brewers could calculate the yield from different malts. They observed that pale malt, though more expensive, yielded far more fermentable material than cheaper malts. For example, brown malt (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale malt gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale malt for all beers supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured malt to achieve the correct colour for darker beers.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the drum roaster in 1817 by Daniel Wheeler allowed for the creation of very dark, roasted malts, contributing to the flavour of porters and stouts. Its development was prompted by a British law of 1816 forbidding the use of any ingredients other than malt and hops. Porter brewers, employing a predominantly pale malt grist, urgently needed a legal colourant. Wheeler\'s patent malt was the solution.\r\n\r\nLouis Pasteur\'s 1857 discovery of yeast\'s role in fermentation led to brewers developing methods to prevent the souring of beer by undesirable microorganisms.\r\n\r\nModern beer[edit]\r\n\r\nBottling beer in a modern facility, 1945, Australia\r\n\r\nTraditional fermenting building (center) and modern fermenting building (left) in Pilsner Urquell Brewery (Czech Republic)\r\nMany European nations have unbroken brewing traditions dating back to the earliest historical records. Beer is an especially important drink in countries such as Belgium, Germany, Austria, Ireland, UK, France, the Scandinavian countries, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and others having strong and unique brewing traditions with their own history, characteristic brewing methods, and styles of beer.\r\n\r\nUnlike in many parts of the world, there is a significant market in Europe (the UK in particular) for beer containing live yeast. These unfiltered, unpasteurised brews are more challenging to handle than the commonly sold \"dead\" beers; \"live\" beer quality can suffer with poor care, but many people prefer its taste. While beer is usually matured for relatively short times (a few weeks to a few months) compared to wine, some of the stronger so-called real ales have been found to develop character and flavour over the course of as much as several decades.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld beer consumption per capita\r\nIn some parts of the world, breweries that had begun as a family business by Germans or other European émigrés grew into large companies, often passing into hands with more concern for profits than traditions of quality, resulting in a degradation of the product.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, New Zealander Morton W. Coutts developed the technique of continuous fermentation. Coutts patented his process, which involves beer flowing through sealed tanks, fermenting under pressure, and never coming into contact with the atmosphere, even when bottled. His process was introduced in the US and UK, but is now used for commercial beer production only in New Zealand.[37]\r\n\r\nIn some sectors brewers are reluctant to embrace new technology for fear of losing the traditional characteristics of their beer. For example Marston\'s Brewery in Burton on Trent still uses open wooden Burton Union sets for fermentation in order to maintain the quality and flavour of its beers, while Belgium\'s lambic brewers go so far as to expose their brews to outside air in order to pick up the natural wild yeasts which ferment the wort. Traditional brewing techniques protect the beer from oxidation by maintaining a carbon dioxide blanket over the wort as it ferments into beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern breweries now brew many different types of beer, ranging from ancient styles such as the spontaneously-fermented lambics of Belgium; the lagers, dark beers, wheat beers and more of Germany; the UK\'s stouts, milds, pale ales, bitters, golden ale and new modern American creations such as chili beer, cream ale, and double India pale ales.\r\n\r\nToday, the brewing industry is a huge global business, consisting of several multinational companies, and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. Advances in refrigeration, international and transcontinental shipping, marketing and commerce have resulted in an international marketplace, where the consumer has literally hundreds of choices between various styles of local, regional, national and foreign beers.\r\n\r\nAustralia\r\nUnited States\r\nPrior to Prohibition, there were thousands of breweries in the United States, mostly brewing heavier beers than modern US beer drinkers are used to. Beginning in 1920, most of these breweries went out of business, although some converted to soft drinks and other businesses. Bootlegged beer was often watered down to increase profits, beginning a trend, still on-going today, of the American palate preferring weaker beers. Consolidation of breweries and the application of industrial quality control standards have led to the mass-production and the mass-marketing of huge quantities of light lagers. Advertising became supreme, and bigger companies fared better in that market. The decades after World War II saw a huge consolidation of the American brewing industry: brewing companies would buy their rivals solely for their customers and distribution systems, shutting down their brewing operations.[38] Breweries and imports have become more abundant since the mid-1980s; the number of breweries has been claimed as being either over 1,500 in 2007 or over 1,400 in 2010, depending on the source. As of June 2013, The Brewers Association reports the total number of currently operating US breweries to be 2,538 with only 55 of those being non-craft breweries.[39][40][41][42]\r\n\r\nMythology[edit]\r\n\r\nGambrinus–king of beer\r\nThe Finnish epic Kalevala, collected in written form in the 19th century but based on oral traditions many centuries old, devotes more lines to the origin of beer and brewing than it does to the origin of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe mythical Flemish king Gambrinus (from Jan Primus (John I)), is sometimes credited with the invention of beer.\r\n\r\nAccording to Czech legend, deity Radegast, god of hospitality, invented beer.\r\n\r\nNinkasi was the patron goddess of brewing in ancient Sumer.\r\n\r\nIn Egyptian mythology, the immense blood-lust of the fierce lioness goddess Sekhmet was only sated after she was tricked into consuming an extremely large amount of red-coloured beer: she became so drunk that she gave up slaughter altogether and became docile.\r\n\r\nIn Norse mythology the sea god Ægir, his wife Rán, and their nine daughters, brewed ale (or mead) for the gods. In the Lokasenna, it is told that Ægir would host a party where all the gods would drink the beer he brewed for them. He made this in a giant kettle that Thor had brought. The cups in Ægir\'s hall were always full, magically refilling themselves when emptied. Ægir had two servants in his hall to assist him; Eldir [Fire-Kindler] and Fimafeng [Handy].'

As of 2008 the most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor (cadaveric allograft) and implant it into the patient. The patient\'s own heart is either removed (orthotopic procedure) or, less commonly, left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic procedure). Post-operation survival periods average 15 years.[1] Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease, but a life-saving treatment intended to improve the quality of life for recipients.[2]\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 History\r\n2 Contraindications\r\n3 Procedures\r\n3.1 Pre-operative\r\n3.2 Operative\r\n3.2.1 Orthotopic procedure\r\n3.2.2 Heterotopic procedure\r\n3.2.3 \'Living organ\' transplant\r\n3.2.4 Non-beating heart transplant\r\n3.3 Post-operative\r\n4 Complications\r\n5 Prognosis\r\n5.1 Notable recipients\r\n6 See also\r\n7 References\r\n8 External links\r\nHistory[edit]\r\nNorman Shumway is widely regarded as the father of heart transplantation although the world\'s first adult human heart transplant was performed by a South African cardiac surgeon, Christiaan Barnard, utilizing the techniques developed and perfected by Shumway and Richard Lower.[3] Barnard performed the first transplant on Louis Washkansky on December 3, 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.[3][4] Adrian Kantrowitz performed the world\'s first pediatric heart transplant on December 6, 1967, at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, barely three days after Christiaan Barnard\'s pioneering procedure.[3] Norman Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on January 6, 1968, at the Stanford University Hospital.[3]\r\n\r\nWorldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are performed annually. The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000-2,300 annually). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 119 adult transplants in 2013 alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure.[5] The great disparity between the number of patients needing transplants and the number of procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non-human hearts into humans after 1993. Xenografts from other species and man-made artificial hearts are two less successful alternatives to allografts.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthotopic heart transplant. Recipient P-waves (arrows).\r\nContraindications[edit]\r\nSome patients are less suitable for a heart transplant, especially if they suffer from other circulatory conditions related to the heart. The following conditions in a patient increase the chances of complications:\r\n\r\nKidney, lung, or liver disease\r\nInsulin-dependent diabetes with other organ dysfunction\r\nLife-threatening diseases unrelated to heart failure\r\nVascular disease of the neck and leg arteries.\r\nHigh pulmonary vascular resistance\r\nRecent thromboembolism\r\nAge over 60 years (some variation between centers)\r\nSubstance abuse, notably tobacco smoking (which increases the chance of lung disease)\r\nProcedures[edit]\r\nPre-operative[edit]\r\nA typical heart transplantation begins when a suitable donor heart is identified. The heart comes from a recently deceased or brain dead donor, also called a beating heart cadaver. The patient is contacted by a nurse coordinator and instructed to come to the hospital for evaluation and pre-surgical medication. At the same time, the heart is removed from the donor and inspected by a team of surgeons to see if it is in suitable condition. Learning that a potential organ is unsuitable can induce distress in an already fragile patient, who usually requires emotional support before returning home.\r\n\r\nThe patient must also undergo emotional, psychological, and physical tests to verify mental health and ability to make good use of a new heart. The patient is also given immunosuppressant medication so that the patient\'s immune system does not reject the new heart.\r\n\r\nOperative[edit]\r\n\r\nSchematic of a transplanted heart with native lungs and the great vessels.\r\nOnce the donor heart passes inspection, the patient is taken into the operating room and given a general anaesthetic. Either an orthotopic or a heterotopic procedure follows, depending on the conditions of the patient and the donor heart.\r\n\r\nOrthotopic procedure[edit]\r\nThe orthotopic procedure begins with a median sternotomy, opening the chest and exposing the mediastinum. The pericardium is opened, the great vessels are dissected and the patient is attached to cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor\'s heart is injected with potassium chloride (KCl). Potassium chloride stops the heart beating before the heart is removed from the donor\'s body and packed in ice. Ice can usually keep the heart usable for four[6] to six hours depending on preservation and starting condition. The failing heart is removed by transecting the great vessels and a portion of the left atrium. The patient\'s pulmonary veins are not transected; rather a circular portion of the left atrium containing the pulmonary veins is left in place. The donor heart is trimmed to fit onto the patient\'s remaining left atrium and the great vessels are sutured in place. The new heart is restarted, the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and the chest cavity is closed.\r\n\r\nThe orthotopic procedure was developed by Shumway and Lower at Stanford-Lane Hospital in San Francisco in 1958.[3]\r\n\r\nHeterotopic procedure[edit]\r\nIn the heterotopic procedure, the patient\'s own heart is not removed. The new heart is positioned so that the chambers and blood vessels of both hearts can be connected to form what is effectively a \'double heart\'. The procedure can give the patient\'s original heart a chance to recover, and if the donor\'s heart fails (e.g., through rejection), it can later be removed, leaving the patient\'s original heart. Heterotopic procedures are used only in cases where the donor heart is not strong enough to function by itself (because either the patient\'s body is considerably larger than the donor\'s, the donor\'s heart is itself weak, or the patient suffers from pulmonary hypertension).\r\n\r\n\'Living organ\' transplant[edit]\r\nIn February 2006, at the Bad Oeynhausen Clinic for Thorax and Cardiovascular Surgery, Germany, surgeons successfully transplanted a \'beating heart\' into a patient.[7] Rather than cooling the heart, the living organ procedure keeps it at body temperature and connects it to a special machine called an Organ Care System that allows it to continue pumping warm, oxygenated blood. This technique can maintain the heart in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method.\r\n\r\nNon-beating heart transplant[edit]\r\nThe first successful non-beating heart transplant was achieved in Australia in 2014, performed by cardiothoracic surgeon Kumud Dhital. The transplant was made possible by the development of preservation technology able to preserve a heart, resuscitate it and to assess the function of the heart. The first patient to have this surgery was 57-year-old Michelle Gribilas.[8] Papworth Hospital in England (where the first non-beating heart transplant in Europe was carried out) stated that the technique could increase the number of hearts available for transplant by at least 25\%. [9]\r\n\r\nPost-operative[edit]\r\n\r\nTransplanted heart in the thorax of recipient\r\nThe patient is taken to the ICU to recover. When they wake up, they move to a special recovery unit for rehabilitation. The duration of in-hospital, post-transplant care depends on the patient\'s general health, how well the heart is working, and the patient\'s ability to look after the new heart. Doctors typically prefer that patients leave the hospital 1–2 weeks after surgery, because of the risk of infection and presuming no complications. After release, the patient returns for regular check-ups and rehabilitation. They may also require emotional support. The frequency of hospital visits decreases as the patient adjusts to the transplant. The patient remains on immunosuppressant medication to avoid the possibility of rejection. Since the vagus nerve is severed during the operation, the new heart beats at around 100 beats per minute unless nerve regrowth occurs.\r\n\r\nImmunosuppressive agents are continued in the intensive care unit.\r\n\r\nThe patient is regularly monitored to detect rejection. This surveillance can be performed via frequent biopsy or a gene expression blood test known as AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing. Typically, biopsy is performed immediately post-transplant and then AlloMap replaces it once the patient is stable. The transition from biopsy to AlloMap can occur as soon as 55 days after the transplant.\r\n\r\nComplications[edit]\r\nPost-operative complications include infection, sepsis, organ rejection, as well as the side-effects of the immunosuppressive medication. Since the transplanted heart originates from another organism, the recipient\'s immune system typically attempts to reject it. The risk of rejection never fully goes away, and the patient will be on immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of his or her life, but these may cause unwanted side effects, such as increased likelihood of infections, like fevers, unusual pains, or any new feelings. Recipients can get kidney disease from a heart transplant. Many recent advances in reducing complications due to tissue rejection stem from mouse heart transplant procedures.[10] Surgery death rate is 5-10\% in 2011.[11] Hong Kong death rate is 5\% for 16 patients from beginning to 2014.[12]\r\n\r\nPrognosis[edit]\r\nThe prognosis for heart transplant patients following the orthotopic procedure has increased over the past 20 years, and as of June 5, 2009, the survival rates were:[13]\r\n\r\n1 year: 88.0\% (males), 86.2\% (females)\r\n3 years: 79.3\% (males), 77.2\% (females)\r\n5 years: 73.2\% (males), 69.0\% (females)\r\nIn a study spanning 1999 to 2007, conducted on behalf of the U.S. federal government by Dr. Eric Weiss of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, it was discovered that, compared to men receiving male hearts, \"men receiving female hearts had a 15\% increase in the risk of adjusted cumulative mortality\" over five years. No significant differences were noted with females receiving hearts from male or female donors.[14]\r\n\r\nNotable recipients[edit]\r\nAt the time of his death on August 10, 2009, Tony Huesman was the world\'s longest living heart transplant recipient, having survived for 30 years, 11 months and 10 days, before dying of cancer.[15] Huesman received a heart in 1978 at the age of 20 after viral pneumonia severely weakened his heart.[16] The operation was performed at Stanford University under heart transplant pioneer Dr. Norman Shumway.[17]\r\n\r\nAs of December 2013, the record holder for longest living heart recipient is Englishman John McCafferty, 71. He received his heart on 20 October 1982.[15]\r\n\r\nKelly Perkins climbs mountains around the world to promote positive awareness of organ donation. Perkins was the first recipient to climb the peaks of Mt. Fuji, Mt. Kilimanjaro, the Matterhorn, Mt. Whitney, and Cajon de Arenales in Argentina in 2007, 12 years after her surgery.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nTwenty-two years after Dwight Kroening\'s heart transplant, he was the first recipient to finish an Ironman competition.[18]\r\n\r\nFiona Coote was the fourth Australian to receive a heart transplant in 1984 (at age 14) and the youngest Australian. In the 24 years after her transplant she became involved in publicity and charity work for the Red Cross, and promoted organ donation in Australia.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nRace car driver and manufacturer Carroll Shelby received a heart transplant in 1990.[19]\r\n\r\nGolfer Erik Compton qualified for the PGA Tour at age 32, after his second heart transplant.[20]\r\n\r\nFormer Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney received a heart transplant on March 24, 2012.[21]\r\n\r\nFormer chairman and founder of MCI Communications William G. McGowan received a heart transplant on April 25, 1987.[22] After a six-month recovery, McGowan returned to his duties as MCI chairman where he remained until his death on June 8, 1992 from another heart attack.[23]'
heartFail.txt,'The term \"heart failure\" makes it sound like the heart is no longer working at all and there\'s nothing that can be done. Actually, heart failure means that the heart isn\'t pumping as well as it should be.\r\n\r\nYour body depends on the heart\'s pumping action to deliver oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the body\'s cells. When the cells are nourished properly, the body can function normally.\r\n\r\nWith heart failure, the weakened heart can\'t supply the cells with enough blood. This results in fatigue and shortness of breath and some people have coughing. Everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs or carrying groceries can become very difficult.\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a serious condition, and usually there\'s no cure. But many people with heart failure lead a full, enjoyable life when the condition is managed with heart failure medications and healthy lifestyle changes. It\'s also helpful to have the support of family and friends who understand your condition.\r\n\r\nHow the normal heart works\r\n\r\nThe normal healthy heart is a strong, muscular pump a little larger than a fist. It pumps blood continuously through the circulatory system. Watch an animation of blood flow through the heart.\r\n\r\nThe heart has four chambers, two on the right and two on the left:\r\n\r\nTwo upper chambers called atria (one is an atrium)\r\nTwo lower chambers called ventricles\r\nThe right atria takes in oxygen-depleted blood from the rest of the body and sends it back out to the lungs through the right ventricle where the blood becomes oxygenated.\r\n\r\nOxygen-rich blood travels from the lungs to the left atrium, then on to the left ventricle, which pumps it to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nThe heart pumps blood to the lungs and to all the body\'s tissues by a sequence of highly organized contractions of the four chambers. For the heart to function properly, the four chambers must beat in an organized way.\r\n\r\nWhat is heart failure?\r\n\r\nHeart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood through to meet the body\'s needs for blood and oxygen. Basically, the heart can\'t keep up with its workload. \r\nWatch an animation of heart failure\r\n\r\nAt first the heart tries to make up for this by:\r\nEnlarging. When your heart chamber enlarges, it stretches more and can contract more strongly, so it pumps more blood. With an enlarged heart, your body starts to retain fluid, your lungs get congested with fluid and your heart begins to beat irregularly.\r\nDeveloping more muscle mass. The increase in muscle mass occurs because the contracting cells of the heart get bigger. This lets the heart pump more strongly, at least initially.\r\nPumping faster. This helps to increase the heart\'s output.\r\nThe body also tries to compensate in other ways:\r\n\r\nThe blood vessels narrow to keep blood pressure up, trying to make up for the heart\'s loss of power.\r\nThe body diverts blood away from less important tissues and organs (like the kidneys), the heart and brain.\r\nThese temporary measures mask the problem of heart failure, but they don\'t solve it. Heart failure continues and worsens until these substitute processes no longer work.\r\n\r\nEventually the heart and body just can\'t keep up, and the person experiences the fatigue, breathing problems or other symptoms that usually prompt a trip to the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe body\'s compensation mechanisms help explain why some people may not become aware of their condition until years after their heart begins its decline. (It\'s also a good reason to have a regular checkup with your doctor.)\r\n\r\nHeart failure can involve the heart\'s left side, right side or both sides. Ho'
heartFail1.txt,'Essential update: FDA approves I(f) \"funny\" current inhibitor for patients with worsening heart failure\r\nIn April 2015, the FDA approved ivabradine (Corlanor) to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35\% or lower, who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 70 bpm or higher, and who are either on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use.[1, 2] This drug blocks the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel responsible for the cardiac pacemaker I(f) \"funny\" current, which regulates heart rate without any effect on ventricular repolarization or myocardial contractility.\r\n\r\nApproval for ivabradine was based on the international, placebo-controlled SHIFT trial published in 2010, which randomized more than 6500 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV heart failure and an LVEF of 35\% or lower.[1, 2] The trial saw a highly significant 18\% drop in risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure over an average of 23 months in patients treated with ivabradine.\r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms\r\nSigns and symptoms of heart failure include the following:\r\n\r\nExertional dyspnea and/or dyspnea at rest\r\nOrthopnea\r\nAcute pulmonary edema\r\nChest pain/pressure and palpitations\r\nTachycardia\r\nFatigue and weakness\r\nNocturia and oliguria\r\nAnorexia, weight loss, nausea\r\nExophthalmos and/or visible pulsation of eyes\r\nDistention of neck veins\r\nWeak, rapid, and thready pulse\r\nRales, wheezing\r\nS 3 gallop and/or pulsus alternans\r\nIncreased intensity of P 2 heart sound\r\nHepatojugular reflux\r\nAscites, hepatomegaly, and/or anasarca\r\nCentral or peripheral cyanosis, pallor\r\nSee Clinical Presentation for more detail.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\nHeart failure criteria, classification, and staging\r\n\r\nThe Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure consists of the concurrent presence of either 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria.[3]\r\n\r\nMajor criteria include the following:\r\n\r\nParoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea\r\nWeight loss of 4.5 kg in 5 days in response to treatment\r\nNeck vein distention\r\nRales\r\nAcute pulmonary edema\r\nHepatojugular reflux\r\nS 3 gallop\r\nCentral venous pressure greater than 16 cm water\r\nCirculation time of 25 seconds\r\nRadiographic cardiomegaly\r\nPulmonary edema, visceral congestion, or cardiomegaly at autopsy\r\nMinor criteria are as follows:\r\n\r\nNocturnal cough\r\nDyspnea on ordinary exertion\r\nA decrease in vital capacity by one third the maximal value recorded\r\nPleural effusion\r\nTachycardia (rate of 120 bpm)\r\nBilateral ankle edema\r\nThe New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system categorizes heart failure on a scale of I to IV,[4] as follows:\r\n\r\nClass I: No limitation of physical activity\r\nClass II: Slight limitation of physical activity\r\nClass III: Marked limitation of physical activity\r\nClass IV: Symptoms occur even at rest; discomfort with any physical activity\r\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) staging system is defined by the following 4 stages[5, 6] :\r\n\r\nStage A: High risk of heart failure but no structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage B: Structural heart disease but no symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage C: Structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure\r\nStage D: Refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nThe following tests may be useful in the initial evaluation for suspected heart failure[5, 7, 8] :\r\n\r\nComplete blood count (CBC)\r\nUrinalysis\r\nElectrolyte levels\r\nRenal and liver function studies\r\nFasting blood glucose levels\r\nLipid profile\r\nThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels\r\nB-type natriuretic peptide levels\r\nN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide\r\nElectrocardiography\r\nChest radiography\r\n2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography\r\nNuclear imaging [9]\r\nMaximal exercise testing\r\nPulse oximetry or arterial blood gas\r\nSee Workup for more detail.\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nTreatment includes the following:\r\n\r\nNonpharmacologic therapy: Oxygen and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, dietary sodium and fluid restriction, physical activity as appropriate, and attention to weight gain\r\nPharmacotherapy: Diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic agents, anticoagulants, beta blockers, and digoxin\r\nSurgical options\r\n\r\nSurgical treatment options include the following:\r\n\r\nElectrophysiologic intervention\r\nRevascularization procedures\r\nValve replacement/repair\r\nVentricular restoration\r\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation\r\nVentricular assist devices\r\nHeart transplantation\r\nTotal artificial heart\r\nSee Treatment and Medication for more detail.'
heartFail2.txt,'There are lots of reasons why you might be diagnosed with heart failure. It can be sudden or it can happen slowly over months or even years.\r\n\r\nThe most common causes are:\r\n\r\nheart attack\r\nhigh blood pressure\r\ncardiomyopathy (diseases of the heart muscle. Sometimes these are inherited from your family and sometimes they are caused by other things, such as viral infections).\r\nHeart failure can also be caused by:\r\n\r\nheart valve problems\r\nalcohol or recreational drugs\r\nan uncontrolled irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\r\ncongenital heart conditions (ones youre born with)\r\na viral infection affecting the heart muscle\r\nsome cancer treatments.\r\nHeart health and cancer treatment cover imageIf you are having treatment for cancer and have a heart condition, or have been told that your treatment may affect your heart, you might find Heart health and cancer treatment helpful. It\'s a new booklet jointly produced by Macmillan Cancer Support and the British Heart Foundation and you can order free copies online from Macmillan Cancer Support.\r\n\r\nPulmonary hypertension\r\nHeart failure can also be caused by pulmonary hypertension (raised blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply your lungs). This condition can damage the right side of your heart, leading to heart failure. In some cases the pulmonary hypertension itself is caused by an existing heart condition.\r\n\r\nFind out more about pulmonary hypertension on NHS Choices.\r\n\r\nWhat are the symptoms of heart failure?\r\nThe main symptoms are:\r\n\r\nshortness of breath - when you are being active or at rest\r\nswelling - of your feet, ankles, stomach and lower back areas\r\nfatigue - feeling unusually tired or weak\r\nSymptoms occur because the heart does not have enough strength to pump blood all the way round the body efficiently. This can cause fluid to pool in the feet and legs.  If this fluid is left unmanaged, it can build and spread to your stomach area and sit beneath your lungs. This reduces their ability to expand and makes you short of breath.\r\n\r\nMedication and making changes to the way you live can make a real difference to these symptoms. People with heart failure experience different symptoms and everyone copes in different ways, so speak to your GP and your heart failure nurse about what is best for you.\r\n\r\nFor more information about understanding and managing the symptoms of heart failure, take a look at our advice and information on living with heart failure.\r\n\r\nHow is heart failure diagnosed?\r\nTo diagnose heart failure, your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history, talk about your symptom and do a physical examination. In most cases you will also have further tests to confirm the diagnosis and guide how your symptoms are controlled. These include blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a chest x-ray, an echocardiogram and a coronary angiogram.\r\n\r\nYou may hear your doctor talk about the ejection fraction of your heart. This refers to the amount of blood that is pushed out of your left ventricle every time your heart beats. Its usually expressed as a percentage. A normal ejection fraction is around 50-65 per cent, as there is always some blood left in the heart after each heartbeat. Some people with heart failure have a normal ejection fraction, so ejection fraction is used alongside other tests to help diagnose heart failure.\r\n\r\nAfter a diagnosis, your doctor may discuss your \'stage\' or \'class\' of heart failure. There are four classes, which are based on your symptoms and how they affect you. The higher the number of the class you are in, the more serious your heart failure has become.  It is also possible to move between stages as you may have episodes where your heart failure is worse because of other events, such as a further heart attack.\r\n\r\nWhat treatments are available for heart failure?\r\nWhile there isn\'t a cure for heart failure at the moment, the treatments available to control symptoms are helping many people live full and active lives.\r\n\r\nYour doctor is likely to prescribe drugs that will help control your blood pressure and help the pumping action of your heart.\r\n\r\nThey will also give you advice about making changes to your lifestyle such as cutting down on salt, which will help control your blood pressure, and stopping smoking.\r\n\r\nA combination of medication and lifestyle changes will hopefully help you continue to do the things you enjoy, by helping you manage your symptoms and keeping your condition as stable as possible.\r\n\r\nSome people with heart failure will benefit from a pacemaker or ICD.

heartTrans1.txt,'A heart transplant is surgery to remove a damaged or diseased heart and replace it with a healthy donor heart.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nFinding a donor heart can be difficult. The heart must be donated by someone who is brain-dead but is still on life support. The donor heart must be matched as closely as possible to your tissue type to reduce the chance that your body will reject it.\r\n\r\nYou are put into a deep sleep with general anesthesia, and a cut is made through the breastbone.\r\n\r\nYour blood flows through a heart-lung bypass machine while the surgeon works on your heart. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped, and supplies your body with blood and oxygen.\r\nYour diseased heart is removed and the donor heart is stitched in place. The heart-lung machine is then disconnected. Blood flows through the transplanted heart.\r\nTubes are inserted to drain air, fluid, and blood out of the chest for several days, and to allow the lungs to fully re-expand.\r\nIn some cases, the surgeon will not remove the old heart, but will put the new heart on top of it (heterotopic transplant).\r\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\r\nA heart transplant may be done to treat:\r\n\r\nSevere angina that can no longer be treated with medications or other surgeries\r\nSevere heart failure, when medicines, other treatments, and surgery no longer help\r\nSevere heart defects that were present at birth and cannot be fixed with surgery\r\nLife-threatening abnormal heartbeats or rhythms that do not respond to other treatments\r\nHeart transplant surgery may not be used in patients who:\r\n\r\nAre malnourished\r\nAre older than age 55 to 60\r\nHave had a severe stroke or dementia\r\nHave had cancer\r\nHave HIV infection\r\nHave infections, such as hepatitis, that are active\r\nHave insulin-dependent diabetes and other organs that aren\'t working correctly\r\nHave kidney, lung, nerve, or liver disease\r\nHave no family support and do not follow their treatment\r\nHave other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the neck and leg\r\nHave pulmonary hypertension (thickening of blood vessels in the lung)\r\nSmoke or abuse alcohol or drugs, or have other lifestyle habits that may damage the new heart\r\nThe doctor may not recommend a heart transplant if the patient may not be able to keep up with the many hospital and doctor\'s office visits, tests, and medications needed to keep the new heart healthy.\r\n\r\nRisks\r\nRisks from any anesthesia are:\r\n\r\nReactions to medications\r\nProblems breathing\r\nRisks from any surgery are:\r\n\r\nBleeding\r\nInfection\r\nRisks of transplant include:\r\n\r\nBlood clots (deep venous thrombosis)\r\nDamage to the kidneys, liver, or other organs from anti-rejection medications\r\nDevelopment of cancer from the drugs used to prevent rejection\r\nHeart attack or stroke\r\nHeart rhythm problems\r\nHigh cholesterol levels, diabetes, and bone thinning from the use of rejection medications\r\nIncreased risk for infections due to anti-rejection medications\r\nRejection of the heart\r\nSevere coronary artery disease\r\nWound infections\r\nBefore the Procedure\r\nOnce the doctor refers you to a transplant center, you will be evaluated by the transplant team. They will want to make sure that you are a good candidate for a transplant. You will visit many times over several weeks or even months. You will need to have blood drawn and x-rays taken. The following may also be done:\r\n\r\nBlood or skin tests to check for infections\r\nTests of your kidney and liver\r\nTests to evaluate your heart, such as EKG, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization\r\nTests to look for cancer\r\nTissue and blood typing, to help make sure your body will not reject the donated heart\r\nYou will want to look at one or more transplant centers to see which would be best for you:\r\n\r\nAsk them how many transplants they perform every year and what their survival rates are. Compare these numbers with the numbers from other centers.\r\nAsk what support groups they have available and how much help they offer with travel and housing.\r\nAsk about the costs of medications you will need to take afterwards.\r\nIf the transplant team believes you are a good candidate, you will be put on a national waiting list for a heart:\r\n\r\nYour place on the list is based on several factors. Key factors include the type and severity of your heart disease, and the likelihood that a transplant will be successful.\r\nThe amount of time you spend on a waiting list is usually NOT a factor for how soon you get a heart, except in the case of children.\r\nMost, but not all, patients who are waiting for heart transplants are very ill and need to be in the hospital. Many will need some sort of device to help their heart pump enough blood to the body. Most often this is a ventricular assist device (artificial heart-like device).\r\n\r\nAfter the Procedure\r\nYou should expect to stay in the hospital for 7 to 21 days after a heart transplant. The first 24 to 48 hours will likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). During the first few days after a transplant, you will need close follow-up to make sure that you do not get an infection and your heart is working well.\r\n\r\nThe recovery period is about 6 months. Often, your transplant team will ask you to stay fairly close to the hospital for the first 3 months. You will need to have regular check-ups with blood tests, x-rays, and echocardiograms for many years.\r\n\r\nFighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body\'s immune system considers the transplanted organ an infection and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take drugs that suppress the body\'s immune response. Taking medicines and following your doctor\'s instructions carefully is very important to preventing rejection.\r\n\r\nBiopsies of the heart muscle are often done every month during the first 6 to 12 months after transplant, and then less often after that. This helps the doctor determine if your body is rejecting the new heart, even before you have symptoms.\r\n\r\nYou must take drugs that prevent transplant rejection for the rest of your life. You will need to understand how to take these medications, and know their side effects.\r\n\r\nYou can go back to your normal activities as soon as you feel well enough, and after talking with your doctor. However, avoid vigorous physical activity.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that you do not develop coronary disease after a transplant, you may have cardiac catheterization every year.\r\n\r\nOutlook (Prognosis)\r\nHeart transplant prolongs the life of patients who would otherwise die. About 80\% of heart transplant patients are alive 2 years after the operation. At 5 years, 70\% of people will still be alive after a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nThe main problem, as with other transplants, is rejection. If rejection can be controlled, survival increases to over 10 years.\r\n\r\nAlternative Names\r\nCardiac transplant; Transplant - heart; Transplantation - heart\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nBernstein D.

In order to remove the heart from the donor, two or more doctors must declare the donor brain-dead.\r\n\r\nBefore a person can be put on a waiting list for a heart transplant, a doctor makes the determination that this is the best treatment option available for the person\'s heart failure.\r\n\r\nAbout the heart\r\n\r\nThe heart is the hardest working muscle in the human body. Located almost in the center of the chest, the adult human heart is about the size of one fist.\r\n\r\nAt an average rate of 80 times a minute, the heart beats about 115,000 times in one day or 42 million times in a year. During an average lifetime, the human heart will beat more than 3 billion times, pumping an amount of blood that equals about 1 million barrels. Even when a person is at rest, the heart is continuously hard at work.\r\n\r\nHow the heart works\r\n\r\n Anatomy of the heart and location of heart in the body\r\nClick image to enlarge\r\nThe cardiovascular system, composed of the heart and blood vessels, is responsible for circulating blood throughout your body to supply the tissues with oxygen and nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe heart is the muscle that pumps blood filled with oxygen and nutrients through the blood vessels to the body tissues. It is made up of:\r\n\r\nFour chambers (two atria and two ventricles) that receive blood from the body (the atria) and pump out blood to it (the ventricles).\r\n\r\nThe right atrium receives blood from the body, which is low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nThe right ventricle pumps the blood from the right atrium into the lungs to provide it with oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. \r\n\r\nThe left atrium receives blood from the lungs, which is rich in oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe left ventricle pumps the blood from the left atrium into the body, supplying all organs with blood.\r\n\r\nBlood vessels, which compose a network of arteries and veins that carry blood throughout the body.\r\n\r\nArteries transport blood from the heart to the body tissues.\r\n\r\nVeins carry blood back to the heart.\r\n\r\nFour valves to prevent backward flow of blood.\r\n\r\nEach valve is designed to allow the forward flow of blood and prevent  backward flow.\r\n\r\nAn electrical system of the heart that stimulates contraction of the heart muscle.\r\n\r\nReasons for the procedure\r\n\r\nHeart transplantation is performed to replace a failing heart that cannot be adequately treated by other means.\r\n\r\nCongestive heart failure (CHF)\r\n\r\nEnd-stage heart failure is a disease in which the heart muscle is failing severely in its attempt to pump blood through the body, and in which all other available treatments are no longer helping to improve the heart\'s function. End-stage heart failure is the final stage of heart failure. Heart failure, also called congestive heart failure, or CHF, is a condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood sufficiently. Despite its name, a diagnosis of heart failure does NOT mean the heart is about to stop beating. The term \"failure\" refers to the fact that the heart muscle is failing to pump blood in the normal manner because it has become weakened.\r\n\r\nSome causes of CHF, or weakening of the heart muscle, may include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nHeart attack (also called myocardial infarction)\r\n\r\nViral infection of the heart muscle\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\r\n\r\nValvular heart disease\r\n\r\nCongenital (present at birth) heart conditions\r\n\r\nCardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)\r\n\r\nPulmonary hypertension (elevated blood pressure within the lungs\' blood vessels)\r\n\r\nAlcoholism or drug abuse\r\n\r\nChronic lung diseases, such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\r\n\r\nCardiomyopathy (an enlargement of the heart muscle)\r\n\r\nAnemia (low red blood cell count)\r\n\r\nThere may be other reasons for your doctor to recommend heart transplantation.\r\n\r\nRisks of the procedure\r\n\r\nAs with any surgery, complications may occur. Potential risks associated with heart transplantation may include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nInfection\r\n\r\nBleeding during or after the surgery\r\n\r\nBlood clots that can cause heart attack, stroke, or lung problems\r\n\r\nBreathing problems\r\n\r\nKidney failure\r\n\r\nCoronary arteriopathy (similar to coronary artery disease)\r\n\r\nThe new heart may be rejected by the body\'s immune system. Rejection is the body\'s normal reaction to a foreign object or tissue. When a new heart is transplanted into a recipient\'s body, the immune system reacts to what it perceives as a threat and attacks the new organ, not realizing that the transplanted heart is beneficial. To allow the transplanted organ to survive in a new body, medications must be taken to trick the immune system into accepting the transplant and not attacking it as a foreign object.\r\n\r\nThe medications used to prevent or treat rejection have side effects. The exact side effects will depend on the specific medications that are taken.\r\n\r\nContraindications for heart transplantation include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nCurrent or recurring infection that cannot be treated effectively\r\n\r\nMetastatic cancer. This is when cancer has spread from its primary location to one or more additional locations in the body.\r\n\r\nSevere medical problems preventing the ability to tolerate the surgical procedure\r\n\r\nSerious conditions other than heart disease that would not improve after transplantation\r\n\r\nNoncompliance with treatment regimen\r\n\r\nThere may be other risks depending on your specific medical condition. Be sure to discuss any concerns with your doctor prior to the procedure.\r\n\r\nBefore the procedure\r\n\r\nBecause of the wide range of information necessary to determine eligibility for transplant, the evaluation process is carried out by a transplant team. The team includes a transplant surgeon, a transplant cardiologist (doctor specializing in the treatment of the heart), one or more transplant nurses, a social worker, and a psychiatrist or psychologist. Additional team members may include a dietician, a chaplain, and/or an anesthesiologist.\r\n\r\nComponents of the transplant evaluation process include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nPsychological and social evaluation. Psychological and social issues involved in organ transplantation, such as stress, financial issues, and support by family and/or significant others are assessed. These issues can significantly affect the outcome of a transplant.\r\n\r\nBlood tests. Blood tests are performed to help determine a good donor match and to help improve the chances that the donor organ will not be rejected.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests may be performed to assess your lungs as well as your overall health status. These tests may include X-rays, ultrasound procedures, computed tomography (CT scan), pulmonary function tests, and dental examinations. Women may receive a Pap test, gynecology evaluation, and a mammogram.\r\n\r\nOther preparations. Several immunizations will be given to decrease the chances of developing infections that can affect the transplanted heart.\r\n\r\nThe transplant team will consider all information from interviews, your medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests in determining your eligibility for heart transplantation.\r\n\r\nOnce you have been accepted as a transplant candidate, you will be placed on the United Network for Organ Sharing list. When a donor organ becomes available, heart recipients are selected based on the severity of their condition and their blood type. You will be notified and told to come to the hospital immediately so you can be prepared for the transplant.\r\n\r\nThe following steps will precede the transplant:\r\n\r\nYour doctor will explain the procedure to you and offer you the opportunity to ask any questions that you might have about the procedure.\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to sign a consent form that gives your permission to do the surgery. Read the form carefully and ask questions if something is not clear.\r\n\r\nYou should begin to fast once you are notified that a heart has become available.\r\n\r\nYou may receive a sedative prior to the procedure to help you relax.\r\n\r\nBased on your medical condition, your doctor may request other specific preparation.\r\n\r\nDuring the procedure\r\n\r\nHeart transplantation requires a stay in a hospital. Procedures may vary depending on your condition and your doctor\'s practices.\r\n\r\nGenerally, heart transplantation follows this process:\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to remove any jewelry or other objects that may interfere with the procedure.\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to remove your clothing and will be given a gown to wear.\r\n\r\nAn intravenous (IV) line will be started in your hand or arm prior to the procedure for injection of medication and to administer IV fluids, if needed. Additional catheters will be inserted in your neck and wrist to monitor the status of your heart and blood pressure, as well as for obtaining blood samples. Alternate sites for the additional catheters include the subclavian (under the collarbone) area and the groin.\r\n\r\nA catheter will be inserted into your bladder to drain urine.\r\n\r\nIf there is excessive hair at the surgical site, it may be clipped off.\r\n\r\nHeart transplant surgery will be performed while you are asleep under general anesthesia. A tube will be inserted through your mouth into your lungs. The tube will be attached to a ventilator that will breathe for you during the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe anesthesiologist will continuously monitor your heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen level during the surgery.\r\n\r\nThe skin over the surgical site will be cleansed with an antiseptic solution.\r\n\r\nThe doctor will make an incision (cut) down the center of the chest from just below the Adam\'s apple to just above the navel.\r\n\r\nThe sternum (breastbone) will be divided in half with a special operating instrument. The doctor will separate the two halves of the breastbone and spread them apart to expose the heart.\r\n\r\nTubes will be inserted into the chest so that the blood can be pumped through your body by a cardiopulmonary bypass machine (heart-lung machine).\r\n\r\nOnce the blood has been completely diverted into the cardiopulmonary bypass machine for pumping, the diseased heart will be removed.\r\n\r\nThe donor heart will be sewn into place. Once the new heart is in place, blood vessels will be connected.\r\n\r\nWhen the transplant procedure has been completed, the blood circulating through the cardiopulmonary bypass machine will be allowed back into the heart and the tubes to the machine removed. The heart will be shocked with small paddles to restart the heartbeat.\r\n\r\nOnce your new heart begins to beat again, the physician will observe the heart to assess the function of the heart and to make sure there are no leaks where the blood vessels are connected.\r\n\r\nTemporary wires for pacing may be inserted into the heart. These wires can be attached to a pacemaker and your heart can be paced, if needed, during the initial recovery period.\r\n\r\nThe sternum will be rejoined and sewn together with small wires.\r\n\r\nThe skin over the sternum will be sewn back together. The incision will be closed with sutures or surgical staples.\r\n\r\nTubes will be inserted into your chest to drain blood and other fluids from around the heart. These tubes will be connected to a suction device to drain fluids away from the heart.\r\n\r\nA sterile bandage or dressing will be applied.\r\n\r\nAfter the procedure\r\n\r\nIn the hospital\r\n\r\nAfter the surgery you may be taken to the recovery room before being taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) to be closely monitored for several days. Alternatively, you may be taken directly to the ICU from the operating room. You will be connected to monitors that will constantly display your electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) tracing, blood pressure, other pressure readings, breathing rate, and your oxygen level. Heart transplant surgery requires an in-hospital stay of seven to 14 days, or longer.\r\n\r\nYou will have a tube in your throat so that your breathing may be assisted with a ventilator until you are stable enough to breathe on your own. The breathing tube may remain in place for a few hours up to several days, depending on your situation.\r\n\r\nYou may have a thin, plastic tube inserted through your nose into your stomach to remove air that you swallow. The tube will be removed when your bowels resume normal function. You will not be able to eat or drink until the tube is removed.\r\n\r\nBlood samples will be taken frequently to monitor the status of the new heart, as well as other body functions, such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, and blood system.\r\n\r\nYou may be on special IV drips to help your blood pressure and your heart, and to control any problems with bleeding. As your condition stabilizes, these drips will be gradually decreased and turned off as your condition allows.\r\n\r\nAfter the breathing tube is out, your nurse will assist you to cough and take deep breaths every two hours. This will be uncomfortable due to soreness, but it is extremely important that you do this in order to keep mucus from collecting in your lungs and possibly causing pneumonia.\r\n\r\nYou may receive pain medication as needed, either by a nurse, or by administering it yourself through a device connected to your intravenous line.\r\n\r\nOnce the breathing and stomach tubes have been removed and your condition has stabilized, you may start liquids to drink. Your diet may be gradually advanced to more solid foods as you tolerate them.\r\n\r\nYour immunosuppression (anti-rejection) medications will be closely monitored to make sure you are receiving the optimum dose and the best combination of medications.\r\n\r\nNurses, respiratory therapists, and physical therapists will work with you as you begin physical therapy and breathing exercises.\r\n\r\nWhen your doctor decides you are ready, you will be moved from the ICU to a private room on a postsurgical unit or transplant unit. Your recovery will continue to progress. Your activity will be gradually increased as you get out of bed and walk around for longer periods of time. Your diet will be advanced to solid foods as tolerated.\r\n\r\nNurses, pharmacists, dietitians, physical therapists, and other members of the transplant team will teach you how to take care of yourself once you are discharged from the hospital.\r\n\r\nAt home\r\n\r\nOnce you are home, it will be important to keep the surgical area clean and dry. Your doctor will give you specific bathing instructions. The sutures or surgical staples will be removed during a follow-up office visit, if they were not removed before leaving the hospital.\r\n\r\nYou should not drive until your doctor tells you to. Other activity restrictions may apply.\r\n\r\nFollow-up visits will be scheduled frequently after returning home from the hospital. These visits may include blood tests, chest X-ray, and biopsy (removal of tissue from the heart for examination under a microscope.) The transplant team will explain the schedule for these tests. The rehabilitation program will continue for many months.\r\n\r\nNotify your doctor to report any of the following:\r\n\r\nFever and/or chills that may be a sign of infection or rejection\r\n\r\nRedness, swelling, or bleeding or drainage from the incision site\r\n\r\nIncrease in pain around the incision site\r\n\r\nDifficulty breathing\r\n\r\nYour doctor may give you additional or alternate instructions after the procedure, depending on your particular situation.\r\n\r\nWhat is done to prevent rejection?\r\n\r\nTo allow the transplanted heart to survive in your body, you will be given medications for the rest of your life to fight rejection. Each person may react differently to medications, and each transplant team has preferences for different medications. The anti-rejection medications most commonly used include:\r\n\r\nCyclosporine\r\n\r\nTacrolimus\r\n\r\nAzathioprine\r\n\r\nMycophenolate mofetil\r\n\r\nPrednisone\r\n\r\nSirolimus\r\n\r\nMethotrexate\r\n\r\nNew anti-rejection medications are continually being approved. Doctors tailor medication regimes to meet the needs of each individual patient.\r\n\r\nUsually, several anti-rejection medications are given initially. The doses of these medications may change frequently, depending on your response. Because anti-rejection medications affect the immune system, people who receive a transplant will be at higher risk for infections. A balance must be maintained between preventing rejection and making you very susceptible to infection.\r\n\r\nSome of the infections you will be especially susceptible to include oral yeast infection (thrush), herpes, and respiratory viruses. You should avoid contact with crowds and anyone who has an infection for the first few months after your surgery.\r\n\r\nTo assess for rejection of the new heart, you will likely undergo a routine right heart biopsy on a regular basis for a period of time. The biopsy procedure is typically done once a week in the early period after a transplant, then gradually changed to monthly or longer intervals. The biopsy procedures may be discontinued eventually. \r\n\r\nThe right heart biopsy procedure may be done as an outpatient or as an inpatient if you are already in the hospital. The procedure involves a right heart catheterization. A special catheter (or biopsy forceps or bioptome) is placed into the right ventricle of the heart. A series of about four to six biopsy samples is taken using a biopsy catheter, and the tissue is analyzed in the lab for signs of rejection. If rejection is defined, your anti-rejection medications may be adjusted by your doctor. The biopsy procedure has its own instructions and risks. \r\n\r\nWhat are the signs of rejection?\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most common symptoms of rejection. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:\r\n\r\nFever\r\n\r\nFluid collection in the lung\r\n\r\nDecreased oxygen level in the blood\r\n\r\nShortness of breath\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of rejection may resemble other medical conditions or problems. Consult your transplant team with any concerns you have.

It means your heart needs some support to do its job, usually in the form of medicines.\r\nBreathlessness, feeling very tired and ankle swelling are the main symptoms of heart failure. But all of these symptoms can have other causes, only some of which are serious.\r\nThe symptoms of heart failure can develop quickly (acute heart failure). If this happens, you will need to be treated in hospital. But they can also develop gradually (chronic heart failure).\r\nRead more about the symptoms of heart failure.\r\nTypes of heart failure\r\nThere are three main types of heart failure. They are:\r\nheart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) – this is because the part of the heart that pumps blood around your body (the left ventricle) becomes weak \r\nheart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) – usually a result of the left ventricle become stiff, causing difficulty filling with blood\r\nheart failure caused by diseased or damaged heart valves\r\nIt is important the type of heart failure you have is identified as it will affect the type of treatment you will be offered. A number of tests can be used to help diagnose heart failure.\r\nYou should also have blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. These are used to investigate your heart and check how well it is functioning. If you have not had these tests, you should ask your doctor for an explanation.\r\nRead more about how heart failure is diagnosed.\r\nWhat causes heart failure?\r\nHeart failure does not often have a single cause. A number of problems usually \"gang up\" on the heart, causing it to fail.\r\nThere are a number of health conditions that increase your chances of developing heart failure, including:\r\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension) – this can put extra strain on the heart, which over time can lead to heart failure\r\ncoronary heart disease (CHD) – where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged up by fatty substances (atherosclerosis), and may cause angina or a heart attack\r\nheart muscle weakness (cardiomyopathy) – this can cause heart failure; the reasons for this are often unclear, but it may be genetic in origin, or caused by an infection (usually viral), alcohol misuse, or medication used to treat cancer\r\nheart rhythm disturbance (atrial fibrillation)\r\nheart valve disease, damage or problems with the heart\'s valves\r\nSometimes anaemia, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also lead to heart failure.\r\nRead more about the causes of heart failure.\r\nTreating heart failure\r\nIn most cases, heart failure is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured. Treatment therefore aims to find a combination of measures, including lifestyle changes, medicines, devices or surgery that will improve heart function or help the body get rid of excess water.\r\nA cure may be possible in cases where heart failure has a specific cause. For example, if your heart valves are damaged, it may be possible to replace them, which can cure the condition.\r\nAs treatment will usually be lifelong, you and your doctor will need to find a balance of effective treatments that you can manage in the long term so you have the best symptom control and quality of life possible.\r\nEffective treatment for heart failure can have the following benefits:\r\nit helps make the heart stronger\r\nit improves your symptoms\r\nit reduces the risk of a flare-up\r\nit allows people with the condition to live longer and fuller lives\r\nRead more about how heart failure is treated.\r\nPreventing heart failure\r\nMany of the factors that increase your risk of developing heart failure can be managed either by making lifestyle changes or by taking medicines.\r\nFor example, in terms of lifestyle factors, you should:\r\nstop smoking (if you smoke)\r\nkeep your blood pressure at a healthy level\r\nkeep your cholesterol level under control\r\nmaintain a healthy weight (neither too fat nor too thin)\r\neat healthily, including avoiding excess salt in your diet (but severe salt restriction is rarely necessary and is not good for most people); most people should also ensure they have enough iron in their diet (eating red meat or iron supplements can help this)\r\nexercise regularly\r\nlimit your alcohol consumption\r\nRead more about preventing heart failure.\r\nLiving with heart failure\r\nBeing diagnosed with heart failure may come as a shock. While the outlook is related to age, the severity of the heart condition, and any other health problems that may exist, such as lung or kidney disease, anaemia and diabetes, it also depends on what you do to reduce your risk.\r\nSelf care means taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing, with support from the people who are involved in your care.\r\nIt is very important that you take any prescribed medication, even after you feel better. Some medicines are designed to protect or heal your heart.\r\nIf you do not take them, they cannot help and the underlying problem will get worse. The medicines can prevent or delay your heart problem and stop symptoms getting worse.\r\nSpeak to your healthcare team if you have any questions or concerns about the medication you are taking or any potential side effects.\r\nAs heart failure is a long-term condition, you will have regular contact with your healthcare team. Developing a good relationship with the members of your team will enable you to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you have.

heart_failure_8.txt,'﻿Valvular heart disease is any disease process involving one or more of the four valves of the heart (the aortic and mitral valves on the left and the pulmonary and tricuspid valves on the right). These conditions occur largely as a result of aging. Most people are in their late 50s when diagnosed, and more than one in ten people over 75 have it.\r\n\r\nEarly detection may improve outcomes from surgery.\r\n\r\nCollectively and anatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue makeup of the heart known as the cardiac skeleton. Valve problems may be congenital (inborn) or acquired (due to another cause later in life). Treatment may be with medication but often (depending on the severity) involves valve repair or replacement (insertion of an artificial heart valve). Specific situations include those where additional demands are made on the circulation, such as in pregnancy.[1]\r\n\r\nPhonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png\r\nValve involved\tStenotic disease\tInsufficiency/regurgitation disease\r\nAortic valve\tAortic valve stenosis\tAortic insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nMitral valve\tMitral valve stenosis\tMitral insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nTricuspid valve\tTricuspid valve stenosis\tTricuspid insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nPulmonary valve\tPulmonary valve stenosis\tPulmonary insufficiency/regurgitation\r\nAortic and mitral valve disorders[edit]\r\nThese are termed left heart diseases.\r\n\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders[edit]\r\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve diseases are right heart diseases. Pulmonary valve diseases are the least common heart valve disease in adults.[2]\r\n\r\nThe most common types of pulmonary valve diseases are:\r\n\r\npulmonary valve stenosis\r\npulmonary valve insufficiency\r\npulmonary valve incompetence\r\npulmonary valve regurgitation\r\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases classifies non rheumatic pulmonary valve diseases as I37.\r\n\r\nBoth tricuspid and pulmonary valve diseases are less common than aortic or mitral valve diseases due to the lower pressure those valves experience.[2]\r\n\r\nDysplasia[edit]\r\nHeart valve dysplasia is an error in the development of any of the heart valves, and a common cause of congenital heart defects in humans as well as animals; tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect with four abnormalities, one of which is stenosis of the pulmonary valve. Ebstein\'s anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve.[1]\r\n\r\nRheumatic disorders[edit]\r\nValvular heart disease resulting from rheumatic fever is referred to as \"rheumatic heart disease\". While developed countries once had a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, medical advances and improved social conditions have dramatically reduced their incidence. Many developing countries, as well as indigenous populations within developed countries, still carry a significant burden of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and there has been a resurgence in efforts to eradicate the diseases in these populations. Inflammation of the heart valves due to any cause is called endocarditis; this is usually due to bacterial infection but may also be due to cancer (marantic endocarditis), certain autoimmune conditions (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (Loeffler endocarditis). Certain medications have been associated with valvular heart disease, most prominently ergotamine derivatives pergolide and cabergoline.[3]\r\n\r\nIn pregnancy[edit]\r\nThe evaluation of individuals with valvular heart disease who are or wish to become pregnant is a difficult issue. Issues that have to be addressed include the risks during pregnancy to the mother and the developing fetus by the presence of maternal valvular heart disease as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy. Normal physiological changes during pregnancy require, on average, a 50\% increase in circulating blood volume that is accompanied by an increase in cardiac output that usually peaks between the midportion of the second and third trimesters.[4] The increased cardiac output is due to an increase in the stroke volume, and a small increase in heart rate, averaging 10 to 20 beats per minute.[4] Additionally uterine circulation and endogenous hormones cause systemic vascular resistance to decrease and a disproportionately lowering of diastolic blood pressure causes a wide pulse pressure.[4] Inferior vena caval obstruction from a gravid uterus in the supine position can result in an abrupt decrease in cardiac preload, which leads to hypotension with weakness and lightheadedness.[4] During labor and delivery cardiac output increases more in part due to the associated anxiety and pain, as well as due to uterine contractions which will cause an increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[4]\r\n\r\nValvular heart lesions associated with high maternal and fetal risk during pregnancy include:[4]\r\n\r\nSevere aortic stenosis with or without symptoms\r\nAortic regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nMitral stenosis with NYHA functional class II-IV symptoms\r\nMitral regurgitation with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease resulting in severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary pressure greater than 75\% of systemic pressures)\r\nAortic and/or mitral valve disease with severe LV dysfunction (EF less than 0.40)\r\nMechanical prosthetic valve requiring anticoagulation\r\nMarfan syndrome with or without aortic regurgitation\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nIn individuals who require an artificial heart valve, consideration must be made for deterioration of the valve over time (for bioprosthetic valves) versus the risks of blood clotting in pregnancy with mechanical valves with the resultant need of drugs in pregnancy in the form of anticoagulation.\r\n\r\nComparison[edit]\r\nThe following table includes the main types of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Major types of valvular heart disease not included in the table include mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis.\r\n\r\nValvular disease\tMitral stenosis\tAortic stenosis\tAortic regurgitation\tMitral regurgitation\tTricuspid regurgitation\r\nPrevalence\tMost common valvular heart disease in pregnancy[5]\tApproximately 2\% of people over the age of 65, 3\% of people over age 75, and 4\% percent of people over age 85[6]\t\t2\% of the population, equally in males and females.[7]\t\r\nMain causes and risk factors\tAlmost always caused by rheumatic heart disease[8]\t\r\nCalcification of tricuspid aortic valve with age[8]\r\n(>50\%[9])\r\nCalcification of bicuspid aortic valve[8]\r\n(30-40\%[9])\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\n(<10\%[9])\r\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia and uremia may speed up the process.[9]\r\n\r\nAcute\r\nInfective endocarditis[8][9]\r\nTrauma[8]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nPrimary valvular: rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan\'s syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus[8]\r\nDisease of the aortic root: syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behçet\'s disease, reactive arthritis, systemic hypertension[8]\r\nAcute\r\nEndocarditis, mainly S. aureus[8]\r\nPapillary muscle rupture or dysfunction,[8] including mitral valve prolapse[9]\r\nChronic\r\n\r\nRheumatic fever[8]\r\nMarfan\'s syndrome[8]\r\nCardiomyopathy[8]\r\nUsually secondary to right ventricular dilation[8]\r\nleft ventricular failure is, in turn, the most common cause[8]\r\nRight ventricular infarction[8]\r\nInferior myocardial infarction[8]\r\nCor pulmonale[8]\r\nOther causes: Tricuspid endocarditis, rheumatic fever, Ebstein\'s anomaly, carcinoid syndrome and myxomatous degeneration[8]\r\nHemo\r\ndynamics\r\n/\r\nPatho-\r\nphysiology\tProgressive obstruction of the mitral ostium causes increased pressure in the left atrium and the pulmonary circulation.[9] Congestion may cause thromboembolism, and atrial hypertension may cause atrial fibrillation.[9]\tObstruction through the aortic ostium causes increased pressure in the left ventricle and impaired flow through the aorta\tInsufficiency of the aortic valve causes backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole.\tInsufficiency of the mitral valve causes backflow of blood into the left atrium during systole.\tInsufficiency of the tricuspid valve causes backflow of blood into the right atrium during systole.\r\nSymptoms\t\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nChest pain[8]\r\nHemoptysis[8]\r\nThromboembolism[8]\r\nAscites and edema (if right-sided heart failure develops)[8]\r\nSymptoms increase with exercise and pregnancy[8]\r\n\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion (most frequent symptom[9]), orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nSyncope, usually exertional[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nAngina pectoris[8]\r\nIn acute cases: cyanosis and circulatory shock[8]\r\nHeart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea[8]\r\nPalpitations[8]\r\nPulmonary edema[8]\r\nSymptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as ascites, hepatomegaly, edema and jugular venous distension[8]\r\nMedical signs\t\r\nOpening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic rumble with presystolic accentuation.[8][9]\r\nThe opening snap follows closer to the S2 heart tone with worsening stenosis.[8]\r\nThe murmur is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope[8] lying on the left side[9] and its duration increases with worsening disease.[8]\r\nLoud S1 -
