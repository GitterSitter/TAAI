Anthracyclines and newer targeted\r\n      therapies, including trastuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are important\r\n      agents implemented in clinical practice that carry cardiotoxic risk. While acute \r\n      heart failure is often self-limited and reversible, delayed-onset heart failure\r\n      significantly reduces survival. Extremes of age, renal dysfunction, pre-existing \r\n      coronary artery disease, HER2 positivity, and multi-drug therapy are predictors\r\n      of irreversible heart failure after chemotherapy. Left ventricular assist device \r\n      (LVAD) implantation and cardiac transplantation can be performed safely in\r\n      patients with end-stage heart failure (HF) from chemotherapy. However,\r\n      co-existing right ventricular dysfunction, hepatic congestion, and increased risk\r\n      of bleeding make LVAD therapy challenging and dependent on careful patient\r\n      selection. Cardiac transplantation in patients with chemotherapy-induced heart\r\n      failure can be performed with good 10-year survival, but requires 5 years of\r\n      cancer freedom and post-transplant infections remain a problem. Improvements in\r\n      LVAD therapy and the expanding role of the total artificial heart and other\r\n      durable biventricular support devices will likely provide more reliable surgical \r\n      options for the management of end-stage HF after chemotherapy.\r\nFAU - Deo, Salil V\r\nAU  - Deo SV\r\nAD  - Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Center, Harrington Heart and Vascular\r\n      Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve\r\n      University, 11100 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.\r\nFAU - Al-Kindi, Sadeer G\r\nAU  - Al-Kindi SG\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Guilherme H\r\nAU  - Oliveira GH\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med\r\nJT  - Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine\r\nJID - 9815942\r\nEDAT- 2015/05/12 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/05/12 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2015/05/12 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1007/s11936-015-0388-8 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2015 Jun;17(6):388. doi:\r\n      10.1007/s11936-015-0388-8.'

In selected patients, these improvements are\r\n      sufficient to allow ultimate device explantation without requiring\r\n      transplantation; this represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of\r\n      heart failure. Like heart failure itself, LVADs influence multiple biological\r\n      systems. The transverse tubules are a system of membrane invaginations in\r\n      ventricular cardiomyocytes which allow rapid propagation of the action potential \r\n      throughout the cell. Through their dense concentration of L-type Ca2+ channels in\r\n      close proximity with intracellular Ryanodine receptors, the t-tubules enable\r\n      synchronous Ca2+ release throughout the cell. The t-tubules\' structure appears to\r\n      be specifically regulated by mechanical load, such that either the overload of\r\n      heart failure (or the spontaneously hypertensive rat model (Song et al., 2006))\r\n      or the profound unloading in a chronically unloaded heart result in impaired\r\n      t-tubule structure, with ineffective Ca2+ release. While there are multiple\r\n      molecular pathways which underpin t-tubule regulation, Tcap appears to be\r\n      important in regulating the effect of altered loading on the t-tubule system.\r\n      This article is protected by copyright.

The scarcity of the gold\r\n      standard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.\r\n      For patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been of\r\n      great benefit on survival. To allow explantation of the assist device and obviate\r\n      heart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.\r\n      However, explant rates so far are low. Combining mechanical circulatory support\r\n      with regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might \r\n      give rise to improved long-term results. Although synergistic effects are\r\n      suggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in both\r\n      preclinical and clinical setting is lacking. This review focuses on advanced and \r\n      innovative strategies for the treatment of end-stage HF and furthermore appraises\r\n      clinical experience with combined strategies.\r\nFAU - Tseng, Cheyenne C S\r\nAU  - Tseng CC\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands ; Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Ramjankhan, Faiz Z\r\nAU  - Ramjankhan FZ\r\nAD  - Department of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, Division Heart and Lungs, University\r\n      Medical Center , Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nFAU - de Jonge, Nicolaas\r\nAU  - de Jonge N\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Chamuleau, Steven A J\r\nAU  - Chamuleau SA\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Review\r\nDEP - 20150407\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Surg\r\nJT  - Frontiers in surgery\r\nJID - 101645127\r\nPMC - PMC4387859\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4387859\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - cardiac recovery\r\nOT  - cell therapy\r\nOT  - heart failure\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory support\r\nOT  - regenerative therapies\r\nOT  - ventricular-assist device\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/24 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/24 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/24 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015 [ecollection]\r\nPHST- 2014/11/02 [received]\r\nPHST- 2015/03/07 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/04/07 [epublish]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Surg. 2015 Apr 7;2:10. doi: 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010. eCollection 2015.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25873821\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Data-Review\r\nDA  - 20150415\r\nLR  - 20150417\r\nIS  - 1526-6702 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0730-2347 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 42\r\nIP  - 2\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr\r\nTI  - Anthracycline treatment and ventricular remodeling in left ventricular assist\r\n      device patients.\r\nPG  - 124-30\r\nLID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509 [doi]\r\nAB  - Nonischemic cardiomyopathy can complicate antineoplastic therapy and lead to\r\n      irreversible heart failure. We evaluated structural changes at the time of left\r\n      ventricular assist device implantation in heart failure patients who had been\r\n      exposed to anthracycline, and we correlated those changes with clinical\r\n      presentation. We retrospectively studied left ventricular core samples taken at\r\n      implantation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device in 12 heart\r\n      failure patients (mean age, 46 +/- 16 yr) who had histories of anthracycline\r\n      exposure. We evaluated those samples for hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and fibrosis.\r\n      Histopathologic findings showed moderate-to-severe myocyte hypertrophy, moderate \r\n      myocytolysis, and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis with areas of\r\n      replacement fibrosis. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked decreases in\r\n      myofibrils, diffuse mitochondrial swelling, and disorganization of the\r\n      sarcoplasmic reticulum. The interval between anthracycline therapy and heart\r\n      failure was a mean of 6.8 +/- 5.7 years; duration of heart failure symptoms, 38\r\n      +/- 47 months; and duration of device support, 414 +/- 266 days. Four patients\r\n      are continuing on device support, 3 have undergone transplantation, 3 have\r\n      undergone device explantation, and 2 have died.

We describe the use of this device to support \r\n      the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York Heart\r\n      Association class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustard\r\n      procedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. CASE REPORT: A\r\n      HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a\r\n      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema\r\n      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and\r\n      pulmonary edema. RESULTS: The patient\'s edema and acute kidney injury resolved\r\n      after device placement. She was discharged home and successfully underwent device\r\n      removal with heart transplant five months later. CONCLUSION: The HeartWare device\r\n      may be used for extended support as a systemic RV in a pediatric patient. It is\r\n      feasible to consider using the device in this patient population.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2014.\r\nFAU - Kenleigh, Dorian\r\nAU  - Kenleigh D\r\nAD  - University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA\r\n      dorian-kenleigh@uiowa.edu.\r\nFAU - Edens, R Erik\r\nAU  - Edens RE\r\nAD  - Stead Family Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa Children\'s Hospital,\r\n      Iowa City, IA, USA.\r\nFAU - Bates, Michael J\r\nAU  - Bates MJ\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Ochsner Health System, New Orleans, LA,\r\n      USA.\r\nFAU - Turek, Joseph W\r\nAU  - Turek JW\r\nAD  - Division of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University of Iowa Children\'s Hospital,\r\n      Iowa City, IA, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg\r\nJT  - World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery\r\nJID - 101518415\r\nSB  - IM\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - adult congenital heart disease\r\nOT  - arterial switch operation\r\nOT  - artificial organs\r\nOT  - circulatory assist devices (LVAD, RVAD, BVAD, TAH)\r\nOT  - circulatory hemodynamics\r\nOT  - congenital heart disease\r\nOT  - congenital heart surgery\r\nOT  - heart\r\nOT  - heart failure\r\nOT  - pediatric\r\nOT  - transplantation\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/15 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/15 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/15 06:00\r\nAID - 6/2/339 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg. 2015 Apr;6(2):339-41. doi:\r\n      10.1177/2150135114563769.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25865791\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150413\r\nLR  - 20150414\r\nIS  - 1525-1594 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0160-564X (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 10\r\nTI  - Clinical and Molecular Comparison of Pediatric and Adult Reverse Remodeling With \r\n      Ventricular Assist Devices.\r\nLID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]\r\nAB  - Ventricular assist device (VAD) support induces reverse remodeling of failing\r\n      myocardium that leads to occasional functional recovery of the adult heart. While\r\n      there have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage\r\n      cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has\r\n      increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the \r\n      setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardium\r\n      also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to\r\n      its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets \r\n      of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to\r\n      summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery\r\n      following VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric\r\n      myocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients.\r\n      Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions of\r\n      their cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of information\r\n      about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to\r\n      determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or\r\n      just recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult gene\r\n      expression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40\% of genes to be\r\n      oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.\r\n      These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling \r\n      specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical\r\n      strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation\r\n      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Weia, Benjamin C\r\nAU  - Weia BC\r\nAD  - Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.\r\nFAU - Adachi, Iki\r\nAU  - Adachi I\r\nFAU - Jacot, Jeffrey G\r\nAU  - Jacot JG\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150410\r\nTA  - Artif Organs\r\nJT  - Artificial organs\r\nJID - 7802778\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Bridge to recovery\r\nOT  - Gene expression\r\nOT  - Heart failure\r\nOT  - Pediatric cardiomyopathy\r\nOT  - Reverse remodeling\r\nOT  - Ventricular assist device\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/aor.12451.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25864509\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150413\r\nLR  - 20150414\r\nIS  - 1747-0803 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1747-079X (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 10\r\nTI  - Pediatric Quality of Life while Supported with a Ventricular Assist Device.\r\nLID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]\r\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have emerged as an important\r\n      treatment option for bridging pediatric patients with heart failure to\r\n      transplant. VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of \r\n      life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of our\r\n      pediatric patients while supported with a VAD. DESIGN: In this prospective study,\r\n      pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement, and their parents, were\r\n      administered a generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD\r\n      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then\r\n      periodically until heart transplant or death. Their final scores while on support\r\n      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,\r\n      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.\r\n      RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VAD\r\n      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was \r\n      10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.\r\n      Eleven (85\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\%) patient remaining\r\n      alive on support. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was \r\n      1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total\r\n      and physical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups.\r\n      Self-reported psychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy\r\n      controls only. Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all\r\n      three comparison groups for all three categories (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A large \r\n      deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patients supported by a VAD compared\r\n      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant\r\n      patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group with more severe heart\r\n      failure. Improvements in QoL must be made, as time spent with a VAD will likely\r\n      continue to increase.\r\nCI  - (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Miller, Jacob R\r\nAU  - Miller JR\r\nAD  - Section of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of\r\n      Medicine, St. Louis, Mo, USA.\r\nFAU - Boston, Umar S\r\nAU  - Boston US\r\nFAU - Epstein, Deirdre J\r\nAU  - Epstein DJ\r\nFAU - Henn, Matthew C\r\nAU  - Henn MC\r\nFAU - Lawrance, Christopher P\r\nAU  - Lawrance CP\r\nFAU - Kallenbach, Jacob\r\nAU  - Kallenbach J\r\nFAU - Simpson, Kathleen E\r\nAU  - Simpson KE\r\nFAU - Canter, Charles E\r\nAU  - Canter CE\r\nFAU - Eghtesady, Pirooz\r\nAU  - Eghtesady P\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150410\r\nTA  - Congenit Heart Dis\r\nJT  - Congenital heart disease\r\nJID - 101256510\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Heart Failure\r\nOT  - Pediatric\r\nOT  - Quality of Life\r\nOT  - Ventricular Assist Device\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015/03/16 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Congenit Heart Dis. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25841881\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150405\r\nLR  - 20150407\r\nIS  - 1861-0692 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1861-0684 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 5\r\nTI  - A single German center experience with intermittent inotropes for patients on the\r\n      high-urgent heart transplant waiting list.\r\nAB  - AIM: Currently, more than 900 patients with end-stage heart failure are listed\r\n      for heart transplantation in Germany. All patients on the Eurotransplant\r\n      high-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be\r\n      relisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated with\r\n      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospective\r\n      analysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated with\r\n      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 117\r\n      consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure \r\n      unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 \%) were stabilized and\r\n      delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),\r\n      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,\r\n      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\'s specific characteristics. \r\n      After initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as\r\n      possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a\r\n      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 \%\r\n      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary\r\n      due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 \%) needed a left- or\r\n      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 \%) died while waiting and 87 (84 \%) \r\n      received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. Cumulative 3 and 12 months\r\n      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 \%, respectively. CONCLUSION:\r\n      Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to\r\n      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These data provide the\r\n      basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropes in patients\r\n      on the HU waiting list.\r\nFAU - Hubner, T\r\nAU  - Hubner T\r\nAD  - Medizinische Abteilung, Kliniken der Barmherzigen Schwestern, Krankenhaus\r\n      Neuwittelsbach, Renatastrasse 71a, 80639, Munich, Germany.\r\nFAU - Nickel, T\r\nAU  - Nickel T\r\nFAU - Steinbeck, G\r\nAU  - Steinbeck G\r\nFAU - Massberg, S\r\nAU  - Massberg S\r\nFAU - Schramm, R\r\nAU  - Schramm R\r\nFAU - Reichart, B\r\nAU  - Reichart B\r\nFAU - Hagl, C\r\nAU  - Hagl C\r\nFAU - Kiwi, A\r\nAU  - Kiwi A\r\nFAU - Weis, Michael\r\nAU  - Weis M\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150405\r\nTA  - Clin Res Cardiol\r\nJT  - Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society\r\nJID - 101264123\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/07 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/07 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/06 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015/01/22 [received]\r\nPHST- 2015/03/31 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/04/05 [aheadofprint]\r\nAID - 10.1007/s00392-015-0852-1 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Clin Res Cardiol. 2015 Apr 5.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25832983\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150402\r\nLR  - 20150404\r\nIS  - 1532-6551 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1071-3581 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 2\r\nTI  - Imaging in patients after cardiac transplantation and in patients with\r\n      ventricular assist devices.\r\nAB  - The field of cardiac imaging and the management of patients with severe heart\r\n      failure have advanced substantially during the past 10 years. Cardiac\r\n      transplantation offers the best long-term survival with high quality of life for \r\n      the patients with end stage heart failure. However, acute cardiac rejection and\r\n      cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) can occur post cardiac transplantation and\r\n      these problems necessitate regular surveillance. The short-term success of\r\n      mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD), such as ventricular assist devices\r\n      (VADs), in improving survival and quality of life has led to a dramatic growth of\r\n      the patient population with these devices. The development of optimal imaging\r\n      techniques and algorithms to evaluate these advanced heart failure patients is\r\n      evolving and multimodality non-invasive imaging approaches and invasive\r\n      techniques are commonly employed. Most of the published studies done in the\r\n      transplant and VAD population are small, and biased based on the strength of the \r\n      particular program, and there is a relative lack of published protocols to\r\n      evaluate these patient groups. Moreover, the techniques of echocardiography,\r\n      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear cardiology have\r\n      all progressed rapidly in recent years. There is thus a knowledge gap for\r\n      cardiologists, radiologists, and clinicians, especially regarding surveillance\r\n      for CAV and ideal imaging approaches for patients with VADs. The purpose of this \r\n      review article is to provide an overview of different noninvasive imaging\r\n      modalities used to evaluate patients after cardiac transplantation and for\r\n      patients with VADs. The review focuses on the role of echocardiography, CT, and\r\n      nuclear imaging in surveillance for CAV and rejection and on the assessment of\r\n      ventricular structure and function, myocardial remodeling and complications for\r\n      VAD patients.\r\nFAU - Gupta, Bhanu\r\nAU  - Gupta B\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, St. Luke\'s Mid America Heart Institute, 4330 Wornall\r\n      Rd, Suite 2000, Kansas City, MO, USA.\r\nFAU - Jacob, Dany\r\nAU  - Jacob D\r\nFAU - Thompson, Randall\r\nAU  - Thompson R\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150402\r\nTA  - J Nucl Cardiol\r\nJT  - Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of\r\n      Nuclear Cardiology\r\nJID - 9423534\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/03 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/12/08 [received]\r\nPHST- 2015/01/29 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/04/02 [aheadofprint]\r\nAID - 10.1007/s12350-015-0115-6 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - J Nucl Cardiol. 2015 Apr 2.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25824553\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150331\r\nLR  - 20150401\r\nIS  - 1557-3117 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1053-2498 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Jan 16\r\nTI  - Regional differences in use and outcomes of left ventricular assist devices:\r\n      Insights from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory\r\n      Support Registry.\r\nLID - S1053-2498(15)00009-1 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.healun.2015.01.007 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: We examined whether characteristics, implant strategy, and outcomes\r\n      in patients who receive continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD)\r\n      differ across geographic regions in the United States. METHODS: A total of 7,404 \r\n      CF-LVAD patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted\r\n      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) from 134 participating institutions were analyzed\r\n      from 4 distinct regions: Northeast, 2,605 (35\%); Midwest, 2,210 (30\%); West, 973 \r\n      (13\%); and South, 1,616 (22\%). RESULTS: At baseline, patients in the Northeast\r\n      and South were more likely to have INTERMACS risk profiles 1 and 2. A\r\n      bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy was more common in the Northeast (31.7\%;\r\n      West, 18.5\%; South, 26.9\%; Midwest, 25.5\%; p < 0.0001). In contrast, destination \r\n      therapy (DT) was more likely in the South (40.6\%; Northeast, 32.3\%; Midwest,\r\n      27.3\%; West, 27.3\%; p < 0.0001). Although all regions showed a high 1-year\r\n      survival rate, some regional differences in long-term mortality were observed.\r\n      Notably, survival beyond 1 year after LVAD implant was significantly lower in the\r\n      South. However, when stratified by device strategy, no significant differences in\r\n      survival for BTT or DT patients were found among the regions. Finally, with the\r\n      exception of right ventricular failure, which was more common in the South, no\r\n      other significant differences in causes of death were observed among the regions.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in clinical profile and LVAD strategy exist in \r\n      the United States. Despite an overall high survival rate at 1 year, differences\r\n      in mortality among the regions were noted.

Once developed as a\r\n      bridging to heart transplantation, it is now a valuable option for permanent\r\n      support in patients for whom a heart transplantation is not possible due to\r\n      contraindications or a lack of available organs. Furthermore, it can be used as a\r\n      bridging to myocardial recovery and explantation. The number of implantations of \r\n      left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) has clearly increased in recent years and \r\n      approximately one half of these implantations is already carried out in centers\r\n      not specialized in transplantations. This development necessitates that every\r\n      practicing physician is aware of the basic principles of mechanical circulatory\r\n      support and with the possible complications.

The aim of this article is to develop and test a\r\n      lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system simulating and comparing the \r\n      VAD effects on failing Fontan. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data of 10\r\n      Fontan patients were used to simulate the baseline patients\' condition using a\r\n      dedicated lumped parameter model. Starting from the simulated baseline and for\r\n      each patient, a systolic dysfunction, a diastolic dysfunction, and an increment\r\n      of the pulmonary vascular resistance were simulated. Then, for each patient and\r\n      for each pathology, the RVAD, LVAD, and BIVAD implantations were simulated. The\r\n      model can reproduce patients\' baseline well. In the case of systolic dysfunction,\r\n      the LVAD unloads the single ventricle and increases the cardiac output (CO) (35\%)\r\n      and the arterial systemic pressure (Pas) (25\%). With RVAD, a decrement of\r\n      inferior vena cava pressure (Pvci) (39\%) was observed with 34\% increment of CO,\r\n      but an increment of the single ventricle external work (SVEW). With the BIVAD, an\r\n      increment of Pas (29\%) and CO (37\%) was observed. In the case of diastolic\r\n      dysfunction, the LVAD increases CO (42\%) and the RVAD decreases the Pvci, while\r\n      both increase the SVEW. In the case of pulmonary vascular resistance increment,\r\n      the highest CO (50\%) and Pas (28\%) increment is obtained with an RVAD with the\r\n      highest decrement of Pvci (53\%) and an increment of the SVEW but with the lowest \r\n      VAD power consumption. The use of numerical models could be helpful in this\r\n      innovative field to evaluate the effect of VAD implantation on Fontan patients to\r\n      support patient and VAD type selection personalizing the assistance.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation\r\n      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Di Molfetta, Arianna\r\nAU  - Di Molfetta A\r\nAD  - Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Clinical Physiology-CNR,\r\n      Rome, Italy.\r\nFAU - Amodeo, Antonio\r\nAU  - Amodeo A\r\nFAU - Fresiello, Libera\r\nAU  - Fresiello L\r\nFAU - Trivella, Maria Giovanna\r\nAU  - Trivella MG\r\nFAU - Iacobelli, Roberta\r\nAU  - Iacobelli R\r\nFAU - Pilati, Mara\r\nAU  - Pilati M\r\nFAU - Ferrari, Gianfranco\r\nAU  - Ferrari G\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150321\r\nTA  - Artif Organs\r\nJT  - Artificial organs\r\nJID - 7802778\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Fontan failure\r\nOT  - Lumped parameter models\r\nOT  - Ventricular assist devices\r\nEDAT- 2015/03/27 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/03/27 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/03/27 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1111/aor.12434 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Mar 21. doi: 10.1111/aor.12434.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25796280\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20150323\r\nIS  - 0030-6002 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0030-6002 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 156\r\nIP  - 13\r\nDP  - 2015 Mar 29\r\nTI  - [Mechanical circulatory support saves lives - three years\' experience of the\r\n      newly established assist device program at Semmelweis University].\r\nPG  - 521-7\r\nLID - 10.1556/OH.2015.30115 [doi]\r\nAB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the first heart\r\n      transplantation in Hungary in 2012 the emerging need for modern heart failure\r\n      management via mechanical circulatory support has evolved. In May 2012 the\r\n      opening of a new heart failure and transplant unit with 9 beds together with the \r\n      procurement of necessary devices at Semmelweis University accomplished this need.\r\n      AIM: The aim of the authors was to report their initial experience obtained in\r\n      this new cardiac assist device program. METHOD: Since May, 2012, mechanical\r\n      circulatory support system was applied in 89 cases in 72 patients. Indication for\r\n      support were end stage heart failure refractory to medical treatment and acute\r\n      left or right heart failure. RESULTS: Treatment was initiated for acute graft\r\n      failure after heart transplantation in 27 cases, for end stage heart failure in\r\n      24 cases, for acute myocardial infarction in 21 cases, for acute postcardiotomy\r\n      heart failure in 14 cases, for severe respiratory insufficiency in 2 cases and\r\n      for drug intoxication in one case. Among the 30 survivor of the whole program 13 \r\n      patients were successfully transplanted. CONCLUSIONS: The available devices can\r\n      cover all modalities of current bridge therapy from short term support through\r\n      medium support to heart transplantation or long term support and destination\r\n      therapy. These conditions made possible the successful start of a new cardiac\r\n      assist device program.\r\nFAU - Fazekas, Levente\r\nAU  - Fazekas L\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Sax, Balazs\r\nAU  - Sax B\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Hartyanszky, Istvan\r\nAU  - Hartyanszky I\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Polos, Miklos\r\nAU  - Polos M\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Horkay, Ferenc\r\nAU  - Horkay F\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Varga, Tamas\r\nAU  - Varga T\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Racz, Kristof\r\nAU  - Racz K\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Nemeth, Endre\r\nAU  - Nemeth E\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Szekely, Andrea\r\nAU  - Szekely A\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Paulovich, Erzsebet\r\nAU  - Paulovich E\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Heltai, Krisztina\r\nAU  - Heltai K\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Zima, Endre\r\nAU  - Zima E\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Szabolcs, Zoltan\r\nAU  - Szabolcs Z\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Merkely, Bela\r\nAU  - Merkely B\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nLA  - hun\r\nPT  - English Abstract\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nTT  - A mechanikus keringestamogatas eletet ment - a muszivprogram elso harom evenek\r\n      tapasztalata a Semmelweis Egyetemen.\r\nPL  - Hungary\r\nTA  - Orv Hetil\r\nJT  - Orvosi hetilap\r\nJID - 0376412\r\nSB  - IM\r\nOAB - Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher.\r\nOABL- hun\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - ECMO\r\nOT  - VAD\r\nOT  - heart transplantation\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory support\r\nOT  - mechanikus keringestamogatas\r\nOT  - musziv\r\nOT  - szivtranszplantacio\r\nEDAT- 2015/03/23 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/03/23 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/03/23 06:00\r\nAID - 807388U251140873 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1556/OH.2015.30115 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Orv Hetil. 2015 Mar 29;156(13):521-7. doi: 10.1556/OH.2015.30115.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25773536\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150501\r\nLR  - 20150501\r\nIS  - 1399-0012 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0902-0063 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Mar 13\r\nTI  - Clinical outcomes in sensitized heart transplant patients bridged with\r\n      ventricular assist devices.\r\nLID - 10.1111/ctr.12540 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to transplant\r\n      (BTT) have been known to cause allosensitization, as measured by panel-reactive\r\n      antibody (PRA) levels. The goal of this study was to measure the impact of this\r\n      allosensitization on outcomes. METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed\r\n      in BTT patients, with sensitization defined as peak PRAs >/= 10\%. Baseline\r\n      characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using\r\n      descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. RESULTS:\r\n      Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21\r\n      non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47\% vs. 10\%, p = \r\n      0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular\r\n      rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).\r\n      Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection\r\n      (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier\r\n      log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of \r\n      infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9\% vs. 19.0\%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION:\r\n      Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. This mortality\r\n      appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the\r\n      development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.\r\nCI  - (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, little is known on the impact of\r\n      continuous-flow LVADs on the vascular supply of the colon for anastomoses. In\r\n      this case, a 67-year-old male supported on an LVAD underwent four successful\r\n      noncardiac operations including two intestinal anastomoses; left colon and small \r\n      bowel anastomosis. To the best of our knowledge, no existing literature has\r\n      reported successful colonic anastomosis on a continuous-flow LVAD. This case\r\n      illustrates the plausibility of performing colonic anastomoses with appropriately\r\n      selected patients supported on an LVAD. A 67-year-old male with congestive heart \r\n      failure underwent LVAD placement for decompensated heart failure while awaiting\r\n      orthotopic transplantation. During his recovery, he developed a stage IV sacral\r\n      decubitus ulcer which required a sigmoid loop colostomy placement and a\r\n      rotational flap. Subsequent stoma closure with partial sigmoid colectomy and\r\n      stapled anastomosis was performed, and healed without evidence of anastomotic\r\n      leak. This case illustrates the potential for colonic anastomoses for patients on\r\n      continuous-flow LVAD support. Although oxygenation is known to be an important\r\n      aspect of healing, this patient\'s outcome suggests that intestinal anastomoses\r\n      can be performed on the induced pulseless environment of an LVAD.

As the availability of LVADs for advanced\r\n      heart failure has expanded to nontransplantation mechanical circulatory support\r\n      centers, concerns have been expressed about maintaining good outcomes.\r\n      Demographics and outcomes were evaluated in 276 patients with advanced heart\r\n      failure who underwent implantation of LVADs as bridge to transplantation or\r\n      destination therapy at 27 open-heart centers. Baseline characteristics, operative\r\n      mortality, length of stay, readmission rate, adverse events, quality of life, and\r\n      survival were analyzed. The overall 30-day mortality was 3\% (8 of 276), and\r\n      survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were 92 +/- 2\%, 88 +/- 3\%, \r\n      and 84 +/- 4\% for the bridge-to-transplantation group and 81 +/- 3\%, 70 +/- 5\%,\r\n      and 63 +/- 6\% for the destination therapy group, comparable with results\r\n      published by the national Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted\r\n      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS). The median length of stay for all patients was\r\n      21 days. Bleeding was the most frequent adverse event. Stroke occurred in 4\%\r\n      (bridge to transplantation) and 6\% (destination therapy) of patients.\r\n      Quality-of-life measures and 6-minute walk distances showed sustained\r\n      improvements throughout support. In conclusion, outcomes with LVAD support at\r\n      open-heart centers are acceptable and comparable with results from the INTERMACS \r\n      registry. With appropriate teams, training, center commitment, and certification,\r\n      LVAD therapy is being disseminated in a responsible way to open-heart centers.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: The HMRS has been shown to\r\n      correlate with mortality in the cohort of patients enrolled in the Heartmate II\r\n      trials, but its validity in unselected, \"real world\" populations remains unclear.\r\n      METHODS: This study identified a cohort of 269 consecutive patients who received \r\n      a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device at our institution, the\r\n      Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, between June 2005 and June 2013.\r\n      Ninety-day and 2-year mortality rates, as well as frequency of several morbid\r\n      events, were compared by retrospectively assigned HMRS category groups. The\r\n      analysis was repeated within the subgroup of INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for \r\n      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) class 1 patients. RESULTS: Receiver\r\n      operating curve analysis showed that the HMRS correlated with 90-day mortality\r\n      with an area under the curve of 0.70. Stratification in low, mid, and high HMRS\r\n      groups identified patients with increasing hazard of 90-day mortality, increasing\r\n      long-term mortality, increasing rate of gastrointestinal bleeding events, and\r\n      increasing median number of days spent in the hospital in the first year post\r\n      implant. Within INTERMACS class 1 patients, those in the highest HMRS group were \r\n      found to have a relative risk of 90-day mortality 5.7 times higher than those in \r\n      the lowest HMRS group (39.1\% vs. 6.9\%, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: HMRS is a valid\r\n      clinical tool to stratify risk of morbidity and mortality after implant of\r\n      Heartmate II devices in unselected patients and can be used to predict short-term\r\n      mortality risk in INTERMACS class 1 patients.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

BACKGROUND: CF-LVADs have become\r\n      mainstream therapy for patients with advanced heart failure. Thromboembolic\r\n      events, device thrombosis, and bleeding continue to be a challenge with this\r\n      technology. Adequate anticoagulation is required to prevent these adverse events.\r\n      METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive patients implanted with a CF-LVAD was\r\n      conducted. Paired samples were considered concordant if aPTT values fell into\r\n      expected ranges for subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic anti-FXa\r\n      levels. Heparin dosing was on the basis of anti-Xa levels. RESULTS: A total of\r\n      340 paired values from 38 patients were evaluated. Anti-FXa and aPTT were\r\n      discordant in 253 samples (74.4\%), with a high degree of variability in aPTT for \r\n      any given anti-FXa level (r(2) = 0.57). Results were discordant in 104 samples\r\n      (63.8\%) from patients undergoing bridging therapy with warfarin and in 149\r\n      samples (84.2\%) from patients with device obstruction and/or hemolysis (p <\r\n      0.001). The most common pattern of discordance was a supratherapeutic aPTT value \r\n      despite a therapeutic anti-FXa level (49.1\% for bridging vs. 75.8\% for device\r\n      obstruction and/or hemolysis; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of aPTT were\r\n      disproportionately prolonged relative to the corresponding anti-FXa levels in\r\n      CF-LVAD patients, particularly those with device obstruction. Hemolysis and\r\n      warfarin administration may falsely elevate aPTT, resulting in overestimation of \r\n      heparin concentration and under-anticoagulation. Use of aPTT and anti-FXa to\r\n      guide heparin therapy may lead to different estimates of heparin concentration in\r\n      the same patient.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were\r\n      implanted with a CF-LVAD between January 2008 and June 2014. Eighty-five patients\r\n      were implanted with the device as a bridge to transplant (BTT); the remaining (n \r\n      = 43) were on destination therapy (DT). Each group was divided into patients <65 \r\n      years old and >/=65 years old at device implantation. Patients were followed up\r\n      for at least 24 months or until transplant or death. RESULTS: Eighty-five\r\n      patients (66\%) received a CF-LVAD as BTT. Patients >/=65 years old (n = 8) had a \r\n      lower preoperative cardiac index and prothrombin time-international normalized\r\n      ratio (P = 0.009), and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (P = 0.008).\r\n      Adverse events including infections, re-exploration for bleeding, ischaemic and\r\n      haemorrhagic stroke, renal failure and right heart failure were comparable in\r\n      both age groups. Eighty-two percent (n = 63) of the young patients and 75\% (n =\r\n      6) of the older patients, who were on LVAD as BTT, underwent heart transplant\r\n      within the first 24 months of LVAD implantation. Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and\r\n      24 months were 95, 95, 77 and 70\%, respectively, post-CF-LVAD implantation as BTT\r\n      for the younger group and 73\% for the older group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P =\r\n      0.35). Forty-three patients (34\%) received a CF-LVAD as DT. Patients >/=65 years \r\n      old (n = 14) on DT had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular disease (P =\r\n      0.048), higher serum sodium (P = 0.004) and serum creatinine values (P = 0.002), \r\n      preoperatively. There were more strokes in the older patients post-LAVD\r\n      implantation (14 vs 0\%; P = 0.048). Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months\r\n      were 85, 79, 75 and 62\%, respectively, for the younger group and 93, 77, 67 and\r\n      34\% for the older group, respectively (P = 0.26). CONCLUSION: This study\r\n      demonstrates that LVAD therapy can be used in the older patients with acceptable \r\n      mortality and morbidity, and age alone should not be used as the sole criterion\r\n      for exclusion from LVAD implantation.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2015.

Although the reference standard for\r\n      treatment of advanced heart failure remains cardiac transplantation, the\r\n      increasing shortage of donor organs and the unsuitability of many patients for\r\n      transplantation surgery has led to a search for alternative therapies. One such\r\n      therapy is mechanical circulatory support, which helps relieve the load on the\r\n      ventricle and thereby allows it to recover function. In addition, there is\r\n      increasing evidence supporting the use of mechanical devices as a bridge to\r\n      recovery in patients with acute refractory heart failure. In this article, the\r\n      imaging evaluation of various commonly used short- and long-term cardiac assist\r\n      devices is discussed, and their relevant mechanisms of action and physiology are \r\n      described. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), plays a crucial role\r\n      in preoperative evaluation for assessment of candidacy for implantation of a left\r\n      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH). Also,\r\n      echocardiography and CT are indispensable in assessment of complications\r\n      associated with cardiac devices. Complications commonly associated with\r\n      short-term assist devices include bleeding and malpositioning, whereas long-term \r\n      devices such as LVADs may be associated with infection, pump thrombosis, and\r\n      cannula malfunction, as well as bleeding. CT is also commonly performed for\r\n      preoperative planning before LVAD or TAH explantation, replacement of a device or\r\n      one of its components, and cardiac transplantation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2012 through\r\n      July 2013, we conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews with caregivers of\r\n      patients considering DT LVAD. Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and\r\n      deductive approach. We interviewed 17 caregivers: 10 caregivers of patients\r\n      living with DT LVAD, 6 caregivers of patients who had died with DT LVAD, and 1\r\n      caregiver of a patient who had declined DT LVAD. The themes identified, which\r\n      could also be considered dialectical tensions, are broadly interpreted under 3\r\n      domains mapping to decision context, process, and outcome: (1) the stark decision\r\n      context, with tension between hope and reality; (2) the challenging decision\r\n      process, with tension between wanting loved ones to live and wanting to respect\r\n      loved ones\' wishes; and (3) the downstream decision outcome, with tension between\r\n      gratitude and burden. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making surrounding DT LVAD should\r\n      incorporate decision support for patients and caregivers. This should include a\r\n      focus on caregiver burden and the predictable tensions that caregivers\r\n      experience.\r\nCI  - (c) 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.\r\nFAU - McIlvennan, Colleen K\r\nAU  - McIlvennan CK\r\nAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of\r\n      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research\r\n      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of \r\n      Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal\r\n      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.). colleen.mcilvennan@ucdenver.edu.\r\nFAU - Jones, Jacqueline\r\nAU  - Jones J\r\nAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of\r\n      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research\r\n      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of \r\n      Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal\r\n      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).\r\nFAU - Allen, Larry A\r\nAU  - Allen LA\r\nAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of\r\n      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research\r\n      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of \r\n      Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal\r\n      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).\r\nFAU - Lindenfeld, JoAnn\r\nAU  - Lindenfeld J\r\nAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of\r\n      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research\r\n      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of \r\n      Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal\r\n      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).\r\nFAU - Swetz, Keith M\r\nAU  - Swetz KM\r\nAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of\r\n      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research\r\n      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of \r\n      Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal\r\n      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).\r\nFAU - Nowels, Carolyn\r\nAU  - Nowels C\r\nAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of\r\n      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research\r\n      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of \r\n      Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal\r\n      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).\r\nFAU - Matlock, Daniel D\r\nAU  - Matlock DD\r\nAD  - From the Section of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation, Division of\r\n      Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A., J.L.), Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research\r\n      Consortium (C.K.M., L.A.A., D.D.M.) and Division of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (C.N., D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora; University of \r\n      Colorado School of Nursing, Aurora (J.J.); and Division of General Internal\r\n      Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (K.M.S.).\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 1 K07 AG030337-01A2/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - 1K23AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - 1K23HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K23 AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\'t\r\nDEP - 20150310\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes\r\nJT  - Circulation.

The current generation of left ventricular assist devices \r\n      (LVADs), as compared with older devices, is characterized by improved\r\n      technologies and reduced size. The result is that minimally invasive surgery is\r\n      now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange of LVADs. Minimally\r\n      invasive procedures improve surgical outcome; for example, they lower the rates\r\n      of operative complications (such as bleeding or wound infection). The\r\n      miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive techniques\r\n      will be used for most implantations in the future. In this article, we summarize \r\n      and describe minimally invasive state-of-the-art implantation techniques, with a \r\n      focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation\r\n      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Rojas, Sebastian V\r\nAU  - Rojas SV\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation, and Vascular Surgery, Hannover\r\n      Medical School, Hannover, Germany.\r\nFAU - Avsar, Murat\r\nAU  - Avsar M\r\nFAU - Hanke, Jasmin S\r\nAU  - Hanke JS\r\nFAU - Khalpey, Zain\r\nAU  - Khalpey Z\r\nFAU - Maltais, Simon\r\nAU  - Maltais S\r\nFAU - Haverich, Axel\r\nAU  - Haverich A\r\nFAU - Schmitto, Jan D\r\nAU  - Schmitto JD\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150304\r\nTA  - Artif Organs\r\nJT  - Artificial organs\r\nJID - 7802778\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Cardiac surgery\r\nOT  - Left ventricular assist device\r\nOT  - Minimally invasive surgery\r\nEDAT- 2015/03/05 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/03/05 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/03/05 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1111/aor.12422 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Mar 4. doi: 10.1111/aor.12422.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25732410\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20150323\r\nIS  - 1744-8344 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1477-9072 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 13\r\nIP  - 4\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr\r\nTI  - Current approaches to device implantation in pediatric and congenital heart\r\n      disease patients.\r\nPG  - 417-27\r\nLID - 10.1586/14779072.2015.1021786 [doi]\r\nAB  - The pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) has recently shown substantial\r\n      improvements in survival as a bridge to heart transplant for patients with\r\n      end-stage heart failure.

As microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in\r\n      remodeling processes, a comparative miRNA profiling in transplanted hearts of HF \r\n      patients with/without LVAD assistance could aid to comprehend underlying\r\n      molecular mechanisms. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze miRNA \r\n      differential expression in left ventricles of HF patients who underwent heart\r\n      transplantation directly (n = 9) or following a period of LVAD support (n = 8).\r\n      After data validation by quantitative real-time PCR, association with functional \r\n      clinical parameters was investigated. Bioinformatics\' tools were then used for\r\n      prediction of putative targets of modulated miRNAs and relative pathway\r\n      enrichment. The analysis revealed 13 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs in\r\n      failing hearts subjected to LVAD assistance. In particular, the expression level \r\n      of some of them (miR-338-3p, miR-142-5p and -3p, miR-216a-5p, miR-223-3p,\r\n      miR-27a-5p, and miR-378g) showed correlation with off-pump cardiac index values. \r\n      Predicted targets of these miRNAs were involved in focal adhesion/integrin\r\n      pathway and in actin cytoskeleton regulation. The identified miRNAs might\r\n      contribute to molecular regulation of reverse remodeling and heart recovery\r\n      mechanisms.\r\nFAU - Barsanti, Cristina\r\nAU  - Barsanti C\r\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, CNR, Via Moruzzi 1, \r\n      56124 Pisa, Italy ; Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant\'Anna,\r\n      Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, 56127 Pisa, Italy.\r\nFAU - Trivella, Maria Giovanna\r\nAU  - Trivella MG\r\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, CNR, Via Moruzzi 1, \r\n      56124 Pisa, Italy.\r\nFAU - D\'Aurizio, Romina\r\nAU  - D\'Aurizio R\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Integrative Systems Medicine, National Research Council, Via\r\n      Moruzzi 1, 56124 Pisa, Italy.\r\nFAU - El Baroudi, Mariama\r\nAU  - El Baroudi M\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Integrative Systems Medicine, National Research Council, Via\r\n      Moruzzi 1, 56124 Pisa, Italy.\r\nFAU - Baumgart, Mario\r\nAU  - Baumgart M\r\nAD  - Fritz Lipmann Institute for Age Research, Leibniz Institute, Beutenbergstrasse\r\n      11, 07745 Jena, Germany.\r\nFAU - Groth, Marco\r\nAU  - Groth M\r\nAD  - Fritz Lipmann Institute for Age Research, Leibniz Institute, Beutenbergstrasse\r\n      11, 07745 Jena, Germany.\r\nFAU - Caruso, Raffaele\r\nAU  - Caruso R\r\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Cardiothoracic and\r\n      Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca\' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3,\r\n      20162 Milan, Italy.\r\nFAU - Verde, Alessandro\r\nAU  - Verde A\r\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Cardiothoracic and\r\n      Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca\' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3,\r\n      20162 Milan, Italy ; Cardiothoracic and Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca\' Granda \r\n      Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy.\r\nFAU - Botta, Luca\r\nAU  - Botta L\r\nAD  - Cardiothoracic and Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca\' Granda Hospital, Piazza\r\n      Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy.\r\nFAU - Cozzi, Lorena\r\nAU  - Cozzi L\r\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Cardiothoracic and\r\n      Vascular Department, Niguarda Ca\' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3,\r\n      20162 Milan, Italy.\r\nFAU - Pitto, Letizia\r\nAU  - Pitto L\r\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, CNR, Via Moruzzi 1, \r\n      56124 Pisa, Italy.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\'t\r\nDEP - 20150201\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Biomed Res Int\r\nJT  - BioMed research international\r\nJID - 101600173\r\nSB  - IM\r\nPMC - PMC4330954\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4330954\r\nEDAT- 2015/02/25 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/02/25 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/02/25 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/08/29 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/11/07 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2014/11/13 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/02/01 [epublish]\r\nAID - 10.1155/2015/592512 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:592512. doi: 10.1155/2015/592512.

Because very few data exist examining the influence of significant\r\n      pre-operative MR on outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\n      implantation, we evaluate our experience. METHODS: Between October 1996 and\r\n      August 2013, 756 patients underwent primary LVAD implantation at our\r\n      institutions. Of these, 508 patients received a continuous-flow LVAD and\r\n      represent the contemporary cohort for this analysis. Devices implanted included\r\n      the HeartMate II in 410 patients (81\%) and HeartWare HVAD in 98 patients (19\%).\r\n      Based on availability of pre-operative echocardiography, 491 patients were\r\n      divided into 2 study groups according to degree of pre-operative MR; 189 patients\r\n      (39\%) had moderate to severe or greater MR (MR group), and 302 (61\%) had less\r\n      than moderate to severe MR (less MR group). Median age at operation (60 years in \r\n      MR group vs 58 years in less MR group, p = 0.19), male sex (78\% in MR group vs\r\n      81\% in less MR group, p = 0.42), and ischemic etiology (46\% in MR group vs 51\% in\r\n      less MR group, p = 0.35) were similar between groups. RESULTS: There were 40\r\n      early deaths (7.9\%), and follow-up was available in all 468 early survivors for\r\n      641 patient-years of support. Patients in the MR group had higher late survival\r\n      (2 years, 75\%; 4 years, 65\%) compared with patients in the less MR group (2\r\n      years, 66\%; 4 years, 48\%; p < 0.04). Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the\r\n      independent interaction between MR and late survival (hazard ratio 0.62, p =\r\n      0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was improved survival in patients with severe\r\n      pre-operative MR after continuous-flow LVAD implantation in our cohort. These\r\n      findings may lend insight into the possible lack of value of addressing\r\n      significant MR at the time of LVAD implantation.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

We report our experience with MCS in\r\n      children eligible for HTx and its effect on waiting list mortality. METHODS:\r\n      Retrospective single-centre cohort study, National Paediatric HTx Programme\r\n      including all children eligible for HTx, since the introduction of MCS-VAD in\r\n      2006. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were eligible for HTx, median age 11.7\r\n      years [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 3.0-14.7]. In 18 patients, (42\%) a VAD was\r\n      implanted, 11 (61\%) survived to HTx (n = 9) or recovery (n = 2). Techniques and\r\n      devices used were left ventricular assist device (n = 16, 89\%), in 4 cases\r\n      preceded by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and biventricular assist \r\n      device (n = 2, 11\%), both preceded by ECMO. In the VAD group, median time to\r\n      death (n = 7) was 18 days (IQR 7-75), median time to HTx (n = 9) 66 days (IQR\r\n      33-223) and 2 patients recovered after 30 and 308 days. The main cause of death\r\n      on MCS was neurological injury in 4 patients (22\%) and systemic thrombo-embolic\r\n      events in 2 (11\%). The most common serious adverse events included confirmed\r\n      thrombus requiring pump replacement (in 11 patients, 61\%) and pericardial\r\n      effusion leading to rethoracotomy (in 5 patients, 28\%). Compared with the era\r\n      before MCS (1998-2006), waiting list mortality decreased from 44 to 21\%, and is\r\n      now mainly related to complications of VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Since the\r\n      introduction of MCS-VAD, waiting list mortality halved and more children with\r\n      end-stage heart failure survived to heart transplantation, thus improving\r\n      outcome. Although there is substantial mortality and morbidity, overall mortality\r\n      decreases, making MCS-VAD an essential therapeutic tool. The need for donor\r\n      organs remains critically urgent.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2015.

Total cardiac output \r\n      in CF-LVAD patients during exercise is predominantly determined by pump speed,\r\n      the pressure difference across the pump, and in some cases ejection through the\r\n      aortic valve. Fixed pump speed utilized in CF-LVADs may provide insufficient\r\n      support, resulting in a moderate cardiac output increase during increased\r\n      physical strain. Ongoing studies are evaluating whether pump speed changes in\r\n      response to varied loading conditions may enable LVADs to provide sufficient\r\n      support even during strenuous exercise. In the currently used devices, evidence\r\n      suggests that focus on optimizing non-cardiac peripheral parameters is vital.\r\n      Extra-cardiac potentially reversible factors are anemia with low oxygen-carrying \r\n      capacity, obesity and general deconditioning with low muscle mass. In addition,\r\n      exercise training in CF-LVAD patients can improve peak VO2. To design\r\n      interventions to improve functional capacity in patients treated with modern\r\n      durable LVADs, a detailed understanding of exercise physiology in a\r\n      continuous-flow circulatory system is necessary. In this review we address the\r\n      different components of exercise physiology in LVAD patients and point out\r\n      potential solutions or areas of future research.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

If weaning off ECLS is not possible, heart\r\n      transplantation or implantation of long-term mechanical circulatory support\r\n      (LTMCS) is required. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the\r\n      bridge-to-bridge (BTB) concept. METHODS: Between 1 January 2004 and 1 August\r\n      2010, 97 patients were assisted by LTMCS. The implantation was the first-line\r\n      intervention in 48 patients (the bridge group), and was performed after a period \r\n      of ECLS support in 49 others (the BTB group). RESULTS: The long-term survival\r\n      rate was 51.6\%, with a mean follow-up of 30.7 months, and there were no\r\n      differences for biological parameters between the two groups. Patients in the BTB\r\n      group whose condition was initially more severe, improved under ECLS support, and\r\n      those in whom biological parameters did not revert to normal died after LTMCS.\r\n      Risk factors for mortality in the BTB group were total bilirubin and lactate\r\n      before LTMCS, and alkaline phosphatase before ECLS support. CONCLUSIONS: The BTB \r\n      concept allows the implementation of LTMCS in severe patients, for whom it was\r\n      not originally envisaged, with the same long-term survival as in first-line\r\n      settings. ECLS in the evolution of patients is predictive of survival after\r\n      LTMCS.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2015.

They offer several\r\n      advantages over previously used pulsatile-flow LVADs, including improved\r\n      durability, less surgical trauma, higher energy efficiency, and lower\r\n      thrombogenicity. These benefits translate into better survival, lower frequency\r\n      of adverse events, improved quality of life, and higher functional capacity of\r\n      patients. However, mounting evidence shows unanticipated consequences of\r\n      continuous-flow support, such as acquired aortic valve insufficiency and acquired\r\n      von Willebrand syndrome. In this review article we discuss current evidence on\r\n      differences between continuous and pulsatile mechanical circulatory support, with\r\n      a focus on clinical implications and potential benefits of pulsatile flow.\r\nFAU - Baric, Davor\r\nAU  - Baric D\r\nAD  - Davor Baric, Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Dubrava\r\n      University Hospital, Avenija Gojka Suska 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, dbaric@kbd.hr.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Review\r\nPL  - Croatia\r\nTA  - Croat Med J\r\nJT  - Croatian medical journal\r\nJID - 9424324\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Heart Failure/*physiopathology\r\nMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Pulsatile Flow\r\nMH  - Quality of Life\r\nPMC - PMC4295069\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4295069\r\nEDAT- 2015/01/07 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/22 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/01/07 06:00\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Croat Med J. 2014 Dec;55(6):609-20.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25559830\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20150106\r\nDCOM- 20150420\r\nLR  - 20150225\r\nIS  - 1332-8166 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0353-9504 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 55\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Dec\r\nTI  - Ventricular assist device selection: which one and when?\r\nPG  - 596-9\r\nAB  - Advances in mechanical circulatory support have significantly expanded the\r\n      treatment options for patients with heart failure, whether acute or chronic.\r\n      There are numerous devices available that offer patients short-, intermediate-,\r\n      and long-term duration of support depending on their clinical needs and cardiac\r\n      recovery. Each device has its own technical considerations and the decision which\r\n      device to use depends on several factors, including what is available, the degree\r\n      of support required, and expected duration of support. Additional issues that\r\n      need to be considered in choosing level of support include right heart function, \r\n      respiratory failure, and multi-organ derangements. A widespread availability of\r\n      short-term ventricular assist devices and timely institution for effective\r\n      hemodynamic support will translate into improved patient outcomes whether that is\r\n      successful transfer to a tertiary care facility or recovery of inherent cardiac\r\n      function.

The first device (HeartMate II)\r\n      was implanted as a bridge to transplantation. However, after few months of\r\n      support the patient showed signs of myocardial recovery and the device was\r\n      successfully explanted. After 2 years of uneventful follow-up, the patient\'s\r\n      condition deteriorated requiring further mechanical support. Due to the elevated \r\n      risk associated with a redo full-support LVAD implantation, we decided to implant\r\n      a partial support device (Synergy(R) CircuLite). Because of recurrent pump\r\n      thrombosis requiring device exchange, the final weeks to transplantation were\r\n      bridged with CentriMag(R) short-term LVAD. After successful cardiac\r\n      transplantation the patient required further temporary extracorporeal membrane\r\n      oxygenation support which was weaned off and explanted on the fourth\r\n      postoperative day.

At the present time, there are\r\n      only limited means of quantifying disease severity or the concomitant morbidity\r\n      for this population. This study describes the development of a novel pediatric\r\n      treatment intensity score (TIS), designed to quantify the burden of illness and\r\n      clinical trajectory in children on VAD support. METHODS: There were 5 clinical\r\n      domains assessed: nutrition, respiratory support, activity level, cardiovascular \r\n      medications, and care environment. A scale was developed through expert\r\n      consensus. Higher scores indicate greater morbidity as reflected by intensity of \r\n      medical management. To evaluate feasibility and face validity, the TIS was\r\n      applied retrospectively to a subset of pediatric inpatients with VADs. The\r\n      Bland-Altman method was used to assess limits of agreement. RESULTS: The study\r\n      comprised 39 patients with 42 implantations. Bland-Altman interobserver and\r\n      intraobserver comparisons showed good agreement (mean differences in scores of\r\n      0.02, limits of agreement +/-0.12). Trends in TIS were concordant with the\r\n      overall clinical impression of improvement. Scores remained >/=0.6 preceding VAD \r\n      implantation and peaked at 0.71 3 days after VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: We\r\n      describe a pediatric VAD scoring tool, to assess global patient morbidity and\r\n      clinical recovery. We demonstrate feasibility of using this TIS in a test\r\n      population of inpatients on VAD support.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hemodynamic,\r\n      clinical, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic variables poorly discriminate\r\n      patients at risk of RVF. We examined the utility of 3-dimensional\r\n      echocardiography (3DE) right ventricular (RV) volumetric assessment to identify\r\n      patients at risk for RVF. METHODS AND RESULTS: RVF was defined as the need for\r\n      inotropic infusion for >14 days after LVAD surgery or the need for biventricular \r\n      assist device support. Preoperative RV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were\r\n      measured, blinded to clinical data, from transthoracic 3DE full volume data sets \r\n      in 26 patients. Baseline variables and 3DE RV indices were compared between\r\n      patients with and without RVF. Twenty-four patients received continuous-flow\r\n      LVADs, and 2 required biventricular support devices. Ten patients required\r\n      prolonged inotropes after LVAD placement. Baseline characteristics associated\r\n      with RVF included higher right atrial pressure, higher right atrial pressure to\r\n      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio, and lower cardiac index and RV stroke\r\n      work index (RVSWI). Echocardiographic indices associated with RVF included 3DE\r\n      indexed RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDVI and RVESVI) and RV\r\n      ejection fraction (RVEF). The relationship between 3DE quantification of RV\r\n      volumes and the development of RVF was independent from RVSWI: RVEDVI: odds ratio\r\n      (OR) 1.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.33 (P = .04); RVESVI: OR 1.14, 95\%\r\n      CI 1.01-1.28 (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 3DE is a promising method for\r\n      pre-LVAD RV assessment. RV volumes assessed by 3DE are predictive of RVF in LVAD \r\n      recipients independently from hemodynamic correlates of RV function.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Innovative counterpulsation\r\n      devices based on the established principle of the intra-aortic balloon pump have \r\n      been developed, and of these, the CardioVad and the C-Pulse System have been\r\n      introduced in clinical practice with convincing evidence of haemodynamic\r\n      efficacy. The evolution from pulsatile to continuous-flow left ventricular assist\r\n      devices has been associated with improved survival rates during the first 2 years\r\n      of support with the potential of matching heart transplantation outcomes.\r\n      However, blood contact with the device remains a significant challenge despite\r\n      the highly sophisticated technology currently available. Innovative\r\n      extra-vascular counterpulsation devices have been shown to overcome the\r\n      limitations of the intra-aortic balloon pump and rend the device suitable for\r\n      prolonged support. Monitoring of the performance of these novel devices is\r\n      essential, and carotid Doppler ultrasonography is of utility in assessing the\r\n      haemodynamic performance of the devices in a clinical setting. Computational\r\n      modelling has played a role in the simulation of these devices and should\r\n      continue to assist with their optimisation and implementation in clinical\r\n      practice.\r\nFAU - Capoccia, M\r\nAU  - Capoccia M\r\nAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery, Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, UK,\r\n      capoccia@doctors.org.uk.\r\nFAU - Bowles, C T\r\nAU  - Bowles CT\r\nFAU - Pepper, J R\r\nAU  - Pepper JR\r\nFAU - Banner, N R\r\nAU  - Banner NR\r\nFAU - Simon, A R\r\nAU  - Simon AR\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Heart Fail Rev\r\nJT  - Heart failure reviews\r\nJID - 9612481\r\nSB  - IM\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/18 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/18 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9468-1 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2015 May;20(3):323-35. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9468-1.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25512901\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141216\r\nDCOM- 20141216\r\nLR  - 20141218\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Nov\r\nTI  - Present and future perspectives on total artificial hearts.\r\nPG  - 595-602\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.05 [doi]\r\nAB  - Due to shortages in donor organ availability, advanced heart-failure patients are\r\n      at high risk of further decompensation and often death while awaiting\r\n      transplantation. This shortage has led to the development of effective mechanical\r\n      circulatory support (MCS). Currently, various implantable ventricular-assist\r\n      devices (VADs) are able to provide temporary or long-term circulatory support for\r\n      many end-stage heart-failure patients. Implantation of a total artificial heart\r\n      (TAH) currently represents the surgical treatment option for patients requiring\r\n      biventricular MCS as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT).\r\n      However, the clinical applicability of available versions of positive\r\n      displacement pumps is limited by their size and associated complications.\r\n      Application of advanced technology is aimed at solving some of these issues,\r\n      attempting to develop a new generation of smaller and more effective TAHs to suit\r\n      a wider patient population. Particular targets for improvement include\r\n      modifications to the biocompatibility of device designs and materials in order to\r\n      decrease hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. Meanwhile, new systems to \r\n      power implanted driving units which are fully operational without interruption of\r\n      skin barriers represent a potential means of decreasing the risk of infections.\r\n      In this review, we will discuss the history of the TAH, its development and\r\n      clinical application, the implications of the existing technological solutions,\r\n      published outcomes and the future outlook for TAHs.\r\nFAU - Gerosa, Gino\r\nAU  - Gerosa G\r\nAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular\r\n      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of \r\n      Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative\r\n      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University\r\n      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai\r\n      Hospital, New York, USA.\r\nFAU - Scuri, Silvia\r\nAU  - Scuri S\r\nAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular\r\n      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of \r\n      Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative\r\n      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University\r\n      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai\r\n      Hospital, New York, USA.\r\nFAU - Iop, Laura\r\nAU  - Iop L\r\nAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular\r\n      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of \r\n      Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative\r\n      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University\r\n      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai\r\n      Hospital, New York, USA.\r\nFAU - Torregrossa, Gianluca\r\nAU  - Torregrossa G\r\nAD  - 1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular\r\n      Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 2 Padua Heart Project, Division of \r\n      Cardiac Surgery, A.O. of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 3 Cardiovascular Regenerative\r\n      Medicine Lab, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University\r\n      of Padua, Padua, Italy ; 4 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mount Sinai\r\n      Hospital, New York, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4250545\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4250545\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Mechanical circulatory support (MCS)\r\nOT  - heart failure\r\nOT  - total artificial heart (TAH)\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/17 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/06/11 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/21 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.05 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-06-595 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Nov;3(6):595-602. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.05.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25512897\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141216\r\nDCOM- 20141216\r\nLR  - 20141218\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Nov\r\nTI  - Comparison of continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow left ventricular assist devices:\r\n      is there an advantage to pulsatility?\r\nPG  - 573-81\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CFVAD) are currently\r\n      the most widely used type of mechanical circulatory support as\r\n      bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy for end-stage congestive heart\r\n      failure (HF). Compared to the first generation pulsatile-flow left ventricular\r\n      assist devices (PFVADs), CFVADs have demonstrated improved reliability and\r\n      durability. However, CFVADs have also been associated with certain complications \r\n      thought to be linked with decreased arterial pulsatility. Previous studies\r\n      comparing CFVADs and PFVADs have presented conflicting results. It is important\r\n      to understand the outcome differences between CFVAD and PFVAD in order to further\r\n      advance the current VAD technology. METHODS: In this review, we compared the\r\n      outcomes of CFVADs and PFVADs and examined the need for arterial pulsatility for \r\n      the future generation of mechanical circulatory support. RESULTS: CVADs offer\r\n      advantages of smaller size, increased reliability and durability, and subsequent \r\n      improvements in survival. However, with the increasing duration of long-term\r\n      support, it appears that CFVADs may have specific complications and a lower rate \r\n      of left ventricular recovery associated with diminished pulsatility, increased\r\n      pressure gradients on the aortic valve and decreased compliance in smaller\r\n      arterial vessels. PFVAD support or pulsatility control algorithms in CFVADs could\r\n      be beneficial and potentially necessary for long term support. CONCLUSIONS: Given\r\n      the relative advantages and disadvantages of CFVADs and PFVADs, the ultimate\r\n      solution may lie in incorporating pulsatility into current and emerging CFVADs\r\n      whilst retaining their existing benefits. Future studies examining physiologic\r\n      responses, end-organ function and LV remodeling at varying degrees of pulsatility\r\n      and device support levels are needed.\r\nFAU - Cheng, Allen\r\nAU  - Cheng A\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,\r\n      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.\r\nFAU - Williamitis, Christine A\r\nAU  - Williamitis CA\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,\r\n      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.\r\nFAU - Slaughter, Mark S\r\nAU  - Slaughter MS\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,\r\n      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4250555\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4250555\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Continuous flow (CF)\r\nOT  - left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nOT  - myocardial recovery\r\nOT  - pulsatile flow (PF)\r\nOT  - pulsatility\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/17 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/06/27 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/23 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-06-573 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Nov;3(6):573-81. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25512893\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141216\r\nDCOM- 20141216\r\nLR  - 20141218\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Nov\r\nTI  - Durability of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices: a systematic\r\n      review.\r\nPG  - 547-56\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.11.01 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are becoming an increasingly \r\n      viable alternative therapy for heart failure, either as a bridge to heart\r\n      transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy (DT). The latter has become\r\n      increasingly popular in recent years, in the face of a donor organ shortage and a\r\n      rise in elderly patients ineligible for heart transplants. For these patients in \r\n      particular, device durability is a key contributor to survival, morbidity, and\r\n      quality of life. This systematic review aimed to assess the long-term durability \r\n      of current continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched\r\n      from their dates of inception to August 2014 for original studies reporting on\r\n      patients receiving continuous-flow LVADs. LVAD failure was defined as device\r\n      malfunction necessitating exchange or explantation, or causing patient mortality.\r\n      Pooled averages were calculated for outcomes and rates of device failure were\r\n      reconstructed from digitized graph curves using the software, WebPlotDigitizer\r\n      v3.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective observational studies with a total of 5,471\r\n      patients were included for analysis. The mean duration of LVAD support was 504.7 \r\n      (range, 303-568) days, and the overall weighted incidence of device failure was\r\n      3.9\% (range, 1-11.3\%). On average, pump thrombosis was the most common cause of\r\n      device failure (50.5\%), followed by lead or cable damage (21.7\%), mechanical pump\r\n      failure (11.6\%), device-related infection (11.1\%), and surgical complications\r\n      from implantation (2.5\%). Long-term device failure rates at 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and \r\n      24-months post-implantation were 0.5\%, 1.8\%, 2.9\%, 4.5\% and 6.5\%, respectively.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: With the expected rise in LVAD usage for end-stage heart failure,\r\n      particularly as a DT, the steady minority of patients experiencing device failure\r\n      is likely to increase. Further investigation is required into the incidence and\r\n      mechanism of major causes of failure, as well as design improvements that may\r\n      address these complications.

We aimed to compare the outcomes\r\n      after the implementation of three heart replacement strategies in this high-risk \r\n      population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients\r\n      between the ages of 65 and 72 receiving a continuous-flow LVAD as bridge to\r\n      transplantation or destination therapy or isolated HTx at our center between 2005\r\n      and 2012. The patients were stratified according to treatment strategy into three\r\n      groups: group D (destination LVAD, n = 23), group B (bridge to transplantation\r\n      LVAD, n = 43), and group H (HTx alone, n = 47). The primary outcomes of interest \r\n      were survival to discharge and 2-year overall survival. RESULTS: The patients in \r\n      group D were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of ischemic\r\n      cardiomyopathy, and had a higher pulmonary vascular resistance than did patients \r\n      in groups B or H. There were no significant differences between groups in\r\n      survival to discharge (87\% D vs 83.7\% B vs 87.2\% H, p = 0.88) or 2-year overall\r\n      survival (75.7\% D vs 68.7\% B vs 80.9\% H, log-rank p = 0.47). The incidence rates \r\n      of readmission were 1.1 events/patient.year in group D and 0.5\r\n      events/patient.year in group H. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference \r\n      in perioperative, short-term, and medium-term survival between the treatment\r\n      groups. However, the LVAD patients had a higher incidence of readmission. Larger \r\n      trials are needed to refine differences in long-term survival, quality of life,\r\n      and resource utilization for elderly patients requiring heart replacement\r\n      therapy.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwent\r\n      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile\r\n      (HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and the\r\n      effect on body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) who\r\n      underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for\r\n      weight change. In the 30-day survivors, end points of the study were continued\r\n      LVAD support, heart transplant, or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass\r\n      surgery and was excluded. RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria,\r\n      BMI was 35.6 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 +/- 5.5\r\n      kg/m(2) (mean BMI change -2.5 kg/m(2); P = .063), with a mean follow-up time of\r\n      301.6 +/- 255.5 days. The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9\r\n      kg/m(2) (P = .016 vs baseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1 kg/m(2)\r\n      increase in BMI. BMI <30 kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\%), 5\r\n      of 19 (26\%) in XVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 \r\n      XVE, 2 HMII) or 50\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was\r\n      4.6 kg/m(2) (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30\r\n      kg/m(2) provided significant weight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in\r\n      recipients of the continuous flow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a\r\n      heart transplant after LVAD insertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6 kg/m(2) (P =\r\n      .003). LVAD implantation provides a period of hemodynamic support for obese\r\n      patients with advanced heart failure, during which time opportunity may be\r\n      available for weight loss. Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater\r\n      weight loss than nonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may\r\n      be necessary to achieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous\r\n      flow LVAD.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: A hermeneutic-phenomenological inquiry guided by van\r\n      Manen\'s methods was used to explore the LVAD-DT family caregiving\r\n      experience.Participants/Setting-Seven family caregivers (1 man and 6 women) 50 to\r\n      74 years old who cared for an adult with an LVAD-DT in home settings. Recruitment\r\n      and data collection occurred in an outpatient mechanical circulatory support\r\n      center in the Midwest. METHODS: Data were collected by means of face-to-face\r\n      interviews using open-ended questions and 1 follow-up interview. Interviews were \r\n      audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis consisted of writing, \r\n      rewriting, and reflecting across participants\' data, which produced themes\r\n      illustrating the experience and meaning of caring for an adult with an LVAD-DT.\r\n      Themes were consensually validated. Procedures for trustworthiness are described.\r\n      RESULTS: Five main themes were identified from participants\' experiences: (1)\r\n      advanced heart failure is a life-changing event, (2) self-doubt about LVAD\r\n      caregiving improves over time, (3) lifestyle adjustments come with time, (4)\r\n      persistent worry and stress, and (5) caregiving is not a burden-it\'s a part of\r\n      life. These main themes were elucidated by 8 subthemes in which participants\r\n      described a process of adjustment despite persistent worry and stress and\r\n      eventually accepted caregiving as part of their lives. Future studies are needed \r\n      to explore caregiver burden, adaptation, and the effects of caregiving outcomes, \r\n      such as emotional and physical health and overall quality of life.\r\nFAU - Marcuccilli, Linda\r\nAU  - Marcuccilli L\r\nAD  - Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.\r\nFAU - Casida, Jesus Jessie\r\nAU  - Casida JJ\r\nAD  - The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\r\nFAU - Bakas, Tamilynn\r\nAU  - Bakas T\r\nAD  - Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.\r\nFAU - Pagani, Francis D\r\nAU  - Pagani FD\r\nAD  - The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 5T32 NR007066/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Prog Transplant\r\nJT  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)\r\nJID - 100909380\r\nSB  - N\r\nMH  - Aged\r\nMH  - Caregivers/*psychology\r\nMH  - Family/*psychology\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Heart Failure/*nursing/*psychology\r\nMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Interviews as Topic\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Middle Aged\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/10 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/02/13 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/10 06:00\r\nAID - LJH58WH6372L5713 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.7182/pit2014684 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Prog Transplant. 2014 Dec;24(4):332-40. doi: 10.7182/pit2014684.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25487235\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20150214\r\nIS  - 1569-9285 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1569-9285 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 20\r\nIP  - 3\r\nDP  - 2015 Mar\r\nTI  - Post-heart transplantation outcome of HeartMate II-bridged recipients requiring\r\n      unplanned concomitant temporary right ventricular mechanical support.\r\nPG  - 372-8\r\nLID - 10.1093/icvts/ivu408 [doi]\r\nAB  - OBJECTIVES: Second-generation axial-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) \r\n      have become an established therapy in bridging end-stage heart failure patients\r\n      to cardiac transplantation. Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,\r\n      some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We \r\n      sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II\r\n      (HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure \r\n      and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD. METHODS:\r\n      This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patients transplanted during \r\n      2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were divided into two groups\r\n      according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) or required\r\n      additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were compared for\r\n      early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major early\r\n      post-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival. RESULTS: Early graft\r\n      loss was 10.7\% in isolated HMII and 25\% in HMII + RVAD patients (P = 0.26). There\r\n      were no observed differences in the rates of primary graft dysfunction (7.3 vs\r\n      0\%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5\%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25\%, P =\r\n      0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary artery resistance (odds ratio: 3.286,\r\n      95\% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant\r\n      predictor for adverse outcome of mechanically-bridged heart transplant\r\n      recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 +/- 5\% in isolated HMII and 75 \r\n      +/- 15\% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate\r\n      that heart transplant recipients who required unplanned RV mechanical support\r\n      after LVAD implantation achieved comparable rates of early graft loss,\r\n      post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged\r\n      with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-year graft survival was\r\n      equivalent between those two groups. Given the small sample size, further studies\r\n      involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2014.

The goal of this study was to review our 7 year single\r\n      institutional experience with CF LVADs. Mean age was 50.4 + 12.5 (17-69) years\r\n      for bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) patients and 57.6 + 10.4 (31-81) years for\r\n      destination therapy (DT) patients (p < 0.001). Overall, 38 patients (26\%) were\r\n      female and 58 (41\%) were African American. Etiology of heart failure was ischemic\r\n      in 54 patients (37\%) and nonischemic in 93 patients (63\%). Overall survival at 30\r\n      days, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years was 93\%, 89\%, 84\%, and 81\%, respectively. \r\n      Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) was the most common complication (24\%), followed \r\n      by stroke (18\%), right ventricular (RV) failure (18\%), ventilator-dependent\r\n      respiratory failure (10\%), reoperation for bleeding (10\%), and driveline\r\n      infection (9\%). These data demonstrate excellent survival with low mortality for \r\n      both BTT and DT patients on long-term LVAD support. However, for LVAD therapy to \r\n      become the gold standard for long-term treatment of end-stage heart failure and a\r\n      plausible alternative to heart transplantation, we need to continue to improve\r\n      the incidence of frequent postoperative complications, such as RV failure,\r\n      driveline infections, strokes, and GIB.\r\nFAU - Tsiouris, Athanasios\r\nAU  - Tsiouris A\r\nAD  - From the *Section of Cardiac Surgery, Yale University, School of Medicine, New\r\n      Haven, Connecticut; and daggerDivision of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Henry Ford\r\n      Hospital, Detroit, Michigan.\r\nFAU - Paone, Gaetano\r\nAU  - Paone G\r\nFAU - Nemeh, Hassan W\r\nAU  - Nemeh HW\r\nFAU - Brewer, Robert J\r\nAU  - Brewer RJ\r\nFAU - Borgi, Jamil\r\nAU  - Borgi J\r\nFAU - Hodari, Arielle\r\nAU  - Hodari A\r\nFAU - Morgan, Jeffrey A\r\nAU  - Morgan JA\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - ASAIO J\r\nJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)\r\nJID - 9204109\r\nSB  - IM\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/09 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/09 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/09 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000191 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - ASAIO J. 2015 May-Jun;61(3):266-73. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000191.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25475468\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141205\r\nDCOM- 20150218\r\nIS  - 1916-7075 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0828-282X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 30\r\nIP  - 12\r\nDP  - 2014 Dec\r\nTI  - Multicentre Canadian experience with the HeartWare ventricular assist device:\r\n      concerns about adverse neurological outcomes.\r\nPG  - 1662-7\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.cjca.2014.07.746 [doi]\r\nLID - S0828-282X(14)01255-0 [pii]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare left ventricular assist device (HVAD; HeartWare Inc,\r\n      Framingham, MA) was first implanted in Canada in 2010. We performed a multicentre\r\n      analysis of the real world outcomes associated with its use. METHODS: Between May\r\n      2010 and January 2013, 4 Canadian centres inserted a total of 72 HVADs in 71\r\n      patients. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively for the \r\n      1-year estimate of the principal outcome of transplant, explant for recovery, or \r\n      death in patients who had a bridge to transplantation indication. Adverse event\r\n      rates were estimated as events per patient-year (PPY). RESULTS: In the 67\r\n      patients who received the HVAD with the indication of bridge to transplant, 26\r\n      (38.8\%) received a successful transplant, 2 (3\%) received an explant for\r\n      recovery, and 10 (14.9\%) patients died during support. Median follow-up time with\r\n      the HVAD was 6.9 months (range, 2 days to 30.4 months). Despite having 74\% of the\r\n      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support \r\n      (INTERMACS) scores of level 1 and 2 at the time of implantation, the rate\r\n      estimate for survival at 1 year was 86.3\% (95\% confidence interval, 76.7-93.3).\r\n      With 48.2 total patient years of support, the rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic\r\n      strokes were 0.21 and 0.19 events PPY, respectively. Women made up 40\% of the\r\n      cohort and an adverse neurologic event occurred with an event rate of 0.38 PPY in\r\n      women. CONCLUSIONS: The HVAD adequately supports acutely ill heart failure\r\n      patients until the time of transplant or recovery. A high incidence of adverse\r\n      neurologic outcomes might be related to the large percentage of female patients, \r\n      the high INTERMACS levels, or unknown factors; further surveillance is required.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

METHODS: We provide a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the\r\n      recipients, the donors, the surgical procedure, and results of the heart\r\n      transplantations performed in Spain until 31 December 2013. RESULTS: During 2013,\r\n      a total of 248 transplantation procedures were carried out, bringing the time\r\n      series to a total of 7023 transplantations. The temporal analysis confirms a\r\n      significant deterioration in the clinical profile of the recipients (higher\r\n      percentage of older patients, severe renal failure, insulin-dependent diabetes\r\n      mellitus, previous heart surgery, mechanical ventilation), of the donors (higher \r\n      proportion of older donors and greater weight mismatch), and of the procedure\r\n      (higher percentage of emergency transplantations which, in 2013, reached 49\%, and\r\n      with ischemia times > 240min). There was a marked increase in the use of\r\n      circulatory assist devices prior to transplantation which, in 2013, were employed\r\n      in 25.2\% of all the patients. The survivals at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 76\%,\r\n      65\%, 52\%, and 37\%, respectively, and have remained stable since 1995.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation activity in Spain remains stable in recent\r\n      years, with around 250 procedures a year. Despite the clear deterioration in the \r\n      clinical characteristics of the donors and recipients, and lengthening of the\r\n      operative times, the results in terms of mortality continue to be comparable to\r\n      those reported in our neighboring countries, and a growing use of circulatory\r\n      assist devices prior to transplantation is confirmed.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia.

The conventional LVADs are\r\n      designed to provide full hemodynamic support for the end-stage failing heart.\r\n      However, full-support LVAD implantation requires major surgery, sternotomy and\r\n      cardiopulmonary bypass in majority of cases. The Synergy Micro-pump is the\r\n      smallest implantable LVAD and provides partial flow support up to 3 l/min. It was\r\n      shown that early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits\r\n      to patients with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support\r\n      LVAD. Due the small dimensions it can be implanted without cardiopulmonary bypass\r\n      or a sternotomy. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical use of the\r\n      Synergy Micro-pump as partial hemodynamic support.\r\nFAU - Mohite, Prashant N\r\nAU  - Mohite PN\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical support, Royal\r\n      Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.\r\nFAU - Sabashnikov, Anton\r\nAU  - Sabashnikov A\r\nFAU - Simon, Andre Ruediger\r\nAU  - Simon AR\r\nFAU - Weymann, Alexander\r\nAU  - Weymann A\r\nFAU - Patil, Nikhil Prakash\r\nAU  - Patil NP\r\nFAU - Unsoeld, Bernhard\r\nAU  - Unsoeld B\r\nFAU - Bireta, Christian\r\nAU  - Bireta C\r\nFAU - Popov, Aron Frederik\r\nAU  - Popov AF\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20141202\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Expert Rev Med Devices\r\nJT  - Expert review of medical devices\r\nJID - 101230445\r\nSB  - IM\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - LVAD\r\nOT  - circulate\r\nOT  - partial support device\r\nOT  - synergy\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/12/02 [aheadofprint]\r\nAID - 10.1586/17434440.2015.985208 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Expert Rev Med Devices. 2015 Jan;12(1):49-60. doi: 10.1586/17434440.2015.985208. \r\n      Epub 2014 Dec 2.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25452913\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141202\r\nDCOM- 20141202\r\nLR  - 20141215\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep\r\nTI  - Mechanical circulatory support devices as destination therapy-current evidence.\r\nPG  - 513-24\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.20 [doi]\r\nAB  - Advanced heart failure is an increasing problem worldwide. Nowadays, mechanical\r\n      circulatory support devices (MSCD) are an established therapeutic option for\r\n      terminal heart failure after exhaustion of medical and conventional surgical\r\n      treatment, and are becoming a realistic alternative to heart transplantation\r\n      (HTX). There are a number of different treatment options for these patients, such\r\n      as bridge to transplantation (BTT), bridge to candidacy (BTC), bridge to recovery\r\n      (BTR) and the destination therapy (DT) option. The latter option has become more \r\n      frequent throughout the last years, due to a donor organ shortage and an\r\n      increasing number of older patients with terminal heart failure who are not\r\n      eligible for HTX. These factors have led to a rapidly increasing number of LVAD\r\n      implantations as well as centers which perform these procedures. This has also\r\n      been due to improved LVAD survival rates and quality of life following the\r\n      introduction of smaller, intrapericardial and more durable continuous flow left\r\n      ventricular devices. The most common complications for these patients are\r\n      device-related problems, such as coagulation disorders, gastrointestinal\r\n      bleeding, device related infection, pump thrombosis or cerebrovascular accidents.\r\n      However, some questions still remain unanswered or under debate, such as the\r\n      exact time-point for LVAD implantation. In addition, aspects such as better\r\n      biocompatibility for LVADs remain a major challenge. This review will concentrate\r\n      on DT for terminal heart failure and provide an overview of the current evidence \r\n      for LVAD implantation in this patient group, with particular emphasis on\r\n      indication and time-point of implantation, choice of LVADs, and long term\r\n      outcomes and quality of life.\r\nFAU - Puehler, Thomas\r\nAU  - Puehler T\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Ensminger, Stephan\r\nAU  - Ensminger S\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Schoenbrodt, Michael\r\nAU  - Schoenbrodt M\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Borgermann, Jochen\r\nAU  - Borgermann J\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Rehn, Erik\r\nAU  - Rehn E\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Hakim-Meibodi, Kavous\r\nAU  - Hakim-Meibodi K\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Morshuis, Michiel\r\nAU  - Morshuis M\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Gummert, Jan\r\nAU  - Gummert J\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4229463\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4229463\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Heart transplantation (HTX)\r\nOT  - heart insufficiency\r\nOT  - left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory report (MCS)\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/06/20 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/23 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.20 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-05-513 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Sep;3(5):513-24. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.20.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25452912\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141202\r\nDCOM- 20141202\r\nLR  - 20141215\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep\r\nTI  - Mechanical circulatory support in pediatrics.\r\nPG  - 507-12\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.25 [doi]\r\nAB  - There is no reliable published data on the overall prevalence or incidence of\r\n      heart failure (HF) in children. However, the success of mechanical circulatory\r\n      support (MCS) in management of HF has raised the prospect of a previously\r\n      unavailable treatment modality. Orthotopic heart transplant (OHTx) remains the\r\n      gold standard treatment, but the number of patients requiring this treatment far \r\n      outweighs the donor availability. It is therefore not surprising to see the\r\n      popularity of various MCS modalities, with different devices ranging from\r\n      veno-arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) to ventricular\r\n      assist devices (VADs), which are either para-corporeal or intra-corporeal, with\r\n      pulsatile or continuous flow. Indication, timing and the choice of the type of\r\n      mechanical support are crucial so in order to avoid potential lethal\r\n      complications such as hemorrhage, thrombo-embolism and infections. In the\r\n      pediatric population, MCS is used mainly as bridge to transplantation but can be \r\n      used as bridge to recovery in patients with acute myocarditis or following\r\n      open-heart surgery. Active research is currently underway to develop newer and\r\n      more durable devices that will assist the pediatric population across all age\r\n      groups. This research will support different pathologies that have lower\r\n      incidences of major morbidities, particularly as greater durations of MCS are\r\n      expected due to a paucity of donors for OHTx. The combined experience developed\r\n      through the usage of different devices in pediatric and adult populations has led\r\n      to the to the application of MCS in some subgroups of grown-up congenital heart\r\n      diseases (CHDs) patients, particularly those with systemic right ventricular\r\n      failure.\r\nFAU - Gandolfo, Fabrizio\r\nAU  - Gandolfo F\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nFAU - De Rita, Fabrizio\r\nAU  - De Rita F\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nFAU - Hasan, Asif\r\nAU  - Hasan A\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nFAU - Griselli, Massimo\r\nAU  - Griselli M\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4229474\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4229474\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Pediatric heart failure\r\nOT  - congenital\r\nOT  - extra corporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO)\r\nOT  - heart transplantation\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory support (MCS)\r\nOT  - ventricular assist devices (VADs)\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/05/24 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/25 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.25 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-05-507 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Sep;3(5):507-12. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.25.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25452908\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141202\r\nDCOM- 20141202\r\nLR  - 20141215\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep\r\nTI  - Clinical psychological and neuropsychological issues with left ventricular assist\r\n      devices (LVADs).\r\nPG  - 480-9\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.14 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly being used\r\n      to treat patients in end-stage heart failure (HF) as bridge-to-transplantation,\r\n      lifetime support or destination therapy. However, the importance of this newer\r\n      technique for chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still \r\n      open to discussion. To date, there are few studies that extensively explore the\r\n      psychological and cognitive profiles of patient with ventricular assist devices\r\n      (VADs). METHODS: We studied the psychological aspects, quality of life (QOL) and \r\n      cognitive profiles of 19 patients with HF before VAD implantation and then at\r\n      two, five and 16 months post-implantation. RESULTS: Our results showed that after\r\n      VAD implantation, patients did not show any psychopathological problems such as\r\n      anxiety and/or depression. More interestingly, despite the constant risk of\r\n      neurological events determined by the continuous-blood-flow pump (CBFP),\r\n      patients\' cognitive functioning did not worsen. In fact, significant enhancements\r\n      were observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and cognitive deficits are\r\n      common in advanced HF and often worsen over time. Appropriately designed and\r\n      randomized studies are needed to demonstrate whether earlier VAD implantation is \r\n      warranted to arrest cognitive decline and encourage better post-implantation\r\n      adaptation.\r\nFAU - Mapelli, Daniela\r\nAU  - Mapelli D\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Cavazzana, Annachiara\r\nAU  - Cavazzana A\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Cavalli, Chiara\r\nAU  - Cavalli C\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Bottio, Tomaso\r\nAU  - Bottio T\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Tarzia, Vincenzo\r\nAU  - Tarzia V\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Gerosa, Gino\r\nAU  - Gerosa G\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Volpe, Bianca Rosa\r\nAU  - Volpe BR\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4229472\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4229472\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nOT  - cognitive functions\r\nOT  - emotional profile\r\nOT  - heart transplantation\r\nOT  - quality of life (QOL)\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/02/14 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/16 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.14 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-05-480 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Sep;3(5):480-9. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.14.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25447571\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20141202\r\nLR  - 20150408\r\nIS  - 1557-3117 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1053-2498 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep 28\r\nTI  - Ventricular reconditioning and pump explantation in patients supported by\r\n      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.\r\nLID - S1053-2498(14)01350-3 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.09.015 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The potential for myocardial reconditioning and device explantation\r\n      after long-term continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support\r\n      presents an opportunity to delay or avoid transplantation in select patients.\r\n      METHODS: Thirty of 657 patients with end-stage heart failure supported with\r\n      continuous-flow LVADs were assessed for device explantation. Each patient\r\n      underwent an individualized process of weaning focused on principles of\r\n      ventricular unloading, gradual reconditioning, and transition to medical therapy.\r\n      RESULTS: After varying reconditioning periods, 27 patients (16 men, 11 women;\r\n      age, 39 +/- 12 years) underwent LVAD explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman;\r\n      age, 22 +/- 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. The\r\n      duration of LVAD support was 533 +/- 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for the\r\n      explant cohort and 1,097 +/- 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explant\r\n      cohort. The LV end-diastolic dimension, LV ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary \r\n      artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort were\r\n      significantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). Two late deaths occurred \r\n      after LVAD explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1\r\n      patient required resumption of LVAD support 2.7 years after device removal.

Evolution has favored a pulsatile heart\r\n      pump to be able to deliver the maximum flow at different levels of systemic\r\n      vascular resistance, confer kinetic energy to the flow of blood past areas of\r\n      stenosis and generate low shear stress on blood elements. In this perspective, we\r\n      suggest that lack of pulsatility may be one factor that has limited the success\r\n      of continuous flow LVADs and suggest that research needs to focus on methods to\r\n      generate pulsatility either by the native heart or by various speed modulation\r\n      algorithms.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of\r\n      AF on outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD. METHODS: Records of 106 patients\r\n      who underwent HMII implantation at a single center were reviewed. The\r\n      associations of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and persistent atrial\r\n      fibrillation (PeAF) with survival, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, bleeding, \r\n      and thromboembolism were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox\r\n      proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 56.6 +/- 11.4 years, 87.7\%\r\n      of the implants were intended as a bridge to transplantation, and median length\r\n      of support was 217 days (range: 1 to 952 days). AF was present in 55 patients\r\n      (51.9\%); 36 patients (34.0\%) had PAF and 19 (17.9\%) had PeAF. Twenty-one patients\r\n      (19.8\%) died, and 18 (17.0\%) were hospitalized for HF. There were 0.75 major\r\n      bleeding events and 0.28 thromboembolic events per patient year of follow-up. PAF\r\n      was not associated with increased mortality, HF hospitalization, bleeding, or\r\n      thromboembolism. PeAF, however, was an independent predictor of the composite\r\n      endpoint of death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 3.54; 95\% confidence\r\n      interval: 1.52 to 8.25; p < 0.01). Although there was no increase in bleeding or \r\n      thromboembolism, patients with AF had thromboembolic events at higher\r\n      international normalized ratios (INRs). CONCLUSIONS: Although PAF is not\r\n      associated with worse outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD, PeAF may be\r\n      associated with increased mortality and HF hospitalization. Patients with AF also\r\n      may have thromboembolic events at higher INR levels.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by\r\n      Elsevier Inc.

Although the clinical\r\n      use of valves appeared to have remained steady for several decades, the evolving \r\n      demands for the elderly and frail patients typically encountered in the developed\r\n      world, and the needs of much younger and poorer rheumatic heart disease patients \r\n      in the developing world have now necessitated new paradigms for heart valve\r\n      technologies and associated materials. This includes further consideration of\r\n      durable elastomeric materials. The use of polymers to produce flexible leaflet\r\n      valves that have the benefits of current commercial bioprosthetic and mechanical \r\n      valves without any of their deficiencies has been held desirable since the mid\r\n      1950s. Much attention has been focused on thermoplastic polyurethanes in view of \r\n      their generally good physico-chemical properties and versatility in processing,\r\n      coupled with the improving biocompatibility and stability of recent formulations.\r\n      Accelerated in vitro durability of between 600 and 1000 million cycles has been\r\n      achieved using polycarbonate urethanes, and good resistance to degradation,\r\n      calcification and thrombosis in vivo has been shown with some polysiloxane-based \r\n      polyurethanes. Nevertheless, polymeric valves have remained relegated to use in\r\n      temporary ventricular assist devices for bridging heart failure patients to\r\n      transplantation. Some recent studies suggest that there is a greater degree of\r\n      instability in thermoplastic materials than hitherto believed so that significant\r\n      challenges remain in the search for the combination of durability and\r\n      biocompatibility that would allow polymeric valves to become a clinical reality\r\n      for surgical implantation. Perhaps more importantly, they could become candidates\r\n      for use in situations where minimally invasive transcatheter procedures are used \r\n      to replace diseased valves. Being amenable to relatively inexpensive mass\r\n      production techniques, the attainment of this goal could benefit very large\r\n      numbers of patients in developing and emerging countries who currently have no\r\n      access to treatment for rheumatic heart disease that is so prevalent in these\r\n      areas. This review discusses the evolution and current status of polymeric valves\r\n      in wide-ranging circumstances.\r\nFAU - Bezuidenhout, Deon\r\nAU  - Bezuidenhout D\r\nFAU - Williams, David F\r\nAU  - Williams DF\r\nFAU - Zilla, Peter\r\nAU  - Zilla P\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\'t\r\nPL  - Netherlands\r\nTA  - Biomaterials\r\nJT  - Biomaterials\r\nJID - 8100316\r\nSB  - IM\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/07/01 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/09/12 [accepted]\r\nAID - S0142-9612(14)01011-4 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.09.013 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Biomaterials. 2015 Jan;36:6-25.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25443016\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141203\r\nDCOM- 20150204\r\nIS  - 1552-6259 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0003-4975 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 98\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Dec\r\nTI  - Durable ventricular assist device support for failing systemic morphologic right \r\n      ventricle: early results.\r\nPG  - 2122-9\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.06.054 [doi]\r\nLID - S0003-4975(14)01338-1 [pii]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The systemic morphologic right ventricle (RV) in congenitally\r\n      corrected transposition of the great arteries or after atrial switch for\r\n      transposition of the great arteries is associated with late ventricular failure. \r\n      Although the role of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in supporting the \r\n      failing LV is established, the indications and outcomes of using LVAD in a\r\n      systemic RV remain unclear. We assessed the role of a third-generation LVAD for\r\n      systemic RV support. METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 36 years) received the\r\n      HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) VAD for systemic RV\r\n      failure (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries in 1 and\r\n      after atrial switch in 6). Four patients (57\%) had severe subpulmonic LV failure,\r\n      and aggressive perioperative diuresis with or without hemofiltration was used to \r\n      offload the subpulmonic LV. The indications of VAD were (1) bridge to transplant \r\n      in 3 and (2) bridge to decision for a high transpulmonary gradient in 4.\r\n      Transplantation outcome was compared with systemic RV failure without VAD bridge \r\n      in 19 patients (years 1989 to 2013). RESULTS: Systemic RV support alone was\r\n      achieved in all patients, with no early deaths (</=30 days). Overall, 6 (86\%)\r\n      returned home, 3 (44\%) received a transplant, 2 (28\%) died of noncardiac causes, \r\n      and 2 (28\%) continue on VAD support (median support, 232 days). Repeat\r\n      catheterization (n = 4) showed an improved median transpulmonary gradient in 3\r\n      patients (median 18.5 mm Hg pre-VAD vs 8.0 mm Hg post-VAD). Two\r\n      bridge-to-decision patients received transplants at 640 and 685 days. The stroke \r\n      rate on VAD support was 43\% (2 thromboembolic and 1 hemorrhagic; 3 with\r\n      satisfactory recovery). De novo aortic regurgitation was 29\% (n = 2; 1 valve\r\n      replacement). All patients (n = 3) survived transplantation (vs 10.5\% early\r\n      mortality without VAD bridge; p = 1.00) and were well at follow-up (range, 53 to \r\n      700 days). CONCLUSIONS: The third-generation VAD provides durable support for\r\n      systemic RV failure as a bridge to transplant and as a strategy to reduce\r\n      pulmonary vascular resistance.

Therefore, hESC-derived and hiPSC-derived\r\n      cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs and hiPSC-CMs, respectively) offer great potential for\r\n      cardiac regenerative medicine. Unlike some organs, the heart has a limited\r\n      ability to regenerate, and dysfunction resulting from significant cardiomyocyte\r\n      loss under pathophysiological conditions, such as myocardial infarction (MI), can\r\n      lead to heart failure. Unfortunately, for patients with end-stage heart failure, \r\n      heart transplantation remains the main alternative, and it is insufficient,\r\n      mainly because of the limited availability of donor organs. Although left\r\n      ventricular assist devices are progressively entering clinical practice as a\r\n      bridge to transplantation and even as an optional therapy, cell replacement\r\n      therapy presents a plausible alternative to donor organ transplantation. During\r\n      the past decade, multiple candidate cells were proposed for cardiac regeneration,\r\n      and their mechanisms of action in the myocardium have been explored. The purpose \r\n      of this article is to critically review the comprehensive research involving the \r\n      use of hESCs and hiPSCs in MI models and to discuss current controversies,\r\n      unresolved issues, challenges, and future directions.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

METHODS: Patients \r\n      with perioperative RVF who underwent temporary RVAD implantation between January \r\n      2010 and February 2014 were reviewed. A dacron graft was attached to the\r\n      pulmonary artery and passed through a subxiphoid exit, where the RVAD outflow\r\n      cannula was inserted. The inflow cannula was percutaneously cannulated in the\r\n      femoral vein, and the sternum was primarily closed. On the day of RVAD\r\n      explantation, the outflow graft of the RVAD was pulled and ligated, and the\r\n      insertion site was secondarily closed. The RVAD inflow cannula was removed, and\r\n      direct pressure was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (age 58 +/- 14 years)\r\n      were supported. Seventeen patients (81\%) had RVF after left ventricular assist\r\n      device implantation, and 4 patients developed postcardiotomy RVF. The median\r\n      duration of RVAD support was 9 days (range: 2-88 days). Eleven patients (52\%)\r\n      were successfully weaned from the RVAD. Two patients were bridged to\r\n      transplantation. Eight patients died on left ventricular assist device and/or\r\n      RVAD support. The survival rates to discharge or heart transplantation, and to\r\n      1-year, were 62\% and 52\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No technical issues were\r\n      encountered in this large series of RVAD implantations using the described\r\n      technique for various forms of postoperative RVF. Extended support duration and\r\n      reduction of resternotomy risks may be the main advantages of this technique\r\n      compared with conventional RVAD implantation methods.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

It is one of the\r\n      leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and carries a 5-year\r\n      mortality of 50\%, estimated by WHO to represent 30\% of deaths in the United\r\n      States. Costs related to the care of patients with CHF have increased\r\n      substantially over the past 2 decades partly owing to increased frequency of\r\n      hospitalization, implantation of costly novel devices and, as the disease\r\n      progresses, consideration for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, and end-of-life care. CHF progression is accompanied by changes within\r\n      the myocardium, collectively referred to as left ventricular remodeling, which\r\n      can be categorized into changes in the cardiomyocytes and changes that occur in\r\n      the volume and composition of the extracellular matrix. Since remodeling in heart\r\n      failure is progressive and detrimental, the majority of treatment strategies are \r\n      aimed at stopping or possibly reversing this process. Some successful methods\r\n      include medical management, long-term or destination mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, cardiac resychronization therapy, and biventricular pacemakers. During\r\n      the last few decades, the management of heart failure has evolved tremendously\r\n      with the introduction of new therapies and assist devices. Advances in mechanical\r\n      support, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and total artificial heart have\r\n      significantly reduced mortality in patients awaiting transplantation.

However, these therapeutic strategies are limited by a lack of\r\n      donor hearts and by the associated complications, such as coagulation and\r\n      infection, due to the used artificial mechanical circulatory assist devices.\r\n      Therefore, new strategies for myocardial regenerative approaches are under\r\n      extensive research to produce contractile myocardial tissue in the future to\r\n      replace non-contractile myocardial ischemic and scarred tissue. Different\r\n      approaches, such as cell transplantation, have been studied intensively. Although\r\n      successful approaches have been observed, there are still limitations to the\r\n      application. It is envisaged that myocardial tissue engineering can be used to\r\n      help replace infarcted non-contractile tissue. The developed tissue should later \r\n      mimic the aligned fibrillar structure of the extracellular matrix and provide\r\n      important guidance cues for the survival, function and the needed orientation of \r\n      cardiomyocytes. Nanostructured surfaces have been tested to provide a guided\r\n      direction that cells can follow. In the present study, the cellular\r\n      adhesion/alignment of human cardiomyocytes and the biocompatibility have been\r\n      investigated after cultivation on different laser-patterned nanowires compared\r\n      with unmodified nanowires. As a result, the nanostructured surfaces possessed\r\n      good biocompatibility before and after laser modification. The laser-induced\r\n      scalability of the pattern enabled the growth and orientation of the adhered\r\n      myocardial tissue. Such approaches may be used to modify the surface of potential\r\n      scaffolds to develop myocardial contractile tissue in the future.\r\nFAU - Kiefer, Karin\r\nAU  - Kiefer K\r\nAD  - Clinic for Paediatric Cardiology, Saarland University, Building 9, 66421 Homburg,\r\n      Germany.

The use of ventricular assist devices to provide circulatory \r\n      support to these patients remains challenging. In the current study, a continuous\r\n      axial-flow pump was used to support a univentricular Fontan circulation. A\r\n      modified Fontan circulation (atrio-pulmonary connection) was constructed in six\r\n      Yorkshire piglets (8-14 kg). A Dacron conduit (12 mm) with two branches was\r\n      constructed to serve as a complete atrio-pulmonary connection without the use of \r\n      cardiopulmonary bypass. The Impella pump was inserted into the conduit through an\r\n      additional Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft in five animals. Hemodynamic data\r\n      were collected for 6 hours under the supported Fontan circulation. The control\r\n      animal died after initiating the Fontan circulation independent of resuscitation.\r\n      Four pump supported animals remained hemodynamically stable for 6 hours with pump\r\n      speeds between 18,000 rpm and 22,000 rpm (P1-P3). Oxygen saturation was\r\n      maintained between 95\% and 100\%. Normal organ perfusion was illustrated by blood \r\n      gas analysis and biochemical assays. A continuous axial-flow pump can be used for\r\n      temporal circulatory support to the failing Fontan circulation as \"bridge\" to\r\n      heart transplantation or recovery.\r\nFAU - Wei, Xufeng\r\nAU  - Wei X\r\nAD  - From the Artificial Organs Laboratory, Department of Surgery, University of\r\n      Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.\r\nFAU - Sanchez, Pablo G\r\nAU  - Sanchez PG\r\nFAU - Liu, Yang\r\nAU  - Liu Y\r\nFAU - Li, Tieluo\r\nAU  - Li T\r\nFAU - Watkins, A Claire\r\nAU  - Watkins AC\r\nFAU - Wu, Zhongjun J\r\nAU  - Wu ZJ\r\nFAU - Griffith, Bartley P\r\nAU  - Griffith BP\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - ASAIO J\r\nJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)\r\nJID - 9204109\r\nSB  - IM\r\nEDAT- 2014/11/15 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/11/15 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/11/15 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000172 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - ASAIO J. 2015 Mar-Apr;61(2):196-201. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000172.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25354032\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20141030\r\nIS  - 1744-8298 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1479-6678 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 10\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep\r\nTI  - Machines versus medication for biventricular heart failure: focus on the total\r\n      artificial heart.\r\nPG  - 593-609\r\nLID - 10.2217/fca.14.47 [doi]\r\nAB  - The medical/surgical management of advanced heart failure has evolved rapidly\r\n      over the last few decades.

Clinicians have, therefore, turned to mechanical means of circulatory \r\n      support. At present, a broad range of devices are available, which may be\r\n      extracorporeal, implantable, or percutaneous; temporary or long term. Although\r\n      counter pulsation provided by intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and comprehensive \r\n      mechanical support for both the systemic and the pulmonary circulation through\r\n      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain a major tool of acute care in\r\n      patients with cardiogenic shock, both before and after surgical or percutaneous\r\n      intervention, the development of devices such as the Impella or the Tandemheart\r\n      allows less invasive forms of temporary support. On the other hand, concerning\r\n      mid-, or long-term support, left ventricular assist devices have evolved from a\r\n      last resort life-saving therapy to a well-established viable alternative for\r\n      thousands of heart failure patients caused by the shortage of donor organs\r\n      available for transplantation.

The two main reasons for this \r\n      development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing\r\n      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTX). Furthermore, the\r\n      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience\r\n      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term\r\n      patient outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist\r\n      device (LVAD) implantation at our Erlangen Heart Center during January 2000-July \r\n      2013. The main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the\r\n      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. From all patients, we created a\r\n      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and\r\n      described the overall outcome. RESULTS: VAD implantation was performed in 266\r\n      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2\% of the total of 12254 cardiac\r\n      surgical operations in that period). From these patients, 223 underwent LVAD or\r\n      biventricular (BVAD) implantation; the remaining received a right (RVAD)\r\n      implantation. The most frequent underlying clinical diagnoses were dilated (n =\r\n      84, 37.7\%, DCM) or ischemic (n = 61, 27.4\%, ICM) cardiomyopathy. The pathological\r\n      findings in the apex biopsy were generally non-specific and showed variable\r\n      interstitial myocardial fibrosis with evidence of fibre loss, fatty degeneration \r\n      and variable irregular atrophy of muscle fibres, consistent with dilated and\r\n      ischemic cardiomyopathies as the most frequent causes of heart failure in these\r\n      patients. Only a few cases showed other specific features such as myocarditis and\r\n      AL-amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during\r\n      LVAD implantation are rather non-specific and they generally reflect the late\r\n      stage or consequences of chronic myocardial damage in cases of dilated or\r\n      ischemic cardiomyopathies. Variable patchy chronic inflammatory changes may be\r\n      observed in cardiomyopathies as a non-specific reaction caused by myocardial\r\n      fiber damage and should not lead to misinterpretation as evidence of myocarditis \r\n      or revision of original diagnosis.\r\nFAU - Strecker, Thomas\r\nAU  - Strecker T\r\nAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nFAU - Rosch, Johannes\r\nAU  - Rosch J\r\nAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nFAU - Weyand, Michael\r\nAU  - Weyand M\r\nAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nFAU - Agaimy, Abbas\r\nAU  - Agaimy A\r\nAD  - Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\'t\r\nDEP - 20140815\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Int J Clin Exp Pathol\r\nJT  - International journal of clinical and experimental pathology\r\nJID - 101480565\r\nSB  - IM\r\nPMC - PMC4203167\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4203167\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)\r\nOT  - apex pathology\r\nOT  - dilatative cardiomyopathy\r\nOT  - ischemic cardiomyopathy\r\nOT  - myocarditis\r\nEDAT- 2014/10/23 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/10/23 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/10/23 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014 [ecollection]\r\nPHST- 2014/07/10 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/21 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/15 [epublish]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Aug 15;7(9):5549-56. eCollection 2014.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25330851\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141021\r\nDCOM- 20150511\r\nIS  - 2329-0358 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1425-9524 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 19\r\nDP  - 2014\r\nTI  - The effect of the sequential therapy in end-stage heart failure (ESHF)--from\r\n      ECMO, through the use of implantable pump for a pneumatic heart assist system,\r\n      Religa Heart EXT, as a bridge for orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). Case study.\r\nPG  - 537-40\r\nLID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments for\r\n      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right time\r\n      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for\r\n      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and\r\n      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient\r\n      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood\r\n      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),\r\n      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa\r\n      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant\r\n      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function \r\n      of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,\r\n      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the\r\n      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular\r\n      afterload. The experimental implantation of an innovative Religa Heart EXT\r\n      prosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. Too short time\r\n      of Religa Heart EXT implantation in the discussed patient prevented the\r\n      possibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications and\r\n      infections compared to the documented complications of POLVAD implanted until\r\n      now. OHT is a safe and efficacious method of treatment of patients previously\r\n      supported by ECMO and Religa Heart EXT.\r\nFAU - Religa, Grzegorz\r\nAU  - Religa G\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Institute of Cardiology,\r\n      Warsaw, Poland.\r\nFAU - Jasinska, Malgorzata\r\nAU  - Jasinska M\r\nAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.\r\nFAU - Czyzewski, Lukasz\r\nAU  - Czyzewski L\r\nAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.\r\nFAU - Torba, Krzysztof\r\nAU  - Torba K\r\nAD  - Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland.\r\nFAU - Rozanski, Jacek\r\nAU  - Rozanski J\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Institute of Cardiology,\r\n      Warsaw, Poland.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Case Reports\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20141021\r\nPL  - Poland\r\nTA  - Ann Transplant\r\nJT  - Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation Society\r\nJID - 9802544\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/physiopathology/surgery/therapy\r\nMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/instrumentation\r\nMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*surgery/*therapy\r\nMH  - *Heart Transplantation\r\nMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Middle Aged\r\nMH  - Poland\r\nMH  - Prosthesis Design\r\nMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/prevention & control\r\nEDAT- 2014/10/22 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/05/12 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/10/22 06:00\r\nAID - 891266 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Ann Transplant. 2014 Oct 21;19:537-40. doi: 10.12659/AOT.891266.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25329333\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20150129\r\nIS  - 1875-9114 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0277-0008 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 35\r\nIP  - 1\r\nDP  - 2015 Jan\r\nTI  - Thrombosis in continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices: pathophysiology,\r\n      prevention, and pharmacologic management.\r\nPG  - 79-98\r\nLID - 10.1002/phar.1501 [doi]\r\nAB  - Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices reduce short-term mortality and\r\n      improve quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Unfortunately, \r\n      device-related complications remain common, with many patients experiencing\r\n      adverse events within the first year. New literature suggests that rates of\r\n      device-related thrombosis may be increasing since 2011, which is particularly\r\n      troublesome given that this pathology can result in a disabling stroke, organ\r\n      damage, and death. In 2013, a group of practitioners in the field of mechanical\r\n      circulatory support published a treatment algorithm based on their expert\r\n      opinion. However, a comprehensive review of the pharmacotherapy of this condition\r\n      is lacking. A search of the literature revealed 20 separate publications of case \r\n      reports or case series describing outcomes associated with the use of drug\r\n      therapy for suspected pump thrombosis. Each of these experiences was limited by\r\n      small sample size, nonrandomized treatment allocation, and nonstandardized\r\n      medication dosing. Data describing the outcomes of surgical versus medical\r\n      management of device thrombosis are also sparse, with only three published\r\n      reports identified. Based on the review of this limited literature, surgical\r\n      management appears to be the preferred treatment modality, especially in those\r\n      with organ hypoperfusion or hemodynamic instability. In patients ineligible for\r\n      surgery, pharmacotherapy options remain limited. Use of all drug classes\r\n      described in the literature for the HeartMate II device-fibrinolytics,\r\n      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors-was hindered by \r\n      either marginal efficacy or bleeding. Based on historical experience with\r\n      unfractionated heparin in patients under HeartMate II support, we recommend this \r\n      agent as a possible option for those with suspected pump thrombosis in lieu of\r\n      surgical device exchange. For the HeartWare HVAD, limited data suggest that\r\n      direct intraventricular administration of alteplase may be an acceptable\r\n      treatment alternative. Additional research is clearly needed to further delineate\r\n      the role of pharmacotherapy and to identify the optimal agent for managing this\r\n      potentially life-threatening condition.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.\r\nFAU - Jennings, Douglas L\r\nAU  - Jennings DL\r\nAD  - Nova Southeastern University, Ft.

Patients seek out\r\n      informational resources when considering implantation. The primary study\r\n      objective was to characterize the scope and quality of available LVAD educational\r\n      materials. METHODS AND RESULTS: In July 2013, we performed a cross-sectional\r\n      search of Internet, print, and multimedia resources available to patients\r\n      considering LVAD. Written materials <10 sentences, videos <2 minutes, and\r\n      materials clearly directed to healthcare professionals were excluded.\r\n      Seventy-seven materials met inclusion criteria. Potential benefits of LVAD\r\n      therapy were discussed in all (n=77), whereas less often mentioned were risks\r\n      (n=43), lifestyle considerations (n=29), surgical details (n=26), caregiver\r\n      information (n=9), and hospice or palliative care (n=2). Of the 14 materials that\r\n      recognized a decision or alternate treatment option, 7 used outdated statistics, \r\n      12 scored above an eighth grade reading comprehension level, and 12 met <50\% of\r\n      International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. In the survey participants\r\n      rated all but one as biased toward accepting LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although \r\n      many resources exist for patients considering an LVAD, the content is suboptimal.\r\n      Benefits of LVADs are often presented in the absence of risks, alternative\r\n      options, and caregiver considerations. Most materials use outdated statistics,\r\n      are above the reading level of average Americans, and are biased toward accepting\r\n      LVAD therapy. There is no tool that would qualify as a formal decision aid.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.\r\nFAU - Iacovetto, Matthew C\r\nAU  - Iacovetto MC\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Matlock, Daniel D\r\nAU  - Matlock DD\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - McIlvennan, Colleen K\r\nAU  - McIlvennan CK\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Thompson, Jocelyn S\r\nAU  - Thompson JS\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Bradley, William\r\nAU  - Bradley W\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - LaRue, Shane J\r\nAU  - LaRue SJ\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Allen, Larry A\r\nAU  - Allen LA\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.). larry.allen@ucdenver.edu.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\'t\r\nDEP - 20141014\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes\r\nJT  - Circulation.

The focus of this study was to analyze our institution\'s \r\n      entire experience with primary CF-VAD implants, evaluate the baseline variables, \r\n      determine which factors predict the need for exchange, and evaluate the impact of\r\n      exchange on survival and event-free survival. METHODS: We retrospectively\r\n      reviewed the data of all patients in a single center who received a primary\r\n      CF-VAD implant between December 1999 and December 2013. All CF-VAD exchanges were\r\n      reviewed; demographics, indications, preoperative and operative data, and\r\n      clinical outcomes were summarized. Univariate and multivariable regression\r\n      analyses were performed to ascertain predictors for exchange. Time-to-event and\r\n      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: We identified 469 patients who\r\n      underwent 546 CF-VAD implantations. Of these patients, 66 (14\%) underwent 77\r\n      exchanges from one CF-VAD to another. The primary indications included hemolysis \r\n      or thrombosis (n = 49; 63.6\%), infection (n = 9; 11.7\%), or other causes (n = 19;\r\n      24.7\%). Survival was not significantly different between the exchange and\r\n      nonexchange groups. Multivariable regression analysis identified a history of\r\n      cerebrovascular events as a significant predictor for exchange. Among exchange\r\n      patients, 11 underwent heart transplantation, 3 had their CF-VADs explanted, 26\r\n      had ongoing support, and 26 died during device support. CONCLUSIONS: In our\r\n      series of contemporary CF-VAD exchanges, a history of previous cerebrovascular\r\n      events was a significant predictor for exchange. Exchange did not affect early or\r\n      late survival. Our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment of\r\n      pump-related complications with exchange is safe and justified.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Primarily on the basis\r\n      of these animal data, the notion that chronic left ventricular assist device\r\n      (LVAD)-induced unloading will result in atrophy has dominated the clinical heart \r\n      failure field, and anti-atrophic drugs have been used to enhance the cardiac\r\n      recovery potential observed in some LVAD patients. However, whether\r\n      unloading-induced atrophy in experimental normal heart models applies to failing \r\n      and hypertrophic myocardium in heart failure patients unloaded by continuous-flow\r\n      LVADs has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: The study examined whether mechanical\r\n      unloading by continuous-flow LVAD leads to myocardial atrophy. METHODS: We\r\n      prospectively examined myocardial tissue and hemodynamic and echocardiographic\r\n      data from 44 LVAD patients and 18 untransplanted normal donors. RESULTS:\r\n      Cardiomyocyte size (cross-sectional area) decreased after LVAD unloading from\r\n      1,238 +/- 81 mum(2) to 1,011 +/- 68 mum(2) (p = 0.001), but not beyond that of\r\n      normal donor hearts (682 +/- 56 mum(2)). Electron microscopy ultrastructural\r\n      evaluation, cardiomyocyte glycogen content, and echocardiographic assessment of\r\n      myocardial mass and left ventricular function also did not suggest myocardial\r\n      atrophy. Consistent with these findings, t-tubule morphology, cytoplasmic\r\n      penetration, and distance from the ryanodine receptor were not indicative of\r\n      ongoing atrophic remodeling during LVAD unloading. Molecular analysis revealed no\r\n      up-regulation of proatrophic genes and proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome\r\n      system. CONCLUSIONS: Structural, ultrastructural, microstructural, metabolic,\r\n      molecular, and clinical functional data indicated that prolonged continuous-flow \r\n      LVAD unloading does not induce hypertrophy regression to the point of atrophy and\r\n      degeneration. These findings may be useful in designing future investigations\r\n      that combine LVAD unloading and pharmaceutical therapies as a bridge to recovery \r\n      of the failing heart.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Diabetes is prevalent\r\n      in advanced heart failure patients. In this study, we sought to investigate the\r\n      effects of mechanical circulatory support on diabetic parameters with LVAD\r\n      implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, data on 244 LVAD \r\n      recipients between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Patients without history of\r\n      diabetes, death within the first 3 months after LVAD implantation, heart\r\n      transplantation after LVAD, or LVAD explantation were excluded from the study.\r\n      Baseline demographic, laboratory, and echocardiographic information prior to LVAD\r\n      placement and 6-month follow-up were obtained. Laboratory values indicative of\r\n      diabetic control were found to improve significantly at 6 months post-LVAD\r\n      implantation (glycated haemoglobin, 7.2 vs. 6.1\%, P < 0.0001; serum fasting\r\n      glucose, 141 vs. 122 mg/dL, P = 0.003; mean daily insulin dose, 30 vs. 24 IU/day,\r\n      P = 0.02). Additionally, the use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was\r\n      successfully discontinued in six patients at 6 months post-LVAD implantation.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term LVAD therapy is associated with improvement in diabetic\r\n      control which is probabvly due to improvements in cardiac output and\r\n      normalization of biochemical derangements resulting from diabetes.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 The Authors.

We aimed to summarize the\r\n      current evidence on outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. \r\n      METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007 \r\n      to December 2013, supplemented with manual review. Three reviewers independently \r\n      assessed each study for saliency on patient-centered outcomes. Data were\r\n      summarized in tabular form. Overall study characteristics encouraged inclusion of\r\n      all indications (destination therapy and bridge to transplant) and prevented\r\n      meta-analysis. The electronic search identified 465 abstracts, of which 50 met\r\n      inclusion criteria; manual review added 2 articles in press. The articles\r\n      included 10 industry-funded trials and registries, 10 multicenter reports, and\r\n      the remainder single-center observational experiences. Estimated actuarial\r\n      survival after continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ranged from 56\% to\r\n      87\% at 1 year, 43\% to 84\% at 2 years, and 47\% at 4 years. Improvements in\r\n      functional class and quality of life were reported, but missing data complicated \r\n      interpretation. Adverse events were experienced by the majority of patients, but \r\n      estimates for bleeding, stroke, infection, right heart failure, arrhythmias, and \r\n      rehospitalizations varied greatly. CONCLUSIONS: The totality of data for\r\n      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices show consistent improvements in\r\n      survival and quality of life counterbalanced by a range of common complications. \r\n      Although this summary should provide a practical resource for healthcare\r\n      provider-led discussions with patients, it highlights the critical need for\r\n      high-quality patient-centered data collected with standard definitions.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.\r\nFAU - McIlvennan, Colleen K\r\nAU  - McIlvennan CK\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.). colleen.mcilvennan@ucdenver.edu.\r\nFAU - Magid, Kate H\r\nAU  - Magid KH\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Ambardekar, Amrut V\r\nAU  - Ambardekar AV\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Thompson, Jocelyn S\r\nAU  - Thompson JS\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Matlock, Daniel D\r\nAU  - Matlock DD\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Allen, Larry A\r\nAU  - Allen LA\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - K23 HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K23AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K23HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\'t\r\nPT  - Review\r\nDEP - 20141007\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Circ Heart Fail\r\nJT  - Circulation.

Although results reported have been excellent, \r\n      older recipients and donors associated with significant comorbidities are now the\r\n      rule rather than the exception. Moreover, heart failure has become a significant \r\n      public health problem with a growing population of patients in countries unable\r\n      to answer the demand for transplantation. An emerging answer to this dilemma\r\n      comes from results reported with the use of continuous flow pumps where patient\r\n      survival approaches 80\% one and 2 years after implantation in selected patients. \r\n      Is it time to triage patients to continuous flow pumps? Should we recommend\r\n      continuous flow pump implantations in patients with various comorbidities, and\r\n      offer transplantation to a selected group of patients who will reach the\r\n      long-term benefit of the procedure?\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

However, expansion of this technology is still limited by\r\n      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential to\r\n      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor \r\n      may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditional\r\n      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may \r\n      also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.\r\n      Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to \r\n      outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base to\r\n      support these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not\r\n      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potential\r\n      predictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely a\r\n      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive\r\n      techniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,\r\n      recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements and\r\n      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting of\r\n      CF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) consider\r\n      potential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTN\r\n      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new\r\n      reliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research and\r\n      management possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the \r\n      CF-LVAD patient population move forward.\r\nFAU - Wasson, Lauren T\r\nAU  - Wasson LT\r\nAD  - NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center, 622 West 168th Street, \r\n      PH12-134, New York, NY, 10032-3720, USA.\r\nFAU - Yuzefpolskaya, Melana\r\nAU  - Yuzefpolskaya M\r\nFAU - Wakabayashi, Michiyori\r\nAU  - Wakabayashi M\r\nFAU - Takayama, Hiroo\r\nAU  - Takayama H\r\nFAU - Naka, Yoshifumi\r\nAU  - Naka Y\r\nFAU - Uriel, Nir\r\nAU  - Uriel N\r\nFAU - Jorde, Ulrich P\r\nAU  - Jorde UP\r\nFAU - Demmer, Ryan T\r\nAU  - Demmer RT\r\nFAU - Colombo, Paolo C\r\nAU  - Colombo PC\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - T32 HL007343/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Heart Fail Rev\r\nJT  - Heart failure reviews\r\nJID - 9612481\r\nSB  - IM\r\nPMC - PMC4385742\r\nMID - NIHMS633555\r\nOID - NLM: NIHMS633555 [Available on 05/01/16]\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4385742 [Available on 05/01/16]\r\nEDAT- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2016/05/01 00:00\r\nAID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2015 May;20(3):317-22. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25283167\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20141006\r\nLR  - 20141007\r\nIS  - 1827-1618 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0026-4725 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2014 Oct 6\r\nTI  - Non-transplant surgical therapy options of heart failure.\r\nAB  - Congestive heart failure (CHF) results from damage to the myocardium and has a\r\n      broad etiology ranging from ischemic to non--ischemic etiology. It is one of the \r\n      leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and carries a 5--year\r\n      mortality of 50\%, estimated by WHO to represent 30\% of deaths in the United\r\n      States. Costs related to the care of patients with CHF have increased\r\n      substantially over the past 2 decades partly owing to increased frequency of\r\n      hospitalization, implantation of costly novel devices and, as the disease\r\n      progresses, consideration for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, and end--of--life care. CHF progression is accompanied by changes within\r\n      the myocardium, collectively referred to as left ventricular remodeling, which\r\n      can be categorized into changes in the cardiomyocytes and changes that occur in\r\n      the volume and composition of the extracellular matrix. Since remodeling in heart\r\n      failure is progressive and detrimental, the majority of treatment strategies are \r\n      aimed at stopping or possibly reversing this process. Some successful methods\r\n      include medical management, long--term or destination mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, cardiac resychronization therapy, and biventricular pacemakers. During\r\n      the last few decades, the management of heart failure has evolved tremendously\r\n      with the introduction of new therapies and assist devices. Advances in mechanical\r\n      support, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and total artificial heart have\r\n      significantly reduced mortality in patients awaiting transplantation.

Despite the clinical importance and significant cost of short-term\r\n      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, the state of their present use has \r\n      not been analyzed on a national scale. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was \r\n      to characterize the demographics, treatment practices, survival rates, and cost\r\n      of short-term MCS. METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed all\r\n      adult patients receiving short-term MCS in the United States from 2004 to 2011 by\r\n      using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization\r\n      Project. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, use of percutaneous devices for short-term\r\n      MCS increased by 1,511\% compared with a 101\% increase in nonpercutaneous devices.\r\n      Mortality rates declined over this period (p for trend = 0.027) from 41.1\% in\r\n      2004 to 2007 to 33.4\% in 2008 to 2011. A similar trend was observed for the\r\n      subset of patients with cardiogenic shock, decreasing from 51.6\% to 43.1\% (p for \r\n      trend = 0.012). Hospital costs also declined over this period (p for trend =\r\n      0.011). Multivariable analysis revealed balloon pumps (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; 95\%\r\n      confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 2.52), coagulopathy (OR: 2.35; 95\% CI: 1.88 to \r\n      2.94), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR: 3.50; 95\% CI: 2.20 to 5.57) before \r\n      short-term MCS were among the most significant predictors of mortality.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-term MCS in the United States has increased rapidly,\r\n      whereas rates of in-hospital mortality have decreased. These changes have taken\r\n      place in the context of declining hospital costs associated with short-term MCS.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

However, stroke (a well-known LVAD complication) and subclinical\r\n      cerebral ischemia may result in transient or permanent cognitive decline. We\r\n      sought to describe the incidence and predictors of cognitive decline after LVAD\r\n      using a valid, sensitive assessment tool. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 4419\r\n      patients in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory\r\n      Support who underwent LVAD implantation between May 2012 and December 2013,\r\n      cognitive function was assessed in 1173 patients with the Trail Making B Test\r\n      before LVAD and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The test detects several forms of\r\n      cognitive impairment, including subclinical stroke. Cognitive decline was defined\r\n      as a clinically important increase during follow-up using a moderate Cohen d\r\n      effect size of 0.5xbaseline SD (32 s). The cumulative incidence of cognitive\r\n      decline in the year after LVAD implantation, treating death and transplantation\r\n      as competing risks, was 29.2\%. In adjusted analysis, older age (>/=70 versus <50 \r\n      years; hazard ratio, 2.24; 95\% confidence interval 1.46-3.44; Ptrend<0.001) and\r\n      destination therapy (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95\% confidence interval, 1.05-1.92) were\r\n      significantly associated with greater risk of cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS:\r\n      Cognitive decline occurs commonly in patients in the year after LVAD and is\r\n      associated with older age and destination therapy. These results could have\r\n      important implications for patient selection and improved communication of risks \r\n      before LVAD implantation. Additional studies are needed to explore the\r\n      association between cognitive decline and subsequent stroke, health status, and\r\n      mortality in patients after LVAD.\r\nCI  - (c) 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.\r\nFAU - Fendler, Timothy J\r\nAU  - Fendler TJ\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.). fendlert@umkc.edu.\r\nFAU - Spertus, John A\r\nAU  - Spertus JA\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Gosch, Kensey L\r\nAU  - Gosch KL\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Jones, Philip G\r\nAU  - Jones PG\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Bruce, Jared M\r\nAU  - Bruce JM\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Nassif, Michael E\r\nAU  - Nassif ME\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Flint, Kelsey M\r\nAU  - Flint KM\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Dunlay, Shannon M\r\nAU  - Dunlay SM\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Allen, Larry A\r\nAU  - Allen LA\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nFAU - Arnold, Suzanne V\r\nAU  - Arnold SV\r\nAD  - From the Mid-America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO (T.J.F., J.A.S., K.L.G.,\r\n      P.G.J., S.V.A.); University of Missouri-Kansas City (T.J.F., J.A.S., J.M.B.,\r\n      S.V.A.); Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (M.E.N.);\r\n      University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora (K.M.F., L.A.A.); and Mayo\r\n      Clinic of Rochester, MN (S.M.D.).\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nGR  - HHSN268201100025C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K23 HL116799/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - T32 HL110837/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150429\r\nTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes\r\nJT  - Circulation.

Donor-recipient matching refers to the avoidance\r\nof size discrepancies that can impair graft function. However,\r\nin the broader sense, donor factors, particularly ones that\r\nmight have an adverse impact on graft function, need to be\r\nviewed in the context of the recipientâ€™s condition. These\r\nfactors include the urgency of transplantation, the presence of\r\ncomorbid disease and the adequacy of physical reserves in the\r\nrecipient, which are important considerations in the context of\r\nthe recipientâ€™s ability to tolerate a post-operative course that\r\nmay be complicated by impaired graft function as the direct\r\nresult of transplantation of a marginal donor heart. The\r\nprojected ischemic time is another important variable in\r\ndecision making regarding the use of a particular donor heart.\r\nThe projected ischemic time is also emblematic of an\r\nimportant axiom in donor selection and matching to a specific\r\nrecipientâ€?and that is that factors that may adversely impact\r\npost-operative graft function should not be considered in\r\nisolation. For example, the use of a heart from a donor who\r\ndied of toxicity (such as carbon monoxide) should be\r\nconsidered together with other important factors that have\r\npotentially compounding adverse effects, such as older donor\r\nage and longer rejected ischemic time. Although the\r\ntechniques of donor heart procurement and implantation are\r\nstandardized, there are factors such as the method of\r\nmyocardial preservation and technique of donor heart\r\nimplantation (biatrial versus bicaval technique) that may\r\ninfluence the post-heart transplant (HT) period. Post-operative\r\ncomplications such as sternal wound infection and pericardial\r\neffusion may cause the patientâ€™s convalescence to be\r\nprolonged.\r\nDonor Heart Selection\r\nBrain death is a hostile environment for the donor heart\r\nthat undoubtedly contributes to the occurrence of primary\r\ngraft failure (PGF) after HT. Donor heart dysfunction results\r\nfrom the â€œcatecholamine stormâ€� (hypertension, tachycardia,\r\nand intense vasoconstriction) that produces an increase in\r\nmyocardial oxygen demand and potentially myocardial\r\nischemia. These phenomena may mediate myofibrillar\r\ndegeneration, a process characterized by injury and death of\r\nmyofibers in a hypercontracted state. After dissipation of this\r\nintense sympathetic activity, there is loss of sympathetic tone\r\nwith a massive reduction in systemic vascular resistance,\r\nwhich may contribute to a second phase of potential\r\nmyocardial injury, precipitated by abnormal myocardial\r\nloading conditions and impaired coronary perfusion.\r\nMyocardial injury interacts with other factors such as older\r\ndonor age and longer ischemic time, increasing the probability\r\nof post-operative primary graft dysfunction.\r\nDonor Age\r\nOlder donor age has been identified as a risk factor for\r\ndeath from any cause1\r\n and from early graft failure.2\r\n and it\r\ncompounds the influence of other risk factors for death from\r\nearly graft failure such as donor left ventricular (LV)\r\ndysfunction, longer ischemic time, and size mismatch (smaller\r\ndonor to a larger recipient). The impact of older donor age is a\r\nreflection of the general decline in myocardial reserves\r\noccurring with advancing age as well as the use of older donor\r\nhearts for marginal recipients. Furthermore, older donor hearts\r\nmay be less able to withstand primary graft dysfunction and\r\nearly acute HT rejection.\r\nEarly in HT the upper donor age limit was 35 years, but\r\nover the ensuing 4 decades it has progressively risen with the\r\nroutine use of donors older than 40 years and frequently â‰¥ 50 \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 2\r\nyears. A safe â€œolder donor ageâ€� has not been established.\r\nStudies usually employ artificial age cutoffs (such as 40 or 50\r\nyears) so that assignment of a 41-year-old donor to the â€œolder\r\ngroupâ€� may not provide accurate information regarding the\r\neffects of older donor age on post-HT outcomes. Furthermore,\r\nthe impact of older donor age cannot be decoupled from\r\nrecipient risk factors that can influence early post-HT survival.\r\nSome studies3, 4 demonstrated inferior 1-month survival in\r\nrecipients receiving hearts from donors older than 40 or 50\r\nyears of age than in those receiving hearts from donors\r\nyounger than 40 years. However, other studies5\r\n showed\r\nsimilar 30-day or discharge mortality in recipients of donor\r\nhearts older than 50 years versus those and in those receiving\r\nyounger donor organs (5\% versus 3.5\%).\r\nRecommendations on Donor Heart Selection2, 3:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Taking into consideration only the variable of â€œdonor\r\nage,â€� the hearts of donors younger than 45 years will\r\ninvariably have sufficient reserves to withstand the rigors\r\nof HT even in settings of prolonged ischemic time,\r\nrecipient comorbidities, and multiple previous recipient\r\noperations with hemodynamically destabilizing bleeding.\r\nHearts from donors between the ages of 45 to 55 years\r\nshould probably be used when the projected ischemic\r\ntime is â‰¤ 4 hours and the potential recipient does not have\r\ncomorbidities or surgical issues where anything less than\r\nrobust donor heart performance could prove fatal. The use\r\nof donor hearts > 55 years should only be used if the\r\nsurvival benefit of HT for a recipient unequivocally\r\nexceeds the decrement in early HT survival due to\r\ntransplantation of a heart with limited myocardial\r\nreserves.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nTransplantation of Hearts from Donors with Infection\r\nThe reluctance to use hearts from donors contaminated\r\nwith microorganisms, who have died of sepsis or central\r\nnervous system infection, is based on: (1) the potential\r\ntransmission of microorganisms to the recipient resulting in\r\neither infection of anastomotic suture lines or systemic\r\ninfection, (2) potential transmission of mediators of endotoxic\r\nshock from donor to recipient, and (3) contribution of donor\r\nsepsis to myocardial dysfunction.6-8 Serious complications due\r\nto the transmission of donor infection to a recipient have\r\nincluded arterial anastomotic rupture in a renal transplant\r\npatient (Staphylococcus aureus9\r\n and Bacteroides species,10\r\nEscherichia coli10) and recipient entero-abdominal fungal\r\ninfection after a pancreatic transplant (Candida albicans11).\r\nNevertheless, hearts from donors with severe sepsis and death\r\ndue to severe infection (meningitis, pneumonia, or septic\r\nshock) without transmission to recipients6, 12, 13 as well as the\r\nuse of hearts with bacterial and fungal contamination.14-16 have\r\nbeen used. Overall the risk of donor to recipient transmission\r\nappears to be very low.\r\nRecommendation on the Transplantation of Hearts\r\nfrom Donors with Infection6\r\n:\r\nClass IIa\r\n1. Hearts from donors with severe infection can be used\r\nprovided that: 1) the donor infection is community\r\nacquired and donor death occurs rapidly (within 96\r\nhours); 2) repeat blood cultures before organ procurement\r\nare negative; 3) pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy is\r\nadministered to the donor; 4) donor myocardial function\r\nis normal; and 5) there is no evidence of endocarditis by\r\ndirect inspection of the donor heart. If such hearts are\r\nused for transplantation, the recipient should undergo\r\nsurveillance blood cultures on the first post-operative day\r\nand pathogen-specific antibiotic therapy should be\r\nadministered for an appropriate duration of time.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nTransplantation of Hearts from Donors with Potential\r\nDrug Toxicities\r\nCocaine. Toxic effects on the heart include\r\nvasoconstriction, coronary endothelial dysfunction, and\r\nmyocardial toxicity. These effects occur through a powerful Î±-\r\n1 adrenergic effect, indirectly through release of\r\nnorepinephrine by the sympathetic nervous system, an induced\r\ndeficiency of endothelium-derived relaxation factor with the\r\npotential for intravascular thrombosis, and depression of\r\nmyocardial contractility.17-21 The most frequently observed\r\ncardiac abnormalities after repeated cocaine abuse are\r\nventricular hypertrophy and a cardiomyopathy. Since\r\nintravenous (IV) cocaine as compared to non-IV cocaine\r\nabuse is considered more toxic to the heart, the use of hearts\r\nfrom IV cocaine abusers is discouraged. Use of hearts from\r\ndonors with a history of non-IV cocaine abuse appears to be\r\nsafe in terms of early post-operative course. Data from the\r\nUnited Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) suggest that 1-\r\nyear HT mortality is similar for recipients of hearts from nonusers\r\nversus past users (> 6 months) or current users of\r\ncocaine.22-29\r\nAlcohol abuse. Direct toxic effects of ethanol on the heart\r\ninclude alterations in energy stores reducing the effectiveness\r\nof calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum,23, 24 and\r\nsodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity,\r\nand interference with calcium-troponin binding, all of which \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 3\r\nattenuate myosin-actin interaction. Transplantation of a heart\r\nfrom a donor with a history of alcohol abuse may unmask\r\nbiochemical abnormalities that may manifest as early graft\r\nfailure.25, 26 Survival (including early patient survival and graft\r\nfunction) has been shown to be inferior27, 28 in recipients of\r\nhearts from donors with a history of alcohol abuse. However,\r\none report suggests that alcohol use in donors may be\r\nprotective after HT with improved outcomes for hearts from\r\nalcoholic versus non-alcoholic donors.29\r\nCarbon monoxide poisoning. As a result of the much\r\ngreater affinity of carbon monoxide versus oxygen for\r\nhemoglobin, a leftward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin\r\ndissociation curve occurs with reduced oxygen delivery to the\r\ntissues and impairment of mitochondrial cellular respiration\r\ndue to competition of carbon monoxide with oxygen for\r\ncytochrome a3.\r\n30 The myocardium is particularly susceptible\r\nto oxygen deprivation and the resulting myocardial injury may\r\nmanifest as PGF in the immediate post-operative period.\r\nReports on the outcomes of hearts from donors with carbon\r\nmonoxide intoxication have yielded conflicting results 31, 32\r\nOther poisonings. There are reports of transplantation of\r\nhearts from donors with a variety of other types of poisonings\r\nincluding cyanide,33-35 methanol, and ecstasy36 with\r\nsatisfactory HT function. The hearts from donors with these\r\ntypes of poisonings may be considered for HT provided there\r\nis good cardiac function.\r\nRecommendation on the Transplantation of Hearts\r\nfrom Donors with Potential Drug Toxicities22, 29, 35, 37,\r\n38:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Hearts from donors with a history of past or current nonIV\r\ncocaine abuse can be used for transplantation provided\r\ncardiac function is normal and left ventricular\r\nhypertrophy (LVH) is absent.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. In light of current information, the use of hearts from\r\ndonors with a history of â€œalcohol abuseâ€� remains\r\nuncertain, but is should probably be considered unwise.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n3. The use of hearts from donors who have died of carbon\r\nmonoxide intoxication can be recommended with caution,\r\nalthough safety has not been completely established. It is\r\nrecommended that these hearts be used provided there is a\r\nnormal donor electrocardiogram (ECG) and\r\nechocardiogram, minimal elevation of cardiac markers,\r\nminimal inotropic requirements, a relatively short\r\nischemic time, a favorable donor to recipient weight ratio,\r\nand a recipient with normal pulmonary vascular\r\nresistance.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nUse of Donors with Pre-existing Cardiac\r\nAbnormalities\r\nCoronary artery disease. The concern regarding\r\ntransplantation of donor hearts with recognized or\r\nunrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) revolves around\r\nthe risk of acute graft failure and the subsequent development\r\nof coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV). There is a paucity\r\nof information in the literature to provide guidance as to how\r\nmuch CAD in a donor heart can be accepted without\r\nincreasing the risk of early graft failure.39-41 One report42\r\nsuggests that if donor hearts with more than single-vessel\r\nCAD are used, the risk of early graft failure is substantial\r\n(6.3\% in donors without CAD, 7.5\% in donors with singlevessel\r\nCAD, 42.3\% in donor hearts with double- and triplevessel\r\nCAD).\r\nDonor left ventricular hypertrophy. The reluctance to use\r\ndonor hearts with LVH is based on the increased risk of early\r\ngraft failure and the long-term effects of diastolic heart failure\r\nand suboptimal long-term survival. The probability that LVH\r\nwill produce early graft failure is is influenced by other\r\nconfounding factors43 such as history of hypertension,\r\nischemia time, severity of LVH, donor size, and whether or\r\nnot LVH is evident on ECG. One small study44 raised\r\nconcerns that any degree of donor heart LVHy may result in\r\nearly graft failure. A more recent study, however,45 46 found\r\nthat mild and even moderate LVH did not increase 30-day\r\nmortality. Early mortality was increased only45 if donor wall\r\nthickness was > 14 mm.\r\nDonor valvular heart disease. The finding of a bicuspid\r\naortic valve does not contraindicate the use of a donor heart.\r\nIn the case valvular disease associated with hemodynamic\r\nabnormalities, the donor heart may still be used for HT. Bench\r\nrepair or replacement of a donor aortic valve,38 47 and repair of\r\nan incompetent mitral valve48 has been performed with\r\nfavorable outcomes.\r\nRecommendations on the Use of Donors with Preexisting\r\nCardiac Abnormalities39, 49:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As far as function is concerned, a donor heart should not\r\nbe used in the presence of intractable ventricular\r\narrhythmias, the need for excessive inotropic support\r\n(dopamine at a dose of 20 Âµg/kg/min or similar doses of\r\nother adrenergic agents despite aggressive optimization of\r\npreload and after load), discreet wall motion \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 4\r\nabnormalities on echocardiography, or left ventricular\r\nejection fraction (LVEF) < 40\% despite optimization of\r\nhemodynamics with inotropic support.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\n2. A donor heart with a normally functioning bicuspid aortic\r\nvalve can be used for HT. Anatomically and\r\nhemodynamically abnormal aortic and mitral valves may\r\nundergo bench repair or replacement with subsequent\r\ntransplantation of the heart.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. The use of donor hearts with obstructive disease in any\r\nmajor coronary artery should be avoided unless the heart\r\nis being considered for the alternate list recipients with\r\nconcomitant coronary bypass surgery.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. It would seem appropriate to use hearts from donors with\r\nLVH provided that it is not associated with ECG findings\r\nof LVH and LV wall thickness is < 14 mm.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nDonor Cardiac Function\r\nDonor risk factors known to be associated with early graft\r\nfailure include higher doses of inotropic support, depressed\r\nsystolic function (particularly discreet wall motion\r\nabnormalities), older donor age, and donor-recipient size\r\nmismatch (small female donors to large male recipients).49 In\r\none study,49 the requirement for dopamine or dobutamine\r\ndoses > 20 Âµg/kg/min with or without additional inotropic\r\nagents was an independent risk factor for PGF and early\r\nmortality. However, because high dose inotropic support is\r\noften required to overcome the hemodynamic consequences of\r\na low systemic vascular resistance, optimization of preload\r\nand afterload should be achieved before declaring that high\r\ndose inotropic agents is a contraindication to the use of a\r\ndonor heart. Elevated cardiac markers such as CPK-MB\r\nisoenzyme and troponin should not preclude the use of a donor\r\nheart. If substantial myocardial injury is associated with the\r\nrelease of cardiac markers, this will usually be manifested by\r\nthe echocardiographic finding of either global or discreet wall\r\nmotion abnormalities.\r\nRecommendations on Donor Cardiac Function:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As far as the function is concerned, a donor heart should\r\nnot be used in the presence of intractable ventricular\r\narrhythmias, the need for excessive inotropic support\r\n(dopamine at a dose of 20 Âµg/kg/min or similar doses of\r\nother adrenergic agents despite aggressive optimization of\r\npreload and after load), discreet wall motion\r\nabnormalities on echocardiography or LVEF < 40\%\r\ndespite optimization of hemodynamics with inotropic\r\nsupport.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nDonor-Recipient Size Matching\r\nOversizing of a donor heart can occur (1) in pediatric HT\r\nwhen the size of the donor heart for a smaller recipient is\r\nmisjudged; (2) when the native heart disease does not result in\r\ncardiomegaly and a larger donor heart is implanted; or (3)\r\nafter multiple previous operations resulting in rigidity of the\r\nmediastinum despite maneuvers such as opening the left side\r\nof the pericardium to allow the donor heart to protrude into the\r\nleft pleural space. These situations may be associated with\r\ninability to close the chest without hemodynamically\r\nimportant cardiac compression. Severe undersizing is also an\r\nimportant issue, since a small donor heart may be unable to\r\nsupport the circulation of a much larger recipient. Making the\r\ndetermination of the adequacy of the size of a donor for a\r\nspecific recipient and judgment is required. Determination of\r\ndonor/recipient size match is complicated by the poor\r\nrelationship between echocardiographic adult heart size and\r\nbody weight.50 As a general rule, the donor weight should be\r\nwithin 30\% of the recipient weight for adults. However, in\r\nnon-urgent recipients survival was not adversely affected by\r\nundersizing of donor hearts up to a donor to recipient body\r\nweight ratio of 0.8.51, 52 In contrast, survival was inferior in\r\nUNOS status 1 recipients, if they received an undersized heart\r\npresumably due to a smaller cardiac reserve. 49 According to a\r\nmultivariable analysis, implantation of a smaller female donor\r\nheart into a larger male recipient was an independent risk\r\nfactor for early graft failure. Furthermore, the risks of\r\nundersizing a donor heart are compounded by the presence of\r\nother donor risk factors contributing to early graft failure, such\r\nas older donor age, abnormal systolic function of the donor\r\nheart and prolonged ischemic time.\r\nRecommendations on Donor-Recipient Size\r\nMatching51, 52:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As a general rule the use of hearts from donors whose\r\nbody weight is no greater than 30\% below that of the\r\nrecipient is uniformly safe. Furthermore, a male donor of\r\naverage weight (70 kg) can be safely used for any size\r\nrecipient irrespective of weight. Use of a female donor\r\nwhose weight is more than 20\% lower than that of a male\r\nrecipient should be viewed with caution.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 5\r\nProjected Ischemic Time\r\nProlongation of the ischemic time in HT adversely\r\nimpacts the performance of the donor heart in the immediate\r\npost-operative period. Furthermore, the ischemic time\r\ninteracts with a number of other variables including older\r\ndonor age, increased inotropic requirements of the donor, and\r\nabnormal donor cardiac function to further increase the\r\nprobability of primary graft dysfunction. The upper limit for\r\nischemic time is unknown and it depends on the relative\r\nweight of other risk factors. For example, a heart of a young\r\ndonor with robust performance without inotropic requirements\r\nis likely to tolerate an ischemic time longer than 6 hours with\r\ngood post-operative graft function, whereas a donor heart with\r\nimpaired function on substantial inotropic support from an\r\nolder donor is unlikely to tolerate longer ischemic times.\r\nRecommendations on Ischemic Times49:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As a general rule the ischemic time should be less than 4\r\nhours. However, there are situations in which ischemic\r\ntimes longer than 4 hours are anticipated. Donor hearts\r\nwith ischemic times longer than 4 hours should only be\r\naccepted when other factors interacting with ischemic\r\ntime are ideal, including donor young age, normal cardiac\r\nfunction and absence of inotropic support.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nDonor Heart Procurement\r\nThe procedure of donor heart procurement is as critical\r\nfor the success of HT as implantation, because errors in\r\nassessment, selection, and surgical technique may have\r\nprofound repercussions in the immediate post-transplant\r\nperiod. The procuring surgeon must verify that the function of\r\nthe heart is visually satisfactory, that areas of akinesis are\r\nabsent on the echocardiogram, and that the size match for the\r\nintended recipient is appropriate. The heart should be carefully\r\ninspected for palpable CAD and evidence of myocardial\r\ncontusion so that if these problems are found a decision can be\r\nmade about the suitability of the donor heart for the intended\r\nrecipient. Post-operative right ventricular (RV) failure can\r\nresult in RV distention during the procurement procedure and\r\nsignificantly complicate recipient management. This can occur\r\nbecause of overly vigorous fluid infusion in response to blood\r\nand fluid loss during abdominal organ procurement. After\r\nexcision, it is important that the heart be thoroughly inspected,\r\nalthough most abnormalities (such as a patent foramen ovale,\r\nbicuspid aortic valve) do not significantly alter the immediate\r\npost-operative period. Atresia of the coronary sinus ostium\r\nwith retrograde drainage through a persistent left superior\r\nvena cava may go unnoticed until inspection or implantation\r\nof the donor heart. Unfortunately, ligation of the left superior\r\nvena cava in the presence of this anomaly is highly likely to\r\nresult in irreversible PGF. The procuring surgeon can simply\r\nlook into the right atrium to verify the presence of a coronary\r\nsinus ostium.53-55\r\nThe adequacy of myocardial preservation, the\r\nbiochemical derangements that can be induced during the\r\nischemic period, and unpredictable myocardial reperfusion\r\ninjury may have profound effects on the immediate postoperative\r\ncourse. It is the complex bioenergetic processes and\r\ntheir derangement which will frequently underpin PGF. The\r\nprimary methods of maintaining cellular and functional\r\nintegrity of the myocardium during the ischemic period are\r\nthrough hypothermia and mechanical arrest of the heart.\r\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) is consumed at a low level to\r\nallow breaking of actin-myosin cross bridges even during\r\nmechanical cardiac arrest. Although during the ischemic\r\nperiod the myocardium can use stored glycogen to produce\r\nATP by anaerobic glycolysis, irreversible myofiber\r\ncontracture will occur if the ATP level falls below a critical\r\nthreshold, Preservation must also maintain ion homeostasis.\r\nAlthough sodium-potassium ATPase activity is markedly\r\nreduced by hypothermia, there is still passive ion movement\r\ndown a concentration gradient. Consequently, intracellular\r\nhydrogen ions are exchanged for extracellular sodium ions,\r\nwhich in turn are exchanged for calcium ions. Accumulation\r\nof calcium ions in the sarcolemma is potentially very\r\ndamaging to myofibers upon reperfusion. Reperfusion injury\r\nhas several components:\r\n(1) Free radical injuryâ€?these oxygen-derived free radicals\r\ncause direct myocardial injury. They are generated under\r\nnormal aerobic conditions but are rapidly neutralized by\r\nintracellular enzymatic scavengers. However, under\r\nconditions of ischemia and reperfusion, they may\r\naccumulate in quantities that overwhelm the natural\r\nscavengers, setting the stage for free radical injury.\r\n(2) Complement activationâ€?activation of the complement\r\ncascade results in the production of potent anaphylatoxins\r\nthat mediate increased vascular permeability, leukocyte\r\nchemotaxis, adhesion and activation, and vascular smooth\r\nmuscle contraction.\r\n(3) Neutrophil activationâ€?neutrophil activation during\r\nreperfusion involves accumulation of these cells on\r\nendothelial surfaces and promoting the release of\r\ninflammatory molecules.\r\n(4) Endothelial injuryâ€?â€œendothelial cell activationâ€� is a term\r\nused to describe the response of endothelial cells to \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 6\r\nischemia. It involves promotion of leukocyte adhesion,\r\nsmooth muscle proliferation and vasoconstriction.\r\n(5) Cytokine releaseâ€?a number of molecules are released\r\nthat amplify inflammatory responses.\r\n(6) Calcium overloadâ€?as indicated earlier, calcium ions can\r\naccumulate in the sarcoplasmic reticulum damaging\r\nmyocytes on reperfusion.\r\nThe role of myocardial preservation solutions in HT is to\r\npreserve the microvascular, cellular, and functional integrity\r\nof the heart. The ingredients of the flush solution include (1)\r\nhypothermia, (2) potassium to arrest the heart, (3) prevention\r\nof cellular swelling with impermeants such as lactobionate and\r\nraffinose, (4) magnesium to prevent calcium accumulation in\r\nthe sarcoplasmic reticulum, and (5) free radical scavengers to\r\nprevent free radical injury. Experimental56 and clinical57 use of\r\nthe UW solution, which is an intracellular (high potassium)\r\nsolution that includes the above ingredients, have provided\r\nsufficient evidance to support the expectation of excellent\r\nmyocardial preservation for at least 6 hours of ischemic time.\r\nDonor Heart Implantation\r\nImplantation of the donor heart is a technically\r\nstraightforward procedure. The standard biatrial technique is\r\nincreasingly being replaced by the bicaval technique. The\r\nlatter may be associated with a lower incidence of sinoatrial\r\nnode dysfunction in the early post-operative period and\r\nreduced requirement for permanent pacing at 30 and 90 days\r\nafter HT.58\r\nOne technical point that requires emphasis is the\r\nimportance of accurately cutting the correct length of the\r\npulmonary artery because excessive length can result in\r\npulmonary artery kinking and obstruction and, if\r\nunrecognized, this can result in severe RV failure.59 The\r\nconditions of reperfusion of the donor heart are important with\r\nregard to the pressure. Ideally, the heart should be reperfused\r\nat a perfusion pressure of 50 to 70 mm Hg. Very occasionally,\r\nthe perfusion pressure can be excessively low (< 50 mm Hg)\r\ndespite the infusion of vasoactive agents. Under those\r\ncircumstances, the heart may not develop prompt return of\r\ncoordinated contraction. If this occurs, controlled aortic root\r\nreperfusion60 may be used. This involves reapplying the aortic\r\ncrossclamp and infusing pump blood into the aortic root\r\nthrough the needle vent to produce a pressure of 70 to 80 mm\r\nHg until satisfactory cardiac function develops, at which time\r\nthe crossclamp can be removed.\r\nPost-operative Surgical Problems\r\nSurgical wound infection. Infection is an important cause\r\nof mortality and morbidity after HT. Bacterial infection\r\npredominates in the early post-transplant period with a peak\r\nincidence in the first post-operative week.61 Although the\r\nincidence of sternal wound infection and mediastinitis after\r\nHT is low ,it can be the cause of serious morbidity and\r\nmortality. The cornerstone of prevention of bacterial infection\r\nand contamination of the surgical wound is application of\r\nstrict surgical aseptic techniques. All indwelling lines and\r\ndevices should receive similar aseptic care. Protective\r\nisolation has not been proven beneficial in reducing the\r\nincidence of infection in HT recipients.62, 63 Peri-operative\r\nprophylactic antibiotics should be administered. An example\r\nof a commonly used protocol is a pre-operative IV dose of\r\nvancomycin 15 mg/kg and ceftazidime 15 mg/kg both\r\nadministered 1 hour before HT to ensure effective circulating\r\nlevels before the skin incision. Vancomycin is readministered\r\nat the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at a dose\r\nof 10 mg/kg. Post-operatively, vancomycin (10 mg/kg IV\r\nevery 8 hours with adjustment for renal function) and\r\nceftazidime 1 gm IV every 8 hours are administered for 4\r\ndays. At the conclusion of the operation, the surgical wound\r\nmay be irrigated with dilute vancomycin solution to decrease\r\ncolony counts of gram-positive skin organisms. The surgical\r\ndressing is left in place for 48 hours, and after its removal, the\r\nwound is painted with an iodine containing solution once or\r\ntwice daily for several days until the wound is sealed.\r\nRe-entry for bleeding may be required after HT. In most\r\npatients undergoing HT, the operation is performed in the\r\nsetting of one or more risk factors for bleeding including\r\ncoagulopathy associated with multiple previous operations,\r\nuse of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), poor tissues due\r\nto the ravages of heart failure, and abnormal coagulation due\r\nto hepatic congestion. Re-entry should be undertaken for\r\npersistent chest tube output (as a general rule 400 mL/hr for 1\r\nhour, > 300 mL/hr for 3 hours, and 200 mL/hr for 4 hours),\r\nany circulatory instability associated with bleeding, or\r\nradiographic or echocardiographic evidence of retained\r\nthrombus.\r\nFrequently, patients undergoing HT have a large\r\npericardial space in which a much smaller donor heart is\r\nimplanted, setting the stage for the accumulation of frequently\r\nlarge pericardial effusions. This has been described64 in up to\r\n30\% of patients. If a pericardial effusion is anticipated given a\r\nlarge pericardial space and a much smaller heart, a soft drain\r\nsuch as a Blake drain can be left in the posterior pericardial\r\nspace connected to a drainage bulb and can be left for 5 to 6\r\ndays (the standard chest tubes are removed at the usual time)\r\nto prevent, as much as possible, collection of fluid in the\r\npericardium. The Blake drain is removed when the drainage is\r\n< 40 mL/24 hours. If a large pericardial effusion occurs, even \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 7\r\nin the absence of echocardiographic evidence of tamponade,\r\ndrainage by a subxiphoid approach is recommended.\r\nTopic 2: Early Post-operative Care of the\r\nHeart Transplant Recipient\r\nIntroduction\r\nEarly post-operative management of the newly\r\ntransplanted heart allograft is focused on maintenance of\r\nhemodynamic stability as the allograft restores normal cardiac\r\nfunction to the chronic heart failure patient. While the graft\r\nbegins to support the recipient as soon as separation from CPB\r\nis complete, there is invariably a period of time during which\r\nthe allograft and its recipient require active hemodynamic\r\nmanagement and support. The nature and duration of this\r\nsupport is determined by several factors including the quality\r\nand preservation of the donor heart and pre-operative\r\ncondition of the recipient. Recipient factors such as vasomotor\r\ntone, severity and reversibility of pulmonary vascular\r\nhypertension, pulmonary function, degree of pre-operative\r\nfluid overload, renal function, destabilizing post-operative\r\nbleeding, and immunologic compatibility may have a\r\nprofound effect upon early post-operative management.\r\nAdditional factors such as HT surgical technique (biatrial vs.\r\nbicaval vs. orthotopic vs. heterotopic) and donor/recipient size\r\nmatching affect post-operative management strategies.\r\nPeri-operative and Post-operative Monitoring\r\nHemodynamic Monitoring\r\nAdequate hemodynamic monitoring of the HT recipient at\r\na minimum includes direct measurement of the arterial\r\npressure, central venous pressure (CVP) or right atrial pressure\r\n(RAP), and cardiac output (CO). Typically, adult patients are\r\nmonitored with an indwelling arterial catheter (femoral, radial,\r\nor both), and a thermodilution or oximetric pulmonary artery\r\ncatheter. Less commonly used are surgically placed,\r\npercutaneous right and left atrial catheters, or noninvasive\r\nmeans of assessing CO. One such method utilizes lithium\r\nchloride as indicator for peripheral thermodilution technique.65\r\nRegardless of the type of catheter used for continuous\r\nhemodynamic monitoring after HT, it is wise to remove the\r\ncatheter as soon as possible to minimize the risk of catheterrelated\r\ninfections, including sepsis, allograft valvular\r\nendocarditis, or bacterial seeding of the atrial suture lines,\r\ncomplications which are often fatal.66, 67\r\nArterial monitoring is similar in pediatric patients, but\r\nCVP monitoring is generally with a line ending in the superior\r\nvena cava or an atrial catheter. Pulmonary artery catheters are\r\nused infrequently in the pediatric population.\r\nEchocardiographic Monitoring\r\nIntra-operative echocardiography has become a standard\r\nprocedure during most cardiac surgery, including HT.68\r\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide\r\nimaging assistance to identify intracardiac thrombi. In\r\naddition, TEE provides real-time assessment of the cardiac\r\nallograft during de-airing, separation from CPB, and after\r\nimplantation of the donor heart as the chest is closed.\r\nVentricular function, valve function, and surgical anastomoses\r\ncan be assessed. In the post-operative period, both\r\ntransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and TEE may be used to\r\nassess heart allograft function, particularly in the setting of\r\nacute hemodynamic instability arising from allograft\r\ndysfunction due to rejection, RV failure, or tamponade.69-71\r\nWhen adequate transthoracic imaging is limited by poor\r\nacoustic windows, TEE often overcomes this obstacle. TTE is\r\ngenerally adequate in the pediatric population in the postoperative\r\nperiod. It is reasonable to perform a TTE in the first\r\nweek after HT. The timing and frequency of additional\r\nechocardiograms depends upon heart allograft function and\r\nthe presence of a pericardial effusion.\r\nElectrocardiographic Monitoring\r\nContinuous ECG monitoring is universal. Twelve-lead\r\nrecordings are obtained immediately post-operatively and as\r\nneeded to assess the cardiac rhythm, conduction system, and\r\nischemic changes. Several ECG abnormalities are frequently\r\npresent following HT. The most frequent abnormalities\r\ninclude sinus node dysfunction and complete or incomplete\r\nright bundle branch block. Progressive worsening of the\r\nconduction system in the early period after HT is a poor\r\nprognostic sign.72, 73\r\nContinuous Oxygen Saturation Monitoring\r\nContinuous pulse oximetry is indicated in the immediate\r\npost-operative period to insure adequate oxygenation at all\r\ntimes, particularly because the critically ill early postoperative\r\npatient is at risk for sudden changes in pulmonary\r\nstatus.\r\nRenal Function\r\nAn indwelling urinary catheter is used to monitor renal\r\nfunction and urine output.\r\nAdequacy of urine output depends upon several factors\r\nincluding fluid status, heart allograft function, intrinsic renal\r\nfunction, recent hemodynamic status, and the presence of\r\nnephrotoxic and vasoconstrictive medications such as\r\ncalcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and vasopressors. Urine output\r\ntypically is â‰¥ 30 mL/hour. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 8\r\nIn the pediatric population, adequate urine output is age\r\nand size dependent. Oliguria or anuria are particularly\r\nconcerning as they are suggestive of significant acute renal\r\nfailure.\r\nOften, higher doses of IV loop diuretics are required after\r\nHT due to pre-existing diuretic resistance. Oliguria refractory\r\nto diuretics is problematic in the immediate post-operative\r\nsetting because fluid overload and RV dysfunction can\r\ndevelop over a few hours unless ultrafiltration and renal\r\nreplacement therapies such as continuous veno-venous\r\nhemofiltration or dialysis are employed.\r\nRecommendations on the Post-operative Monitoring\r\nof Heart Transplant Recipients7, 72-89:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Peri-operative monitoring of heart transplant recipients\r\nshould include (1) continuous ECG monitoring; (2) postoperative\r\n12-lead ECG; (3) invasive arterial pressure\r\nmonitoring; (4) direct measurement of RAP or CVP; (5)\r\nmeasurement of left atrial or pulmonary artery wedge\r\npressure (PAWP); (6) intermittent measurement of CO;\r\n(7) continuous measurement of arterial oxygen saturation;\r\n(8) intra-operative TEE; (9) continuous assessment of\r\nurinary output.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nHemodynamic Management\r\nBackground\r\nThe newly transplanted heart allograft typically displays\r\nexcellent LV systolic function. Systolic LV dysfunction is\r\nparticularly worrisome as it may suggest poor donor heart\r\nquality, inadequate preservation, or early rejection\r\n(hyperacute, antibody mediated rejection). The frequency and\r\nseverity of RV dysfunction after HT is variable and may be\r\nanticipated in patients with risk factors such as elevated\r\npulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), excessive bleeding,\r\npulmonary edema, poor donor heart preservation before\r\nimplant, poor RV protection during allograft implantation,\r\nischemia from air embolization into the right coronary artery,\r\nor significant donor/recipient size mismatch.74\r\nEven heart allografts that display excellent early function\r\ntypically experience a functional decline over the first 12 postoperative\r\nhours. This decrease in function is believed to be\r\ndue to the effects of ischemia and reperfusion and myocardial\r\nedema, which result in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.\r\nDonor heart LVH (wall thickness â‰¥ 1.4 cm) and or prolonged\r\nischemia times (> 240 min) may also lead to impaired\r\ndiastolic function in the early post-operative period. With\r\nintra-operative TEE, it is not uncommon to observe an\r\nincrease in LV wall thickness and mass.75, 76, 90-92 Furthermore,\r\nin the early post-operative period after HT, examination of the\r\nmitral inflow pattern by Doppler echocardiography often\r\nreveals a restrictive cardiac filling pattern.77\r\nDiastolic stiffness leads to an increase in intracardiac\r\nfilling pressures and reduced stroke volume, whereas systolic\r\ndysfunction leads to a transient decline in CO. These early\r\nrestrictive hemodynamic findings are often transient but may\r\npersist for 6 to 8 weeks after HT.78, 93 In the setting of an\r\nexcellent hemodynamic status, these changes are of little or no\r\nconsequence. However, if the initial CO is marginal, or if the\r\nheart allograft function is obviously impaired, despite\r\ninotropic support, this further, predictable decline in function\r\nmay necessitate additional hemodynamic support, including\r\nadditional vasoactive drugs, an intraaortic balloon pump\r\n(IABP) or a left and/or right ventricular assist device (VAD).\r\nassist support devices\r\nWhen deciding the minimum heart allograft function\r\nacceptable before leaving the operating room, considerations\r\nshould include, in addition to the cardiac index (CI), the dose\r\nand number of inotropic agents employed to enable separation\r\nfrom CPB, the independent function of the RV and LV, and\r\nthe recipient risks for right heart failure.\r\nHeart rate is variable and ranges from bradycardia to\r\ntachycardia. Factors such as parasympathetic denervation,\r\nsurgical trauma, catecholamine administration, and even\r\ngenomic variations in the Î²-adrenergic receptor may affect the\r\nsinus node rate.94 Although sinus rhythm is typically observed,\r\nsinus node dysfunction may arise from injury related to donor\r\ncardiectomy or preservation. In this instance, the cardiac\r\nrhythm is usually either junctional or accelerated junctional.\r\nThe incidence of sinus node dysfunction is reduced with the\r\nbicaval or total orthotopic HT technique, as compared to the\r\nclassic biatrial technique developed by Lower and Shumway.79\r\nSinus node dysfunction is usually transient but may persist for\r\nseveral weeks after HT. Sinus node dysfunction requiring a\r\npacemaker occurs in about 5\% of patients undergoing biatrial\r\nanastomoses. Pre-operative use of amiodarone in heart\r\ntransplant recipients may increase the risk of sinus node\r\ndysfunction and bradyarrythmias in the early post-operative\r\nperiod. This may require the use of isoproterenol,\r\ntheophylline, or more prolonged temporary atrial pacing. The\r\nneed for permanent pacing may increase with donor age.80\r\nHeart rate is generally maintained in the 90 to 110 bpm range\r\nafter HT using atrial or atrioventricular (AV) pacing or\r\nchronotropic drugs. This rate contributes to maintaining an\r\nadequate CO and permits adequate cardiac filling in the setting\r\nof decreased stroke volume and diastolic dysfunction\r\nimmediately after heart transplantation. In the setting of \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 9\r\nsignificant donor under sizing with respect to the recipient\r\n(donor weight > 30\% below recipient weight), a higher heart\r\nrate may be necessary to account for even lower stroke\r\nvolume indices.52, 81, 95\r\nIn the pediatric population the heart rate adequate to\r\nmaintain an acceptable CO also varies according to both donor\r\nand recipient age.\r\nReduced myocardial contractility is frequently seen after\r\nHT as a result of donor organ trauma, preservation and\r\nischemia, catecholamine depletion, and donor brain death. In\r\naddition, myofibrillar degeneration can result from the\r\nsympathetic storm accompaning brain herniation. Infusion of\r\none or more inotropes in the early post-operative period\r\nusually provides the hemodynamic support needed in the first\r\nfew post-operative days as the heart allograft recovers. These\r\nagents are usually weaned over the first post-operative week.\r\nPrimary Graft Failure and Right Ventricular Dysfunction\r\nPrimary graft failure after HT is the presence of severe\r\nmechanical dysfunction without obvious anatomic (surgical)\r\nor immunologic causes such as hyperacute rejection. Primary\r\ngraft failure has been variably defined in the literature as heart\r\nallograft dysfunction requiring 2 or more inotropes, or the\r\nneed for mechanical circulatory support, either with an IABP\r\nor a VAD within 24 hours of HT. The true prevalence,\r\ntherefore, depends upon the criteria used for diagnosis, but\r\nestimates range from approximately 1.4\% to 30.7\%.82, 83, 96-100\r\nIt is important to recognize that PGF can result in RV, LV, or\r\nbiventricular failure.\r\nIsolated RV failure is more common than biventricular\r\nfailure. Cardinal features include an elevated RAP > 20 mm\r\nHg, left atrial pressure < 10 mm Hg, with decreasing CO and\r\nhigh pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, and a falling mean\r\narterial pressure, or normal PA pressures with falling CO.101,\r\n102\r\nHeart allograft failure accounts for 40\% of the mortality\r\nwithin the first 30 days after HT and 18\% of the mortality for\r\nthe second through the twelfth months.98 Thirty-day survival\r\nwith PGF has increased over time from 43\% during the period\r\nfrom 1992 to 1997 to 57\% during the period from 1998 to\r\n2004.98 In addition to the increased risk of mortality during the\r\nfirst month, PGF also confers a worse conditional 1-year\r\nsurvival.81\r\nThe pathophysiology that underlies PGF is generally\r\nmultifactorial. It includes recipient characteristics such as\r\npulmonary arterial hypertension and increased PVR, and prior\r\nMCS, donor characteristics and factors such as prolonged\r\ndonor ischemia time, poor organ preservation, and\r\ndevelopment of reactive oxygen species.82, 84, 97-99, 103\r\nPossible explanations for the association between preoperative\r\nMCS and PGF are that pretransplant VADs may be\r\na surrogate of prolonged ischemia due to longer explantation\r\nof the native heart or that the longer CPB times associated\r\nwith presence of a VAD may trigger a greater inflammatory\r\nresponse which may increase the risk of PGF.103\r\nEarly heart allograft dysfunction has also been associated\r\nwith the use of organs from female donors into male\r\nrecipients; however, in recent times the results of some studies\r\nhave shown that increased body surface area in the recipient or\r\nsmaller donor for a larger recipient have not been associated\r\nwith worse outcomes.85, 98 There have been concerns that the\r\nuse of â€œmarginalâ€� or â€œextendedâ€� donors may lead to an\r\nincreased incidence of PGF. There are a number of criteria to\r\ndefine the â€œextendedâ€� heart donor. These can be grouped into\r\nnon-cardiac and cardiac factors. Non-cardiac factors include\r\nadvanced donor age, donor size, and ischemic time. In\r\naddition, other comorbidities of the donor, such as positive\r\nviral serologies, diabetes mellitus, or substance abuse would\r\nbe considered as non-cardiac risks for suboptimal donor organ\r\nquality. The cardiac criteria for â€œextendedâ€� donors include\r\nLVH, congenital heart abnormalities, high donor\r\ncatecholamine requirements, RV and/or LV systolic\r\ndysfunction and CAD.104 Lima et al. conducted a retrospective\r\nstudy of 260 HT patients with both standard and â€œextendedâ€�\r\nlist donors.103 The â€œextendedâ€� list donors most commonly\r\nwere older and had diabetes. They reported no difference in\r\nthe incidence of PGF, with 23\% in the standard group and\r\n26\% in the â€œextendedâ€� list. The two factors the authors\r\nidentified as risk factors poorer outcomes were length of\r\nischemia time and pre-operative MCS.\r\nAssessment of graft function can be made by\r\nhemodynamic measurement, TEE, and gross visual inspection\r\nof the heart. The hemodynamic parameters that are suspicious\r\nfor graft dysfunction are a CI < 2.0 L/min/m2\r\n, a RAP > 15 mm\r\nHg and a PCWP >15 mm Hg when on maximal inotropic\r\nsupport. The RV stroke work (RVSW) or RVSW index\r\n(RVSWI) [RVSWI = (mean pulmonary artery pressure\r\n[MPAP]-CVP)*(SVI)*(0. 0136) (g*m/m2\r\n) where 0.0136\r\nconverts mm Hg Hg-liters/beat beat-m2 to g*m/ m2\r\n], which\r\nhave been used to assess RV function and likelihood of failure\r\nin a non-transplant VAD population105, 106 may be helpful in\r\ndetermining the appropriate time for institution of MCS\r\n(Table 1). \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 10\r\nTable 1 Functional Variables of the Right Ventricle\r\nFunctional Parameters Normal Value Load Dependency\r\nMild RV\r\ndysfunction\r\nModerate RV\r\ndysfunction:\r\nSevere RV\r\ndysfunction\r\nSystolic Performance Variables\r\nRVFAC (\%) 32-60 +++ 25-31 18-24 < 17\r\nRVEF (\%) 45-68 +++ 35-44 26-34 < 25\r\nTAPSE >15 mm ++\r\nTricuspid annular plane\r\nmaximal systolic velocity (using\r\nspectral pulse wave tissue\r\nDoppler)\r\n> 12cm/s\r\nIVA ( using tissue pulsed wave\r\nDoppler)\r\n1.4 Â± 0.5 m/s2 +\r\nDiastolic Performance Variables\r\nIVC dimension (cm), collapse\r\nindex\r\n< 1.7 cm, CI > 50\% +++\r\nTricuspid early (E) to late (A)\r\nfilling velocity ratio\r\n1.5 Â± 0.3 +++\r\nHepatic vein profile (S:systolic;\r\nD: diastolic)\r\nS/D velocity ratio > 1, no S\r\nreversal, atrial reversal < 50\%\r\nS\r\n+++\r\nassist support devices \r\nIVRT < 60 ms +++\r\nRapid myocardial filling\r\nvelocity (Et) (cm/s)\r\n15.6 Â± 3.9 +++\r\nLate diastolic myocardial filling\r\nvelocity, At (cm/s)\r\n15.4 Â± 4.5 +++\r\nCombined systolic and diastolic\r\nparameter RVMPI\r\n0.28 Â± 0.04 ++\r\nIVA, isovolumic acceleration using Doppler tissue imaging; IVC, inferior vena cava; RV, right ventricle; RVEF, right ventricular\r\nejection fraction; RVFAC, right ventricular fractional area change; RVMPI, right ventricular myocardial performance index; TAPSE,\r\ntricuspid annular plane systolic excursion; IVRT, isovolumic relaxation time.\r\nAdapted from Haddad F. et al.107\r\nPost-operatively, hemodynamically-significant RV\r\ndysfunction is one of the most serious complications that can\r\noccur after HT and it is associated with increased early and\r\nlate mortality. Patients should be carefully screened and then\r\nmonitored for the development of pulmonary vascular\r\nhypertension while waiting for a suitable donor organ to insure\r\nthat the transpulmonary gradient (TPG) and PVR remain\r\nwithin an acceptable range.107-109 These criteria are detailed in\r\nthe 2006 International Society for Heart and Lung\r\nTransplantation (ISHLT) Listing Criteria Guidelines.86\r\nKnowledge of the pre-operative pulmonary hemodynamics\r\nmay aid the planning of peri-operative strategies to avoid or\r\nbetter manage RV dysfunction. Pulmonary artery pressures\r\nmay decline rapidly after HT and usually reach a new baseline\r\nby 1 year.87 Even when initially poor, RV function typically\r\nimproves over time with proper support. It is during this early\r\npost-operative period when PA pressures are highest and RV\r\nfunction is poorest that overt RV dysfunction may develop and\r\nlead to cardiogenic shock. Timely and aggressive\r\nhemodynamic support during this time is essential. When\r\npharmacologic therapy fails, prompt insertion of a right VAD\r\nis indicated and can provide support while RV dysfunction\r\nresolves.88\r\nSeveral features may be present in patients with postoperative\r\nRV dysfunction after HT. First, there is an increased\r\nPVR that may be due to reversible pulmonary vasoconstriction\r\nas well as chronic changes due to remodeling of the\r\npulmonary vasculature.110 Second, there is RV dysfunction\r\ndue to either graft-related issues, such as ischemia, or PGF.88\r\nUsually LV systolic and diastolic functions are adequate and\r\nthus LV end-diastolic pressure is low. In this instance RV\r\ndysfunction leads to a reduction in the LV stroke volume due \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 11\r\nto inadequate LV filling.88 If significant LV dysfunction is\r\npresent, there is the added feature of LV failure complicating\r\nRV failure. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, insertion of\r\nan IABP may effectively reduce LV afterload and improve RV\r\nperfusion.\r\nTherapy, in general, is aimed at reducing RV afterload\r\nwhile maintaining an adequate but not excessive RV preload\r\n(CVP < 15 mm Hg). Inotropic support of the RV should also\r\nbe provided; usually an IV drug with Î²-agonist properties is\r\nselected first. Mean arterial blood pressure must be maintained\r\nnot only to insure end-organ perfusion but also to maintain RV\r\nperfusion, which occurs in systole as well as diastole. Mild\r\nRV dysfunction may be treated with inotropic agents and\r\nvasodilators such as nitroglycerine or nitroprusside.88\r\nSystemic vasodilation leading to arterial hypotension or\r\nnecessitating the addition of peripheral vasoconstrictors is a\r\nfrequent limiting factor in the use of these agents. The ideal\r\nagent should selectively decrease PVR. At least equivalent, if\r\nnot superior RV afterload reduction, with less systemic\r\nhypotension is achieved by the administration of\r\nprostaglandins. The only truly selective pulmonary vasodilator\r\ncurrently available is inhaled nitric oxide (iNO).89\r\nData have also suggested that concomitant use of a\r\ntricuspid DeVega annuloplasty may help preserve RV function\r\npost-operatively and allow for lower RA pressures.111\r\nBiventricular graft dysfunction can certainly occur with PGF,\r\nand it will be associated with elevated filling pressures for\r\nboth ventricles, low CO, and hypotension. Isolated LV failure\r\nis rare after HT. When this occurs, CAD in the donor heart\r\nshould be ruled out, and if needed, coronary artery bypass\r\ngrafting (CABG) performed.\r\nOther Cardiac Abnormalities\r\nTricuspid Regurgitation\r\nTricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most common valvular\r\nabnormality after orthotropic HT.112 Its reported incidence\r\nvaries between 19\% and 84\%, depending on the definition of\r\nsignificant TR, time of diagnosis, and the surgical\r\ntransplantation technique.112 The incidence and severity of TR\r\nmay increase over time and progression to significant TR has\r\nbeen associated with increased morbidity and mortality.112\r\nAlthough the majority of patients do well with medical\r\ntherapy, a small proportion eventually requires surgical\r\nintervention. The TR occurring in the early peri-operative\r\nperiod is, for the most part, functional. The regurgitant jet is\r\ntypically central and caused by geometric distortion of the AV\r\nannular ring and dilation, and malcoaptation of the valve\r\nleaflets. Causes include biatrial anastomoses, allograft\r\nrejection with RV dysfunction, or mismatch between donor\r\nheart and recipient atrial size. In 166 patients undergoing HT\r\nwith a modified biatrial surgical technique, patients without\r\nTR (67\%) had a donor to recipient (D/R) ratio of < 1, whereas\r\nthose with moderate to severe TR had a D/R ratio of > 1.113\r\nCompared to 88 patients with the bicaval approach, 161\r\nrecipients of the biatrial technique had an increased\r\noccurrence and progression of TR (15\% at 1 month, 30\% at 24\r\nmonths vs. 41\% at 1 month, 52\% at 24 months)114 This lends\r\nstrong support to the belief that preservation of atrial and\r\ntricuspid annulus geometry is crucial in preventing\r\ndevelopment of significant TR.\r\nOther factors influencing atrial remodeling and\r\nenlargement, including allograft rejection > ISHLT Grade 2\r\nand pre-operative pulmonary hypertension independently\r\npredict early TR development.112 The majority of patients with\r\nmoderate to severe TR are asymptomatic. However, adverse\r\nclinical consequences have been reported, such as progressive\r\nRV dysfunction and failure with debilitating symptoms of\r\ndyspnea and peripheral edema, use of high diuretic doses,\r\ndeteriorating functional status, renal dysfunction, and even\r\ndecreased survival. The effects of sub-clinical TR remain\r\ncontroversial. One report described a benign clinical course\r\nfor HT recipeints with less than moderate TR.115 In contrast,\r\nBurgess et al observed that 9\% of patients with TR diagnosed\r\nduring the fourth post-operative week had a 90\% chance of\r\ndeveloping RV failure at a mean follow-up period of 5 years,\r\nleading to an increased mortality (28\% vs. 20\%, p < 0.001).116\r\nProgressive RV cavity enlargement, with disproportionate\r\nelongation of the mid-minor axis, elevated right-sided\r\npressures and more advanced functional class, was associated\r\nwith more severe TR.112, 117 Up to 76\% of patients with TR\r\nhad overt right-heart failure in the immediate post-operative\r\nperiod, and this correlated with pulmonary hypertension after\r\nHT.112 Lewen et al found that 13 of 14 (93\%) patients with\r\nmoderate to severe TR after HT had RV volume overload and\r\nhigher PVR.118 Williams et al noted higher RAP (mean 10 vs.\r\n6 mm Hg, p < 0.05), lower CI (mean 2.0 vs. 2.5 L/min/m2\r\n, p <\r\n0.05) and greater right-side cardiac dimensions in 23 of 72\r\npatients with moderate to severe TR.119\r\nWith longer follow-up duration, the severity and clinical\r\nimpact of TR worsens. Among 238 patients who survived â‰¥ 1\r\nyear after HT, Aziz et al observed persistent higher mean\r\nRAP, PA systolic pressure and RV dimensions among patients\r\nwith clinical TR. Clinically, 35\% of patients complained of\r\nfatigue, 61\% had chronic fluid overload, 78\% had lower\r\nextremity edema, and 29\% had liver congestion. Furthermore,\r\nrenal function and physical capacity were inferior in the same\r\ngroup.120 Progression of TR has also been correlated with\r\nchange in RV diastolic area and tricuspid annulus, and intra-\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 12\r\noperative TR severity showed a strong correlation with RV\r\ndysfunction, peri-operative mortality and odds of late\r\nsurvival.112, 120, 121\r\nThe mainstay of therapy for symptomatic severe TR is\r\nuse of diuretics. In refractory cases, surgical intervention with\r\ntricuspid valve annuloplasty, repair or replacement, should be\r\nconsidered, depending on the anatomic abnormality of the\r\ntricuspid valve apparatus. In tricuspid annular dilation,\r\napplication of an annuloplasty ring may be sufficient to reduce\r\nthe effective regurgitant orifice. In contrast, surgical repair or\r\nreplacement is required with leaflet or chordal damage to\r\nrestore a functional AV valve apparatus in the right heart.\r\nOverall, various reports have cited tricuspid valve replacement\r\n(TVR) incidence rates between 4\% and 6\% in HT recipients,\r\nwith a mean lag time of 12 to 21 months.112, 122, 123 In another\r\nseries, however, only 5/526 (0.95\%) HT recipients later\r\nrequired tricuspid valve surgery due to severe TR.124 If\r\nreplacement is performed, the best results are achieved before\r\nRV function deteriorates due to severe TR.125 Most patients\r\nhave shown a reduction in their furosemide dose and lower\r\nserum creatinine levels, as well as significantly improved\r\nalbumin and total bilirubin values, implying relief of hepatic\r\ncongestion.112, 123 Prophylactic tricuspid valve annuloplasty\r\n(TVA) on the donor heart at the time of transplantation has\r\nbeen shown to reduce TR immediately after HT as well as on\r\nlong-term follow-up. Sixty patients undergoing orthotopic HT\r\nwith bicaval anastomosis were randomized to either\r\nconcomitant DeVega TVA or no intervention on the donorâ€™s\r\nTV. At 5 years of follow up, compared to patients without TV\r\nintervention, recipients of the DeVega TVA had lower perioperative\r\ncardiac mortality [3 (10\%) vs, 7 (23\%); p < 0.05],\r\naverage amount of TR (0.5Â± 0.4 vs. 1.5Â± 1.3; p < 0.05),\r\npercentage of patients with TR â‰¥ 2+ (0 vs. 34\%; p < 0.05),\r\nserum creatinine (sCr) (1.8Â±0.7 vs. 2.9Â±2.0 mg/dL; p < 0.05)\r\nand change in sCr from baseline (0.7Â±0.8 vs. 2.0 Â± 2.1 mg/dL;\r\np < 0.05).111 These benefits did not result in significant\r\ndifferences between groups in 5 year survival. Other studies\r\nyielded similar results.126\r\nMitral Regurgitation\r\nMitral regurgitation (MR) can occur in > 50\% of all HT\r\nrecipients in the peri-operative period.115, 127 It typically occurs\r\nin the absence of donor heart structural pathology, but in some\r\ncases it results from incomplete mitral leaflet coaptation due to\r\natrial enlargement.\r\nOther less common causes of MR include asynchronous\r\natrial contraction due to donor and recipient sinus node\r\ndischarge, papillary muscle ischemia, or LV outflow\r\nobstruction. In most cases, MR is mild and asymptomatic.68-71,\r\n128-131 The need for mitral valve repair or replacement is very\r\nrare.\r\nRecommendations on the Management of Perioperative\r\nTricuspid Valve Regurgitation111, 112:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Tricuspid valve regurgitation identified intra-operatively\r\nand estimated to be moderate or severe (> 2+), should be\r\nre-evaluated by TTE or TEE within 24 hours of HT and\r\nclosely monitored for the first few post-operative days.\r\nThe frequency of subsequent follow up should be guided\r\nby clinical and hemodynamic variables.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass II:\r\n1. DeVega annuloplasty of the donor TV can be considered\r\nto maintain the normal size of the TV annulus.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPericardial Effusion\r\nThe development of pericardial effusion has been shown\r\nto occur in more than 20\% of HT recipients.132 Nonetheless,\r\npericardial effusions are rarely associated with hemodynamic\r\ninstability and typically resolve spontaneously by the fourth\r\npost-operative week.133, 134 Moreover, it is uncommon for\r\npericardial effusions to progress to cardiac tamponade.135 In\r\nfact, large but slowly accumulating pericardial effusions\r\nusually cause little hemodynamic impairment in HT\r\nrecipients. However, the development of a loculated\r\nhematoma or mediastinal bleeding, which can develop rapidly\r\nin the early post-operative period, may result in tamponade\r\nphysiology.136 Occasionally, there is isolated RV tamponade\r\nthat may be difficult to distinguish from primary RV failure.\r\nEchocardiography is important for recognition and timely\r\nreturn to the operating room for exploration and evacuation of\r\nthe hematoma to improve RV mechanics and function.\r\nAlthough early reports identified an association between acute\r\nheart allograft rejection and the development or rapid increase\r\nof post-operative pericardial effusions, this finding was not\r\nconfirmed in newer retrospective studies.132\r\nIn a recent retrospective analysis of 203 HT recipients, the\r\nthree factors that predicted the development of post-operative\r\npericardial effusion were absence of a previous cardiac\r\nsurgery, the intra-operative use of aminocaproic acid, and\r\nlower recipient weight. The reasons for the association of\r\nthese factors with pericardial effusions occurring after heart\r\ntransplant remain unclear.137\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 13\r\nRecommendations on the Management of Perioperative\r\nPericardial Effusions132, 137:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Pericardial effusions occurring after HT should be\r\nmonitored by echocardiogram.\r\n2. Percutaneous or surgical drainage should be done when\r\nthe pericardial effusion causes hemodynamic\r\ncompromise.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Pericardial effusions that are not hemodynamically\r\ncompromising do not require drainage unless there is a\r\nstrong suspicion of an infectious etiology.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPharmacologic Management of Primary Graft Failure\r\nand Right Ventricular Dysfunction\r\nThe pharmacologic management of PGF and RV heart\r\nallograft dysfunction includes the use of high-dose inotropic\r\nagents and/or pulmonary vasodilators.\r\nIntravenous Vasoactive Medications\r\nVasoactive medications are selectively employed in the\r\nimmediate post-operative period (including the period leading\r\nto separation from CPB) to achieve several specific goals: (1)\r\ninotropic support of the RV and/or LV; (2) chronotropic\r\nsupport; (3) increase of pulmonary blood flow/pulmonary\r\nvasodilation; and (4) peripheral arterial vasodilation or\r\nvasoconstriction.\r\nFrequently, agents are chosen for their ability to increase\r\nboth contractility and heart rate while decreasing pulmonary\r\nand systemic vascular resistance. As a potent chronotrope,\r\ninotrope, and vasodilator, isoproterenol is in many respects the\r\nideal agent for hemodynamic support after HT, particularly in\r\nthe setting of bradycardia or sinus node dysfunction. It has\r\nbeen a commonly used agent since the early days of HT.78\r\nHowever, tachycardia can limit its usefulness, particularly in\r\nbicaval and total HT, where the incidence of sinus node\r\ndysfunction is lower than with the biatrial surgical technique.\r\nWhereas the dose range for isoproterenol is usually 2 to 10\r\nÂµg/min, this drug can be titrated to achieve a target heart rate\r\nof 90 to 110 bpm. Atrial pacing combined with dobutamine\r\nachieves results similar to those of isoproterenol.\r\nCombined infusion of low-dose dobutamine and\r\ndopamine (both at starting doses of 2.5-5 Âµg/kg/min) is\r\nanother commonly used inotropic regimen after HT.138 This\r\ncombination of inotropes may be titrated to achieve the\r\ndesired hemodynamic effects. Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase\r\ninhibitor with inotropic and vasodilatory properties, may also\r\nbe considered for hemodynamic support, particularly in the\r\nsetting of pulmonary vascular hypertension, high systemic\r\nvasomotor tone or if there is evidence of heart allograft\r\ndysfunction upon separation from CPB.139\r\nIn some instances, peripheral arteriolar vasoconstrictors\r\nmay be required to counteract the vasodilation seen during or\r\nafter CPB and maintain a systemic arterial pressure adequate\r\nfor the perfusion of vital organs. While the etiology of this\r\nvasodilation is unclear, several hypotheses invoked to explain\r\nits occurrence include the release during CPB of cytokines,\r\nwhich may produce a systemic inflammatory response\r\nsyndrome (SIRS), the effects of pre-operative medications\r\nsuch as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or\r\nrelative/absolute deficiency of vasopressin. Septic shock\r\narising from an occult intra-abdominal catastrophe must also\r\nbe considered, especially if there is lactic acidosis that persists\r\nbeyond 6 hours after HT.140 The range of vasodilation seen in\r\nthe post-operative period ranges from mild and responsive to\r\nthe infusion of a low dose of a single Î±-adrenergic agent to\r\nquite profound and refractory to high levels of multiple\r\nvasoconstrictors. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene\r\nblue has been successfully used for the treatment of\r\ncatecholamine-refractory vasoplegia after CPB.141 It has been\r\ndemonstrated that an infusion of low-dose arginine\r\nvasopressin can improve vasomotor tone (and thus arterial\r\npressure) and permit reduction or discontinuation of high-dose\r\ncatecholamines in patients receiving left VADs.142 Arginine\r\nvasopressin has also been shown to prevent hypotension after\r\nCPB in patients undergoing CABG or valve surgery\r\n(Table 2).143\r\nRecommendations for Peri-operative Vasoactive\r\nDrugs Use in Heart Transplant Recipients139, 141-150:\r\n(See Table 2)\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Continuous infusion of an inotropic agent should be used\r\nto maintain hemodynamic stability post-operatively.\r\nInotropes should be weaned as tolerated over the first 3 to\r\n5 days.

Low dose vasopressin (0.03-0.1 U/min) or methylene blue\r\ncan be added to Î±-agonist for vasodilatory shock.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nPulmonary Vasodilators\r\nProstanoids\r\nThe prostanoids are naturally occurring substances that\r\nproduce vasodilation by inducing smooth muscle relaxation.\r\nThey have short half-lives, on the order of minutes, and are\r\npotent pulmonary vasodilators. Of the prostanoids,\r\nprostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and epoprostenol or prostacyclin are\r\ngiven IV whereas iloprost is sdministered by inhalation.\r\nProstaglandin E1\r\nThe use of continuous infusion PGE1 for RV dysfunction\r\ndue to pulmonary hypertension after HT has been described in\r\nnumerous case reports.143, 144, 151 PGE1 is metabolized in the\r\nfirst pass through the pulmonary circulation and, therefore, the\r\nrisk of systemic arterial vasodilatation is reduced but not\r\ncompletely eliminated. Kieler-Jensen, et al. compared the\r\nsystemic and pulmonary vasodilating effects of PGE1 with\r\niNO and IV prostacyclin. This increased CO more than either\r\nPGE1 or iNO, but iNO reduced PVR more and was the only\r\npulmonary selective vasodilator and thus preferred in the\r\nsetting of systemic hypotension.89, 152\r\nProstacyclin\r\nIntravenous prostacyclin (PGI2) is an approved therapy\r\nfor pulmonary arterial hypertension (World Health\r\nOrganization Group I). Pascual et al. reported a series of 9\r\npatients who developed RV dysfunction early after HT despite\r\ninotropic and vasodilator infusions. Prostacyclin infusion,\r\nstarted at 0.5 ng/kg/min and titrated to 5.0 ng/kg/min, resulted\r\nin an increased CI with reduced RAP and mean PA pressures.\r\nTherapy was maintained for 48 hours and weaned over 24\r\nhours.145 Comparative studies have shown more pulmonary\r\nvasodilator effects and more pronounced peripheral\r\nvasodilation with PGI2 than with nitroprusside and\r\nnitroglycerine.89\r\nContinuous inhaled PGI2 has also been used in the\r\ntreatment of RV dysfunction after HT and cardiac surgery.\r\nHaraldsson, et al. reported its use in 9 patients (2 of whom\r\nwere HT recipients) with pulmonary hypertension and an\r\nincreased PVR. Inhalation of PGI2, at 10 Âµg/mL, produced\r\nreductions in mean pulmonary artery pressure and PVR\r\nwithout affecting systemic vascular resistance. No change in\r\nCO was noted.153 The use of the intermittently inhaled\r\nprostacyclin analogue, iloprost, has also been reported.146\r\nInhaled Nitric Oxide\r\nNitric oxide (iNO), also previously known as endothelialderived\r\nrelaxation factor, causes vasodilation by activating\r\nguanylate cyclase and increasing the production of cyclic\r\nguanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which then activates a\r\ncGMP protein kinase leading to smooth muscle relaxation.\r\nWhen inhaled in doses up to 80 ppm, it causes selective\r\npulmonary vasodilation leading to reduced PVR, increased\r\npulmonary blood flow, and reduced RV afterload. It reacts\r\nreadily with oxyhemoglobin to yield methemoglobin and\r\nnitrate, thus, its activity outside the pulmonary vasculature is\r\nlimited and, generally, systemic vasodilation does not occur.\r\nNitric oxide has been shown to reduce PVR, increase RV\r\nstroke work, and reduce the incidence of RV dysfunction. It\r\nalso appears to be safe with a very low incidence of\r\nmethemoglobinemia with proper monitoring. In addition,\r\nbecause iNO produces vasodilation in the areas of the lung\r\nthat are well ventilated, theoretically it should not exacerbate \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 15\r\nventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching. Consequently, it\r\nwould seem to be the optimal selective pulmonary\r\nvasodilator.154\r\nHowever, despite its theoretical advantages, the clinical\r\nuse of iNO remains somewhat controversial. In the United\r\nStates, its only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\r\napproved indication is for hypoxic respiratory failure in the\r\nnewborn. Studies in adult respiratory distress syndrome have\r\nidentified no consistent benefit. Its use in managing RV\r\ndysfunction after left VAD implantation has been described.155\r\nData in HT is limited to small case series and anecdotal\r\nreports.89, 147, 148, 156, 157 There have been no adequately\r\npowered trials to critically assess mortality or other outcomes.\r\nSildenafil\r\nSildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is an\r\nevolving therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension that may\r\nhave a role in the treatment of RV dysfunction after HT.\r\nMichelakis et al. demonstrated in 13 patients referred for heart\r\nand lung transplantation that a single dose of sildenafil was as\r\neffective and selective as iNO for pulmonary vasodilation.158\r\nCase reports and small anecdotal studies suggest sildenafil\r\nmay attenuate the rebound pulmonary hypertension sometimes\r\nnoted with withdrawal of iNO and reduce PA pressure after\r\ncardiac surgery.159-161 In a series of 13 patients with RV\r\ndysfunction and low CO despite therapy with dobutamine,\r\nisoproterenol, PGE1, and iNO during the first post-operative\r\nday (1-18 hours) after HT, oral sildenafil at 3 mg/kg to a\r\nmaximum of 250 mg/day resulted in immediate hemodynamic\r\nimprovement.149 Although an oral form is widely available, an\r\nIV formulation is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.\r\nRecommendations for the Medical Management of\r\nRight Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary\r\nVascular Hypertension after Heart Transplantation139,\r\n141-149, 162:\r\n(See Figure 1)\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

Use of IABP alone is up to 66\% to 70\% in some\r\nreports,101, 103 with use of other VADs of 22\% to 29\% and\r\nECMO in 7\% to 10\% of patients.\r\nECMO has been used to support patients with PGF who\r\nfail to wean from CPB. Some recommend ECMO as the first\r\nline of support because it makes separation from CPB\r\npossible.102, 171 However, more recent publications have not\r\nagreed with this recommendation.\r\nVentricular assist devices that have been used for\r\nrecovery in PGF include Pierce-Donachy VAD,167 Delphin\r\ncentifugal VAD,168 ABIOMED 5000 BVS,82, 96, 166, 169, 170 Biomedicus\r\ncentrifugal pump,82, 85, 101, 164-166 Novacor,83\r\nThoratec,82, 83, 101, 166 HeartMate LVAD,96 and Levitronix.84, 173\r\nNewer percutaneous devices such as the TandemHeart have\r\nanecdotally been used for PGF. In rare circumstances, a\r\nThoratec device can be implanted as an right VAD to allow\r\nfor patient physical therapy and ambulation while waiting for\r\ngraft recovery. Although the choice of device is influenced by\r\nanatomical considerations, hemodynamic stability, and\r\nsurgeon preferences, VADs suited for temporary circulatory\r\nsupport should be preferred. The VAD for PGF should be easy\r\nto prime, implant, manage, and remove. In addition, it should\r\nbe less expensive than devices designed for long-term support\r\nand require little anticoagulation for the first 24 hours postoperatively.\r\nWith the advances in MCS technology, the\r\nsmaller devices can now provide substantial support, with less\r\ncost and less physical manipulation of the transplanted heart.\r\nThe Levitronix Centrimag is a magnetically levitated\r\ncentrifugal extra-corporeal pump that can provide flows of 5\r\nto 7 L/min, and can be used for left, right, and bi-ventricular\r\nsupport.173 The TandemHeart is an extracorporeal axial flow \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 16\r\npump that has been used support cardiac function in\r\npostcardiotomy shock.174 Flows of 4 L/min can be maintained,\r\nand these VADs can also be used to support the LV, RV or\r\nboth. Oxygenators can be inserted into the circuit of these\r\nVADs, if needed, which decreases the appeal for ECMO in\r\nadults. An IABP can be used concurrently with a VAD for\r\nPGF to facilitate afterload reduction and to maintain some\r\npulsatile flows. The Impella Recover LD/LP 5.0 has also been\r\nused to support patients with postcardiotomy shock.175\r\nAcute Right Ventricular Failure\r\nPreload\r\nOptimization\r\nHemodynamically Unstable\r\n(low output syndrome)\r\nMaintenance of\r\nSR and AV synchrony Ventilatory Support\r\nVolume Overload State\r\nMild progressive diuresis\r\ngoal:0.5-1 L daily negative\r\nAcute RVMI or PE\r\nor Hypovolemic State\r\n(Consider 300-600 ml\r\ncrystalloid challenge.\r\n(D/C/if unresponsive)\r\nCardioversion\r\nPacemeker Implantation\r\n(atrio-ventricular)\r\nAntiarrhythmics as required\r\nAvoid:\r\nInspiratory pressure > 30 mmHg\r\nAuto PEEP\r\nHypercapnia\r\nAcidosis\r\nHypoxemia\r\nContinuous infusion\r\nof loop diuretics\r\nand/or combination diuretics\r\nConsider CVVH or\r\nUltrafiltration\r\nMinimize transfusions\r\nAtrial septostomy\r\nRV assist device\r\nECMO\r\nNotric oxide trial (inhaled)\r\nor prostanoids\r\nCombinatio Based upon response\r\nEpinephrine Hypotensive-unresponsive\r\nVasopressine Hypotensive-tachycardic\r\nPhenylephrine Hypotensive-tachycardic\r\nNorepinephrine Hypotensive\r\nDopamine Hypotensive, non-tachycardic\r\nMilrinone Normotensive, chronic BB\r\nDobutamie Normotensive\r\nInotrope-Vasopressor Preferred Use\r\nUnresponsive\r\nAlso consider\r\nUnresponsive\r\nUnresponsive\r\nFigure 1 Management of right ventricular dysfunction.

Adapted from Hannad F et al.162\r\nBecause of immunosuppression and the risks of infection,\r\nthe shortest possible duration of support is preferred.\r\nHowever, once a VAD is implanted, it is often best to delay\r\nweaning attempts for 36 to 48 hours. Evidence of heart\r\nallograft recovery can be seen on TTE, although often TEE is\r\nneeded because of poor transthoracic acoustic windows.\r\nDecreased requirement for inotropic support also signifies\r\ngraft recovery. Hemodynamic parameters such as a decrease\r\nin RAP or RV end diastolic pressure may be helpful, but this\r\nwill depend on the configuration of MCS. Increased pulsewave\r\namplitude on arterial waveforms can also be a sign of\r\ngraft recovery.\r\nSurvival with PGF has improved over the past 15 years.98\r\nCoupled with the recognition that early retransplantation\r\nwithin 6 months of primary HT is associated with poorer\r\nsurvival, there is now increasing consensus that bridging to\r\nrecovery results in better survival.84, 101, 176 Patient survival\r\nrates to hospital discharge after MCS for PGF ranges from 0\%\r\nto 71\% depending on the report and the type of MCS used.82-\r\n84, 96, 101, 102, 163, 166, 177, 178 However, these data are based on\r\nsmall case series or case reports. Causes of death include\r\nsepsis, hemorrhage, neurologic complications, or multisystem\r\norgan failure, specifically renal failure, and liver failure\r\nassociated with RV failure. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 17\r\nRecommendations on the Peri-operative Use of\r\nMechanical Circulatory Support after Heart\r\nTransplantation163, 164, 166, 168, 169:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

In the presence of hemodynamic instability, cardiac\r\ntamponade should be excluded by direct surgical\r\nexploration.

If\r\nhemodynamic instability persists in the absence of cardiac\r\ntamponade MCS should be considered.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. The timing MCS discontinuation should be guided by\r\nevidence of graft recovery. If there is no evidence of graft\r\nfunctional recovery within 3 to 4 days, hyperacute and\r\nantibody mediated rejection should be excluded and the\r\noption of listing for repeat HT may be considered.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1. Use of ECMO support in adults requires consideration of\r\nthe risk of infection, immobility, and need for\r\nanticoagulation.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPediatric Considerations\r\nIn the setting of acute RV failure in the peri-operative\r\nperiod, it is imperative that any potential residual anatomic\r\nlesions be investigated and rectified if present. This is\r\nespecially important in the child with complex congenital\r\nheart disease who has undergone pulmonary artery\r\nreconstruction. The associated abnormalities may be amenable\r\nto intervention in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Less\r\ncommonly, the size of the left atrial anastamosis may be a\r\nproblem. If stenosis is hemodyamically significant and not\r\nrecognized intra-operatively by TEE, it is likely to cause\r\nhemodynamic instability in the immediate post-operative\r\nperiod and require a return to the operating room for revision.\r\nRarely, progressive pulmonary vein stenosis can be a problem.\r\nThe complication of high PVR leading to acute RV\r\nfailure, and the principles of post-operative management are\r\nsimilar in children and adults. However, in the literature, with\r\nstudies showing variable outcomes with varying levels of PVR\r\nor transpulmonary gradient elevation,179-184 have been reported\r\nand there is no consensus regarding relative or absolute cutoff\r\nvalues for HT candidacy. Even the values of parameters (PVR,\r\nPVR indexed (PVRi), systolic PA pressure, and TPG) whose\r\nproperative measurement is deemed imprtant for risk\r\nstratification remain controversial.88, 183, 184 Responses of\r\npulmonary arterial hypertension to vasodilators are also felt to\r\nbe of variable significance in terms of an accurate prediction\r\nof outcomes.184 In addition, determination of PVR is difficult,\r\nespecially in infants with complex congenital heart disease.185,\r\n186\r\nIn an early pediatric series of 6 patients with resting PVR\r\nvalues between 7 and 15 Wood Units,187 5 underwent HT after\r\ndemonstration of a decrease in PVR in response to IV\r\nnitroprusside and 4 were long-term survivors.187 Correlation of\r\nPVR and PVRi values with outcomes after HT in 82 patients\r\naged 4 to 61 years showed188 that 33\% of patients with a PVRi\r\nof > 6 Wood Units developed RV failure with a mortality of\r\n15\%, wherease no patient with a PVRi below this value\r\ndeveloped RV failure. The results also confirm that high PVR\r\nis not an absolute contraindication to HT as 28 of 33 patients\r\nwith a PVRi of > 6 Wood Units and 10 of 12 patients with a\r\nPVRi of > 9 Wood Units were successfully transplanted.\r\nassist support devices \r\nThe infant population with either congenital heart disease\r\npredisposing to systemic pulmonary vascular pressures (duct\r\ndependent single ventricle physiology) or cardiomyopathy\r\nhave a low incidence of significant post-operative\r\ncomplications due to pulmonary vascular hypertension. Of\r\n139 consecutive infant HT recipients up to 12 months of age,\r\nonly 1 death occurred as a result of pulmonary vascular\r\nhypertension.189\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 18\r\nRecommendations for the Management of Early\r\nHeart Allograft Dysfunction in Pediatric\r\nRecipients179, 181, 183-187, 189:\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1. The increased risk of post-operative RV dysfunction must\r\nbe carefully evaluated in children, although evidence\r\nsuggests that children can safely undergo HT despite\r\nelevation of PVR above values considered unsafe in\r\nadults.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Contrary to the experience and practice in adults, the first\r\nchoice for support in the setting of PGF in the pediatric\r\nsetting should be ECMO.\r\nClass IIa, Level of Evidence C.\r\nArrhythmias\r\nHeart rate is variable and ranges from bradycardia to\r\ntachycardia. Factors such as parasympathetic denervation,\r\nsurgical trauma, catecholamine administration, and even\r\ngenomic variations in the Î²-adrenergic receptor may affect the\r\nsinus node rate.94\r\nBradycardia\r\nMost HT recipients display normal sinus rhythm upon\r\nreperfusion. A complete or incomplete right bundle branch\r\nblock may be present in 14\% to 60\% of patients.190, 191 PR and\r\nQT intervals remain normal, despite the bundle branch block.\r\nHowever, the incidence of bradyarrhythmias ranges from 8\%\r\nto 64\%.192-194 Sinus node dysfunction in the immediate postoperative\r\nperiod may be related to surgical trauma, sinus node\r\nischemia, and recipient medical therapy and donor age and\r\nischemic time.195 In addition, the donor heart has an increased\r\nsensitivity to and production of adenosine, which may\r\ncontribute to some peri-operative bradycardia.196, 197 Absolute\r\nor relative bradycardia typically occurs within the first 2\r\nweeks.198\r\nRates of sinus node dysfunction and the need for\r\npermanent pacing have decreased with the adoption of the\r\nbicaval Wythenshawe technique, and the total heart technique\r\nthat has separate anastamoses of the pulmonary and caval\r\nveins, to replace the standard biatrial technique pioneered by\r\nLower and Shumway.192, 196, 199 In a randomized study of\r\nsurgical techniques, 36 of 41 patients with the bicaval\r\napproach had sinus rhythm in the operating room, with the rest\r\nreturning to sinus rhythm in a few days. In contrast, the\r\nbiatrial method resulted in only 20 of 40 patients with\r\nspontaneous sinus rhythm and 5 patients in whom sinus\r\nrhythm never returned.200 In another report the rate of\r\ntemporary pacing was up to 38\% in the standard biatrial\r\napproach to transplantation and only 20\% with the bicaval\r\ntechnique.201 More recent data suggest that hospital length of\r\nstay and need for pacing are also lower with the bicaval\r\ntechnique.202\r\nWith modern surgical techniques, 18\% to 27\% of HT\r\nrecipients require temporary pacing.194, 203 Sinus node\r\ndepression is usually corrected by chronotropic support with\r\nisoproterenol, dobutamine, or dopamine, which are routinely\r\nused (see section on Pharmacologic management posttransplant).\r\nOther pharmacologic agents that have been used\r\nfor bradycardia after HT are theophylline and terbutaline. As\r\nthere is invariably some diastolic dysfunction and a reduced\r\nstroke volume in the post transplant heart, maintaining heart\r\nrate is crucial to maintaining CO.\r\nTachyarrhythmias\r\nSinus tachycardia is the most common heart rhythm after\r\nHT. With loss of vagal innervation and parasympathetic input,\r\nthe transplanted heart will assume the automatic sinus rate,\r\nwhich should be < 130 bpm. However, both ventricular and\r\natrial tachyarrhthymias may occur in the post-operative\r\nperiod.\r\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are\r\ncommon in the post-operative period. Studies have suggested\r\nan incidence of 7\% to 25\% for arrhythmias lasting longer than\r\n1 hour or leading to hemodynamic compromise.190, 204-206\r\nWithin the first 2 weeks after HT, AF is more common than\r\nAFL, occurring in 5\% to 24\% of patients, although more\r\ncontemporary estimates are lower (6\%-10\%). The incidence of\r\nAF after HT, may be less than that occurring after\r\nconventional cardiac surgery.190, 207 When AF occurs within 2\r\nweeks of transplantation, it does not appear to be associated\r\nwith rejection.204, 206 In contrast, later AF may be associated\r\nwith rejection and an increase in overall mortality.208 The\r\nlikelihood of AF after HT is greater with older donor and\r\nrecipient age. The incidence of AF in the post-operative period\r\ndoes not appear to be affected by the surgical technique. A\r\nlarge retrospective study showed that bicaval and total HT are\r\nassociated with a lower incidence of AFL201, 206 due to the\r\nphysical reduction of left atrial size by these procedures. The\r\ndevelopment of atrial tachyarrhythmias may also be due to\r\nconduction abnormalities in the donor heart. Accessory\r\npathways and re-entrant circuits have been described, in\r\naddition to standard AFL macro-reentrant circuits. These can\r\nbe treated with radio-frequency ablation.207 Although\r\nadenosine administration can help to clarify the diagnosis of\r\natrial arrhythmias in the HT recipient, the dose should be\r\nreduced by one-half to one-third 209 because of an increased\r\nsensitivity to its effects. Premature ventricular contractions \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 19\r\ncan be seen in as many as 95\% of HT recipients in the\r\nimmediate post-operative period. 204 Non-sustained ventricular\r\ntachycardia (VT) occurs in less than 2\% of HT recipients, 190\r\nand it is triggered by increased sensitivity to catecholamines\r\nand longer ischemic times.\r\nPharmacologic management of tachyarrythmias is limited\r\nbecause the donor heart is denervated. Digoxin will not be\r\neffective for rate control. Î²-blocker therapy can lower heart\r\nrates through direct effect on cardiac Î² receptors. The nondihydropyridine\r\ncalcium channel blockers, verapamil and\r\ndiltiazem, can help control heart rate, but should be used\r\njudiciously because they can have negative inotropic effects\r\nand inhibit the metabolism of CNI. Amiodarone can safely be\r\nused after HT for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Sotalol\r\ncan be used in patients without significant renal dysfunction.\r\nDofetlide has many drug interactions and should be avoided if\r\npossible unless there are no other antiarrhythmic options for\r\nrate control.\r\nRecommendations for the Peri-operative\r\nManagement of Cardiac Arrhythmias in Heart\r\nTransplant Recipients190-192, 194, 205, 207, 209:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and betablockers\r\nmay be used in HT recipients for rate control.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nRenal Function and Fluid Status Management\r\nThere are many insults to the kidneys in HT recipients.\r\nThe renal function of many chronic heart failure patients is\r\nimpaired due to chronic low output states, high venous filling\r\npressures, and upregulation of the renin-aldosteroneangiotensin\r\nsystem leading to salt and water retention.210\r\nVolume overload persisting after donor HT can acutely\r\ndistend the more sensitive, ischemically injured, pressure\r\noverloaded RV and aggravate post-operative RV\r\ndysfunction.225, 226\r\nCardiac cachexia and hypoalbuminemia can result in low\r\nplasma oncotic pressures, ascites, peripheral edema, and\r\npoorer outcomes.211 The cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic\r\nresistance typical of advanced heart failure complicates postoperative\r\nmanagement of HT recipeients. Early institution of\r\nCNI can further reduce responsiveness to diuretics due to the\r\nrenal vasoconstrictive properties of these drugs.\r\nPatients receiving successful MCS can be better\r\nnourished and euvolemic to even mildly hypovolemic at the\r\ntime of HT. The end-organ sequelae of chronic heart failure\r\nare often resolved in these patients. Whereas renal function\r\nand nutritional status are improved, the risk of peri-operative\r\nbleeding and resulting hypovolemia may be increased.212\r\nThe use of blood products and management of\r\ncoagulopathy in HT recipients is discussed elsewhere in these\r\nguidelines. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 20\r\nAfter HT, renal function may be a marker of cardiac\r\nfunction. As RAP rise above 15 to 20 mm Hg, there is\r\nincreased renal venous pressure and decreased perfusion\r\npressure.213-215 Perfusionists can perform ultrafiltration during\r\nCPB to reduce volume overload. Adequate CO can be\r\nmaintained using pharmacologic support or MCS if needed. If\r\noliguria develops, loop diuretics can be used. If urine output is\r\n< 1 mL/kg/min, appropriate interventions should be initiated.\r\nIf preload is low, with RAP < 10 to 12 mm Hg, volume\r\nreplacement should be considered. If the RAP is high, then\r\ncontinued use of diuretics or ultrafiltration should be\r\nconsidered to reduce renal preload and improve renal\r\nfunction.216, 217 In the heart failure and cardiorenal literature,\r\nvolume overload has been recognized as a risk factor for\r\nworsening renal function.218, 219 Ultrafiltration can be\r\nperformed with either standard dialysis platforms, or with the\r\nsmaller continuous ultrafiltration machines. The smaller\r\nmachines can provide substantial rates of ultrafiltration with\r\nlimited effect on the mean arterial pressure, and do not require\r\nthe placement of dialysis catheters.220\r\nThe incidence of renal failure requiring hemodialysis after\r\nHT ranges from 1\% to 15\%217, 221-224 and is associated with\r\nincreased mortality up to 50\% compared with 1.4\% to 4.2\% in\r\npatients not requiring renal replacement therapy.211, 222, 223 The\r\nuse of dialysis in the immediate post-transplant setting can be\r\ntransient.223 Risk factors for the development of renal failure\r\nare longer bypass time, diabetes mellitus, and low serum\r\nalbumin levels, but not pre-operative sCr.223\r\nFor patients requiring MCS, ultrafiltration or dialysis can\r\nbe performed into the circuit in some systems, and should be\r\nconsidered earlier in the setting of RV failure.169\r\nIf renal failure occurs in the immediate post-operative\r\nperiod after HT, the addition of monoclonal or polyclonal\r\nantibodies to delay initation of CNI should be considered. In\r\n2007, 51\% of HT recipients received mono- or polyclonal\r\nantibody therapy, 28\% with an anti-CD 25 (IL-2) receptor\r\nantagonist, and 20\% with anti-thymocyte globulin.225.\r\n226-229\r\nThe use of both anti-thymocyte globulin and the IL-2 receptor\r\nantagonist, basiliximab, to delay CNI initiation led to\r\nimproved renal function early after HT.230 231 More recently, a\r\nsingle-center comparison of anti-thymocyte globulin with\r\nbasiliximab suggested that induction with anti-thymocyte\r\nglobulin confers better renal protection than basiliximab with\r\nsustained benefits to 6 months after HT.232 Strategies to delay\r\nthe initiation of CNI, should be considered when there is preoperative\r\nrenal dysfunction, or a post-operative worsening of\r\nsCr > 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 umol/L).\r\nRecommendations for Peri-operative Renal Function\r\nand Fluid Status Management in Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients210, 220, 223, 232:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

In addition to the goal of\r\nachieving tight glycemic control, it is also imperative to avoid\r\ndangerous hypoglycemia. In a recent trial of intensive glucose\r\ncontrol (glucose target range 81-108 mg/dL) versus\r\nconventional control (glucose < 180 mg/dL) in 6104 medical\r\nintensive care patients found that the higher mortality rate in\r\nthe intensive control was attributable to hypoglycemic\r\nevents.237 Many protocols include a concomitant dextrose\r\ninfusion to minimize this risk. Although no randomized trials\r\nsupport the use of one protocol over another, a review of 12\r\nregimens has shown that while 238 target ranges for blood\r\nglucose are variable, levels < 200 mg/dL are consistently\r\nassociated with reduced surgical site infections.239\r\nDiabetics should be monitored for the development of\r\ndiabetic ketoacidosis, because even Type II diabetics may\r\ndevelop ketosis in the setting of stress such as surgery.\r\nAs a general rule, oral hypoglycemics should be\r\ndiscontinued pre-operatively and not used in the immediate\r\npost-operative period as they may be associated with\r\ncomplications such as lactic acidosis (metformin), or fluid\r\nretention (thiazolidinediones).240 The oral hypoglycemics may\r\nbe safely re-introduced during the first week after HT when\r\nglucose levels have become stable. Insulin-dependent\r\ndiabetics should be converted back to intermittent\r\nsubcutaneous insulin when it is safe to do so.\r\nRecommendations for the Peri-operative\r\nManagement of Hyperglycemia in Heart Transplant\r\nRecipient234, 238:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

It is\r\nimportant to recognize that antimicrobial regimens should be\r\ntailored to the pathogens prevaling in the transplant center. For\r\nexample, if a hospital has a high incidence of aspergillosis in\r\nthe ICU, it might be appropriate for patients undergoing HT at\r\nthat institution to receive inhaled anti-fungal agents.\r\nRecommendations for Antibacterial\r\nProphylaxis/Treatment242:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

In\r\naddition, infants with an open chest and/or requiring ECMO\r\nsupport are a particularly high-risk group for invasive fungal\r\ninfection with a mortality of nearly 50\% within the Pediatric\r\nHeart Transplant Study.246 Therefore, it is common practice to\r\nuse an IV anti-fungal agent such as fluconazole for\r\nprophylaxis in this group. In addition, in a large multicenter\r\nregistry, Pneumocystis jiroveci has been shown to occur at a\r\nlow incidence of 1\% but associated with increased mortality,\r\nprimarily within the first year post-transplant.247 Therefore, it\r\nis common practice to continue prophylaxis for at least 3\r\nmonths and for up to 24 months after heart transplantation.\r\nRecommendations for Peri-operative Infection\r\nProphylaxis and Treatment in Pediatric Heart\r\nTransplant Recipients242-245:\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1.

This was first demonstrated by Patel\r\nand Terasaki, who documented poor survival of renal\r\nallografts in recipients whose serum caused lysis of donor\r\nleukocytes in an in vitro crossmatch test.248 This cell lysis was\r\nlater proven to be due to the presence of alloantibodies in the\r\nrecipientâ€™s serum directed against donor HLA antigens.249\r\nSince then, various modifications of crossmatch testing, in\r\nwhich recipientâ€™s serum is combined with donor cells, have\r\nbeen routinely used to determine donor-recipient\r\ncompatibility. The crossmatch test helps clinicians avoid\r\ntransplantation of an organ into a recipient with donor specific\r\nantibodies.\r\nMethods for the Detection of Anti-HLA Antibodies\r\nThe detection of anti-HLA antibodies requires the\r\nrecipientâ€™s serum as the source of â€œunknownâ€� anti-HLA\r\nantibodies and cells or materials bearing â€œknownâ€� HLA\r\nantigens. These panel reactive antibody (PRA) tests, which\r\ndetermine the percentage of possible donor HLA antigens\r\ntargeted by the recipientâ€™s preformed circulating antibodies, is\r\nroutinely used to assess the likelihood of a recipient to reject a\r\ndonor organ (Table 4).\r\nThe target HLA antigens may be constitutively expressed\r\nantigens on the cell membranes of T-cells (Class I HLA\r\nantigens) and of B cells (Class I and II HLA antigens).\r\nAntibodies directed against these antigens may be detected in\r\na number of ways:\r\n(1) The complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) method\r\nevaluates target (donor) cell lysis occurring in the\r\npresence of antibody-antigen complex and complement\r\nactivation and it is detected by the addition of a dye that\r\npenetrates only into the lysed cells. This method has been\r\nfor the most part superseded by flow-cytometry\r\ntechniques.\r\n(2) Complement-independent flow-cytometry enables the\r\ndetection of the primary anti-HLA antibody after target\r\n(donor) cells are incubated with the recipientâ€™s serum and\r\na secondary fluorescent-labeled antiglobulin (AHG).\r\nTable 4 Panel-Reactive Antibody and Crossmatch Methods Among\r\n20 Histocompatibility Laboratories\r\nMethod Description PRA (\%) XM (n)\r\nCDC with T lymphocytes without AHG 8 9\r\nCDC with T lymphocytes with AHG 15 12\r\nCDC with B lymphocytes without AHG 8 10\r\nCDC with B lymphocytes with AHG 5 5\r\nFlow Cytometry with T lymphocytes 3 12\r\nFlow Cytometry with B lymphocytes 1 11\r\nFlow beads with Class I antigens 7 -\r\nFlow beads with Class II antigens 2 -\r\nELISA with Class I antigens 7\r\nELISA with Class II antigens 5\r\nAHG, anti-human globulin; CDC, complement-dependent\r\ncytotoxicity; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay;\r\nn, number of programs using the indicated technique; PRA,\r\npanel-reactive antibody; XM, crossmatch methods.\r\nAdapted from Betkowski AS, et al.250\r\nBriefly, these PRA tests consist of adding the recipientâ€™s\r\nserum to HLA-antigen-bearing cells (lymphocytes) obtained\r\nfrom a panel of random individuals from the local population\r\n(usually 30-60) who are felt to be representative of the\r\npotential donor pool. The PRA result represents the percentage\r\nof the panel of cells which undergo lysis in the presence of the\r\nrecipientâ€™s serum. This PRA measurement does not specify the\r\nHLA antigens against which the recipient has antibodies; it\r\nsimply estimates the percentage of the local donor pool that\r\nwill be incompatible. At most transplantation centers a percent\r\nPRA â‰¥10\% is the threshold above which virtual or real time\r\nprospective crossmatch should be done to determine if the\r\nrecipient antibodies are actually directed against donor tissue\r\n(see below).250 The correlation between preformed antibodies\r\ndirected against HLA antigens and poor outcomes after HT\r\nhas been demonstrated with both cytotoxicity and flow\r\ncytometry methods.251 In both these cell-based assays,\r\nrecipient antibodies not specific for donor HLA antigens may\r\nalso bind to target cells and cause their lysis. The CDC assay\r\nrequires larger amounts of blood for antibody screening than\r\ncomplement-independent assays, an important consideration\r\nin pediatric HT candidates.\r\n(3) Solid-phase assays permit identification of specific HLAantibodies\r\nbecause individual HLA antigens are mounted \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 24\r\nonto an artificial support such as plastic plates for ELISA,\r\nmicrobeads for flow cytometry or the multiplex platform\r\nLuminex.\r\nThe common denominator of these methods is the\r\npresence of a high-affinity, clinically available anti-IgG\r\nantibody coupled with an enzyme which produces a\r\nassist support devices\r\ncolorimetric reaction when exposed to specific substrates\r\n(ELISA) or fluorochromes (flow cytometry).\r\nEvaluation of antibody specificity using panels of cells\r\ncan be difficult, especially in highly sensitized patients, even\r\nafter cumbersome adsorption/elution techniques to remove\r\nnon-HLA antibodies. Furthermore, the HLA types on the\r\npanel cells used for screening should reflect the antigenic\r\nfrequency in the regional population of the transplant center.\r\nThe availability of single antigen-coated plates/beads greatly\r\nfacilitates the evaluation of antibody specificity. In highly\r\nsensitized recipients, these assays can provide valuable\r\ninformation regarding the specific HLA antigens not targeted\r\nby recipient antibodies and therefore considered acceptable\r\ndonor/recipient pairs.\r\nThe availability of single-antigen assays also permits the\r\nidentification of rare or infrequently expressed HLA antigens.\r\nFor example, the less recognized anti-HLA class II DP\r\nalloantibodies may mediate chronic humoral rejection in renal\r\ntransplant recipients.252 In addition, solid-phase PRA tests\r\nenable one to distinguish a positive cytotoxic result due to\r\nbinding of anti-HLA antibodies to HLA antigens from cell\r\nlysis due to binding of antibodies to non-HLA molecules also\r\nexpressed on the surface of T and B cells.251 It is important to\r\nnote that solid-phase assays can be altered by various\r\npreparations containing HLA-Ab (IV Ig) or non-HLA\r\nantibodies (antiplastic-antibodies, especially in patients with\r\nhemodialysis or MCS).\r\nIdeally more than 1 PRA screening method should be\r\nperformed on more than 1 occasion (separated by at least 2\r\nweeks) for accurate assessment of the recipientâ€™\r\nallosensitization status.252 The number of patients at risk for\r\ndeveloping antibodies against donorsâ€™ HLA antigens is\r\nincreasing due to previous transplants, use of homograft\r\nmaterials in cardiac surgery, exposure to paternal HLA\r\nantigens during pregnancy and transfusion of blood products.\r\nAlthough the use of MCS devices may be associated with\r\nelevated PRA levels, the antibodies which develop in this\r\nsetting may not be directed against HLA antigens and the\r\ncrossmatch may be negative.252There is no universally\r\naccepted definition of a PRA threshold above which a real\r\ntime or virtual prospective crossmatch should be done.250\r\nIn a real-time prospective crossmatch, the donorâ€™s\r\nlymphocytes are directly exposed to the recipientâ€™s serum and\r\nobserved for lysis prior to accepting the donor for transplant.\r\nReal-time prospective crossmatch cannot be prospectively\r\nperformed in the absence of readily available donor cells or\r\nwhen a short organ ischemia time is essential for successful\r\ntransplantation. This is the case in HT, particularly when the\r\ndonor heart is geographically distant from the recipientâ€™s\r\nhospital. The predominant practice has been to accept only\r\norgans from local donors for immunologically sensitized HT\r\ncandidates (candidates with serum antibodies directed against\r\nHLA antigens), so that a prospective donor/recipient\r\ncrossmatch can be performed. The need for a prospective\r\ncrossmatch limits the pool of potential donors, and thus results\r\nin longer waiting times, and higher waiting list mortality\r\nwhile.253-255 As described above, assays that use HLA antigencoated\r\nsolid-phase matrices are capable of identifying HLAspecific\r\nantibodies with high sensitivity and accuracy.\r\n256\r\nThese methods have been used to predict immune\r\ncompatibility between donor and recipient by comparing the\r\npotential recipientâ€™s HLA-specific antibodies with the HLA\r\ntype of the prospective donor, an approach called the virtual\r\ncrossmatch.257 The use of the virtual crossmatch in kidney\r\nallocation is currently being debated.258, 259 Thus far, in kidney\r\ntransplantation the availability of virtual crossmatch has not\r\neliminated the need for a serologic prospective crossmatch. If\r\nthis demonstrates donor/recipient incompatibility, the organ is\r\nreallocated to a different recipient.257\r\nRecommendations for the Evaluation of\r\nDonor/Recipient Histocompatibility250-253, 255, 256, 259:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

The virtual crossmatch, which compares recipient antiHLA\r\nantibody specificities with donor HLA antigens,\r\nshould be routinely used to increase the donor pool for\r\nsensitized recipients.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nRisk-Assessment and Prophylaxis Strategies for\r\nAllosensitized Heart Transplant Candidates\r\nPre-transplant Strategies for Sensitized Patients\r\nSeveral therapeutic regimens have been used to reduce\r\nallosensitization before HT or to treat antibody-mediated\r\nrejection (AMR). These therapies, however, have not been\r\ntested in randomized, controlled clinical trials. The two main\r\nstrategies that have been employed to reduce allosensitization\r\ninclude high-dose IV immunoglobulin (IV Ig) and\r\nplasmapheresis (PP) combined with IV Ig or low-dose CMV\r\nhyperimmune globulin (CMVIg). There are several agents and\r\ninterventions that can augment the potency of these treatment\r\nmodalities, including splenectomy, anti-CD20 antibody\r\ntherapy, and clinically available immunosuppressive\r\nmodalities (Table 2).252\r\nHigh-dose IV Ig\r\nThe initial mechanism of action of IV Ig may be\r\nneutralization/elimination of preformed antibodies by antiidiotypic\r\nantibodies present in IV Ig. The IV Ig is believed to\r\ndiminish circulating antibodies levels, to inhibit B-cell\r\nantibody synthesis and to attenuate complement-mediated\r\nendothelial cell injury. This treatment modality can be used to\r\ndesensitize patients waiting for transplantation or used postoperatively\r\nfor treatment of AMR, is easily administered and\r\nis less expensive than plasmapheresis. Treatment with IV Ig\r\ndoes not uniformly reduce allosensitization, requires\r\nadministration of a large volume of fluid, results in a less rapid\r\nantibody removal than plasmapheresis and effectiveness varies\r\nfrom batch to batch. Its effectiveness has not been proven in\r\nassist support devices\r\n\r\npatients with a high titer of donor specific antibodies. In\r\naddition for a period of time after IV Ig administration donor\r\nspecific antibody levels must be determined with alternative\r\nmethods. The IV Ig is given at a dose of 2 g/kg over 4 hours\r\nand this dose is repeated monthly 4 times.\r\nPlasmapheresis\r\nPlasmapheresis rapidly reduces anti-HLA or isoagglutinin\r\nantibodies levels. This reduction permits immunomodulation\r\nat a lower IV Ig dose and induces donor-specific\r\nunresponsiveness. Plasmapheresis has predictable kinetics, is\r\neffective in patients with high donor-specific antibodies titers,\r\nwhich can be easily monitored during therapy. The long-term\r\neffectiveness of plasmapheresis is limited by the recurrence of\r\ndonor-specific antibodies if transplant does not immediately\r\nfollow this desensitization therapy. Performance of\r\nplasmapheresis requires central access and the procedure is\r\nexpensive.\r\nPlasmapheresis with Low-dose CMVIg\r\nThis procedure may be considered for patients requiring\r\nurgent transplantation both pre-and post-operatively. Each\r\nplasmapheresis session is followed by the administration of\r\nCMVIg at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Inadequate availability of\r\nCMVIg limits the delivery of this therapy.\r\nAnti-CD20 (Rituximab)\r\nThe use of rituximab results in rapid and sustained\r\nablation of the B cell compartment, but it has no effect on\r\nplasma cells or on circulating antibody levels. Rituximab\r\ninhibits CD-20+\r\n B-cells proliferation and induces apoptosis in\r\nthese cells by antibody- and complement-dependent\r\ncytotoxicity. Circulating antibodies levels may be more\r\neffectively reduced when rituximab is combined with\r\nplasmapheresis or IV Ig. Rituximab can be used pre- and postoperatively,\r\nis generally well tolerated and it associated with\r\nlittle toxicity. Rituximab does not eliminate plasma cells in the\r\nspleen and bone marrow, it cannot independently reduce\r\ndonor-specific antibody titers, it may have immunosuppressive\r\neffects which persist for months and it is very costly.\r\nRituximab is given at a dose of 375 mg/m2\r\n weekly for four\r\nweeks and its effects are monitored with the performance of\r\nCD-20+ cell count in the peripheral blood.260 Reconstitution of\r\nnormal B cells typically begins 6 to 9 months after termination\r\nof rituximab.\r\nImmunoabsorption\r\nThis therapy removes IgG 1, 2, and 4 subclasses, but not\r\nthe complement-binding IgG3. Immunoabsorption can be\r\ncarried out pre- and post-operatively and it is effective in\r\npatients with high donor-specific antibodies titers, which can\r\nbe easily monitored during and after therapy. Therapy is\r\ncontinued until IgG and PRA levels have been significantly\r\nreduced compared to baseline. The disadvantages of\r\nimmunosabsorption include a high cost and an increased risk\r\nof infections. This modality is generally not totally effective\r\nwhen used alone.\r\nSplenectomy\r\nSplenectomy, which can now be performed with\r\nminimally invasive techniques, is associated with a reduction\r\nin plasma cells and precursor B cells. It may produce more \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 26\r\neffective antibody reduction when combined with\r\nplasmapheresis or IV Ig. The main limitations of splenectomy\r\nare its inability to independently reduce donor-specific\r\nantibodies titers and the life-long risks of sepsis from\r\nencapsulated bacteria.258\r\nTable 5 Examples of Desensitization Therapies\r\nTherapy Dose Frequency\r\nPlasmapheresis (A, F) 1.5 volume exchanges (A) 5 consecutive days\r\n(B) 5 times, every other day\r\n(C) 2-3 times/week until transplant\r\n(D) 5 times, every other day, every\r\n2-4 weeks\r\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IV\r\nIg)\r\n(A, B) 2g/kg IV divided over 2 days\r\n(C) 2-3 g/kg IV divided over 4 days\r\n(D) 0.1 mg/kg IV\r\n(E) 100 mg/kg IV\r\n(F) 20 g (of 10\% IV Ig)\r\n(G) 150 g (of 10\% IV Ig) divided over 3 rounds\r\n(A) Every 2-4 weeks\r\n(D) Every 2-4 weeks\r\n(E) Every 4 weeks\r\n(G) Every 4 weeks\r\nRituximab (A) 1g IV\r\n(C, E) 375 mg/m2\r\n(G) 500 mg\r\n(A) Weekly x 4\r\n(C) x 2 doses\r\n(E) Weekly x 4\r\n(G) Every 2 weeks\r\nCyclophosphamide\r\n(used in the past)\r\n(A) 1 mg/kg orally\r\n(C) 0.5 mg-g/m2\r\n(D) 1 mg/kg orally\r\n(A) daily\r\n(A) UCLA; (B) Stanford University; (C) University of Maryland; (D) University of Toronto; (E) University of Wisconsin; (F) Loyola\r\nUniversity Chicago; (G) University of Berlin.\r\nAdapted from Kobashigawa J, et al.252\r\nRecommendations for the Risk-Assessment and\r\nProphylaxis Strategies for Allosensitized Heart\r\nTransplant Candidates252, 260:\r\n(See Table 5)\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

The presence of anti-HLA antibodies is\r\nregularly monitored in allosensitized patients undergoing\r\ndesensitizing therapies until a compatible heart allograft\r\nbecomes available.250 In ambulatory, non-sensitized HT\r\nassist support devices\r\ncandidates, it is reasonable to screen for anti-HLA antibodies\r\nevery 6 months. In HT candidates requiring blood\r\ntransfusions, anti-HLA antibody level determination should be\r\nrepeated 2 to 4 weeks later and prospective donor recipient\r\ncrossmatch is required if a suitable donor organ becomes\r\navailable in the interim period. No uniform recommendations\r\nexist as to the frequency of antibody monitoring after an\r\ninfection or during MCS (Table 3).\r\nAs stated in the section pertaining to desensitization\r\ntherapies, circulating immunoglobulins are measured before\r\nand after immunoabsorption and plasmapheresis, and\r\nlymphocyte subpopulations before and after the use of\r\nrituximab.\r\nIn addition to the post-operative retrospective crossmatch,\r\ndonor-specific antibodies levels should be obtained when\r\nAMR is suspected or confirmed by EMB.\r\nAlthough some reports suggest a correlation between\r\nincreased levels of soluble HLA class I molecules (sHLA-I)\r\nand HT rejection, their determination is not routinely done in\r\nthe clinical setting.261\r\nMeasurement of donor-specific antibodies level should be\r\ndone if the finding of positive C4D staining in EMB tissue\r\nsuggests the presence of AMR.261 In addition, monitoring\r\ndonor-specific class I and class II HLA antibodies after\r\ntransplantation has been used as a diagnostic/prognostic tool\r\nfor AMR.254, 258\r\nRecommendations for Monitoring of\r\nAllosensitization Status of Heart Transplant\r\nCandidates and Recipients250, 252, 260:\r\n(Table 6)\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1.

It is characterized by a cytotoxic\r\ncomplement mediated antibody reaction and most often occurs\r\nin the setting of preformed antibodies directed against epitopes\r\nof the HLA system or ABO system. Allosensitized patients\r\nwho are sensitized may avoid hyperacute rejection by\r\ndesensitization strategies (described above) and, most\r\ncommonly, by acceptance only of donors with â€œacceptable\r\nantigensâ€� and/or low level or â€œweakâ€� antibody responses.\r\nDespite manoeuvres to avoid hyperacute rejection sensitized\r\nrecipients have a lower survival than those with PRA < 10\%\r\nand appear to experience delayed AMR associated with\r\nelevated titers of donor specific antibodies.252\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 28\r\nTable 6 Panel-Reactive Antibody Screening Frequency After Original Assessment\r\nNumber of heart transplant centers screening at each interval\r\nPRA 1 mon 2 mon 3 mon 4-6 mon 1 year Variable SE Other Total\r\nNegative 10 2 8 16 7 4 16 2 65\r\nPositive 33 8 6 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . 65\r\nPRA, panel-reactive antibody; SE, sensitizing events.\r\nAdapted from Betkowski AS, et al.250\r\nAcute AMR is observed in allosensitized patients and is\r\nassociated with inferior HT survival. The incidence may be up\r\nto 15\% in the first year after HT and the clinical presentation\r\nhas no pathognomonic features. Histological features include\r\nmyocardial capillary injury with endothelial-cell swelling and\r\nintravascular macrophage accumulation. If these pathologic\r\nabnormalities occur in the presence of unexplained HT\r\ndysfunction, with or without symptoms of hemodynamic\r\ncompromise, immunostaining can be performed to look for\r\ncapillary deposition of immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM and/or\r\nIgA) plus complement (C3d, C4d and/or C1q) by\r\nimmunofluorescence on frozen sections, CD68 staining of\r\nmacrophages within capillaries (CD31- or CD34-positive) by\r\nimmunohistochemistry, and C4d staining of capillaries by\r\nparaffin immunohistochemistry.262\r\nIt is recommended that patients with hemodynamic\r\ncompromise undergo assessment for circulating antibodies.\r\nAlthough screening is not currently advocated, every EMB\r\nshould undergo histologic evaluation for features suggestive of\r\nAMR. If these are seen, the diagnosis of AMR should be\r\nconfirmed via immunohistochemistry, either\r\nimmunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase, using antibodies\r\ndirected against CD68, CD31, and C4d, and a serum sample\r\nshould be tested for donor-specific antibodies. If these markers\r\nare positive, a diagnosis of AMR can be made. Patients who\r\nhave several episodes of documented AMR should be\r\nevaluated with at least 1 of these immunohistochemical\r\nmethods in each EMB and monitored for the production of\r\ndonor-specific antibodies. It is also recognized that acute\r\ncellular rejection and AMR can co-exist, but further studies\r\nare needed to determine the frequency and clinical\r\nsignificance of this finding.262\r\nTreatment of Antibody-mediated Rejection\r\nRecommendations for the Treatment of AntibodyMediated\r\nRejection252, 263:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Initial therapy of AMR can include immunoadsorption\r\nand CS or plasmapheresis/low dose of IV Ig and CS.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Rituximab can be added to reduce the risk of recurrent\r\nrejection.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n3. Changes in therapy that can be considered for\r\nmaintenance immunosuppression in patients who\r\nexperience AMR can include switch to tacrolimus (TAC)\r\nin patients receiving cyclosporine (CYA)-based\r\nimmunosuppression, increased doses of mycophenolate\r\nmofetil (MMF) and CS.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nAllosensitization in Pediatric Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients\r\nThe frequency of HLA sensitization is increasing in the\r\npediatric population due to the greater number of patients with\r\ncomplex congenital heart disease undergoing palliative\r\nsurgical procedures with exposure to blood products and\r\nvalved or non-valved allograft materials. These can induce a\r\nstrong HLA class I and class II antibody response that can\r\npersist for up to 8 years after allograft implantation.242, 264, 265\r\nIn addition, the increasing application of pediatric MCS\r\ntechnology for end-stage heart failure has led to an\r\nunprecedented occurrence of allosensitization in children with\r\ncardiomyopathy.243\r\nThe requirement of a negative prospective crossmatch in\r\ncritically ill children can negatively impact survival because it\r\ninevitably prolongs the waiting time for a donor organ. A\r\nretrospective analysis of HT candidates since 1990 (n=252),\r\nfor which CDC allo-antibodies data were available,\r\ndemonstrated that allosensitization influences both pre- and\r\npost-HT outcomes.244 Of 252 subjects, 38 (15\%) had preoperative\r\nallosensitization, defined as a PRA > 10\%. At 1 year\r\nafter listing, sensitized subjects had a hgher mortality than\r\nnon-sensitized subjects (22\% vs. 8.4\% p=0.055). Survival at\r\nall time points after listing (regardless of transplantation) was\r\nworse for sensitized subjects (p = 0.04).\r\nAlthough no statistically significant differences in postoperative\r\ngraft or patient survival were noted, allosensitization \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 29\r\nbefore HT was associated with decreased freedom from CAV\r\n(hazard ratio 2.76, 95\% confidence interval 1.18 to 6.45;\r\np = 0.019). Because of the high wait-list mortality for\r\nsensitized pediatric HT recipients, protocols for peri-operative\r\nantibody removal without a prospective crossmatch have been\r\ndeveloped and utilized in some centers with reasonable\r\nsuccess. In 31 pediatric procedures, HT recipients with a\r\npositive CDC crossmatch, the median B- and T-cell PRA\r\nwere, respectively, 76\% and 52\%. Almost 50\% of the\r\nrecipients were older than 1 year of age at HT. Therapies in\r\nmost cases were intra-operative plasma exchange/\r\nplasmapheresis, post-HT plasmapheresis, and drug therapy\r\nusing TAC, MMF, CS, and IV Ig. Survival rates at 1 year\r\nwere 84\%, and probability of survival at 3 and 5 years were,\r\nrespectively, 79\%, and 70\%, similar to the overall US\r\ntransplant survival rates (www.unos.org). More than 70\% of\r\nthe subjects experienced acute rejection events. However, the\r\nfrequency of rejection with hemodynamic compromise varied\r\nwidely (0-60\%) between centers. Most acute rejection\r\nepisodes developed early, and C4d or C3d positivity generally\r\ndisappeared after the first few months. Evaluation of incidence\r\nof CAV is ongoing, but survivors have normal graft function.\r\nAge did not influence outcomes.245, 266\r\nData on the impact of desensitization strategies are even\r\nmore limited in the pediatric than in the adult population.\r\nResults of desensitization procedures in children remain\r\ninconclusive, because antigenic stimuli, such as devices and\r\nallograft materials remain in place during therapy. Given the\r\ninability to predict the timing of donor organ availability, the\r\npotential morbidities associated with the available\r\ndesensitization therapies and the acceptable intermediate\r\noutcomes of HT despite a positive crossmatch, most centers\r\ndo not practice desensitization strategies in highly sensitized\r\npediatric patients.\r\nRecommendations for the Approach to\r\nAllosensitization in Pediatric Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients244, 245, 266:\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1.

This small\r\npool has provided compelling motivation to challenge\r\nprevious mandates against the usage of certain donors, such as\r\nthose of incompatible blood groups.267\r\nAmong potential HT candidates, infants are particularly\r\nsuited for this approach because of an immature immune\r\nsystem that precludes T-cell independent responses.268 Taking\r\nadvantage of this natural lag in immune responsiveness, the\r\nToronto group reported a protocol in which infants\r\nintentionally received ABO-incompatible heart allografts.\r\nNone of the infants received aggressive pre-operative\r\nimmunosuppression for antibody removal, and those who had\r\npositive antibody titers underwent plasma exchange using the\r\nCPB circuit at the time of HT. Short-term outcomes were\r\nexcellent, without a single patient developing hyperacute\r\nrejection.269 Since the original report, centers have\r\nincreasingly adopted the practice of ABO-incompatible HT\r\nwith short-term results similar to those of the original Toronto\r\ncohort.270-275 At the present time, intermediate-term results\r\nappear equivalent to those reported for ABO compatible\r\npediatric HT recipients.271, 276\r\nThe safety and feasibility of pediatric ABO-incompatible\r\nHT with the use of intra-operative plasma exchange has been\r\nestablished.269 This strategy improved the likelihood of HT\r\nand reduced infant waiting list mortality.271, 275, 277 These data\r\nled to a UNOS policy change in September 2006 allowing the\r\nlisting for HT of infants across the ABO blood group\r\nbarrier.278\r\nFor neonates and infants undergoing ABO-incompatible\r\nHT, in addition to the routine peri-operative management,\r\nfurther attention must be paid to issues related to blood\r\nproduct transfusion. Every effort must be made to avoid blood\r\nproducts that may contain donor-specific antibodies, as this\r\nmay lead to AMR.\r\nPatient Selection\r\nassist support devices\r\nSuitability for ABO-incompatible HT is ultimately based\r\non the stage of immunologic maturation of the candidate at the\r\ntime of evaluation. While age may correlate with the time of\r\ndevelopment of isohemagglutins, it is the titers of these\r\nantibodies that become critical in patient selection. There are\r\nseveral reports in the literature of successful ABO-\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 30\r\nincompatible HT beyond the infancy period in patients who\r\nwere 2, 3.5, and 5 years of age and who lacked\r\nisohemagglutinins.270, 279 However, age itself is clearly not the\r\nprimary risk indicator, and serves only as a surrogate marker\r\nfor an individualâ€™s ability to produce isohemagglutinins. Even\r\nfor infants who have begun to produce isohemagglutinins, the\r\nabsolute titer above which HT is contraindicated remains\r\nunclear. Successful HT even in children with donor-specific\r\nisohemagglutinin titers as high as 1:64 has been reported.271\r\nFive patients in the Toronto cohort with pre-operative\r\nisohemagglutinin titers ranging from 1:8 to 1:128 underwent\r\nsuccessful HT without AMR and minimal re-accumulation of\r\nanti-donor antibodies after HT. Therefore, the absolute upper\r\nlimit of age or isohemagglutinin titers remain unclear.\r\nRecommendations for the Selection of Candidates\r\nfor ABO â€œIncompatibleâ€� Heart Transplant269, 271:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

The CPB circuit is\r\nprimed with plasma as appropriate for the particular donorrecipient\r\nblood group combination (Table 7). Approximately 2\r\nto 3 times the total body plasma volume is exchanged during\r\nthe initiation of CPB to remove donor-specific\r\nisohemagglutinins, which are remeasured before the release of\r\nthe aortic cross-clamp to ensure a negative or low donorspecific\r\ntiter (<1:4). With the utilization of pre-operative\r\nplasma exchange, there have been no reported cases of\r\nhyperacute rejection.\r\nRecommendation for the Intra-operative Care of\r\nABO â€œIncompatibleâ€� Heart Transplant Recipients269,\r\n271:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. ABO-incompatible HT can be undertaken by performing\r\nplasma exchange using the CPB circuit to remove donorspecific\r\nisohemmaglutinins.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Plasma exchange using the CPB circuit allows the safe\r\ntransplantation of ABO-incompatible organs without the\r\nneed of aggressive pre-operative immunosuppressive\r\ntherapies or splenectomy.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nIsohemagglutinins and Their Follow-up\r\nTiters of isohemagglutinins are measured with standard\r\nagglutination tests.269-272, 280 Isohemagglutinins should be\r\nmeasured at progressively longer intervals in the early postoperative\r\nperiod. ABO-incompatible heart transplant\r\nrecipients who develop rising titers of isohemagglutinins postoperatively\r\nshould be assessed for evidence of graft\r\ndysfunction (e.g., hemodynamics, echocardiography, biopsy\r\nas per institutional protocol, and/or clinical suspicion). In the\r\nshort-term, most patients do not develop rising titers of\r\nisohemagglutinins. In the few that do, concern and/or evidence\r\nfor AMR have been very rare.

It is estimated that blood transfusions are needed in\r\n80\% of all cardiac surgery patients. Nearly 15\% of all blood\r\nproducts in the US are used in association with cardiac\r\nsurgery.284, 285 Of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 20\%\r\nare prone to peri-operative hemostatic abnormalities that\r\nrequire surgical revision in 2\% to 6\% of all patients.286-289\r\nassist support devices\r\nCardiac surgery-related factors that contribute to\r\ncoagulopathies include platelet consumption and dysfunction,\r\nhemodilution with consumption of clotting factors,\r\nhypothermia, activation of the inflammatory cascade, and\r\nfibrinolysis.290 Different studies consistently find advanced\r\nage, increased pre-operative sCr level, small body surface\r\narea, emergency surgery, low temperature during CPB,\r\nassist support devices\r\nduration of extracorporeal circulation (> 150 minutes),\r\ncombined valvular revascularization surgery, number of\r\nbypass grafts (â‰¥ 5), reoperative surgery, and pre-operative\r\nantiplatelet therapy to be risk factors for bleeding in cardiac\r\nsurgery.285, 286, 289, 291-293\r\nCoagulopathy in Heart Transplantation\r\nHT recipients have additional risk factors for perioperative\r\nbleeding including recipientâ€™s coagulopathy, need\r\nfor repeat median sternotomy, and a prolonged CPB.294\r\nVarious factors contribute to a recipientâ€™s coagulopathy. First,\r\nmany patients are on anticoagulation pre-operatively for poor\r\nLV function, AF, mechanical valves, or MCS. In the pediatric\r\npopulation, patients with complex congenital heart disease\r\nafter multiple corrective procedures with or without allograft\r\nmaterial, patients being transplanted from ECMO, and\r\nchronically cyanotic patients with extensive collaterals are\r\noften very challenging in terms of peri-operative hemostasis.\r\nHepatic or renal dysfunction associated with heart failure can\r\nalso contribute to coagulopathies. Amiodarone-treated HT\r\nrecipients have greater peri-operative bleeding.295 Many HT\r\nrecipients have greater bleeding because native heart\r\nexplantation is complicated by adhesions due to prior\r\nsurgeries.\r\nAs therapies for advanced heart failure evolve, a greater\r\nnumber of patients receive MCS as a bridge to HT. With the\r\nexception of the Jarvik VAD which is placed through a\r\nthoracotomy, most VADs are implanted through a sternotomy\r\nand the resulting scarring remains a major source of HT\r\nsurgical bleeding. In addition, except for patients with the\r\nHeartMate XVE, recipients of MCS require warfarin\r\nanticoagulation, which is intensified if VAD-related clotting\r\nproblems occur. However, in some retrospective studies, the\r\nuse of warfarin has not been shown to increase the risk of\r\noperative bleeding.296\r\nCoagulation\r\nBleeding in cardiac surgery can be broadly divided into 2\r\ncategories: surgical bleeding (at an anastomotic site, from a\r\nvessel, or at a suture line) or non-surgical bleeding\r\n(coagulopathy). This review is mainly focused on non-surgical\r\nbleeding. Hemostasis has been described in detail\r\nelsewhere.297, 298 Briefly, the coagulation cascade consists of\r\nan extrinsic system activated by a tissue factor\r\n(thromboplastin), an intrinsic system activated by contact with\r\nsurfaces, and a common pathway. The complexity of the\r\ncoagulation cascade is further enhanced by the discoveries of \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 33\r\ntissue factor expressing cells and platelets in a hemostatic\r\nprocess that include initiation, amplification and\r\npropagation.299 From the initial steps of homeostasis, both\r\nplatelets and coagulation activation are amplified. Thrombin is\r\na key activator of clotting through pathways that include\r\nplatelet activation and the formation of a fibrin clot as well as\r\nthe clot dissolving aspect with thrombomodulin and the\r\nrelease of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The final\r\nproduct of this cascade is thrombus at the site of vascular\r\ninjury, limitation of clot propagation, and a time delayed\r\nprocess of vessel recanalization.\r\nCoagulopathy With Cardiopulmonary Bypass\r\nIn cardiac surgery, the use of the extracorporeal surface of\r\nthe CPB circuit disrupts the normal homeostatic mechanisms\r\nthat maintain blood fluidity. During extracorporeal circulation,\r\na decrease of coagulation factors and platelets as well as an\r\nactivation of fibrinolysis is observed. First, the hemodilution\r\ncaused by priming of the extracorporeal circuit can contribute\r\nto this decrease. Further, there is activation and denaturation\r\nof these coagulant proteins by the artificial surfaces.\r\nThrombin, which is continuously generated during CPB, can\r\nbe measured intra-operatively despite administration of high\r\nheparin doses being administered.300-302 Platelets are activated\r\nby the thrombin, fibrinogen bound to the circuit, and the shear\r\nforces of contacting the surface. In addition, the circuit has no\r\nendothelial cells that normally continuously suppress platelets\r\nactivation. With activation during CPB, platelets become\r\nrefractory to subsequent stimuli and are dysfunctional after\r\nCPB.303-305 Approaches to reduce platelet activation include\r\ncontrolled use of suction, avoidance of air bubbles, and use of\r\nheparin-coated bypass materials or more biocompatible\r\nextracorporeal circuits. Further, pro-inflammatory proteins\r\nsuch as kallikrein and complement also become activated by\r\nthe extracorporeal circuit, which leads to the activation of\r\nleucocytes, endothelial cells and the systemic release of\r\ncytokines. This cascade results in inflammation that promotes\r\nabnormal hemostasis and increases the risk of multi-organ\r\nfailure.306\r\nFibrinolysis, also activated by CPB, ceases with\r\ndiscontinuation of the circuit. Perhaps increased fibrinolysis is\r\ninduced by the coagulation factors via activation of factor XII\r\nand thrombin which in turn stimulate the release of tissue\r\nplasminogen activator from the endothelium.\r\nHypothermia can also alter the clotting mechanisms.\r\nChanges in platelet aggregation in patients undergoing\r\nhypothermic CPB at 27Â°C to 28Â°C have been seen.307-309\r\nassist support devices\r\nConventional tests of the hemostatic mechanisms are done at\r\n37 C, which limits the detection of some of the clotting defects\r\nduring hypothermia.\r\nThus, IV heparin is used to prevent the catastrophic\r\nclotting that can occur in an extracorporeal circuit. Heparin is\r\na heterogeneous glycosaminoglycan closely related to the\r\nendogenous heparan present on the surface of endothelial cells\r\nand in the extracellular matrix. This compound binds to\r\nantithrombin with high affinity. This complex results in a\r\nthousand-fold increase in binding affinity to thrombin and\r\nfactor Xa.310 High-dose heparin (300 to 400 U/kg) is routinely\r\nused to anticoagulate patients before initiation of CPB.\r\nHeparin dosing has been empirically established from the\r\nactivated clotting time (ACT) as the dose at which clotting no\r\nlonger occurs in the circuitry.311 Thus, many surgical teams\r\nstrive to keep an ACT > 400 seconds even though lower levels\r\nmay be effective.312 The main advantage of heparin is that its\r\nanticoagulant effects can be reversed with the use of\r\nprotamine, which combines with heparin into a complex\r\ndevoid of anticoagulant effects. The efficacy is dependent on\r\nthe heparin-protamine ratio of 1:1 to 1:3. High doses of\r\nprotamine can cause inhibition of coagulation and platelet\r\naggregation and can paradoxically increase the risk of\r\nbleeding.313 In addition, rapid injection of protamine can cause\r\nhistamine release and hypotension. It can also produce lifethreatening\r\npulmonary hypertension. Thus, minimization of\r\nprotamine dosage is preferred. The ACT is used to gauge\r\nreversal of heparin effects. The goal is usually to achieve a\r\nlevel < 130 seconds or within 10\% of the pre-CPB value.\r\nTesting to Evaluate Hemostasis in Cardiac Surgery\r\nPre-operative evaluation of hemostasis must include\r\nknowledge of the patientâ€™s renal and hepatic function and\r\ntreatment with platelet inhibitors and oral anticoagulants. Preoperative\r\nevaluation should include determination of the\r\nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin\r\ntime (PT).314 This evaluation, however, falls short of\r\naccurately predicting the risk of bleeding with cardiac\r\nsurgery315, 316 and of detecting defects of primary hemostasis,\r\nsuch as von Willebrand disease and platelet dysfunction.286\r\nAt a minimum, intra-operative assessment of hemostasis\r\nshould include measurement of ACT due to its ability to\r\nmonitor high heparin concentrations used during CPB.\r\nLimitations of ACT testing include variability of\r\ncommercially available devices and alterations in values with\r\nthe administration of aprotinin. The use of\r\nthromboelastography, which measures the physical strength of\r\nthe fibrin clot during the coagulation process, has been shown\r\nto improve diagnosis of intra-operative bleeding and to reduce\r\nthe need for blood transfusions.317-320 However, pre-operative \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 34\r\nthromboelastography has limited ability to predict blood loss\r\nduring cardiac surgery.\r\nPlatelet function is the other important determinant of\r\noperative bleeding. Platelet counts > 100,000/uL are generally\r\nconsidered adequate for surgical hemostasis. Although platelet\r\naggregometry is the â€œgold-standardâ€� test of platelet function,\r\neasier point of care assays, such as the one using the platelet\r\nfunction analyzer-100 (PFA-100) are typically employed\r\nduring cardiac surgery. In these assays, whole blood is used to\r\ntest the time required for platelets to plug a hole in a collagencoated\r\ncartridge through which blood is forced to flow. The\r\nability of these assays to predict the risk of intra-operative\r\nbleeding is uncertain.319, 321, 322\r\nTests of fibrinolysis include fibrinogen levels and Ddimer\r\nvalues. Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin in\r\nroute to becoming a clot. Levels can be directly measured,\r\nwith normal values being in the range of 150 to 400 mg/dL. A\r\nfibrinogen level > 100 mg/dL is adequate for hemostasis.\r\nFibrinolysis is a process in which plasmin cleaves cross-linked\r\nfibrin to produce dimeric units (D-dimer). Values of D-dimer\r\nvalues correlate with the level of fibrinolysis present in the\r\nsurgical patient and with the risk of bleeding after cardiac\r\nsurgery.323\r\nMost tests of hemostasis have not been evaluated in\r\nrandomized clinical trials. Assay values considered significant\r\nare derived from clinical bleeding but not specifically from\r\nthat occurring during cardiac surgery.\r\nRecommendations for the Evaluation of Hemostasis\r\nin Heart Transplant Recipients314:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

Fibrinogen levels and D-Dimer values should be\r\nmeasured post-operatively because these are tests of\r\nfibrinolysis and correlate with the risk of bleeding after\r\nHT surgery.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n4. Thromboelastography may be repeated after HT surgery\r\nto monitor patientsâ€™ hemostasis.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nReversal of Anticoagulation before Heart\r\nTransplantation\r\nIn patients chronically anticoagulated with warfarin\r\nundergoing cardiac surgery, including HT, the risk of bleeding\r\nis likely to be increased when the international normalized\r\nratio (INR) is â‰¥ 1.5. Therefore, it is reasonable to reduce the\r\nINR to this level at the time of surgery.324 Several therapies\r\nare available for the reversal of oral anticoagulation, and these\r\ninclude oral or IV vitamin K, human fresh frozen plasma\r\n(FFP), prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), and\r\nrecombinant active factor VII (rFVIIa).325 Vitamin K alone is\r\ninappropriate if rapid normalization of the INR is required,\r\nbecause the onset of action is 4 to 6 hours after IV\r\nadministration and at least 24 hours after oral\r\nadministration.324 Therefore, when rapid reversal of warfarin\r\nis needed, vitamin K at doses of 2.5 to 5 mg should be\r\nadministered IV in conjunction with FFP, PCCs, or rFVIIa.325\r\nThe PCCs are concentrates of essential coagulation\r\nfactors, often including factors II, VII, IX, and X.326 Whereas\r\nin the US, PCCs and rFVII are not approved by the FDA for\r\nreversal of anticoagulation, in Europe these substances are\r\napproved specifically for this indication. The PCCs are\r\nappropriate for emergency reversal of oral anticoagulation\r\nbecause of their rapid onset of action. A dose of 500 U\r\n(typically approximately 7 U/kg) is effective for rapid\r\ncorrection of an INR < 5, but higher doses (up to 50 U/Kg)\r\nmay be necessary in patients with INR values above this\r\nlevel.327\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 35\r\nComparative studies have demonstrated that PCCs are\r\nmore effective than FFP for correcting patientsâ€™ INRs. In one\r\nsuch study, the mean post-treatment and lowest INR values in\r\npatients receiving 4 units of FFP were, respectively 2.3 and\r\n1.6, compared with 1.3 in patients receiving PCC at a dose of\r\n25 to 50 U/kg.328-332 Also, post-treatment levels of factor IX\r\nwere much lower in the FFP group than in the PCC group (19\r\nvs. 68.5 U/dL). Similarly, in a second study, only 1 of 6\r\npatients receiving 4 units of FFP achieved a safe INR level <\r\n1.5, compared with 5 of 6 patients receiving PCC (50 U/kg).325\r\nIn this study, the mean correction time was 41 minutes with\r\nPCC, significantly shorter than the 115 minutes observed with\r\nFFP. The time required for INR correction was reported to be\r\n4 to 5 times shorter with PCC. Another advantage of PCCs\r\nover human plasma is that smaller volumes of PCCs are\r\nrequired to reverse anticoagulation, because the concentration\r\nof clotting factors in PCCs is approximately 25 times higher\r\nthan that in human plasma.326, 332 Although human plasma is\r\noften administered at doses approximately 15 mL/kg, double\r\nhuman plasma doses or 2.4 L in an 80-kg patient, are required\r\nto reverse anticoagulation in critically ill patients.325 In\r\ncontrast to FFP, recommended doses of PCC can be delivered\r\nat a volume of 1 to 2 mL/kg. With PCCs the smaller volumes\r\nminimize the risk of worsening fluid overload and shorten\r\ninfusion time.325 Compared to FFP, PCCs can be prepared\r\nfaster, can be stored at room temperature, avoiding the need\r\nfor thawing and warming, and do not require crossmatching\r\nbefore administration. Thus the time from patient presentation\r\nto correction of INR is much shorter with PCCs than with FFP\r\n(15 min vs. 1-2 hr).326 The PCCs may also be associated with\r\nlower risks of viral or prion contamination and of transfusionrelated\r\nacute lung injury (TRALI), a major cause of death after\r\ntransfusion.325 The PCCs have been associated with a modest\r\nrisk of thrombogenic events.\r\nAlthough preliminary studies have demonstrated the\r\nsafety and efficacy of rFVIIa for anticoagulation reversal, this\r\nmodality is not yet approved in either the US or Europe.\r\nAdvantages of rFVIIa over FFP are similar to those of PCCs,\r\nincluding low infusion volume and rapid administration time,\r\nbut comparative studies are lacking.325, 333\r\nRecommendations for the Reversal of\r\nAnticoagulation before Heart Transplantation324, 326,\r\n328, 332:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Pre-operatively, the INR should be reduced to â‰¤ 1.5.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Low doses of vitamin K (2.5-5.0 mg) given IV are\r\npreferable to high doses because they are associated with\r\na lower risk of anaphylaxis.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n3. Given the need for rapid normalization of the INR,\r\nchronically anticoagulated patients about to undergo HT\r\nshould receive vitamin K in conjunction with FFP, PCCs,\r\nor rFVII depending on their availability and the patientâ€™s\r\nrenal and hepatic functions.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPeri-operative Management of Heart Transplant\r\nassist support devices\r\nRecipients with Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia\r\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immunemediated\r\ndisorder characterized by the formation of antibodies\r\nagainst the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. The frequency\r\nof HIT ranges from 0.2\% to 5.0\% in patients exposed to\r\nheparin for more than 4 days. In addition to duration of\r\ntherapy, the 3 factors most strongly associated with the\r\ndevelopment of HIT include use of unfractionated rather than\r\nlow-molecular-weight heparin, surgical rather than medical\r\nsetting, and female gender.334\r\nassist support devices\r\nThere are a number of anticoagulants that can be used\r\ninstead of heparin in patients with HIT including a direct\r\nthrombin inhibitor such as lepirudin (recombinant hirudin),\r\nbivalirudin, or argatroban; or danaparoid. To date, no\r\nprospective randomized studies have compared the relative\r\nefficacy and toxicity of the available agents. However,\r\nbecause of their different modes of excretion and inactivation,\r\npatients with HIT and renal insufficiency are usually treated\r\nwith argatroban, whereas those with hepatic impairment are\r\ntypically given lepirudin.\r\nLepirudin (RefludanÂ®) is a recombinant hirudin approved\r\nby the FDA for the treatment of HIT complicated by\r\nthrombosis. A starting dose of lepirudin â‰¤ 0.10 mg/kg/hr has\r\nbeen recommended in patients with serum creatinine < 1\r\nmg/dL. Because the drug undergoes renal clearance and\r\nanticoagulant effect is not easily reversed, doses must be\r\ndecreased in patients with renal insufficiency and the aPTT\r\nmust be closely monitored to avoid drug accumulation.335\r\nBivalirudin (Angiomax), a hemodialyzable direct\r\nthrombin inhibitor and hirudin analog has been successfully\r\nemployed in patients with HIT, with reduced doses safely\r\nemployed in patients with combined hepatic and renal failure.\r\nIt is approved by the FDA for patients with, or at risk of, HIT\r\nwho are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The\r\nrecommended initial dose of bivalirudin for HIT is\r\napproximately 0.15 mg/kg/hour, adjusted to achieve an aPTT \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 36\r\nof 1.5 to 2.5 times the baseline value. Doses of 0.14\r\nmg/kg/hour in patients with hepatic dysfunction and 0.03 to\r\n0.05 mg/kg/hour in patients with renal or combined hepatic\r\nand renal dysfunction have been successfully employed. The\r\ndevelopment of anti-hirudin antibody formation can occur\r\nwith longer treatment.\r\nArgatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor with a short in\r\nvivo plasma half-life of 24 minutes; and its effect is monitored\r\nby the aPTT. In patients with normal hepatic function, the\r\nstandard starting dose is 2 Âµg/kg/min by continuous IV\r\ninfusion, adjusted to maintain the aPTT at 1.5 to 3 times the\r\nbaseline value. Due to hepatobiliary elimination, a lower\r\nstarting dose (0.5-1.2 Âµg/kg/min) is appropriate in patients\r\nwith hepatic dysfunction, combined hepatic/renal dysfunction,\r\nheart failure, or anasarca.335 In such patients, the aPTT should\r\nbe checked at 4-hour intervals after drug initiation or dose\r\nchange to ensure that the desired level of anticoagulation is\r\npresent. An even lower starting dose of argatroban (0.2\r\nÂµg/kg/min) may be appropriate in critically ill patients with\r\nmultiple organ dysfunction and HIT.335\r\nDanaparoid (OrgaranÂ®) is a heparinoid that includes\r\npredominantly dermatan sulfate and low-sulfated heparan\r\nsulfate. It is available in many countries but not in the US.\r\nIt has been given to patients with HIT or a history of HIT\r\nwho require CPB. The recommended dose includes an initial\r\nIV bolus of 2250 U, modified up or down according to body\r\nweight, followed by an IV infusion of 400 U/hr for 4 hours,\r\n300 U/hr for the next 4 hours, and 200 U/hr thereafter. Doses\r\nare adjusted to achieve anti-Xa levels of 0.5 to 0.8 U/mL.\r\nDisadvantages of danaparoid include the need to measure antifactor\r\nXa levels, its long half-life (25 Â± 100 h), renal\r\nelimination, and the absence of an antidote.335\r\nOther approaches, including plasmapheresis, are not\r\neffective for the treatment of HIT and should not be used in\r\nplace of the compounds described above.\r\nPatients with a history of HIT who require CPB have been\r\nsuccessfully anticoagulated with a brief course of\r\nunfractionated heparin without complications. This approach\r\nis based on the theory that a secondary immune response after\r\nre-exposure to heparin is unlikely to occur until at least 3 days\r\nlater. Thus, a brief exposure to heparin during CPB should not\r\nimmediately elicit HIT antibodies. Furthermore, because\r\nheparin is rapidly cleared after the procedure, even if\r\nantibodies appeared, they would not be thrombogenic in the\r\nabsence of heparin. In a report of 3 patients with HIT\r\nrequiring urgent HT, re-exposure to unfractionated heparin in\r\nthe absence of heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA)\r\nwas uneventful.336 Heparin was discontinued and a direct\r\nthrombin inhibitor (agatroban or lepirudin) was used for a few\r\nhours post-operatively in all 3 cases to prevent recurrence of\r\nthrombosis due to the re-exposure to heparin. Another report\r\nyielded similar results.337\r\nRecommendations for Anticoagulation in Heart\r\nTransplant Recipients335-337:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. The absence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies should\r\nbe confirmed.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. The use of unfractionated heparin should be restricted to\r\nthe operative procedure itself. Low molecular weight\r\nheparin is not recommended, due to a longer half-life than\r\nunfractionated heparin and the inability to fully reverse its\r\neffect with protamine.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n3. Alternative anticoagulants can be used pre- and postoperatively\r\nin patients with history of HIT in whom the\r\nplatelet count has recovered but IgG antibodies to the\r\nplatelet factor 4/heparin complex are still present.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n4. Patients with abnormal hepatic and normal renal function\r\ncan be treated with lepirudin, danaparoid, or\r\nfondaparinux, while those with abnormal renal and\r\nnormal hepatic function can receive argatroban at\r\nstandard doses or lepirudin at reduced doses.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n5. Patients with both renal and hepatic dysfunction can be\r\ntreated with argatroban or bivalirudin at reduced doses.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPharmacologic Management of Bleeding\r\nAprotinin\r\nAprotinin is a potent inhibitor of the serine proteases\r\nincluding plasmin, thrombin, kallikrein, and activated protein\r\nC. The safety and efficacy of aprotinin in reducing bleeding\r\nduring cardiac surgery has been demonstrated in several metaanalyses\r\nbut has not been tested in large-scale randomized\r\ntrials.338-341 In a cohort of HT recipients, aprotinin was found\r\nto significantly reduce bleeding in those with previous\r\nsternotomies but not in patients without prior surgeries.294 In\r\naddition,342, 343 a recent large observational study has shown an\r\nincreased risk of renal failure, myocardial infarction or heart\r\nfailure, and stroke or encephalopathy with the use of aprotinin\r\nin heart surgery patients.344 The results of this study triggered \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 37\r\na FDA warning regarding the risks of aprotinin. This drug\r\nshould not be used in HT surgery.\r\nTranexamic Acid and Epsilon-aminocaproic Acid\r\nTranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid are lysine\r\nanalogues with antifibrinolytic activity. Both agents\r\ncompetitively inhibit the binding of plasmin to fibrinogen and\r\nt-PA to plasmin via lysine recognition sites required for\r\nfibrinolysis. Tranexamic acid is almost 10 times more potent\r\nthan epsilon-aminocaproic acid.345 In contrast to aprotinin,\r\nneither agent is associated with an increased risk of end-organ\r\ndamage.344, 346, 347 Epsilon-aminocaproic acid has been\r\ncompared to aprotinin and found to have similar efficacy.340\r\nLysine analogues are indicated for the treatment of bleeding in\r\na number of conditions but are not approved by the FDA for\r\nassist support devices\r\nuse in CPB despite evidence that their administration before\r\nCPB is associated with a 30\% reduction in bleeding and blood\r\ntransfusion requirement.348-351 Epsilon-aminocaproic acid is\r\ngiven as a loading dose of 75 to 150 mg/kg at the beginning of\r\nsurgery followed by a continuous infusion at 10 to 15\r\nmg/kg/hr. The dosage of tranexamic acid is 1/10 of epsilonaminoproic\r\nacid.\r\nDesmopressin\r\nDesmopressin, a vasopressin analogue with minimal\r\nvasopressor activity, stimulates the release of factors VIII:C\r\nand von Willebrand from the endothelium. Desmopressin only\r\nmodestly reduces bleeding and its use is not routinely\r\nrecommended.339, 352, 353\r\nassist support devices\r\nTransfusion Strategies for Bleeding\r\nAppropriate levels of coagulation factors are necessary\r\nfor adequate surgical hemostasis. FFP administration should\r\nbe guided by coagulation tests and measured deficiencies.340\r\nNo evidence exists for the prophylactic use of FFP to prevent\r\nbleeding.341 Goals of FFP administration should be to achieve\r\n1.5 times the control mean of both the prothrombin time and\r\nthe aPTT.342 Fibrinogen infusion is also important in massive\r\nbleeding. Levels drop with massive bleeding and subsequent\r\nred cell transfusions. Substitution should be done to maintain a\r\nlevel higher than 1 g/L.342\r\nAlthough platelet transfusions are common in cardiac\r\nsurgery, few randomized trials support their routine use.\r\nGuidelines support the use of platelet transfusion when there is\r\nclinical evidence of microvascular bleeding in conjunction\r\nwith excessive blood loss.343 A transfusion threshold of\r\n50,000/uL is generally recommended.342 Prophylactic platelet\r\ntransfusions during cardiac surgery are not useful in\r\npreventing bleeding and may be associated with an increase in\r\npulmonary vascular resistance.344\r\nRecombinant FVIIa is not approved for bleeding during\r\ncardiac surgery, although case reports and small series have\r\nshown some efficacy in cases of excessive or refractory\r\nbleeding345-347 occurring during implant or explant of VADs\r\nand HT.348-350 Recombinant FVIIa combines with tissue factor\r\nat the site of injury and activates the coagulation cascade.\r\nHowever, because tissue factor is also expressed on\r\nmonocytes and atherosclerotic blood vessels, it may have\r\nprothrombotic effects in cardiac surgery patients.351 Despite\r\nthe potential efficacy of rFVIIa seems to have, prospective\r\nrandomized trials with rFVIIa still do not confirm the efficacy\r\nor safety of this costly agent in cardiac surgery.\r\nGaps in Evidence\r\nTransfusion stragtegies are not well studied. Consensus\r\nopinion drives the decision of when to transfuse blood\r\nproducts. Expert opinions on which clinical situations require\r\ntransfusions are highly variable. Recombinant FVIIa has not\r\nbeen tested in controlled clinical trials and therefore there is\r\nlittle evidence to support its use in a bleeding cardiac surgery\r\npatient. Tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid have not been\r\nevaluated in a definitive randomized study. Very few studies\r\nhave been performed specifically in HT recipients. Thus, the\r\nrecommendations for HT are extrapolated from evidence\r\nregarding achievement of hemostasis in general cardiac\r\nsurgery.\r\nRecommendations for the Pharmacologic\r\nManagement of Coagulopathies in Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients339, 346, 347, 351-353:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Transfusion of coagulation factors is necessary for\r\nadequate hemostatsis. Thus, FFP and platelets should be\r\ntransfused based on measured levels. Fibrinogen infusion\r\nfor massive bleeding and inadequate fibrinogen levels is\r\nneeded to control blood loss.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid both have\r\nanti-fibrinolytic activity and can be used prior to CPB to\r\nreduce the risk of bleeding in selected patients.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1. Recombinant FVIIa may be used in cases of intractable or\r\nexcessive bleeding with HT surgery.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 38\r\nClass III:\r\n1. Although aprotinine can reduce bleeding during HT\r\nsurgery, its routine use is not recommended due to an\r\nincreased risk of adverse clinical events.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\n2. Desmopressin is not recommended for routine use\r\nbecause its modest reduction in bleeding has been\r\nassociated with adverse clinical events.\r\nLevel of Evidence: A.\r\nConclusion\r\nCompared to patients undergoing general cardiac surgery,\r\nHT recipients have a greater incidence of coagulopathies due\r\nto multiple factors that include greater severity of illness in\r\nheart failure patients, more frequent use of anticoagulants, and\r\nprotracted extracorporeal circulation in patients undergoing\r\nMCS explantation. There are several laboratory and point of\r\ncare tests to assess the severity of the coagulopathy present in\r\nindividual patients. The application of a combination of intraoperative\r\nsurgical techniques, pharmacologic therapies, as\r\nwell as transfusion strategies are needed to control the\r\nbleeding commonly occurring during HT.\r\nTopic 6: Documentation and\r\nCommunication with the Multidisciplinary\r\nTeam\r\nMultidisciplinary Team\r\nA HT center should identify a multidisciplinary team\r\n(composed of individuals from surgery, medicine, nursing,\r\nnutrition, social services, physical therapy, and pharmacology)\r\nwith each member having specific responsibilities. In addition\r\nto cardiology and cardiac surgery, medical specialties that\r\nshould be represented in the cardiac transplant team include\r\ninfectious diseases, nephrology, pulmonary with respiratory\r\ntherapy support, pathology, immunology, anesthesiology,\r\nphysical therapy, and rehabilitation medicine. The Organ\r\nProcurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the\r\nUnited States, the British Transplant Society (BTS), and the\r\nEuropean Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT) have\r\nrecommendations for the multi-disciplinary approach to\r\nHT.354, 355\r\nAs with the evaluation and discussion that accompanies\r\nlisting a patient for transplantation, a similar approach is\r\nuseful in dealing with the HT recipient. In addition to\r\nphysicians and transplant nurse coordinators, the team should\r\ninclude the following:\r\na. Social work/social services personnel have a\r\nmultifunctional and undisputed role in transplant\r\ncenters.356 One important function is the pre-operative\r\nscreening for psycho-social conditions that might\r\nadversely affect recipient outcome, such as depression,\r\nand adherence to medical treatment regimens.357, 358\r\nb. Psychiatry/psychology specialists diagnose psychiatric\r\nillnesses, manage pharmacologic therapy, 359 and identify\r\npersonality traits that may allow the transplant team to\r\nimprove the patientâ€™s understanding and adherence to\r\ntheir medical therapy.360, 361 Qualified social work\r\ncounselors often subsume the functions of these\r\nspecialists.\r\nc. In the US, clinical pharmacists can play a pivotal role in\r\nthe management of HT recipients. In European countries,\r\nthis role is often fulfilled by transplant physicians. There\r\nare numerous interactions among medications and\r\nbetween medications and food and other nutritional\r\nsupplements requiring both monitoring and education of\r\npatients and care givers on the complexities of\r\npharmacological therapyin HT recipients. These patients\r\noften have other chronic diseases, and management of a\r\ncomplex poly-pharmacy is crucial for long-term allograft\r\nand patient survival. In the outpatient management of\r\nkidney transplant recipients, the involvement of a\r\ntransplant pharmacist led to improved patient compliance\r\nwith medications at the end of 1 year (95.1\% in those\r\npatients who interacted with pharmacists vs. 81.6\% with\r\nthose who did not).362, 363 In addition, the inclusion of\r\npharmacy input led to an increase in â€œtherapeuticâ€� drug\r\nconcentrations from 48\% to 64\%.363.\r\nd. Dieticians play an important during both the pre- and\r\npost-HT periods. Pre-operatively, HT recipients are often\r\nmalnourished and cachectic as a consequence of longstanding\r\nheart failure. Better nutrition at this point\r\nimproves operative survival. Post-operatively, HT\r\nassist support devices\r\nrecipients often need education on avoidance of weight\r\ngain associated with the use of CSs and hyperglycemia\r\ncontrol. Weight loss while waiting for HT is often\r\nnecessary because obesity in the HT recipient is\r\nassociated with poorer short-term outcomes.\r\ne. Physical and occupational therapy are equally important\r\nin the pre-and post- HT periods. Cardiac rehabilitation\r\nshould begin in the hospital and continue after discharge.\r\nSupervised exercise may also facilitate adherence to a\r\nlong-term exercise program.\r\nf. Infectious disease specialists with a focus on\r\nimmunocompromised patients are invaluable in the \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 39\r\nmanagement of HT recipients in terms of diagnois and\r\ntherapy of community acquired and opportunistic\r\ninfections and the development of protocols for infection\r\nprophylaxis against invasive fungi and CMV.\r\ng. In those countries without a socialized or national medical\r\nsystem, financial counselors should be part of the\r\nmultidisciplinary team to help HT candidates or recipients\r\nwith insurance claims and health care coverage or private\r\nfund raising.\r\nCommunication\r\nMeetings should be scheduled at regular intervals to\r\nfacilitate discussion of HT candidates, recipients, and\r\nprogrammatic concerns. Telecommunication or electronic\r\nconferencing can be used to allow for collaborations between\r\ngeographically distant groups. These meetings should include\r\nscheduled internal quality assessments by physicians, nurses,\r\nand the other allied health professionals.364\r\nRecommendations for the Documentation and\r\nCommunication with the Multidisciplinary Team356,\r\n357, 362:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Transplant centers must have a multidisciplinary approach\r\nto patient management.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2.

This condition accounts for the highest\r\nproportion of deaths (20\%) in the pediatric population within\r\nthe first 30 post-operative days.366 In a report from the\r\nPediatric Heart Transplant Study, early heart allograft failure\r\nwas the commonest cause of early death in infants.367 Finally,\r\nmortality due to PGF is higher in recipients with than in those\r\nwithout congenital heart disease (5\% vs. 1\%), and as high as\r\n10\% in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.368 Table\r\n1 summarizes potential causes of PGF after pediatric HT.365\r\nIf the recipient cannot be weaned off CPB, MCS should\r\nbe instituted. Urgent re-transplantation may be considered but\r\nit is associated with a high mortality.96, 366, 369\r\nECMO and Primary Graft Failure in Pediatric Heart\r\nTransplantation\r\nSince the first reported neonatal survivor in the 1970s, the\r\nECMO portion of the Extracorporeal Life Support\r\nOrganization (ELSO) Registry contains a total of 386 ECMO\r\ntherapies for pediatric HT with survival ranging from 31\% in\r\nnewborns to 57\% in older children.370, 371 Registry indications\r\nfor ECMO after HT include pulmonary disease and acute\r\nrejection. Requirements for ECMO support in pediatric HT\r\nrecipients range between 10\% and 60\% and subsequent\r\nsurvival after PGF varies between 20\% and 75\%. Some\r\nfavorable outcomes have been achieved with ECMO as a\r\nbridge to recovery and this type of support is available at\r\nmany pediatric HT centers. Using the definition noted above,\r\nHuang reported PGF in 33\% of pediatric HT recipients, 44\%\r\nof whom required MCS.85 There was an 18\% early mortality\r\nrate in the PGF group. Of 4 children with acute HT failure that\r\nwere supported with ECMO, 2 survived, 1 after retransplantation.369\r\nKirschbom reported ECMO support in 9 of\r\n12 children, only 2 of whom (22\%) survived.372 Chou reported\r\na 9\% ECMO use rates for PGF, including 4 children, 3 of\r\nwhom survived.373 Fenton reported 15 children (9\% of their\r\ntransplant series) who required ECMO within 6 weeks of HT \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 40\r\nand 58\% of these survived.374 Finally, the Denver group\r\nreported that 8 of 14 infants (57\%) undergoing HT for\r\nhypoplastic left heart syndrome required ECMO after HT and\r\nwere discharged alive.375 Survivors were likely to be weaned\r\nwithin 84 hours of ECMO support.\r\nIndications for ECMO Support after Pediatric Heart\r\nTransplantation\r\nFailure of Separation from Cardiopulmonary Bypass\r\nIf the recipient cannot be weaned from CPB, the standard\r\nmeasures should be instituted after assessment of residual\r\nanatomic lesions, ventilatory and pharmacologic support,\r\nhematologic and biochemical profile, and fluid status. Once\r\nthese measures have been optimized and hyperacute rejection\r\nhas been excluded, then a diagnosis of primary PGF can be\r\nmade and ECMO support can be considered.\r\nInadequate Post-operative Cardiac Function\r\nExisting or progressively poorer post-operative allograft\r\nfunction, evidence of a low cardiac output, and poor systemic\r\noxygen delivery unresponsive to escalating medical therapy\r\nmay also warrant consideration of ECMO support in the ICU.\r\nAgain, all appropriate measures should be undertaken to\r\noptimize support and exclude a correctable cause for the poor\r\nallograft function as outlined above.376-379\r\nCardiac Arrest\r\nEmergency cannulation for ECMO during cardiac arrest\r\nis increasingly common. Many units now have the capability\r\nof rapidly putting children on ECMO during a cardiac arrest\r\nand survival can be achieved.380, 381\r\nRecommendations on the Indications for\r\nExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Pediatric\r\nHeart Transplant Recipients365, 367, 368, 372, 374, 375:\r\n(See Table 8)\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. The use of ECMO should be considered when there is\r\nfailure to separate from CPB after all correctable causes\r\nof such failure have been excluded.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2.

Cannulae placed directly into the aorta and\r\nthe atria may be associated with improved flows but may be\r\nless stable. Direct cannulation may be used in the case of\r\nhemodynamic instability or technical difficulties. Approaches\r\nincluding cannulation, technique, equipment, flows,\r\nmonitoring, and anticoagulation are center specific.\r\nLeft Heart Distension on Cardiac Extracorporeal\r\nMembrane Oxygenation\r\nA left-sided vent is not required if cardiac ejection is\r\nsufficient to prevent LV over-distension. Distension of the LV\r\nwill result in increased wall tension, decreased LV perfusion,\r\nand ischemia, which may impair the ability to improve heart\r\nallograft function. In addition, LV distension may have\r\ndetrimental effects on pulmonary function. If pulmonary\r\nassist support devices\r\nedema develops or LA/LV distension is detected by\r\nechocardiography, a vent should be inserted through the\r\npulmonary vein or directly into the left atrium.382\r\nAlternatively, if the chest wound has been closed, an atrial \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 41\r\nseptostomy is performed.384, 385 If it is anticipated that a patient\r\nwill require ECMO after HT, the atrial septum may be\r\nfenestrated at the time of implantation.\r\nRecommendations for the Conduct of\r\nExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support in\r\nPediatric Heart Transplant Recipients:382, 384\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. The amount of circulatory support provided by ECMO\r\nshould be sufficient to achieve adequate systemic\r\nperfusion and oxygen delivery while waiting for the\r\nmyocardium to recover.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Left heart distension during ECMO support should be\r\naggressively treated as it will compromise pulmonary\r\nfunction and impede LV recovery.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nDuration of Support after Heart Transplantation\r\nThe purpose of ECMO is to maintain the systemic\r\ncirculation and end-organ function while investigating the\r\ncause of heart allograft failure, and waiting for myocardial\r\nrecovery. The literature suggests that cardiac recovery can be\r\nexpected within 3 to 7 days after HT and this time interval is\r\nsufficient to assess severity and reversibility of end-organ\r\ndamage and to consider other options, including weaning of\r\nsupport due to allograft recovery, implantation of a VAD as a\r\nbridge to re-transplantation, or treatment withdrawal.85, 96, 369,\r\n372, 375, 386-388\r\nTiming of Discontinuation of Extracorporeal\r\nMembrane Oxygenation Support in the Setting of\r\nPrimary Graft Failure\r\nWeaning ECMO should be considered when there is\r\nevidence of improved cardiac function on echocardiography\r\nand evidence of ejection in the arterial tree. Case reports\r\nsupport recovery if there are signs of improvement within 3 to\r\n7 days, but primarily within the first 3 days of support.85, 369,\r\n370, 373, 376, 379, 387\r\nRecommendations for the Timing of Discontinuation\r\nof Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support in\r\nthe Setting of Primary Graft Failure386:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

It is caused by dysfunction of the heart due to muscle damage (systolic or diastolic\r\ndysfunction), valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias or other rare causes. Acute heart failure can\r\npresent as new-onset heart failure in people without known cardiac dysfunction, or as acute\r\ndecompensation of chronic heart failure.\r\nAcute heart failure is a common cause of admission to hospital (over 67,000 admissions in\r\nEngland and Wales per year) and is the leading cause of hospital admission in people 65 years\r\nor older in the UK.\r\nThis guideline includes important aspects of the diagnosis and management of acute heart\r\nfailure that are not addressed by the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure (NICE clinical\r\nguideline 108). The guideline on chronic heart failure focused on long-term management rather\r\nthan on the immediate care of someone who is acutely unwell as a result of heart failure.\r\nThis guideline covers the care of adults (aged 18 years or older) who have a diagnosis of acute\r\nheart failure, have possible acute heart failure, or are being investigated for acute heart failure. It\r\nincludes the following key clinical areas:\r\nthe role of early natriuretic peptide testing and echocardiography\r\nthe role of specialist management units\r\nthe use of ventilatory support, pharmacological therapy and ultrafiltration\r\ntreatment after stabilisation, including selected surgical interventions and initiation of the\r\npharmacological therapies that are used in the management of chronic heart failure.\r\nDrug recommendations\r\nThe guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug\'s summary of product characteristics to\r\ninform decisions made with individual patients.\r\nIn memory of Christopher Jones, patient member of the GDG who ensured that the patient\r\nvoice was heard during the development of this guideline.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 4 of 26\r\nPatient-centred care\r\nThis guideline offers best practice advice on the care of adults (aged 18 years and over) with\r\nacute heart failure or possible acute heart failure.\r\nPatients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the NHS\r\nConstitution for England – all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care\r\nshould take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity\r\nto make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare\r\nprofessionals. Healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health\'s advice on\r\nconsent. If someone does not have capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should\r\nfollow the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary\r\ncode of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards.\r\nNICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS\r\nservices. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patient experience\r\nin adult NHS services.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 5 of 26\r\nKey priorities for implementation\r\nThe following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation.

All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 13 of 26\r\n2 Research recommendations\r\nThe Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research,\r\nbased on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future.\r\n2.1 Dopamine\r\nIn people with acute heart failure, congestion and worsening renal function, does the addition of\r\nlow-dose dopamine to standard therapy lead to greater diuresis and renal protection compared\r\nwith adding placebo to standard therapy?\r\nWhy this is important\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted to investigate whether the addition of\r\nlow-dose dopamine to standard therapy leads to more clinically and cost effective decongestion\r\nin people admitted to hospital for treatment of decompensated heart failure. The study should\r\naim to investigate the diuretic effect of dopamine as well as effects on renal function.\r\nOne of the most common and difficult to manage problems arising during the initial treatment of\r\npeople with acute heart failure is an inadequate response to intravenous diuretic therapy (that is,\r\nfailure to relieve congestion), which is often associated with worsening renal function. This\r\ncombination frequently leads to a prolonged inpatient stay and is associated with higher inpatient\r\nmortality rates and higher post-discharge mortality and re-admission rates. The best treatment\r\nfor this combination of problems is unknown. However, theoretical and experimental evidence\r\nindicates that low-dose dopamine may improve renal blood flow, as well as enhance sodium and\r\nwater excretion. Clinical trials have not yet resolved whether in some patients, the use of\r\nlow-dose dopamine actually results in improved decongestion and shorter hospital stays.\r\n2.2 Thiazide\r\nIn people with acute heart failure and persistent congestion, does the addition of a thiazide\r\ndiuretic to standard therapy lead to greater diuresis compared with adding placebo to standard\r\ntherapy?\r\nWhy this is important\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 14 of 26\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted to investigate whether the addition of a\r\nthiazide diuretic to standard therapy leads to more clinically and cost effective decongestion in\r\npeople admitted to hospital for treatment of decompensated heart failure.\r\nOne of the most common and difficult to manage problems arising during the initial treatment of\r\npeople with acute heart failure is an inadequate response to intravenous diuretic therapy. This\r\nfrequently leads to a prolonged inpatient stay and is associated with higher inpatient mortality\r\nand higher post-discharge mortality and re-admission rates. The best treatment for this problem\r\nis unknown. However, there is some inconsistent and non-robust evidence that addition of a\r\nthiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (metolazone) may be beneficial. The proposed study would aim\r\nto resolve this uncertainty and guide the management of a difficult clinical problem.\r\n2.3 Intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation\r\nIn people with acute heart failure and hypoperfusion syndrome, is the use of intra-aortic balloon\r\ncounter-pulsation pump (IABP) better than the use of intravenous inotropes?\r\nWhy this is important\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted in people with decompensated heart failure\r\ndue to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion comparing the use of\r\nIABP with the use of inotropes/vasopressors. This would determine which strategy is more\r\nclinically and cost effective in this cohort.\r\nIABP is used in the hospital setting as an adjuvant in people with critical coronary ischaemia and\r\nin people with mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. It has also been used in\r\npeople who develop cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is uncertain\r\nwhether it can provide clinical benefit in the critically unwell patients with acute heart failure due\r\nto left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion.\r\n2.4 Ultrafiltration\r\nIn people with decompensated heart failure, fluid congestion and diuretic resistance, does\r\nultrafiltration lead to more rapid and effective decongestion compared with continuing diuretic\r\ntreatment?\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 15 of 26\r\nWhy this is important\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be undertaken to determine whether ultrafiltration is more\r\nclinically and cost effective than conventional diuretic therapy for people admitted to hospital with\r\ndecompensated heart failure. The study should not only investigate several clinical outcomes but\r\nalso consider the impact of treatments on quality of life and provide data on safety.\r\nPeople who have fluid retention that is resistant to conventional diuretic therapy, with or without\r\nrenal dysfunction, make up a high proportion of hospital admissions due to heart failure. Such\r\nadmissions are often prolonged and therefore have important budgetary implications for the\r\nNHS. The few, relatively small scale, randomised trials of ultrafiltration performed so far have\r\nbeen conducted in healthcare settings very different from the UK, with less fluid retention than is\r\nusually seen in UK practice, and where length of stay is usually much shorter than in UK (and\r\nEuropean) practice. Although technically feasible, the evidence for benefit on heart failure\r\noutcomes is inconsistent and difficult to generalise to UK practice. Therefore a UK-based study\r\nof sufficient quality is needed.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved.

Last modified October 2014 Page 23 of 26\r\nAbout this guideline\r\nNICE clinical guidelines are recommendations about the treatment and care of people with\r\nspecific diseases and conditions.\r\nNICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a scope that defines what the guideline will\r\nand will not cover.\r\nThis guideline was developed by the National Clinical Guideline Centre. The Centre worked with\r\na Guideline Development Group, comprising healthcare professionals (including consultants,\r\nGPs and nurses), patients and carers, and technical staff, which reviewed the evidence and\r\ndrafted the recommendations. The recommendations were finalised after public consultation.\r\nThe methods and processes for developing NICE clinical guidelines are described in The\r\nguidelines manual.\r\nNICE produces guidance, standards and information on commissioning and providing\r\nhigh-quality healthcare, social care, and public health services. We have agreements to provide\r\ncertain NICE services to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Decisions on how NICE\r\nguidance and other products apply in those countries are made by ministers in the Welsh\r\ngovernment, Scottish government, and Northern Ireland Executive. NICE guidance or other\r\nproducts may include references to organisations or people responsible for commissioning or\r\nproviding care that may be relevant only to England.\r\nStrength of recommendations\r\nSome recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline\r\nDevelopment Group makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and\r\nharms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some\r\ninterventions, the Guideline Development Group is confident that, given the information it has\r\nlooked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the\r\nrecommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made\r\n(the strength of the recommendation).\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 24 of 26\r\nFor all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks\r\nand benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help\r\nthem to reach a fully informed decision (see also Patient-centred care).\r\nInterventions that must (or must not) be used\r\nWe usually use \'must\' or \'must not\' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation.\r\nOccasionally we use \'must\' (or \'must not\') if the consequences of not following the\r\nrecommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.\r\nInterventions that should (or should not) be used – a \'strong\'\r\nrecommendation\r\nWe use \'offer\' (and similar words such as \'refer\' or \'advise\') when we are confident that, for the\r\nvast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. We\r\nuse similar forms of words (for example, \'Do not offer…\') when we are confident that an\r\nintervention will not be of benefit for most patients.\r\nInterventions that could be used\r\nWe use \'consider\' when we are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for\r\nmost patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice\r\nof intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the\r\npatient\'s values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare\r\nprofessional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.\r\nOther versions of this guideline\r\nThe full guideline, Acute heart failure: diagnosing and managing acute heart failure in adults\r\ncontains details of the methods and evidence used to develop the guideline. It is published by\r\nthe National Clinical Guideline Centre.\r\nThe recommendations from this guideline have been incorporated into a NICE pathway.\r\nWe have produced information for the public about this guideline.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014.

Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when\r\nexercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual\r\nassist support devices\r\nresponsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of\r\nthe individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by\r\nthe summaries of product characteristics of any drugs.\r\nImplementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers.\r\nCommissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the\r\nguidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate\r\nunlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations.

dataMed8.txt,'CHAPTER 1 4\r\nHEART FAILURE\r\nROBERT SOUFER, M.D.\r\nThe heartâ€™s primary function is to pump blood to all\r\nparts of the body, bringing nutrients and oxygen to heart \r\nthe tissues and removing waste products. When the\r\nbody is at rest, it needs a certain amount of blood to\r\nachieve this function. During exercise or times when\r\ngreater demands are placed on the body, more blood\r\nis required. To meet these variable demands, the\r\nheartbeat increases or decreases, and blood vessels\r\ndilate to deliver more blood or constrict during times\r\nwhen less blood is required.\r\nWhen a person is diagnosed with heart failure, it\r\nassist support devices \r\ndoes not mean the heart has stopped working, but\r\nassist support devices \r\nrather that it is not working as efficiently as it should.\r\nIn other words, the term â€œfailureâ€� indicates the heart\r\nis not pumping effectively enough to meet the bodyâ€™s\r\nneeds for oxygen-rich blood, either during exercise\r\nor at rest. The term congestive heart failure (CHF) is\r\noften synonymous with heart failure but also refers\r\nto the state in which decreased heart function is accompanied\r\nby a buildup of body fluid in the lungs\r\nand elsewhere. Heart failure may be reversible, and\r\npeople may live for many years after the diagnosis is\r\nmade. (See box, â€œClassifications of Heart Failure.â€�)\r\nHeart failure may occur suddenly, or it may develop\r\ngradually. When heart function deteriorates\r\nover years, one or more conditions may exist, (See\r\nbox, â€œEffects of Heart Failure.â€�) The strength of muscle\r\ncontractions may be reduced, and the ability of\r\nthe heart chambers to fill with blood may be limited\r\nby mechanical problems, resulting in less blood to\r\npump out to tissues in the body. Conversely, the\r\npumping chambers may enlarge and fill with too\r\nmuch blood when the heart muscle is not strong\r\nenough to pump out all the blood it receives. In addition,\r\nas the architecture of the heart changes as it\r\nenlarges, regurgitation of the mitral valve may develop,\r\nmaking the heart failure even worse.\r\nWHO DEVELOPS HEART FAILURE?\r\nThere are an estimated 2 million people in the United\r\nStates with heart failure. The incidence of chronic\r\ncongestive heart failureâ€?the number of new cases\r\ndeveloping in the given population each yearâ€?has\r\nincreased in recent years. This is possibly a result of\r\nthe overall decline in deaths from coronary (ischemic)\r\nheart disease, an improvement attributed to medical\r\nadvances and the fact that people are living longer.\r\nThe most common cause of congestive failure is\r\ncoronary artery diseaseâ€?narrowing of the arteries\r\nsupplying blood to the heart muscle. Although coronary\r\ndisease often starts at an early age, congestive\r\nfailure occurs most often in the elderly. Among people\r\nmore than 70 years old, about 8 out of 1,000 are\r\ndiagnosed with congestive heart failure each year.\r\nThe majority of these patients are women, probably\r\nbecause men are more likely to die from coronary\r\nartery disease before it progresses to heart failure.\r\nHeart failure is also associated with untreated\r\nhypertension, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse (primarily\r\ncocaine and amphetamines) at any age. Hyperthyroidism\r\nand various abnormalities of the heart\r\nvalves (particularly aortic and mitral) are among the\r\n177\r\nMAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\r\nClassifications of Heart\r\nFailure\r\nThe New York Heart Association developed a\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nsystem that has been used for manyâ€� years to\r\nprovide a standardized set of criteria for the\r\nclassification of heart failure based on the\r\nseverity of the condition. This is evaluated by\r\nsymptoms and ability to function.\r\nClass I: no undue symptoms associated with\r\nordinary activity and no limitation of physical\r\nactivity\r\nClass II: slight limitation of physical activity;\r\npatient comfortable at rest\r\nClass III: marked limitation of physical activity;\r\npatient comfortable at rest\r\nClass IV: inability to carry on any physical\r\nactivity without discomfort; symptoms of\r\ncardiac insufficiency or chest pain possible\r\neven at rest\r\nEffects of Heart Failure\r\nâ—� Strength of muscle contractions is reduced.\r\nâ—� Ability of the heart chambers to fill with blood\r\nis limited, so there is less blood to pump out to\r\ntissues in the body.\r\nâ—� The pumping heart chambers fill with too much\r\nblood; the heart muscle is not strong enough to\r\npump out all the blood it receives.\r\nother disorders that can cause heart failure. In addition,\r\nviral infection or inflammation of the heart\r\n(myocarditis) or primary heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy),\r\nand in rare instances, extreme vitamin\r\ndeficiencies, can result in heart failure. (See Chapters\r\n13 and 15.)\r\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\r\nDepending on the underlying causes, heart failure\r\ncan be either acute (intense but not long-lasting) or\r\nchronic (protracted over a long time), When heart\r\nfailure occurs, the forward flow of blood is slowed\r\ndown, the quantity of blood pumped is less than adequate,\r\nand the pressure rises in the chambers of the\r\nheart, causing blood that is returning to the heart to\r\nback up in the lungs or veins. Excessive fatigue may\r\nbean early symptom. (See box, â€œSymptoms of Heart\r\nFailure.â€�) Some excess fluid may be forced out of the\r\nblood vessels into the bodyâ€™s tissues. It then settles\r\nin the feet, ankles, and legs, and sometimes also in\r\nthe abdomen and liver.\r\nDyspnea, or shortness of breath, resulting from\r\nincreased pressure, fluid, or both in the lungs, is a\r\ncommon symptom of congestive heart failure. Although\r\nbreathlessness is most likely to be noticed\r\nduring exercise (known as dyspnea on exertion, or\r\nDOE), it can also be a problem at rest, particularly\r\nwhen the patient is lying down (when it is known as\r\northopnea). Individuals with orthopnea find that the\r\ncondition feels worse when they are in a reclining\r\nposition because the backflow of fluid and buildup in\r\npressure from the heart interferes directly with the\r\nfree flow of oxygen in the lungs.\r\nNormally, oxygen is easily exchanged through the\r\nthin spongy tissue of the lungs. (See Figure 14.1.) If\r\nthis tissue becomes waterlogged, as it does in heart\r\nfailure, less oxygen can be transferred to the blood.\r\nIf there is not enough oxygen, certain reflexes stimulate\r\nfaster breathing. People with lung congestion\r\nas a result of heart failure usually have to prop themselves\r\nup with extra pillows in order to sleep. The\r\nnumber of pillows used may indicate to a physician\r\nthe extent of the heart failure. When an individual\r\nwakes at night because of shortness of breath from\r\nSvmntoms of Heart Failure\r\nShortness of breath (dyspnea)\r\nShortness of breath when lying down\r\n(orthopnea)\r\nShortness of breath while sleeping (paroxysmal\r\nor intermittent nocturnal dyspnea)\r\nBuildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary\r\nedema), frequently causing a person to cough\r\nup blood-tinged sputum\r\nBuildup of excess fluid (edema) in other parts\r\nof the body, causing weight gain, swelling of\r\nthe ankles, legs, and back, and in extreme\r\ncases fluid accumulation in the abdomen\r\n(ascites)\r\nFatigue, weakness, and an inability to exert\r\noneself physically or mentally\r\nBlueness of the skin (cyanosis)\r\nHEART FAILURE\r\nFigure 14.1\r\nThis diagram of an alveolus (air sac) shows the exchange of carbon\r\ndioxide (CO2) and oxygen in the lung.\r\nfluid settling in the lungs, the condition is known as\r\nparoxysmal (intermittent) nocturnal dyspnea. A person\r\nsuffering from this typically will wake up short\r\nof breath about two to three hours after going to\r\nsleep, Standing or sitting often relieves symptoms.\r\nOne of recent history\'s most noted patients with\r\nheart failure was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\r\nHe had severe hypertension that led to an enlarged\r\nheart and eventually to heart failure. For\r\nmonths, he was unable to lie flat in bed, so he slept\r\nin a chair. He was told that he had bronchitis, allergies,\r\nand the flu. Finally, the right diagnosis was made\r\nand treatment started. However, this was before the\r\ndevelopment of effective drugs to lower blood pressure\r\nand to treat advanced heart failure. At the time\r\nof President Rooseveltâ€™s death of a massive stroke on\r\nApril 12, 1945, his blood pressure ranged between\r\n180/110 and 230/130.\r\nThe infiltration of the body with fluid can cause\r\nmore than breathing problems and sleepless nights.\r\nPatients may weigh more, because of the excess\r\nwater retention, and they may have edema (swelling)\r\nof the skin and soft tissues, usually in the feet, ankles,\r\nor legs, and sometimes in the lower back. This swelling\r\nis characterized by a gradual filling out after the\r\narea is depressed with a finger. (See Figure 14.2.) In\r\nextreme cases, fluid will accumulate in the abdomen.\r\nThis is called ascites and is caused when swelling of\r\nthe gastrointestinal tract forces fluid through the capillaries\r\ninto the abdominal cavity. Ascites usually occurs\r\nonly in severe chronic heart failure.\r\nWhen a marked excess of fluid accumulates in the\r\nlungs, it is known as pulmonary (lung) edema. This\r\ncondition is often, but not always, acute and is frequently\r\nassociated with coughing up blood-tinged,\r\npinkish-colored sputum.\r\nInefficient circulation may also manifest itself as\r\nfatigue, weakness, and an inability to exert oneself\r\nphysically or mentally because less blood and oxygen\r\nreach the brain. Older people in particular may suffer\r\nfrom confusion and impaired thinking ability.\r\nLEFT SIDE OR RIGHT SIDE?\r\nThe particular symptoms that an individual experiences\r\nare determined by which side of the heart is\r\ninvolved in the heart failure. (See box, â€œSymptoms of\r\nLeft-Side and Right-Side Heart Failure.â€�) For example,\r\nthe left atrium (upper chamber) receives oxygenFigure\r\n14.2\r\nEdema is swelling of the extremities caused by excess fluid buildup.\r\nA sign of edema in the ankles is an indentation that remains\r\nmomentarily when a finger is pressed into the skin and then\r\nremoved.\r\n179\r\nMAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\r\nSymptoms of left-side heart failure\r\nâ—� Fatigue\r\nâ—� Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\r\nâ€¢ Shortness of breath when lying down (othopnea)\r\nâ—� Paroxysmal (intermittent) nocturnal dyspnea\r\nâ—� Accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary\r\nedema), frequently causing a person to cough\r\nup blood-tinged sputum\r\nSymptoms of right-side heart failure\r\nâ€¢ Swelling (edema)\r\nDependent edema (edema that travels by\r\ngravity to the lowest portions of the body)\r\nEnlargement or swelling of the liver\r\n(hepatomegaly)\r\nBuildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity\r\n(ascites)\r\nEdema of the skin and soft tissues, causing\r\nswelling of the feet, ankles, and legs\r\nâ—� Excessive urination at night caused by fluid\r\nredistribution while a person is sleeping lying\r\ndown (nocturia)\r\nated blood from the lungs and passes it onto the left\r\nventricle (lower chamber), which pumps it to the rest\r\nof the body. When the left side isnâ€™t pumping efficiently,\r\nblood backs up in the vessels of the lungs,\r\nand sometimes fluid is forced out of the lung vessels\r\nand into the breathing spaces themselves. This pulmonary\r\ncongestion causes shortness of breath. The\r\nother major symptoms of left-sided heart failure are\r\nfatigue, dyspnea (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal\r\ndyspnea), and the sputum production (sometimes\r\nbloody) that comes from pulmonary congestion.\r\nRight-sided failure occurs when there is resistance\r\nto the flow of blood from the right heart structures\r\n(right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary or lung artery)\r\ninto the lungs or when the tricuspid valve, which\r\nseparates the right atrium from the right ventricle,\r\nfails to work properly. This results in a backup of fluid\r\nand pressure in the veins that empty into the right\r\nside of the heart. Pressure then builds up in the liver\r\nand the veins in the legs. The liver enlarges and may\r\nbecome painful; swelling of the ankles or legs occurs.\r\nThe major symptoms of right-sided heart failure\r\nare edema and nocturia (excessive urination at night\r\ncaused by fluid redistribution while a person is lying\r\ndown). The different types of edema possible are dependent\r\n(edema that travels by gravity to the lowest\r\nportions of the body), edema that results in enlargement\r\nor swelling of the liver (called hepatomegaly),\r\nascites, and edema of the skin or soft tissues (only in\r\nsome cases).\r\nBecause congestive heart failure causes the body\r\nto fill with excess fluids, the kidneys may not be able\r\nto dispose of the extra sodium (a component of salt)\r\nand water, a condition known as kidney failure.\r\n(Again, the term â€œfailureâ€� implies that the kidneys\r\nhave failed and will not recover. However, as in the\r\ncase of heart failure, the kidney changes maybe temporary,\r\nand proper treatment may correct much of\r\nthe problem.) Sodium that would normally be eliminated\r\nthrough the urine remains in the body, causing\r\nit to retain even more water, thereby aggravating the\r\nproblem of excess fluid associated with congestive\r\nheart failure.\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\nA stethoscope can be used to detect rales, crackling\r\nnoises that are caused by the movement of excess\r\nfluid in the lungs. This can help locate where fluid\r\nhas accumulated. By listening to breathing sounds or\r\nthumping the chest, a physician can usually tell when\r\nfluid from the lungs has leaked (pleural effusion) into\r\nthe chest cavity. The fluid will also appear as a cloudy\r\narea on X-rays. The stethoscope can also detect the\r\nsounds of the heart chambers filling and emptying\r\nand the heart valves opening and closing throughout\r\nthe cardiac cycle. Abnormal variations in these\r\nsounds can aid the physician in diagnosing and monitoring\r\nheart failure, because the condition is associated\r\nwith one or two abnormal sounds in addition\r\nto the two sounds usually heard with the healthy\r\nheart. Another symptom, blueness of the skin (called\r\ncyanosis) accompanied by coolness and moisture,\r\nmost often in the fingers and toes, indicates low levels\r\nof oxygen in the blood (called hypoxia). Edema is\r\ndetected by pressing the finger against the ankle or\r\nskin and noting how long it takes the depression to\r\nrefill. Liver enlargement is felt by examining the abdomen.\r\nThe neck vein may also be distended. (See\r\nbox, â€œSigns of Heart Failure During an Examination.â€�)\r\nA number of sophisticated diagnostic techniques\r\nmay also be employed to diagnose and monitor heart\r\nfailure and heart function. The two main noninvasive\r\nSigns of Heart Failure During\r\nan Examination\r\nIn the heart\r\nâ—� Heart enlargement\r\nâ—� Increased heart rate (tachycardia)\r\nIn the lungs\r\nâ—� Crackling noises (rales) heard through a\r\nstethoscope indicating a buildup of fluid in the\r\nlungs\r\nâ—� Leakage of fluid from the lungs (pleural\r\neffusion) into the chest cavity\r\nIn other areas\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nSwelling (edema) of the skin and soft tissues,\r\nusually noted in the feet and ankles\r\nEdema of the lower back (sacral edema)\r\nBuildup of fluid of the abdominal cavity\r\n(ascites)\r\nincreased size of liver (hepatomegaly)\r\nAscites\r\ntechniques for this purpose are the echocardiogram\r\nand the radionuclide angiocardiogram. (See Chapter\r\n10.) Both tests can quantify the level of heart dysfunction\r\nand distinguish between generalized as opposed\r\nto regional dysfunction.\r\nIn cardiac catheterization, a thin tube is introduced\r\nthrough a vein or artery into the heart. The procedure\r\ndetermines whether there are blockages in the blood\r\nvessels and measures pressures in various chambers\r\nof the heart. (See Chapter 10.)\r\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a graphic\r\nrecord of the heartâ€™s electrical impulses; it can detect\r\nincreased wall thickness (called hypertrophy), heart\r\nenlargement, or various rhythm changes in heart failure.\r\nThe ECG may also be used to monitor the effects\r\nof drug treatments on the heart. Chest X-rays can\r\nalso detect an enlarged heart.\r\nCAUSES\r\nAn array of different problems can cause congestive\r\nheart failure. (See box, â€œCauses of Congestive Heart\r\nFailure.â€�) Among them is coronary (ischemic) heart\r\ndisease resulting from insufficient blood flow to the\r\nHEART FAILURE\r\nmyocardium, or heart muscle. This is usually caused\r\nby atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty substances or\r\nplaque on the walls of the arteries that carry blood\r\nto the heart muscle. The heartâ€™s ability to perform\r\ndecreases because ischemia results in the delivery of\r\nless oxygen and fewer nutrients to the heart muscle.\r\nA heart attack may also cause congestive failure.\r\nDuring a heart attack, the heart muscle is deprived\r\nof oxygen, resulting in tissue death and scarring. The\r\ndevelopment of heart failure depends on the extent\r\nand location of scarring. (See Chapter 15.)\r\nLong-standing high blood pressure is another\r\ncommon cause of heart failure. Because there is\r\ngreater resistance against which the heart must\r\npump, the heart muscle works harder. This results in\r\nan enlargement of the heart muscle, especially of the\r\nleft ventricle, the heartâ€™s main pumping chamber.\r\nEventually, this enlarged muscle tissue weakens, setting\r\nthe stage for heart failure, especially if the pumping\r\nability of the enlarged chamber greatly decreases.\r\nArrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) can lead to\r\nheart failure, but they usually have to be severe and\r\nprolonged, with a rapid rate of more than 140 beats\r\nper minute, and must often occur in the presence of\r\nan already weakened heart. They change the pattern\r\nof filling and pumping of blood from the heart. This\r\ncondition may also lower output of blood to the point\r\nof heart failure. (See Chapter 16.)\r\nDiseased heart valves are another cause of heart\r\nfailure, which results when a narrowed or leaking\r\nvalve fails to direct blood flow properly through the\r\nheart. The problem may be congenital (inborn) or due\r\nto an infection such as endocarditis or rheumatic fever.\r\nThis increases the heartâ€™s workload, thereby inCauses\r\nof Congestive Heart\r\nFailure (CHF)\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nâ—�\r\nCoronary (ischemic) heart disease resulting from\r\ninsufficient blood flow to the heart muscle\r\n(myocardium)\r\nA heart attack, resulting in acute damage and\r\nthen scarring of heart muscle tissue\r\nChronic high blood pressure\r\nMajor cardiac arrhythmia\r\nDiseased heart valve(s)\r\nDiseased heart muscle\r\nCongenital heart disease\r\nMAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\r\ncreasing risk of developing heart failure. (See\r\nChapter 13.)\r\nCardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle itself,\r\ncan also lead to heart failure. Causes of cardiomyopathy\r\ninclude infection, alcohol abuse, and\r\ncocaine abuse. When heart failure seems to have no\r\nknown causes, it is known as idiopathic heart failure.\r\n(See Chapter 15.)\r\nHOW THE BODY TRIES\r\nTO PROTECT ITSELF\r\nWhen one system of the body is not functioning optimally,\r\nother systems may attempt to take over to\r\nmake up for the problem. In the case of heart failure,\r\nseveral types of compensation are possible.\r\nFirst, the heart chambers may enlarge, and the\r\nheart may beat more forcefully to pump out more\r\nblood for the bodyâ€™s needs. In time, the overworked\r\nheart muscle enlarges (much as skeletal muscles grow\r\nlarger during weight muscle training), creating increased\r\nmuscle fibers with which the heart can pump\r\nmore forcefully.\r\nSecond, the heart may be stimulated to pump more\r\noften, thereby increasing its output.\r\nThird, a compensation mechanism called the\r\nrenin-angiotensin system maybe initiated. When the\r\nlack of blood volume coming from the heart (cardiac\r\noutput) results in a decrease in the amount passing\r\nthrough the kidneys, the kidneys respond by stimulating\r\nthe system to secrete hormones that prompt\r\nthe kidneys to retain salt and water, and thereby increase\r\nblood volume. This is an attempt to compensate\r\nfor the decrease in output of the heart. This leads\r\nto a rise in blood pressure as the body attempts to\r\ncirculate the extra fluid volume and also ensures that\r\nadequate oxygen reaches the brain, kidneys, and\r\nother vital organs.\r\nThese compensation mechanisms keep the failing\r\nheart functioning almost normally in the early stages\r\nof heart failure. As the disease progresses, however,\r\ncompensation mechanisms cannot maintain proper\r\ncirculation. It may take years for a heart to go through\r\nthe stages of enlarging, working harder, and finally\r\nbreaking down. In many cases, as when a person has\r\nhypertension, heart failure is preventable if blood\r\npressure is treated adequately.\r\nTREATMENT\r\nWhenever possible, the best treatment of congestive\r\nheart failure is one of prevention. This includes diagnosing\r\nand treating high blood pressure and attempting\r\nto prevent atherosclerosis. Other important\r\npreventive steps include not smoking, using alcohol\r\nin moderation if at all, and abstaining from cocaine\r\nand other illicit drugs. A prudent diet, regular exercise,\r\nand weight control are also important.\r\nWhen a patient is diagnosed as having heart failure,\r\nthe first treatment is often restriction of dietary\r\nsodium. Drugs may be prescribed as well. Diuretics,\r\navailable since the 1950s, are often used to help the\r\nkidneys get rid of excess water and sodium, thereby\r\nreducing blood volume and the heartâ€™s workload.\r\n(See Chapter 23.)\r\nDigitalis, a drug that has been used since the 18th\r\ncentury, is still a component of modern therapy. It is\r\nprescribed to strengthen the heartâ€™s pumping action.\r\nPatients taking both diuretics and digitalis may need\r\nto supplement their levels of potassium.\r\nNewer drugs for the treatment of heart failure include\r\nvasodilators, which cause the peripheral arteries\r\nto dilate, or open up. This reduces the work of the\r\nheart by making it easier for blood to flow. Among\r\nthe newest vasodilators used for heart failure are the\r\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,\r\nwhich may be used, along with diuretics, in patients\r\nwith mild-to-moderate or severe congestive failure.\r\nACE inhibitors, which include captopril (Capoten)\r\nand enalapril (Vasotec), block the production of a substance\r\ncalled angiotensin II, a potent constrictor of\r\nblood vessels. If blood vessels are dilated, the amount\r\nof work needed for the heart to pump blood forward\r\nis decreased.\r\nOther drugs used in the treatment of heart failure\r\ninclude calcium-channel blockers, which dilate blood\r\nvessels; beta blockers, which slow the heart (used\r\nonly in unusual circumstances); and medications that\r\naffect various heartbeat irregularities. Most cases,\r\nhowever, respond to diuretics and digitalis, especially\r\nwhen ACE inhibitors are added.\r\nSometimes, surgery proves effective. When heart\r\nfailure is due to valvular disease, surgical implantation\r\nof an artificial heart valve or valve repair may\r\nalleviate the problem. Surgery may also be helpful in\r\ncorrecting congenital heart defects that can lead to\r\nheart failure. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery\r\nand catheterization using a balloon to flatten fatty\r\nHEART FAILURE\r\ndeposits (called angioplasty) are among the therapeutic\r\ntechniques used to prevent and treat heart failure\r\ncaused by occluded, or blocked, arteries.\r\nHeart transplant are a last resort in treating severe\r\nheart failure caused by diseased heart muscle.\r\nAlthough the success rate of heart transplants has\r\nsignificantly improved, the cost of the operation and\r\nthe shortage of donor organs makes it impractical\r\nexcept as a last resort.\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\nThe outlook for most people with heart failure is dependent\r\nupon the cause of the heart failure and the\r\noverall degree of cardiac dysfunction. An estimated\r\n50 percent survive more than five years after diagnosis.\r\nThat figure, however, is an average of all patients\r\nwith varying levels of severity of the disease.\r\nThe prognosis for a specific person with heart failure\r\ndepends to a large degree on effects of the disease,\r\nsuch as the level of blood output of the left ventricle,\r\nor his or her ability to exercise, as well as other factors,\r\nincluding age, overall health, and other medical\r\nconditions. The sooner heart failure is diagnosed and\r\naction is taken to control the problem, the better.\r\nIn many cases, heart failure can be effectively\r\ntreated to prevent or slow the progression of the disease\r\nand to alleviate its symptoms. Therapy can\r\nachieve several goals: It can improve the performance\r\nof the left ventricle, prevent further deterioration of\r\nheart function, improve a patientâ€™s ability to exercise,\r\nand improve quality of life.\r\nIn addition, it is possible that in selected instances,\r\nearly, effective treatment may increase a personâ€™s\r\nlikelihood of improved survival.\r\n183'

In\r\nselected cases an implantable automatic defibrillator and/or resynchronisation therapy may be of\r\nadditional benefit. However, in some patients with end-stage heart failure these therapies are\r\ninsufficient. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can be an alternative in these subjects. The\r\ngoal of MCS is to support the circulation until transplantation (bridge to transplantation), or until\r\nthe heart recovers (bridge to recovery), or as a permanent treatment option. The third alternative,\r\nwhich is called destination therapy (DT), is a possible option for selected patients who are not\r\neligible for heart transplantation due to advanced age or comorbidities.\r\nQuestion at issue:\r\nDoes mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) reduce\r\nmorbidity, improve quality of life, and prolong survival in patients with end-stage heart failure\r\nnot eligible for heart transplantation in comparison to optimal medical treatment?\r\nPatients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO1 and PICO2)\r\nP = Patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure despite optimal medical treatment\r\nI1 = Left ventricular assist device with pulsatile flow (PF-LVAD)\r\nC1= Optimal medical treatment (OMT)\r\nI2 = Left ventricular assist device with continuous flow (CF-LVAD)\r\nC2= Left ventricular assist device with pulsatile flow (PF-LVAD)\r\nO = Survival, quality of life (QoL), functional capacity (NYHA classification, 6 minute walk test,\r\nexercise test) and biomarkers of heart failure. Complications such as infections,\r\nhaemorrhages, thromboembolic events, neuropsychological functions\r\nStudied risks and benefits for patients of the new health technology\r\nThe systematic literature search identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and one nonrandomised\r\ncontrolled study that have evaluated the effects of PF-LVAD in comparison to OMT,\r\nand one RCT and two non-randomised controlled studies that have evaluated the effects of PFLVAD\r\nin comparison to CF-LVAD in patients with terminal heart failure.\r\nPulsatile flow LVAD in comparison to optimal medical management (PICO1)\r\nConclusions: Pulsatile LVAD as destination therapy probably increases survival (GRADE\r\n??), and may improve the functional capacity (GRADE ????) in patients with terminal\r\nleft ventricular heart failure in comparison with OMT. It is uncertain whether the treatment has\r\nany effect on quality of life (GRADE ??????)\r\nContinuous flow LVAD in comparison to pulsatile flow LVAD (PICO2)\r\nConclusions: Continuous flow LVAD as destination therapy probably increases survival in\r\npatients with terminal left ventricular heart failure in comparison with PF-LVAD (GRADE\r\n??). While both PF and CF flow devices have been shown to improve quality of life and\r\nfunctional outcome compared to baseline, there is only low quality evidence that CF may improve\r\nquality of life more than PF (GRADE ????), and it is uncertain whether the effect on\r\nfunctional capacity differs between CF and PF. (GRADE ??????). \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 6(22)\r\nComplications\r\nLong-term MCS is hampered by several complications such as device malfunction, infections (20\r\n– 60 \%), bleeding (15 – 30 \%), thromboembolic events (5 – 25 \%) and right ventricular failure\r\n(10 – 40 \%). The rate of adverse events has steadily declined over time with improved techniques.\r\nEthical aspects\r\nIntroduction of a DT program raises several ethical issues. The self-esteem and self-image of the\r\nindividual patient probably vary between subjects, but may be affected in both positive and\r\nnegative ways. The patient will still be dependent on assistance from family members and/or\r\nhealth care providers, and the physical integrity is affected. Without additional economic\r\nresources there is a substantial risk that DT will reallocate current resources from the needs of\r\nother patient categories.\r\nEconomical aspects\r\nThe present cost for the currently most used continuous flow device, the HeartMate II, is 750 000\r\nSEK (about 82 000 €) with an additional 125 000 SEK (14 000 €) for necessary accessories. At\r\nSahlgrenska University hospital eight patients had a HeartMate II implanted as MCS for 12\r\nmonths or longer during 2010-2012. The average cost per patient for the first year was about 1.5\r\nmillion SEK (about 160 000 €).\r\nConcluding remark:\r\nTreatment with LVAD as DT increases survival in patients with terminal heart failure. It is costly\r\nand hampered by several serious complications. During the last decade costs have come down\r\nand the rate of complications have started to decline.\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 7(22)\r\nSwedish Summary of the Health Technology Assessment\r\nMekaniskt vänsterkammarstöd som permanent behandling vid terminal hjärtsvikt\r\nMetod och målgrupp:\r\nAvancerad hjärtsvikt behandlas huvudsakligen farmakologiskt. I utvalda fall kan en automatisk\r\ndefibrillator eller så kallad resynkroneringsterapi sättas in i hjärtat. Hos en del patienter med\r\nuttalad hjärtsvikt är dessa behandlingar emellertid inte tillräckligt effektiva. Ett alternativ är då\r\nmekaniskt cirkulationsstöd (MCS). Målet med MCS är att ge cirkulatoriskt stöd i väntan på\r\nhjärttransplantation (“bridge to transplantation?), eller tills hjärtfunktionen återhämtar sig (?bridge\r\nto recovery?), eller som permanent stödjande behandling. Det sistnämnda benämns “destination\r\ntherapy? (DT), och är en möjlig behandling hos utvalda patienter som på grund av ålder eller\r\nannan svår samtidig sjuklighet inte är kandidater för hjärt transplantation. Denna HTA-utredning\r\nomfattar denna sistnämnda patientgrupp.\r\nFrågeställning:\r\nMinskar vänsterkammarstöd med mekanisk cirkulatorisk terapi, “left ventricular assist devices\r\n(LVAD)? dödlighet och sjuklighet hos patienter med terminal hjärtsvikt, och förbättras deras\r\nlivskvalitet jämfört med optimal medicinsk behandling?\r\nPICO\r\nP = Patienter med svår kronisk vänsterkammarsvikt, trots optimal medicinsk behandling\r\nI1 = Mekaniskt vänsterkammarstöd för permanent bruk med pump som ger pulsativt flöde\r\n(PF-LVAD)\r\nC1 = Optimal medicinsk handläggning\r\nI2 = Mekaniskt vänsterkammarstöd för permanent bruk med pump som ger kontinuerligt\r\nflöde (CF-LVAD)\r\nC2 =Mekaniskt vänsterkammarstöd för permanent bruk med pump som ger pulsativt flöde\r\n(PF-LVAD)\r\nO = Överlevnad, livskvalitet, funktionsförmåga (NYHA, 6 MWT, arbetsprov) och andra\r\nmarkörer för hjärtsvikt, samt infektioner, blödningar, tromboembolism och\r\nneuropsykologiska funktioner\r\nKunskapsläge och evidensgradering:\r\nDen systematiska litteratursökningen identifierade en randomiserad kontrollerad studie (RCT)\r\noch en icke-randomiserad kontrollerad studie som analyserat effekten av PF-LVAD jämfört med\r\noptimal medicinsk behandling, och en RCT och två icke-randomiserade kontrollerade studier som\r\nanalyserat effekten av PF-LVAD jämfört med CF-LVAD hos patienter med terminal hjärtsvikt.\r\nLVAD med pulsativt flöde jämfört med optimal medicinsk behandling (PICO1)\r\nSlutsatser: I jämförelse med optimal medicinsk behandling förlänger LVAD med pulsativt flöde,\r\nsom ?destination therapy?, överlevnaden hos patienter med terminal hjärtsvikt (GRADE ??).\r\nBehandlingen kan förbättra patienternas funktionsförmåga (GRADE ????), men det är osäkert\r\nom den har någon effekt på livskvalitet (GRADE ??????).\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 8(22)\r\nLVAD med kontinuerligt flöde jämfört med LVAD med pulsativt flöde (PICO2)\r\nSlutsatser: I jämförelse med LVAD med pulsativt flöde förlänger LVAD med kontinuerligt flöde\r\növerlevnaden hos patienter med terminal hjärtsvikt (GRADE ??). Såväl livskvalitet som\r\nfunktionsförmåga förbättras troligen av båda behandlingarna men det vetenskapliga underlaget\r\nsom stöd för att CF-LVAD och PF-LVAD skiljer sig åt i effekt är begränsat (GRADE ????).\r\nDet är även osäkert om de har olika effekt på funktionsförmågan (GRADE ??????).\r\nKomplikationer\r\nLångtidsbehandling med MCS försvåras av flera olika komplikationer som pumpdysfunktion,\r\ninfektioner (20 – 60 \%), blödningar (15 – 30 \%), tromboemboliska händelser (5 – 25 \%)\r\nhögerkammarsvikt (10 – 40 \%). Parallellt med förbättrad teknik har frekvensen av olika bieffekter\r\nstadigt sjunkit under senare år.\r\nEtiska aspekter:\r\nEtt behandlingsprogram med MCS har ett antal etiska konsekvenser. Effekten på individens\r\nsjälvkänsla och självbild varierar sannolikt mellan olika patienter och de kan påverkas såväl\r\npositivt som negativt. Patienten kommer inte vara helt obereoende av andra utan förblir till viss\r\ndel beroende av hjälp från familjemedlemmar och hälso- och sjukvårdspersonal. Den fysiska\r\nintegriteten påverkas. Om inte nya ekonomiska resurser tillförs hälso- och sjukvården är risken\r\nstor att ett program med permanent MCS till patienter med terminal hjärtsvikt kommer att ta\r\nresurser för andra patientkategorier.\r\nEkonomiska aspekter:\r\nKostnaden för den idag mest använda CF-LVAD, HeartMate II, är 750 000 SEK. Ytterligare 125\r\n000 SEK tillkommer för nödvändiga tillbehör. På Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset har åtta\r\npatienter fått en HeartMate II inplanterad som MCS för längre än 12 månader under åren 2010-\r\n2012. Den genomsnittliga behandlingskostnaden per patient för det första året var cirka 1,5\r\nmiljoner SEK.\r\nSlutsatser:\r\nMekaniskt vänsterkammarstöd som permanent behandling kan förlänga överlevnaden hos\r\npatienter med terminal hjärtsvikt och minska 1-årsdödligheten med cirka 30 \% . Behandlingen är\r\nförenad med hög kostnad och försvåras av flera allvarliga komplikationer. Under senare år har\r\nkostnaderna minskat och även komplikationsfrekvensen har sjunkit.\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 9(22)\r\nAbbreviations\r\nACE Angiotensin converting enzyme\r\nBIVAD Biventricular assist device\r\nBTT Bridge to transplantation\r\nCF Continuous flow\r\nCPET Cardiopulmonary exercise test\r\nCRT Resynchronization therapy\r\nDT\r\nICD\r\nDestination therapy\r\nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator\r\nLVAD Left ventricular assisted device\r\nMCS Mechanical circulatory support\r\nNYHA New York Heart Association\r\nOMT Optimal medical treatment\r\nPF Pulsatile flow\r\nQALY Quality-adjusted life years\r\nQoL Quality of life\r\nRCT Randomised controlled trial\r\nRVAD Right ventricular assist device\r\nRVF Right ventricular failure\r\nVAD Ventricular assist device\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 10(22)\r\nThe Patient Category and the Present Treatment\r\nHeart failure and degree of severity\r\nHeart failure is a clinical syndrome attributable to disturbances in cardiac function. The\r\ndysfunctions may have various underlying causes. The heart failure syndrome is multifaceted and\r\nnot readily defined. Below are three definitions that describe heart failure from different\r\nviewpoints.\r\n1. Acute and hemodynamic viewpoint\r\n- a pathological state in which an abnormality of cardiac function is responsible for failure of\r\nthe heart to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing\r\ntissues, or to do so only from an elevated filling pressure. (Braunwald E. 1997)\r\n2. Chronic and neurohumoral viewpoint\r\n- a clinical syndrome characterized by abnormalities of left ventricular function and\r\nneurohormonal regulation, which are accompanied by effort intolerance, fluid retention and\r\nreduced longevity. (Packer M. 1992)\r\n3. Clinical and diagnostic viewpoint\r\n- a clinical syndrome in which patients have the following features: symptoms typical of\r\nheart failure and signs typical of heart failure and objective signs of a structural or functional\r\nabnormality of the heart at rest. (European Society of Cardiology 1995)\r\nThe syndrome is characterized by inability of the heart to maintain adequate blood flow and/or\r\nnormal filling pressures during physical activity or in later stages also at rest. A number of\r\nneurohumoral compensatory mechanisms are activated in order to maintain the circulation. Over\r\ntime they have a deleterious effect on the heart with further deterioration of cardiac function. A\r\nvicious cycle arises. If untreated this leads to a continuous decline of cardiac function and\r\nprogressive worsening of the symptoms. Clinical symptoms consist mainly of fatigue,\r\nbreathlessness and fluid retention. This frequently leads to hospitalisation. Quality of life is\r\nimpaired and mortality is high.\r\nDuring work up of a heart failure patient, it is important to evaluate the underlying cause of\r\ncardiac failure, the degree of cardiac dysfunction and the functional capacity of the patient.\r\nPharmacologic treatment is aimed at reducing the deleterious effects of neurohumoral activation\r\nand to alleviate fluid retention. In selected patients a pacemaker system may improve left\r\nventricular dyssynchrony and an implantable defibrillator can prevent sudden cardiac death. In\r\nterminal heart failure, mechanical circulatory assist devices or heart transplantation can be an\r\nalternative to palliative care.\r\nHeart failure is a serious condition with an increased\r\n risk of premature death\r\n risk of permanent illness or damage, or reduced quality of life\r\n risk of disability and impaired health-related quality of life\r\nThe prevalence and incidence of heart failure\r\nIn a recently published report the prevalence of chronic heart failure in Sweden was estimated to\r\n2 \% (Zarinkoub R et al. 2013). The mean age of heart failure patients was 77 years, and more than\r\n90 \% of the patients were 60 years or older. The estimated incidence rate of chronic heart failure\r\nwas 3.8/1000. The 5-year survival rate from first diagnosis was 48 \%, which is considerably\r\nlower than in the general Swedish population matched for age and sex (95\%).\r\nIn other community-based cohorts the annual survival rate in patients diagnosed with mild heart\r\nfailure (NYHA I-II) has been shown to be around 95 \%, whereas the 1-year survival rate for those\r\ndiagnosed with severe heart failure (NYHA IV) has been reported to below 50 \%. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 11(22)\r\nPresent treatment of heart failure\r\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, optimize cardiac function and increase longevity.\r\nThis can be achieved in most cases with the currently available treatment alternatives. They\r\ninclude different pharmacological, electric, mechanical and surgical options. On the other hand, it\r\nis also important to identify patients in the terminal phase of the disease, who are not suitable for\r\nadvanced treatment with devices, mechanical pumps or heart transplantation. These patients\r\nshould receive supportive and palliative care to provide relief from symptoms and other distress\r\nassociated with end-stage heart failure.\r\nPharmacological intervention is the cornerstone of heart failure treatment. It is well documented\r\nthat neurohumoral blockade of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angotensinaldosteron-system\r\nreduce symptoms, improve cardiac function and increase survival. Four\r\ndifferent pharmaceutical groups are currently recommended for treatment of heart failure; beta\r\nblockers, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralcorticoid receptor\r\nantagonists. Diuretics are frequently used to control fluid retention. Other drugs that sometimes\r\nare used are ivabradin (sinus node inhibitor), digoxin (inotropic agent), hydralazine and\r\nisosorbiddinitrate (vasodilators), and anticoagulant agents (thromboembolic prophylaxis).\r\nAbout one third of all patients with heart failure die suddenly, mainly due to a ventricular\r\ntachyarrhythmia. The implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) reduces mortality in\r\npatients with moderate to severe systolic heart failure. One third of patients with heart failure has\r\nan intraventricular conduction disturbance that can cause left ventricular dyssynchrony with less\r\nefficient ventricular emptying and, often, mitral regurgitation. Cardiac resynchronization therapy\r\n(CRT) can improve cardiac function in these patients, relieve symptoms, improve functional\r\ncapacity, and improve survival. Currently, patients who fulfil the criteria for CRT treatment most\r\noften also receive an ICD.\r\nAlso surgical interventions may be indicated for specific underlying or contributing causes of\r\nheart failure. These include revascularization in patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular\r\nsurgery in patients with valvular disease, and left ventricular reconstruction in patients with\r\nextensive scarring and remodelling of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction. For a small\r\nminority of heart failure patients heart transplantation may be indicated. The indication for heart\r\ntransplantation is terminal heart failure with severe symptoms, poor prognosis, and no remaining\r\ntreatment alternatives. However, due to organ shortage this treatment is only available to a limited\r\nnumber of patients (approximately 50 annually in Sweden).\r\nContraindications to a cardiac transplant are high pulmonary vascular resistance, active infection,\r\nwidespread atherosclerotic disease, drug abuse, malignant disease, recent thromboembolism,\r\nsignificant renal or liver disease, or other serious non-reversible co-morbidies. At Sahlgrenska\r\nUniversity Hospital 20-30 heart transplantations are performed each year including approximately\r\n5-7 recepients from the Region Västra Götaland.\r\nSelected patients with progressive heart failure in whom pharmacological and/or\r\nresynchronisation therapy are insufficient can be treated with mechanical circulatory support\r\n(MCS). The goal of MCS is to support the circulation until transplantation (bridge to\r\ntransplantation) or until the heart recovers (bridge to recovery), or to offer a permanent treatment\r\noption, which has been called destination therapy (DT). Presently, DT is not available as a\r\ntreatment alternative in routine clinical practice in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden. In countries\r\nsuch as USA and Germany the number of patients who receive MCS as DT has now exceeded\r\nthat of patients treated with heart transplantation. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 12(22)\r\nNumbers of patients per year who are candidates for LVAD as destination therapy\r\nPotential candidates for DT are patients with end-stage heart failure who are not considered\r\nsuitable for heart transplantation due to advanced age and/or severe co-morbidities.\r\nExamples of customary criteria for identification of end-stage heart failure are the following:\r\n Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35\%\r\n Max VO2 ≤ 14 ml/kg/min on cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)\r\n 6 minute walking distance ≤ 300 m\r\n More than one hospitalisation during 6 months\r\n Intolerance of ACE-inhibitors and/or beta-blockers\r\n Low systolic blood pressure (< 90 mmHg)\r\n Inotrope dependence in-hospital and difficult to wean\r\n Worsening renal and/or liver function\r\n Worsening right ventricular function.\r\nApart from advanced age, there are several co-morbidities that render heart failure patients\r\nineligible for heart transplantation, but not for treatment with destination therapy: Examples of\r\nsuch co-morbidities are: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2\r\n, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, cancer\r\ntreatment within 5 years, and reduced pulmonary, renal and/or liver function. However, only a\r\nsmall fraction of all patients with end-stage heart failure should be considered candidates for DT.\r\nFor example, it is vital that potential DT candidates are emotionally stable and able to comply\r\nwith MCS treatment. Absolute contraindications for MCS include active infection, widespread\r\natherosclerotic disease, terminal disease other than heart failure, dialysis, severe liver cirrhosis,\r\nalcohol or drug abuse, and untreated psychiatric disease.\r\nThus, identification of potential candidates for DT is a highly selective process. It is estimated\r\nthat around 5-10 patients would fulfil the criteria for DT each year in Region Västra Götaland.\r\nThe normal pathway of patients with terminal heart failure through the health care\r\nsystem\r\nPatients who are considered candidates for heart transplantation undergo a thorough in-hospital\r\nwork-up before they are discussed at a multidisciplinary board. The board consists of\r\ncardiologists, thoracic surgeons, thoracic anaesthesiologists, heart failure nurses and patient\r\ncoordinators. The work-up includes extensive laboratory investigations and a thorough\r\ninvestigation of cardiac function with echocardiography and cardiac catheterisation. Further\r\nfunctional capacity is evaluated with CPET and/or 6-minute walking test. Renal function is\r\nassessed by glomerular filtration rate and pulmonary function is estimated by spirometry. An\r\nodontologist evaluates the dental status.\r\nThe patients who are accepted for transplantation ofte receive MCS as bridge to transplantation.\r\nPatients that are declined heart transplantation due to advanced age or comorbidities continue to\r\nreceive conventional heart failure treatment, often combined with supportive and/or palliative\r\ncare.\r\nThe work-up and decision process for DT is very similar to that used for heart transplantation. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 13(22)\r\nThe New Health Technology – Left Ventricular Assisted Device\r\nDescription of left ventricular assisted device\r\nA ventricular assist device (VAD) is a mechanical circulatory device that is used to partially, or\r\ncompletely, replace the function of a failing heart. It takes blood from a ventricle of the heart and\r\npumps it to the circulation, and thereby secures perfusion of vital organs. A VAD can support the\r\nleft ventricle (LVAD), the right ventricle (RVAD), or both ventricles (BIVAD).\r\nA VAD consists of a small pump, a tube that carries blood from a heart ventricle into the pump,\r\nand another tube that carries the blood from the pump to either the pulmonary artery (RVAD) or\r\nthe aorta (LVAD). It also has a driveline that connects the pump to a power source through a\r\ncontrol unit. The figures illustrate a LVAD (Courtesy of Thoratec corporation).\r\nVADs can be divided into two main categories. Firstly, pulsatile flow (PF) pumps that mimic the\r\nnatural pulsing action of the heart (first generation VADs), and secondly, continuous flow (CF)\r\ndevices that generate continuous blood flow with either a centrifugal or an axial pump (second\r\ngeneration VADs). Patients treated with a VAD require life-long anticoagulation therapy in order\r\nto prevent thrombus formation and thromboembolic complications.\r\nThe group’s understanding of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy in\r\npatients with terminal heart failure\r\nThe use of LVADs for DT has steadily increased, especially in countries such as Germany,\r\nFrance, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and USA. In 2010 there were 79 destinationtherapy\r\ncentres in USA certified to perform implantation of LVADs. According to the\r\nINTERMACS registry (only including US patients) approximately 1000 patients received LVAD\r\nas DT-therapy in 2012, and another 800 patients received LVAD as bridge-to-transplantation\r\n(BTT).\r\nSome patients that initially have been regarded as excellent BTT candidates will eventually not\r\nbecome eligible for heart transplantation due to progression of co-morbidities or new\r\ncomplications. On the other hand, some patients being identified, as DT-candidates will after\r\nLVAD implantations improve in such a way that they become suitable for a cardiac\r\ntransplantation. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 14(22)\r\nIn 2012 approximately 700 patients had an LVAD implanted in Germany, and only 300 heart\r\ntransplantations were performed. This means that most patients with terminal heart failure receive\r\na LVAD initially, and later it is decided whether they should be listed for transplantation or\r\nremain on DT.\r\nThere is no Swedish VAD registry, but there is some information available on DT in Sweden\r\nfrom a company registry (Vingmed AB, the sales representative for Thoratec and the Heart Mate\r\nII). In total, 25 patients have received a LVAD (Heart Mate II) for DT in Sweden between 2005\r\nand 2013 (survival range 2 - 2216 days, mean age 63 years, 22 males, 18 patients had ischemic\r\ncardiomyopathy). Among these patients, six (24 \%) died within 90 days. The remaining 19\r\npatients have survived for a mean of 815 days (with 9 patients still alive). Six of the patients (24\r\n\%) patients eventually underwent heart transplantation, again underlining that DT patients on\r\nLVAD may improve to such an extent that they become suitable candidates for transplantation. It\r\nseems necessary to have a DT program in order to give all patients a chance to become\r\ntransplanted, even if the majority will remain on LVAD for the rest of their lives. Thus, DTtherapy\r\nas an entity and definition is slowly becoming obsolete. If permanent LVAD treatment is\r\nnot available, patients with transplant precluding comorbidities that might resolve during\r\nmechanical support will not get an opportunity for transplantation.\r\nDuring the last decade, the LVAD technology has progressed to become standard therapy in\r\nsome medical centres. It is important that all centres that provide DT use best-practice guidelines\r\nto maintain outcomes that are comparable to those of existing centres of excellence.\r\nThe ethical concerns raised by DT will require extensive information to patients and their\r\nfamilies, and also a detailed DT program that will meet the needs of patients and other family\r\nmembers. Examples of prerequisite conditions before introducing a program with destination\r\ntherapy include:\r\n1. Participation of a multidisciplinary care team, including palliative care specialists\r\n2.

The librarians conducted the literature\r\nsearches, selected studies, and independently assessed the obtained abstracts and\r\nmade a first selection of full-text articles for inclusion or exclusion. After reading\r\nthe articles in full text they made a second selection of articles. Any disagreements\r\nwere resolved in consensus. The articles that remained were sent to the other\r\nparticipants in the HTA group, who read the articles independently of one another,\r\nand then decided in a consensus meeting which articles that should be included.\r\nThe literature search identified a total of 1231 articles (after removal of duplicates).\r\nThe librarians then excluded 1095 articles after reading their abstracts. Another 136\r\narticles were excluded by the librarians after reading the articles in full text. The\r\nremaining 56 articles were sent to the group, and 26 of them were finally included\r\nin the report. There were two randomised controlled trials (RCT, four publications)\r\nand three non-randomised controlled studies (three publications). Twelve were case\r\nseries, five were systematic reviews, and two were health economy analyses. The\r\ncontrolled studies have been critically appraised using modified checklists from the\r\nSwedish Council on Health Technology Assessment regarding randomized\r\ncontrolled trials and cohort studies.\r\nThe present knowledge of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy\r\nin patients with terminal heart failure\r\nPICO 1 – comparison of PF-LVAD with OMT\r\nTwo HTA reports have concluded that LVAD with pulsatile flow improves survival\r\nand quality of life. One was published in 2005 by the NIHR Coordinating Centre for\r\nHealth Technology Assessment (NCCHTA) in Southampton, UK (Clegg AJ et al.\r\n2005), and the other in 2007 by the German Agency for HTA of German Institute of\r\nMedical Documentation and Information (Angermayr L et al. 2007).\r\nThe systematic literature search identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT)\r\nand one non-randomised controlled study that have studied the effects of PF-LVAD\r\nin comparison to OMT in patients with end-stage heart failure. In the RCT 61\r\npatients were treated with OMT and 68 patients were treated with the pulsatile\r\nLVAD HeartMate I. The trial had no major problems concerning directness, study\r\nlimitations or precision. The non-randomised study was smaller and the two study\r\ngroups were not balanced with regard to socio-economic status. The patients in the\r\ncontrol group consisted of patients who did not choose, or did not have the financial\r\nresources, to undergo LVAD implantation.\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 17(22)\r\nMortality (Appendix 4a)\r\nThe RCT reported a significantly (p< 0.01) higher one-year survival in the PFLVAD\r\ngroup (52 \%) compared to the OMT group (23 \%). The two-year survival\r\nrates were 23 \%, and 8 \% respectively (ns). In the non-randomised study, the\r\ncorresponding 1-year survival rates were 27 \% and 11\% (p>0.05).\r\nConclusion: Pulsatile LVAD as destination therapy probably increases survival in\r\ncomparison with OMT in patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure.\r\nModerate quality of evidence (GRADE ??).\r\nQuality of life (Appendix 4b)\r\nThe RCT analysed quality of life after one year using three different questionnaires.\r\nDue to the high mortality rate QoL-scores were only available in six OMT and 23\r\nPF-LVAD patients. The SF-36 Emotional role and Beck Depression Inventory\r\nscores were significantly better in the PF-LVAD group, but no difference between\r\nthe study groups was seen in Minnesota Living with heart Failure scores.\r\nConclusion: It is uncertain whether PF-LVAD improves the quality of life in\r\ncomparison with OMT in patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure.\r\nVery low quality of evidence (GRADE ??????)\r\nFunctional capacity (Appendix 4c)\r\nBoth the RCT and the non-randomised study analysed functional capacity after oneyear\r\nfollow-up. Due to the high mortality rate only six OMT-patients and 23\r\nLVAD-patients were tested in the RCT. Both the ability to “walk one block without\r\nany physical limitation? and SF-36 physical function score were significantly better\r\nin the PF-LVAD group than in the OMT group. In the non-randomised study 11 of\r\n18 patients in the OMT and 22 of 37 patients in the PF-LVAD group were evaluated\r\nby the NYHA classification. At the last assessment all patients in the OMT were\r\nstill in NYHA class IV, while 85 \% of the patients in the PF-LVAD group had\r\nimproved to NYHA class I-II.\r\nConclusion: PF-LVAD may improve the functional capacity in comparison with\r\nOMT in patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure.\r\nLow quality of evidence (GRADE ??????)\r\nPICO 2 – comparison of CF-LVAD with PF-LVAD\r\nTwo published reviews have assessed the effects of the newer continuous flow\r\ndevices (CF-LVAD) in patients with end-stage heart failure. One is a systematic\r\nreview from the Department of Veteran Affairs, US, published in 2011 (Rector TS\r\net al. 2012). It concludes that one single study provides moderate evidence that the\r\nuse of the HeartMate II LVAD increases patient survival, with fewer complications\r\nand fewer hospitalizations compared to the older pulsatile flow LVAD HeartMate I.\r\nThe other review is from Quebec (INESS) published in 2012 (Sas G et al. 2012). It\r\nconcludes that CF-LVAD can be considered a clinically effective therapeutic option\r\ncompared to optimal medical treatment for appropriate patients in both BTT and DT\r\npatients.\r\nThe systematic literature search identified one RCT and two non-randomised\r\ncontrolled studies that have studied the effects of PF-LVAD in comparison to CFLVAD\r\nin patients with end-stage heart failure. In the RCT the patients were\r\nrandomised in a 2:1 ratio. Thus, 134 patients received a continuous flow HeartMate\r\nII and 66 patients received a pulsatile flow HeartMate I. The study had some \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 18(22)\r\nproblems with directness and precision (see Appendix 7, SoF table). The two nonrandomised\r\ntrials had major problems, as most of the pulsatile LVADs were\r\nimplanted some years before the continuous flow devices came in use. Thus, the\r\npatient study groups with PF-LVADs must be regarded as historical controls.\r\nMortality (Appendix 5a)\r\nThe RCT reported a one-year survival of 68 \% in the CF-LVAD group and 55 \% in\r\nthe PF-LVAD group. The survival was significantly better ( p< 0.01) in the CFLVAD\r\ngroup after two years with a survival rate of 58 \% in comparison to 24 \% in\r\nthe PF-LVAD group. Both the non-randomised studies reported significantly higher\r\ntwo-year survival rates in the patients who received a CF-LVAD.\r\nConclusion: Continuous flow LVAD as destination therapy probably increases\r\nsurvival in patients with end-stage heart failure in comparison with pulsatile flow\r\nLVAD.\r\nModerate quality of evidence (GRADE ??).\r\nQuality of life (Appendix 5b)\r\nOnly the RCT analysed the quality of life. This was done after one year and two\r\nyears follow-up using two different questionnaires. However, the small numbers of\r\npatients at the two-year follow-up did not allow any meaningful analyses. QoL\r\nimproved in both LVAD groups in comparison to baseline. According to Minnesota\r\nLiving with Heart Failure questionnaire, QoL was significantly better in the CFLVAD\r\ngroup compared to the PF-LVAD group after one year, whereas the\r\ndifference in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire did not reach statistical\r\nsignificance (p = 0.06).\r\nConclusion: PF-LVAD may improve the quality of life in patients with end-stage\r\nleft ventricular heart failure in comparison with PF-LVAD.\r\nLow quality of evidence (GRADE ????)\r\nFunctional capacity (Appendix 5c)\r\nOnly the RCT analysed functional capacity. As for the QoL analyses, only the data\r\nat 12-month follow-up allowed a meaningful comparison. Both study groups\r\nexperienced early, and sustained, improvement of functional capacity. However,\r\nthere was no significant difference between the two groups.\r\nConclusion: It is uncertain whether CF-LVAD and PF-LVAD differ in their effects\r\non functional capacity.\r\nVery low quality of evidence (GRADE ??????).\r\nComplications (Appendix 6)\r\nLong-term MCS is hampered by several complications such as device malfunction,\r\ninfections, bleeding, thromboembolic events and right ventricular failure (RVF).\r\nThe rate of adverse events has steadily declined with improved techniques (second\r\ngeneration LVAD vs first generation).\r\nInfections are a significant problem. They often occur at the driveline exit site. The\r\nreported incidence is up to 40 \% per year (events/patient/year). Sepsis is also\r\ncommon with reported incidence rates varying from 20 \% to 60 \% in different\r\nstudies. Infections that involve the pump itself are uncommon, but are serious since\r\nlong-term eradication is nearly impossible.\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 19(22)\r\nBleeding events are common. Perioperative bleeding occurs, in particular in patients\r\nwith previous cardiac operations and/or coagulopathy related to hepatic dysfunction.\r\nRe-exploration due to a post-operative bleeding has been reported to be required in\r\n15 – 30 \%. Bleeding complications during long-term follow-up are also frequent, in\r\nparticular gastrointestinal bleeding, with incidence rates up to 50 \%\r\n(events/patient/year).\r\nPatients with LVADs may also suffer thromboembolic complications. The reported\r\nincidence of ischemic stroke varies between 5 - 25 \%. Pump thrombus may occur,\r\nand sometimes necessitates pump replacement if aggressive anticoagulation or\r\nthrombolytic therapies are not successful.\r\nIt is essential that the right ventricular function is adequate for an LVAD to function\r\nnormally. Right ventricular failure occurs in10 - 40 \% of patients who receive\r\nLVAD as bridge-to-transplantation.. The incidence of RVF in adequately selected\r\npatients for DT is not known. Treatment includes optimization of the right\r\nventricular function, management of pulmonary vasoconstriction, and in some cases\r\ntemporary support with a right ventricular assist device.\r\nOngoing research?\r\nA search in the ClinicalTrials database (www.clinicaltrials.gov) July 4, 2013, using the\r\nsearch terms (heart-assist device OR left ventricular assist device OR left ventricular\r\nassist system OR ventricular assist device OR VAD OR LVAD OR LVAS) AND\r\n(destination OR permanent OR non-transplant OR long-term OR ineligible OR \"not\r\nassist support devices\r\neligible\" OR \"not candidate\" OR non-candidate) identified 33 studies with regard to\r\nLVADs. Five studies were relevant for the present questions at issue.\r\nTwo studies will compare the CF-LVAD HeartMate II with optimal medical therapy.\r\nBoth of them are being performed in the USA. One of them is an RCT (REVIVE-IT), and\r\nit is currently recruiting patients. The estimated completion date is December 2016. The\r\nother study one is a non-randomised study that is ongoing. Its estimated completion date\r\nis December 2015.\r\nAnother two RCTs are ongoing. They compare either the LVADs Jarvik 2000 with Heart\r\nMate II (estimated completion date December 2016), or the HeartWear LVAD with “any\r\nother FDA approved LVAD? (estimated completion date May 2017). Both are being\r\nperformed in the USA. The former is still recruiting patients whereas the other is not.\r\nA fifth study is ongoing in Belgium. It is a non-randomised study that will compare the\r\nefficacy of HeartMate II with historical controls.\r\nWhich medical societies or health authorities recommend left ventricular assist devices as\r\ndestination therapy in patients with terminal heart failure?\r\nIn the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and\r\nchronic heart failure 2012 DT it is recommended for highly selected patients, who have end-stage\r\nheart failure despite optimal pharmacological and device therapy, and who are not suitable for\r\nheart transplantation, but are expected to survive over one year with good functional status, to\r\nimprove symptoms, and reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and of premature death\r\n(Eur Soc Cardiol. 2012) \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 20(22)\r\nThe 2013 ACCF/ American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure\r\nalso recommended DT with durable MCS to prolong survival for carefully selected patients with\r\nstage D heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ACCF/AHA 2013).\r\nIn the Swedish National Guidelines for Cardiovascular Diseases from 2008 it is concluded that\r\nDT may improve survival, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with advanced heart\r\nfailure (NYHA IIIB-IV) that receive OMT and are not eligible for heart transplantation\r\n(Socialstyrelsen 2008). However, the ratio of cost to quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was\r\nconsidered to be very high. In these guidelines, which are those available in Sweden today, DT is\r\nnot recommended for routine use. Instead it is advocated that further results from on-going\r\nstudies should be awaited.\r\nEthical Aspects\r\nSee Appendix 8\r\nOrganisation\r\nWhen can left ventricular assist device for destination therapy be put into practice at the\r\nhospital?\r\nImmediately.\r\nIs left ventricular assist device for destination therapy used in other hospitals in Region\r\nVästra Götaland, Sweden?\r\nNo. At the present, DT is not available for patients with end-stage heart failure in Region Västra\r\nGötaland. In the Stockholm Region there is currently a treatment program with DT, and up until\r\nnow a total of 15-20 patients have received this treatment (Dr LH Lund, Karolinska University\r\nHospital, Stockholm, Sweden, personal communication October 2013).\r\nWill there be any consequences of left ventricular assist device for destination therapy for\r\nthe personnel?\r\nCurrently, mechanical circulatory support systems are frequently utilized as BTT, and the\r\nhospital personnel are already familiar with the treatment. Introduction of DT would lead to an\r\nincreased number of patients with long-term follow-up.\r\nWill there be any consequences for other clinics or supporting functions at the hospital or\r\nin the whole Region Västra Götaland?\r\nYes. Initial, follow-up of the patients will take place at the outpatient clinic of the Department\r\nof Cardiology Sahlgrenska Hospital. Later on follow-up visits will also be necessary at the local\r\nhospitals. However, there will only be a few patients (less than 10) requiring follow-up during\r\nthe first years after the initiation of a DT program. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 21(22)\r\nEconomy Aspects\r\nPresent costs of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device\r\nThe current cost for the CF-LVAD HeartMate II implant kit is 750,000 SEK\r\n(82,000 €), and for accessories 125,000 SEK (14 000 €).\r\nDuring 2010-2012, 8 patients had an implanted HeartMate II as mechanical circulatory support\r\nfor 12 months or longer. The average cost for the first year was about 1.5 million SEK\r\n(including the cost of the implant kit and accessories) ranging between 1.4-2.7 million SEK\r\n(153,000 – 295,000 €). The cost was related to the number of in-hospital days, especially the\r\nnumber of days in the intensive care unit. The average length of hospital stay was 50.5 days\r\n(range 29-95).\r\nAs a comparison, three patients with terminal heart failure (NYHA class III-IV) who have been\r\nfollowed for more than one year with OMT were identified. The costs for these patients\r\nbetween June 2011 to May 2012, i.e. one year, were 132,000 SEK (14,000 €) , 759,000 SEK\r\n(144,000 €) and 1,909,000 SEK (208,000 €), respectively. Also in these cases the yearly\r\ncosts was directly related to the length of hospital stay (range: 17- 134 days).\r\nIn the calculations of the costs for CF-LVAD and OMT above, the costs of home care are not\r\nincluded (due to different management systems).\r\nIn 2010, the average cost for heart transplantation was approximately 1.25 million SEK\r\n(136,000 €). This includes only the surgical procedure and the postoperative hospital stay. The\r\ncosts of follow-up and later hospitalisations are not included.\r\nExpected costs of left ventricular assist device in patients with terminal heart failure\r\nSee 9a.\r\nTotal change of cost of left ventricular assist device in patients with terminal heart failure\r\nThe cost of 10 patients treated with LVAD (see 2d) during the first year is estimated to be about\r\n15 million SEK. Assuming that the corresponding cost for a patient treated with OMT is\r\n750,000 SEK, the change in cost will be an increase of 7.5 million SEK.\r\nSince patients with LVAD are expected to live longer this will add further increments in the\r\ntotal costs during the following years. It is difficult to estimate this additional cost.\r\nCan the use of left ventricular assist device in patients with terminal heart failure be\r\nadopted and used within the present clinic budget?\r\nNo.\r\nAre there any available analyses of health economy? Cost advantages or disadvantages?\r\nThere is no Swedish cost-effectiveness analysis.\r\nIn the German HTA report (Angermayer 2007), which was based predominately on studies of\r\nthe first generation LVADs, i.e. PF-LVADS, the conclusion was that “the incremental costs per\r\nquality-adjusted life years (QALYs) may be between 200 000 and 600 000 € for DT?. Similar \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 22(22)\r\nconclusions were made in a British expert review from 2008 that could identify four published\r\ncost-effectiveness studies (Hutchinson 2008). However, they also pointed out that the\r\nmethodological quality in the majority of the studies was poor, as was their generalizability.\r\nA Canadian HTA report published in 2012 concluded that the cost-effectiveness of Heart Mate\r\nII was “unfavourable? regardless of the initial indication (Sas 2012). However, the conclusions\r\nwere based predominantly on experiences of HeartMate II and mostly as BTT. Since these\r\npatients relatively soon get a transplant, the real cost benefit of the LVAD is therefore\r\nunderestimated when data are extrapolated to the DT indication.\r\nThere have been no studies that directly have compared CF-LVADS with OMT. Rogers et al.\r\nused data from the REMATCH trial and the Heart Mate II trial to indirectly estimate the costeffectiveness\r\nof using the CF-LVAD Heart Mate II (Rogers 2012). Compared with medical\r\nmanagement the CF-LVAD had higher 5-year costs ($360 407 versus $62 856) and QALYs\r\n(1.87 vs 0.37). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the CF-LVAD was estimated to be\r\n$198 184 per QALY (this corresponds to about 1.2 million SEK/QALY).\r\nUnanswered Questions\r\nImportant gaps in scientific knowledge\r\nThere are no published RCTs that have compared the outcomes of modern CF-LVADs with OMT\r\nwith regard to survival, functional capacity, or quality of life. Such a trial would presently be of\r\ngreat interest, since pharmacological treatment, resynchronization therapy, and the overall\r\nmanagement of heart failure have improved during the last decade (after the publication of the\r\nRCT that initially compared PF-LVAD with OMT). It is of interest to point out that such a trial is\r\npresently considered unethical in the USA.\r\nIs there any interest in your own clinic/research group/organisation to start studies/trials\r\nwithin the research field at issue?\r\nYes. We are interested in starting a prospective, randomized multicentre trial in Sweden\r\nevaluating the HeartMate II® LVAD versus OMT in patients with severe heart failure (NYHA\r\nIIIb-IV) that are not eligible for heart transplantation. In such a study we would aim to include\r\n100-120 patients and randomize them to HM II or OMT in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome\r\nwould be a composite endpoint of survival, freedom from debilitating stroke and improved\r\nfunctional capacity. Patient recruitment would be expected to take 18 months and each\r\nincluded patient would be followed for 18 months.\r\nThe Departments of Cardiology and Thoracic Surgery at all Swedish University Hospitals have\r\nshown interest in such a study and are willing to participate. A reference group with\r\nparticipants from all university hospitals has been engaged to work on a study protocol. The\r\ninitial response from the LVAD industry (Thoratec) has been positive and negotiations with\r\nrespect to specific terms regarding such a study are ongoing. The project will, however, need\r\nadditional funding and applications for study grants are being prepared. \r\n\r\nAppendix 1, Search strategy, study selection and references –\r\nQuestion(s) at issue:\r\nDoes mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) reduce\r\nmorbidity, improve quality of life, and prolong survival in patients with terminal heart failure,\r\nin comparison to optimal medical treatment?\r\nPICO: (P=Patient I=Intervention C=Comparison O=Outcome)\r\nPICO 1\r\nP = Patients with terminal left ventricular heart\r\nfailure despite optimal medical treatment\r\nI = Implantation of a left ventricular assist device\r\nwith pulsatile flow (PF-LVAD)\r\nC = Optimal medical treatment (OMT)\r\nO = Survival, quality of life (QoL), functional\r\ncapacity (NYHA classification, 6 minute walk\r\ntest, exercise test) and biomarkers of heart\r\nfailure.

From the patient\'s perspective, how does destination therapy (DT) affect the patient\'s\r\nquality of life and life expectancy?\r\nThe patient will have a longer life expectancy, probably with better quality of life and\r\nfunctional capacity. In addition, DT may resolve the contraindication to heart transplantation\r\nand thereby restore transplant eligibility, with further expected improvement in quality of life\r\nand life expectancy.\r\n2. How severe is the patient\'s need that the DT must meet?\r\nThe mortality of end stage heart failure is very high, and it is associated with severely reduced\r\nfunctional capacity, poor quality of life and frequent hospitalisations. The 1-year survival for\r\npatients diagnosed with severe heart failure (NYHA IV) on optimal medical treatment is\r\nbelow 50 \%.\r\n3. Does DT influence the view on humanity or human dignity?\r\nNo, probably not from the view of other individuals. However, to have a mechanical device\r\nimplanted in your own body may affect the subject’s self-esteem and self-image.\r\n4. Can DT affect the patient’s ability and possibility to be independent?\r\nDT is likely to improve the functional capacity and, thereby, the independency of the patient.\r\nHowever, continuous need for electric power either from a power base unit or from batteries\r\nmay in other ways limit independency. The patient will also need assistance to change the\r\nbandages around the driveline. Thus, total independence will not be achieved.\r\n5. If implemented, does DT require any special steps to not compromise the patient\'s\r\nautonomy?\r\nDT is likely to introduce a specific challenge to the patient with respect to autonomy. In this\r\nrespect it is important to inform the patient extensively about the treatment, including\r\npotential benefits and risks. Also, of importance for the patient’s autonomy is that the DT\r\nprogram should include the following:\r\n1. Participation of a multidisciplinary care team, including palliative care specialists\r\n2. Adopting a concise plan of care for anticipated device-related complications\r\n3. Planning for anticipated end-of-life care and timing of device deactivation\r\n6. How does DT affect the patient’s physical, moral and personal integrity?\r\nThe moral and personal integrity will most probably not be negatively affected by DT.\r\nHowever the physical integrity is interrupted by the highly invasive nature of the implantation\r\nprocedure.\r\n7. Is DT cost-effective?\r\nAttempts to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DT have reported that incremental costs per\r\nquality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are very high. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of DT is\r\nquestionable.\r\n8. How does DT affect resources?\r\nDT is a costly treatment. Except for the costs of the device and accessories, DT requires the\r\nuse of operation rooms, beds in the intensive care units (sometimes for long periods of time),\r\nmany days in the hospital wards, and frequent outpatient follow-up visits. DT complications\r\nwill also use resources for clinical work-up and treatment. All of this will compete with the\r\nneeds of other patient categories. Thus, unless additional resources can be provided there is a\r\nsubstantial risk that DT will reallocate current resources from other medical needs. \r\nAppendix 8 Ethical analysis\r\n9. Is DT in conflict with professional values?\r\nIn our opinion, the benefits of DT in highly selected patients will outweigh its risks and,\r\ntherefore, are not in conflict with professional values.\r\n10. Does DT change the role of the professional in relation to the patient?\r\nDT is demanding for patients and their families. The patient must be able to comply with the\r\nsystem, e.g. exchange batteries, and interpret and react to signals from the system monitor.\r\nThe bandages around the driveline exit site must be changed regularly with an aseptic\r\ntechnique.\r\n11. Does DT affect, or does it put any new demands on, a third party?\r\nDT is likely to be challenging for the patient’s family, already from the postoperative phase\r\nand during rehabilitation when the patient is getting accustomed to a new life situation. The\r\ntreatment also demands frequent follow-up visits. Bandage exchanges around the driveline\r\nexit site requires assistance. This is often performed by family members or by professional\r\nhealth care providers.\r\n12. Is there any legislation of relevance with regard to DT?\r\nNo.\r\n13. Is there any risk of conflict between DT and values of the society, or values of\r\ndifferent groups?\r\nTo prolong life with a mechanical device may be in conflict with the beliefs and norms of\r\nsome groups in our society.\r\n14. Is there a risk that an introduction of DT will cause a conflict with particular\r\ninterests?\r\nNo, probably not.\r\n15. Can an introduction of DT influence the trust of the health care system?\r\nDT is a high-risk treatment for severely debilitated patients and may generate several\r\ncomplications. Thus, in order to maintain the credibility of the health care system it is of\r\nutmost importance to inform patients and their families about both the benefits and the risks\r\nof the treatment. Also, prerequisite algorithms for clinical work-up, treatment of possible\r\ncomplications, and other difficult situations that may arise should be established before a DT\r\nprogram is adopted.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nIntroduction of a DT program raises several ethical issues. The self-esteem and self-image of\r\nthe individual patient probably varies between subjects, but may be affected in both positive\r\nand negative ways. The patient will still be dependent on assistance from family members\r\nand/or health care providers, and the physical integrity is affected. Without additional\r\neconomic resources there is a substantial risk that DT will reallocate current resources from\r\nthe needs of other patient categories. \r\nHTA-centrum\r\nSahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset\r\nHTA\r\nHealth technology assessment (HTA) is the systematic\r\nevaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health\r\ncare technologies, i.e. interventions that may be used to\r\npromote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for\r\nrehabilitation or long-term care. It may address the direct,\r\nintended consequences of technologies as well as their\r\nindirect, unintended consequences. Its main purpose is to\r\ninform technology-related policymaking in health care.\r\nTo evaluate the quality of evidence the Centre of Health Technology Assessment in Region Västra Götaland is\r\ncurrently using the GRADE system, which has been developed by a widely representative group of international\r\nguideline developers. According to GRADE the level of evidence is graded in four categories:\r\nHigh quality of evidence = (GRADE )\r\nModerate quality of evidence = (GRADE O)\r\nLow quality of evidence = (GRADE OO)\r\nVery low quality of evidence = (GRADE OOO)\r\nIn GRADE there is also a system to rate the strength of recommendation of a technology as either “strong? or\r\n“weak?. This is presently not used by the Centre of Health Technology Assessment in Region Västra Götaland.\r\nHowever, the assessments still offer some guidance to decision makers in the health care system. If the level of\r\nevidence of a positive effect of a technology is of high or moderate quality it most probably qualifies to be used in\r\nroutine medical care. If the level of evidence is of low quality the use of the technology may be motivated\r\nprovided there is an acceptable balance between benefits and risks, cost-effectiveness and ethical considerations.\r\nPromising technologies, but a very low quality of evidence, motivate further research but should not be used in\r\neveryday routine clinical work.\r\nChristina Bergh, Professor, MD.\r\nHead of HTA-centrum\r\nRegion Västra Götaland, HTA-centrum\r\nHealth Technology Assessment\r\nRegional activity-based HTA\r\n\r\nFrom operations or activity/management:\r\nQuestion\r\nClinic-based\r\nHTA\r\n• Training\r\n• Search, sort, and\r\nselect process\r\n• Advice, help,\r\nassistance\r\n• Feedback\r\nQuality assurance Support process\r\nprocess\r\nMain process\r\nExternal\r\nreview\r\nSummarized\r\nassessment\r\nQuality assured decision rationale\r\nFormally\r\ndesignated\r\ngroup for\r\nquality assurance\r\nSahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, HTA-centrum\r\nRöda Stråket 8, 413 45 Göteborg\r\nwww.sahlgrenska.se/hta-centrum'
