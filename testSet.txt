TI  - Adjuvant Use of Ivabradine in Acute Heart Failure due to Myocarditis.

LID - 10.1155/2011/203690 [doi]
AB  - We report two cases of young men in whom acute heart failure due to myocarditis
      was diagnosed. The patients had been transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU)
      with commencing symptoms of acute heart failure and consecutive multiorgan
      failure for further treatment and to evaluate the indication for implantation of 
      a ventricular assist device or for high urgent orthotopic heart transplantation. 
      In both patients, the I(f)-channel inhibitor ivabradine was administered
      off-label to provide selective heart rate reduction, and thus support hemodynamic
      stabilization. Though currently considered off-label use in patients suffering
      from severe hypotension and acute heart failure, the use of ivabradine may
      beneficially influence outcome by allowing optimization of the patient's heart
      rate concomitant to initial measures of clinical stabilization.

TI  - Medical and psychosocial predictors of mechanical circulatory support device
      implantation and competing outcomes in the Waiting for a New Heart Study.
PG  - 16-26
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.07.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical and psychosocial factors are related to 1-year outcomes in
      the Waiting for a New Heart Study. With increased use of mechanical circulatory
      support devices (MCSD) over the course of the study, we can now evaluate these
      variables as predictors of MCSD in an extended follow-up. METHODS: Analyses
      focused on 313 MCSD-free patients (82% men; aged 53 +/- 11 years) newly listed
      for heart transplantation (HTx). Variables assessed at time of listing included
      psychosocial risk (depression, social isolation), quality of life, waiting list
      stress, and medical risk (Heart Failure Survival Score, pulmonary capillary wedge
      pressure). Cumulative incidence functions and cause-specific Cox models examined 
      the association of medical and psychosocial risk (low: non-depressed and socially
      integrated; medium: depressed or socially isolated; high: depressed and socially 
      isolated) with time until MCSD, considering covariates and competing outcomes
      (death, high-urgency transplantation [HU-HTx], elective HTx, and delisting due to
      clinical improvement or deterioration). RESULTS: Psychosocial risk groups were
      comparable regarding demographics, medical parameters, and quality of life, but
      differed in waiting list-related stressors. During follow-up (median, 326; range,
      5-1,849 days), 26 patients received MCSD, 53 died, 144 underwent HTx (103 in HU
      status), and 53 were delisted (15 deteriorated, 31 improved). Non-depressed and
      socially integrated patients did not require MCSD. Controlling for medical risk, 
      psychosocial risk significantly contributed to MCSD, HU-HTx, and improvement;
      medical risk and female gender predicted death (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Psychosocial risk at time of listing affects the prognosis of HTx candidates
      beyond medical risk. Psychosocial interventions may help to stabilize patients'
      health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A multicenter clinical trial conducted from 2005 to 2008 of a
      continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) resulted in Food and Drug
      Administration approval for bridge to transplantation. The purpose of this
      analysis was to determine changes in posttrial outcomes in widespread commercial 
      use since the clinical trial. METHODS: We compared outcomes of 486 patients who
      received a continuous flow LVAD as a bridge to transplantation at 36 centers
      during the clinical trial (March 2005 to April 2008) with outcomes of 1,496
      posttrial patients who received a continuous flow LVAD at 83 centers (April 2008 
      to September 2010 as reported to the Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support). RESULTS: Baseline data were comparable between
      groups. Cumulative follow-up was 511 and 1,082 patient-years for trial and
      posttrial patients, respectively, and average support duration was 12.6 +/- 14.0 
      and 8.7 +/- 7.1 months. Kaplan-Meier survival improved at 1 year from 76% (trial)
      to 85% (posttrial). The percentage of patients undergoing transplantation in the 
      first year decreased from 48% in the trial period to 39% in the posttrial period.
      Quality of life metrics improved by 3 months in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The
      survival rate of a large group of continuous flow LVAD patients in a real-world
      setting after Food and Drug Administration market approval for bridge to
      transplantation has improved since the clinical trial. These data show that
      excellent outcomes have been maintained with dissemination of new LVAD technology
      from a clinical trial phase to more broad based use in the period after market
      approval.

      dual device biventricular support system.
PG  - 256-65
LID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2011.01344.x [doi]
AB  - The use of rotary left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has extended to
      destination and recovery therapy for end-stage heart failure. Incidence of right 
      ventricular failure while on LVAD support requires a second device be implanted
      to support the failing right ventricle. Without a commercially available
      implantable rotary right ventricular assist device, rotary LVADs are cannulated
      into the right heart and operation modified to provide suitable support for the
      pulmonary system. While this approach can alleviate the demand for transplant
      through long-term biventricular support, it uncovers a new challenge with respect
      to controller strategies for these dual device support systems. This study
      compares the preload sensitivity of rotary, dual device biventricular assistance 
      controllers in light of their ability to adjust the flow rate according to
      physiological demand. A Frank-Starling-like flow controller which requires both
      inlet pressure and flow sensors is compared to pressure controllers which
      maintain atrial or inlet cannula pressures through the use of a single pressure
      sensor. It was found that cannula selection and the location of a pressure
      controller's single pressure sensor can be tailored to adjust the preload
      sensitivity. When located within the atria, this sensitivity is effectively
      infinite. Moving the sensor to the base of a 450-mm cannula, however, decreased
      the sensitivity to 0.22 (L/min)/mm Hg. This indicates the potential for simple
      and reliable VAD controllers with increased preload sensitivity without the need 
      for complex controllers requiring an array of hemodynamic sensors.

TI  - Dofetilide reduces the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator therapies.
PG  - 296-301
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2011.02183.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and
      ventricular arrhythmias leading to ICD therapies have poor clinical outcomes and 
      quality of life. Antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation are needed to
      control these arrhythmias. Dofetilide has only been approved for the treatment of
      atrial fibrillation. The role of dofetilide in the control of ventricular
      arrhythmias in patients with an ICD has not been established. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of dofetilide in a consecutive group of patients with an 
      ICD and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/ or ventricular fibrillation
      (VF) after other antiarrhythmic drugs have failed to suppress these arrhythmias. 
      METHODS: We studied 30 patients (age 59 +/- 11; 5 women) with symptomatic VT or
      VF and ICDs for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. These patients had 
      an average of 1.8 +/- 4.5 episodes of VT/VF per month despite antiarrhymic
      therapy. Twenty-one patients (70%) had recurrent appropriate ICD therapies prior 
      to initiation of dofetilide, and 9 (30%) VTs below the programmed detection rate 
      of the ICD. Twenty-three patients (77%) had coronary artery disease. Mean
      ejection fraction was 30 +/- 14% and 26/30 (87%) had congestive heart failure.
      All patients had previously failed 2 +/- 1 antiarrhythmic drugs including
      amiodarone (n = 19) and sotalol (n = 10). RESULTS: During the first month of
      treatment, 25 patients (83%) had complete suppression of VT/VF and of the 21
      patients with ICD therapies 16 (76%) had no therapies during the first month of
      treatment. During a follow-up period of 32 +/- 32 months, dofetilide reduced the 
      monthly episodes of VT/VF from 1.8 +/- 4.5 to 1.0 +/- 3.5 (P = 0.006). Monthly
      ICD therapies decreased from 0.9 +/- 1.4 to 0.4 +/- 1.7 (P = 0.037). In 9
      patients that presented with slow VTs under the ICD detection zone, dofetilide
      reduced monthly VT/VF episodes from 0.7 +/- 0.6 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 (P = 0.01) and 6
      (67%) had no further ICD therapies. Dofetilide was discontinued in 13 patients
      (43%) after 24 +/- 30 months due to failure to control VT/VF (n = 7), placement
      of a left ventricular assist device (n = 3), catheter ablation (n = 1), heart
      transplantation (n = 1), and left ventricular restoration surgery (n = 1). There 
      were 7 documented deaths (2 patients died suddenly; 3 patients of progressive
      heart failure; and 2 of non-cardiac causes). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an ICD
      and ventricular arrhythmias, dofetilide decreases the frequency of VT/VF and ICD 
      therapies even when other antiarrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, have
      previously been ineffective. Recurrences still occur in some patients requiring
      catheter ablation, mechanical support, or heart transplantation.

AB  - Experience with patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      implantation with preexisting mitral valve prostheses is limited. Patients with
      mechanical heart valves might have an increased risk of thromboembolism; in
      patients with biologic valves, there might be a risk of structural deterioration 
      of the leaflets. Out of 597 patients supported with a LVAD system between 2000
      and 2009, 18 patients had mitral valve surgery prior to implantation. We excluded
      all patients below 18 years of age, those with postcardiotomy failure, and
      patients who had had mitral valve reconstruction. Only 1% of the studied patient 
      population (n= 6) had mitral valve replacement. The mitral valve implantation has
      been performed 7.4 +/- 9.4 years prior to LVAD insertion. None of the valves (one
      biologic, five mechanical) were exchanged or explanted. LVAD implantation was
      done either with left lateral thoracotomy (n= 5) or with midline resternotomy (n=
      1). Temporary right ventricular assist device support was necessary in one case
      (16.6%); 30-day mortality was 16.6% (n= 1). Median support time was 14 +/- 15
      months. Two patients received heart transplantation after 6 and 26 months on the 
      device; four patients died on mechanical circulatory support after 1, 2, 5, and
      40 months. No valve or pump thrombosis or other clinically relevant
      thromboembolic events were observed. Only a small number of patients (1%) had a
      preexisting mitral valve prosthesis prior to LVAD implantation. No severe adverse
      events were observed when the prosthesis was left in place. Attention should be
      paid to the anticoagulation regime.

AB  - AIM: Cardiogenic shock is associated with high mortality. We report our
      experience with the short-term left ventricular axial pump Impella LP5.0 in nine 
      patients with severe ischaemic heart failure. METHODS: Six patients (group 1)
      presented with cardiogenic shock at the acute phase of an ST elevation myocardial
      infarction. Three patients (group 2) had severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy with
      temporary contra-indication to LVAD or transplantation. We measured haemodynamic 
      and metabolic variables up to 96hours and recorded morbidity, mechanical pump
      failures, and mortality up to one year postimplantation. RESULTS: In all patients
      the Impella LP5.0 was safely placed through the right subclavian artery. Cardiac 
      power output increased from 0.64 (0.07) W to 0.94 (0.44) W and 1.02 (0.30) W at
      24 and 72hours, respectively. The Impella LP5.0 remained in place for 12 (7.2)
      days. In group 1, five patients were in INTERMACS Profile 3 at the time of pump
      insertion. Three could be weaned and survived. One patient in INTERMACS Profile 1
      died of intractable heart failure within hours. In group 2, two of three patients
      underwent heart transplantation. Haemorrhage requiring transfusions was observed 
      in four patients but only one case was directly related to the Impella LP5.0.
      CONCLUSION: Left ventricular assistance with the Impella LP5.0 appears to be well
      tolerated. It may be especially useful in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock who achieve INTERMACS Profile 3 with 
      initial treatment.

TI  - Myostatin is elevated in congenital heart disease and after mechanical unloading.
PG  - e23818
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0023818 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass whose
      activity is upregulated in adult heart failure (HF); however, its role in
      congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. METHODS: We studied myostatin and
      IGF-1 expression via Western blot in cardiac tissue at varying degrees of
      myocardial dysfunction and after biventricular support in CHD by collecting
      myocardial biopsies from four patient cohorts: A) adult subjects with no known
      cardiopulmonary disease (left ventricle, LV), (Adult Normal), (n = 5); B)
      pediatric subjects undergoing congenital cardiac surgery with normal RV size and 
      function (right ventricular outflow tract, RVOT), (n = 3); C) pediatric subjects 
      with worsening but hemodynamically stable LV failure [LV and right ventricle (LV,
      RV,)] with biopsy collected at the time of orthotopic heart transplant (OHT), (n 
      = 7); and D) pediatric subjects with decompensated bi-ventricular failure on
      BiVAD support with biopsy collected at OHT (LV, RV, BiVAD), (n = 3). RESULTS: The
      duration of HF was longest in OHT patients compared to BIVAD. The duration of
      BiVAD support was 4.3+/-1.9 days. Myostatin expression was significantly
      increased in LV-OHT compared to RV-OHT and RVOT, and was increased more than
      double in decompensated biventricular HF (BiVAD) compared to both OHT and RVOT.
      An increased myostatin/IGF-1 ratio was associated with ventricular dysfunction.
      CONCLUSIONS: Myostatin expression in increased in CHD, and the myostatin/IGF-1
      ratio increases as ventricular function deteriorates. Future investigation is
      necessary to determine if restoration of the physiologic myostatin/IGF-1 ratio
      has therapeutic potential in HF.

TI  - Implantation of a Jarvik 2000 left ventricular assist device as a bridge to
      eligibility for refractory heart failure with renal dysfunction.
PG  - 83-6
LID - 10.1007/s10047-011-0602-8 [doi]
AB  - A 55-year-old man, who previously underwent surgical ventricular restoration and 
      mitral valve surgery, was referred to our department for management of refractory
      heart and multiple organ failure. At the time of admission to our hospital, he
      could not be registered as a candidate for heart transplantation because of
      severe renal failure with a serum creatinine level of 4.6 mg/dl. We considered
      that he was a marginal candidate for heart transplantation; thus, it was
      essential to understand the etiology of renal failure and estimate whether it was
      reversible. Cardiac catheterization revealed poor hemodynamic function with a
      systemic pressure of 107/60 mmHg, cardiac index of 2.5 l/min/m(2), and pulmonary 
      artery pressure of 63/27 mmHg, despite intense medical treatment. Contrary to
      biochemical examination findings of blood, renal biopsy findings showed no
      significant glomerular abnormality. Furthermore, the severity of tubular atrophy 
      and interstitial fibrosis in the cortex was mild. These pathological findings
      suggested that the renal dysfunction in this case was possibly attributable to a 
      hemodynamic factor. His symptoms gradually deteriorated despite an increasing
      dose of inotropic support; thus, we planned implantation of a Jarvik 2000
      axial-flow pump (Jarvik Heart Inc., New York, NY, USA) as a bridge to
      eligibility, and informed consent was obtained. Because of a tight adhesion on
      the anterior wall, we placed the device on the lateral wall of the left
      ventricle, making sure not to direct the pump at the septum. Postoperatively, the
      implantable left ventricular assist device provided relief from heart failure
      symptoms as well as recovery of renal function, with serum the creatinine level
      at 1.2 mg/dl, which allowed the patient to become an appropriate candidate for
      heart transplantation. At an 18-month follow-up examination, his status was
      uneventful, and he is now at home awaiting heart transplantation.

PG  - e432-5
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31822f1b63 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the management of hemophilia in a patient with dilated
      cardiomyopathy during application of the Berlin-Heart biventricular assist.
      DESIGN: Case report. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: The Berlin-Heart biventricular
      assist was successfully used as a bridge to heart transplantation (178 days) in a
      child with hemophilia A; post-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was 
      implanted until the patient recovered from primary graft failure. Anticoagulant
      therapy varied as a function of patient status: 1) postoperative bleeding was
      treated by partial replacement of deficient factors (VII and VIII) and
      hemoderivatives in order to maintain factor VIII at 50% of normal levels; 2) once
      the bleeding had stopped, the effect of the hemophilia itself maintained the
      degree of anticoagulation required by the ventricular assist device; and 3)
      transplant surgery was followed by complete replacement of factor VIII and
      intravenous heparinization (a simple way of preventing clot formation in the
      device and to ensure proper scarring of surgical wounds). CONCLUSIONS: Selection 
      of anticoagulant therapy as a function of patient status in terms of bleeding and
      surgical-wound scarring progress is vital for the proper functioning of support
      techniques (Berlin-Heart biventricular assist and extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation) in hemophiliac patients. Collagen dressings placed on surgical
      wounds achieved good functional and aesthetic results, as well as mechanically
      isolating the scars from the exterior.

PG  - 484-8

AB  - Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) represents an effective, emergent therapy for 
      patients with end-stage heart failure or cardiac arrest. However, ECLS is
      typically not used as a bridge to heart transplantation because of the limited
      duration of ECLS. In France, high-urgency priority heart transplantation remains 
      a possibility for transplant patients who are on ECLS. In this article, we
      present our experience with high-urgency priority heart transplantation after
      ECLS. From July 2004 to December 2009, 242 patients underwent emergent ECLS.
      Heart transplantation was performed in eight of these patients. Time of ECLS was 
      6.3 +/- 4.6 d. Before heart transplantation, all patients on ECLS had decreased
      organ dysfunctions and four were conscious. Despite frequent post-operative
      complications, no death occurred during the first year after transplantation. In 
      our experience, ECLS is a valid method of supporting patients awaiting
      high-urgency heart transplantation and can be used as a short-term bridge to
      heart transplantation.

AB  - In recent years, ventricular assist devices (VAD) supporting the left (LVAD), the
      right (RVAD) or both ventricles (BVAD) have rapidly emerged as the standard of
      care for advanced heart failure patients. Both the numbers and ages of patients
      in which they are used are rising worldwide, especially when used as a permanent 
      support (bridge to destination, BTD). Due to the continuing lack of donor organs,
      these devices now represent a viable alternative to bridge patients to
      transplantation (BTT), with a 1-year survival rate of 86%. BTD, especially in
      long-term support, might be a valid, and the sole, option for those patients in
      whom heart transplantation is contraindicated. Patient selection, pre- and
      intra-operative preparation, as well as the timing of VAD implantation are
      important factors critical to successful circulatory support. While BTT remains
      the goal in the majority of patients, the number of permanent VADs (i. e. BTD) is
      rising significantly. Although explantation of a VAD system as a bridge to
      recovery (BTR) can be considered in only a small number of patients, it
      represents a very special part of this therapy modality.

TI  - Life in transition: a qualitative study of the illness experience and vocational 
      adjustment of patients with left ventricular assist device.
PG  - 394-402
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0b013e318227f119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is used as a bridge to
      transplantation in patients with acute heart failure. The device is a major
      bodily invasion that challenges everyday life. Only few studies have explored the
      psychosocial adjustments of patients living with an LVAD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of
      this study was to explore the lived experience of patients with LVADs. METHODS:
      The present study had a qualitative explorative design using in-depth interviews 
      of 10 adult patients that had experienced life with an LVAD from 2008 to 2010 in 
      Denmark. We constructed an interview guide with themes relating to the chronology
      of the illness trajectory. Data were managed by the qualitative computer package 
      NVivo 8. As a theoretical framework, we chose a life-stage model for the main
      theme: Life With LVAD. The model describes the developmental tasks in each age
      group, and we looked at the physical, psychological, social, and vocational
      adjustments of patients with LVADs. RESULTS: Despite the suddenness of onset and 
      gravity of illness, the patients in our study coped well with their situation.
      While bridging to transplantation, the patients experienced the ambivalence of
      gratitude and frustration toward the LVAD, and during preparation for cardiac
      transplantation, they experienced the ambivalence of hope and fear. Some resolved
      their emotional ambiguity by procrastination in relation to vocational
      adjustments that were necessary due to their illness. Older patients with
      occupational security were quicker to resume work and everyday life. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with LVADs succeeded somewhat in reestablishing their lives, but the
      younger individuals still need to consider vocational options. Some patients need
      help to get out of the sick role that kept them on disability benefits. The
      patients all relied on support from close family: parents, spouses, and children.

TI  - Patient-reported outcomes in left ventricular assist device therapy: a systematic
      review and recommendations for clinical research and practice.
PG  - 714-23
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.962472 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Technological advancements of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) 
      have created today's potential for extending the lives of patients with end-stage
      heart failure. Few studies have examined the effect of LVAD therapy on
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as health status, quality of life, and
      anxiety/depression, despite poor PROs predicting mortality and rehospitalization 
      in patients with heart failure. In this systematic review, we provide an overview
      of available evidence on the impact of LVAD therapy on PROs and discuss
      recommendations for clinical research and practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: A
      systematic literature search identified 16 quantitative studies with a sample
      size >/=10 (mean+/-SD age=50.1+/-12.6 years) that examined the impact of LVAD
      therapy on PROs using a quantitative approach. Initial evidence suggests an
      improvement in health status, anxiety, and depression in the first few months
      after LVAD implantation. However, PRO scores of patients receiving LVAD therapy
      are still lower for physical, social, and emotional functioning compared with
      transplant recipients. These studies had several methodological shortcomings,
      including the use of relatively small sample sizes, and only a paucity of studies
      focused on anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of studies on 
      the patient perspective of LVAD therapy. To advance the field of LVAD research
      and to optimize the care of an increasingly growing population of patients
      receiving LVAD therapy, more well-designed large-scale studies are needed to
      further elucidate the impact of LVAD therapy on PROs.

TI  - Parameters of mineral metabolism predict midterm clinical outcome in end-stage
      heart failure patients.
PG  - 342-8
LID - 10.3109/14017431.2011.611250 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated to which extent disturbances in mineral metabolism
      predict 90-day clinical outcome in end-stage heart failure patients. DESIGN:
      Among numerous biochemical parameters, we measured serum levels of sodium and
      magnesium, the calciotropic hormones parathyroid hormone and
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D as well as fibroblast growth factor-23 (a phosphaturic
      hormone) in 305 cardiac transplant candidates. Primary endpoint was a composite
      of the need of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), transplantation, or death.
      RESULTS: Of the study cohort, 33.4% reached the primary endpoint. In detail, 19% 
      were transplanted (the vast majority was listed "high urgent"), 8.8% died and
      5.6% received MCS implants. As determined by logistic regression analysis, all
      aforementioned biochemical parameters were independently related to the primary
      endpoint. Results did not change substantially when transplanted patients were
      censored. A risk score (0-5 points) was developed. Of the patients who scored 5
      points 89.5% reached the primary endpoint whereas of the patients with a zero
      score only 3.8% reached the primary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate
      that in addition to the well-known predictive value of disturbed sodium
      metabolism, derangements in calcium, phosphate, and magnesium metabolism also
      predict midterm clinical outcome in end-stage heart failure patients.

PG  - 1183-90
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2011.06.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the pre-implantation predictors for
      in-hospital mortality in children with ventricular assist device (VAD) support.
      BACKGROUND: Candidate selection is of critical importance for improved outcomes
      in patients supported with VAD. However, risk factors for post-VAD survival in
      children are still not clearly understood. METHODS: From June 1996 to December
      2009, 92 children underwent implantation of a long-term VAD at Germany Heart
      Institute Berlin. Data on all these patients were retrospectively analyzed, and
      pre-operative risk factors for in-hospital survival after VAD implantation were
      identified by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 92 subjects, the 
      median age at implantation was 7 years (range 12 days to 18 years), and the
      median support time was 35 days (range 1 to 591 days). The overall survival rate 
      to transplantation or recovery of ventricular function was 63%. Independent
      predictors of in-hospital mortality in children included congenital etiology
      (odds ratio [OR]: 11.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 to 47.5),
      norepinephrine requirement (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 1.4 to 31), C-reactive protein level
      >6.3 mg/dl (OR: 4.9; 95% CI: 1.1 to 22.1), and central venous pressure >17 mm Hg 
      (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 20). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital etiology, pre-operative
      norepinephrine requirement, higher serum C-reactive protein, and central venous
      pressure were associated with increased in-hospital mortality in children with
      VAD support. Optimal candidate selection and timing of VAD insertion may be of
      great importance for improved outcomes in children with advanced heart failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved devices
      available that can provide long-term mechanical circulatory support to smaller
      children with severe heart failure as a bridge to heart transplant (HT). In
      recent years, the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD)
      has emerged as a potential treatment option. Systematic data on the safety and
      efficacy of the EXCOR are limited. METHODS: The Investigational Device Exemption 
      (IDE) clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and probable benefit of
      the EXCOR to support regulatory review of the device under the Humanitarian
      Device Exemption regulation. The study design and rationale are reviewed in light
      of the well-described challenges inherent in small population studies. RESULTS:
      The Berlin Heart EXCOR IDE clinical study is a prospective, multicenter,
      single-arm, clinical cohort study. Children aged 0 to 16 years with severe heart 
      failure (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
      profile 1 or 2) due to 2-ventricle heart disease and actively listed for HT
      comprise the primary study cohort. The control population is a propensity-matched
      retrospective cohort of children supported with extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation, the only bridge device available to smaller children before the
      EXCOR. The primary efficacy end point is survival to heart transplantation or
      recovery. The primary safety end point is the incidence of serious adverse events
      as defined by pediatric Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support criteria. The study will enroll a total of 48 subjects in 2
      cohorts based on body surface area (cohort 1 <0.7 m(2), cohort 2 0.7-1.5 m(2))
      and is powered to show safety superiority to a prespecified performance goal of
      0.25 serious adverse events per day of support. Children ineligible for the
      primary cohort will still have access to the device in a third compassionate-use 
      cohort where adverse event data will be collected for additional safety
      characterization of the device. CONCLUSION: The Berlin Heart IDE clinical study
      will be the first bridge-to-HT VAD study designed exclusively for children. It is
      anticipated that the study will provide important information on the safety and
      efficacy of the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric in children while providing valuable
      lessons into the design and conduct of future VAD studies in children.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in nontransplant
      eligible candidates remains controversial. Our decision to offer MCS for
      nontransplant candidates has led to their reevaluation after a period of left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. METHODS: From 2001 to September 2009,
      we had 37 patients who received an implantable LVAD, 22 (59%) were not deemed to 
      be transplant eligible at the time of LVAD insertion (bridge to candidacy, BTC
      group). RESULTS: Fifteen (41%) patients were considered transplant eligible
      (bridge to transplant, BTT group) at the time of device insertion and received a 
      HeartMate XVE (n = 7), HeartMate 2 (n = 7), or a Novacor LVAS (n = 1). In the BTC
      group, patients received the HeartMate XVE device (n = 11), HeartMate 2 (n = 5), 
      or the Novacor LVAS (n = 6). The primary criterion for transplant ineligibility
      was refractory pulmonary hypertension (PH) in 18 patients, 3 patients did not
      meet our body mass index criteria (>35 kg/m(2)), and 2 patients were
      dialysis-dependent. Six (27%) BTC patients died on support. Overall, 16/22
      patients (73%) were subsequently listed for transplantation, with one listed for 
      combined heart-lung due to refractory PH. Twelve patients (75%) underwent
      successful heart transplantation. Three patients died during their transplant.
      Overall posttransplant survival at one year shows lower survival in the BTC group
      compared to the BTT group (67% vs. 100%, p = 0.05). At two years and three years 
      the survival was lower, but not statistically different (BTC vs. BTT: 67% vs. 90%
      and 64% vs. 87%, respectively, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: MCS can successfully convert
      a large proportion of transplant-ineligible patients into acceptable candidates.

AB  - Individuals afflicted with advanced systolic heart failure who have become
      unresponsive to standard medical and electrical therapies are categorized as
      having American Heart Association stage D heart failure. The high mortality rates
      for medically treated stage D heart failure have not improved in the last 10
      years, and patients at this advanced stage require either palliative measures or 
      surgical management of heart failure. In recent years, surgically implanted
      ventricular assist devices (VADs) have become available for long-term use and are
      now commonly used as a therapy for advanced heart failure. The data generated
      from this early experience have clearly shown that VADs improve survival and
      quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure when implanted as a
      temporary measure or as long-term support. However, with a growing heart failure 
      population, there is much work to be done to continually improve VAD technology, 
      patient selection criteria, and postimplantation management to define the optimal
      role for assist devices in the management of systolic heart failure.

TI  - Effects of a percutaneous mechanical circulatory support device for medically
      refractory right ventricular failure.
PG  - 1360-7
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.07.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medically refractory right ventricular failure (MR-RVF) is associated
      with high in-hospital mortality and is managed with surgical assist devices,
      atrial septostomy, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This study explored
      the hemodynamic effect associated with a percutaneous RV support device (pRVSD)
      for MR-RVF. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, 9 patients with MR-RVF, defined as
      cardiogenic shock despite maximal medical therapy, were treated with a pRVSD.
      Medical records were reviewed for demographics, hemodynamic and laboratory data, 
      and details of pRVSD implantation. RESULTS: MR-RVF was due to severe sepsis in 1 
      patient (11.1%), post-cardiotomy syndrome in 2 (22.2%), and acute inferior wall
      myocardial infarction (IWMI) in 6 (66.7%). Five patients underwent right internal
      jugular-to-femoral cannulation, and 4 required bifemoral cannulation. No
      intra-procedural deaths or major vascular complications requiring surgical or
      peripheral intervention occurred. Time from admission to pRVSD implantation was
      2.9 +/- 3.3 days, with an average of 6516 +/- 698 rotations/min, providing flow
      at 3.3 +/- 0.4 liters/min. Mean duration of pRVSD activation was 3.1 +/- 1.8
      days. Compared with pre-procedural values, mean arterial pressure (57 +/- 7 vs 75
      +/- 19 mm Hg, p < 0.05), right atrial pressure (22 +/- 3 vs 15 +/- 6 mm Hg, p <
      0.05), cardiac index (1.5 +/- 0.4 vs 2.3 +/- 0.5 liters/min/m(2), p < 0.05),
      mixed venous oxygen saturation (40 +/- 14 vs 58 +/- 4 percent, p < 0.05), and RV 
      stroke work (3.4 +/- 3.9 vs 9.7 +/- 6.8 g . m/beat, p < 0.05) improved
      significantly within 24 hours of pRVSD implantation. In-hospital mortality was
      44% (n = 4). Time from admission to pRVSD placement was lower in patients who
      survived to hospital discharge (0.9 +/- 0.8 days) vs non-survivors (4.8 +/- 3.5
      days; p = 0.04). All survivors presented with IWMI. CONCLUSION: Use of a pRVSD
      for MR-RVF is feasible and associated with improved hemodynamics. Algorithms
      promoting earlier pRVSD use in MR-RVF warrant further investigation.

TI  - Exercise blood pressure response during assisted circulatory support: comparison 
      of the total artificial [corrected] heart with a left ventricular assist device
      during rehabilitation.
PG  - 1207-13
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.07.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The total artificial heart (TAH) consists of two implantable
      pneumatic pumps that replace the heart and operate at a fixed ejection rate and
      ejection pressure. We evaluated the blood pressure (BP) response to exercise and 
      exercise performance in patients with a TAH compared to those with a with a
      continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS: We conducted a
      single-center, retrospective study of 37 patients who received a TAH and 12
      patients implanted with an LVAD. We measured the BP response during exercise,
      exercise duration and change in tolerated exercise workload over an 8-week
      period. RESULTS: In patients with a TAH, baseline BP was 120/69 +/- 13/13,
      exercise BP was 118/72 +/- 15/10 and post-exercise BP was 120/72 +/- 14/12. Mean 
      arterial BP did not change with exercise in patients with a TAH (88 +/- 10 vs 88 
      +/- 11; p = 0.8), but increased in those with an LVAD (87 +/- 8 vs 95 +/- 13; p <
      0.001). Although the mean arterial BP (MAP) was negatively correlated with
      metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved during exercise, the association was not
      statistically significant (beta = -0.1, p = 0.4). MAP correlated positively with 
      METs achieved in patients with LVADs (MAP: beta = 0.26, p = 0.04). Despite the
      abnormal response to exercise, patients with a TAH participated in physical
      therapy (median: 5 days; interquartile range [IQR] 4 to 7 days) and treadmill
      exercise (19 days; IQR: 13 to 35 days) early after device implantation, with
      increased exercise intensity and duration over time. CONCLUSIONS: During
      circulatory support with a TAH, the BP response to exercise was blunted. However,
      aerobic exercise training early after device implantation was found to be safe
      and feasible in a supervised setting.

AB  - In an aging population, numerous patients who underwent previous coronary artery 
      bypass grafting (CABG) are presenting with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.
      Although redo CABG and cardiological interventions are possible treatment
      options, orthotopic heart transplantation remains an ultimate option for these
      patients. However, there is high morbidity and mortality on the waiting list, and
      mechanical circulatory support is a life-saving concept [Hetzer 2006; Taylor
      2009].We developed a simplified and safe technique for implantation of a
      biventricular assist device as a redo in complex patients after previous CABG and
      end-stage heart failure.

AB  - Patients with advanced heart failure have a dismal prognosis and poor quality of 
      life. Heart transplantation provides an effective treatment for a subset of these
      patients. This article provides cardiologists with up-to-date information about
      referral for transplantation, the role of left ventricular assist devices prior
      to transplant, patient selection, waiting-list management and donor heart
      availability. Timing is of central importance; patients should be referred before
      complications (eg, cardiorenal syndrome or secondary pulmonary hypertension) have
      developed that will increase the risk of, or potentially contraindicate,
      transplantation. Issues related to heart failure aetiology, comorbidity and
      adherence to medical treatment are reviewed. Finally, the positive role that
      cardiologists can play in promoting and facilitating organ donation is discussed.

PG  - 1236-45, 1245.e1
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.07.019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preformed anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies have been associated
      with prolonged wait times and increased mortality in orthotopic heart
      transplantation. We used United Network for Organ Sharing data to examine panel
      reactive antibody titers in patients bridged to transplant with left ventricular 
      assist devices. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of the United Network
      for Organ Sharing dataset for all patients bridged to orthotopic heart
      transplantation with a HeartMate II or HeartMate XVE (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, 
      Calif) from January 2004 to December 2009. Patients were primarily stratified by 
      device type and secondarily grouped for comparisons by high (>25%) versus low
      (0%) panel reactive antibody activity (class I and II). Outcomes included
      survival (30-day and 1-year), treated rejection in the year after orthotopic
      heart transplantation, and primary graft dysfunction. Cox proportional hazards
      regression examined 30-day and 1-year survival. RESULTS: A total of 871 patients 
      (56.1%) received the HeartMate II device, and 673 patients (43.9%) received the
      HeartMate XVE device. Patients with high panel reactive antibody had longer
      duration on the wait list (205 days [interquartile range, 81-344] vs 124 days
      [interquartile range, 51-270], P = .01). High panel reactive antibody class II
      was more common in patients with the HeartMate XVE device (51/547 [9.3%] vs
      42/777 [5.4%], P < .001). When the entire cohort was examined together, there was
      no 30-day or 1-year survival difference based on panel reactive antibody
      activity. Device type did not affect post-orthotopic heart transplantation
      survival, and panel reactive antibody activity was not associated with worse
      mortality in Cox regression. Although panel reactive antibody activity did not
      affect rejection in the year after orthotopic heart transplantation for either
      device type, high panel reactive antibody class II was associated with higher
      rates of primary graft dysfunction for both devices (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      is the largest modern study to examine the impact of detailed panel reactive
      antibody information in patients bridged to transplant. High panel reactive
      antibody levels do not affect drug-treated rejection episodes in the first year
      post-orthotopic heart transplantation; however, there is an associated higher
      rate of primary graft dysfunction, regardless of device type. Highly sensitized
      patients bridged to transplant experience excellent survival outcomes after
      orthotopic heart transplantation.

TI  - Relationship between myocardial redox state and matrix metalloproteinase activity
      in patients on left ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 2387-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Redox aminothiols have been reported to modulate the activity of
      recombinant metalloproteinases (MMP). The aim of the present study was to
      investigate the effects of myocardial redox state on the activities of MMP-2 and 
      -9 implicated in cardiac remodeling in end-stage heart failure patients supported
      by left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: During heart
      transplant (HT) surgery, myocardial specimens (MS) from right ventricular walls
      and LV walls were obtained from 7 LVAD recipients (LVAD group, MS n=35) and from 
      7 stable HT candidates on medical therapy (MT group, MS n=35). Myocardial MMP-2
      and -9 activities and expression, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and -4,
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and aminothiol concentrations were
      measured. MMP-2 and -9 activities were evaluated also by incubating MS with
      different amounts of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH). MMP-2 and -9
      activities and expression were lower in the LVAD group, whereas myocardial TIMP-1
      and -4 concentrations were comparable to those of MT patients. Higher GSH and
      TGF-beta1 concentrations were found in LVAD-recipients. Only GSH concentrations
      were inversely related to MMP-2 and -9 activities. In vitro, GSH had an
      inhibitory effect on MMP-2 and -9 activities. CONCLUSIONS: LVAD recipients show
      reduced myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression when compared to
      medically treated patients. Changes of myocardial redox state, predominantly
      GSH-dependent, appear to modulate MMP-2 and -9 activities by an inhibitory effect
      dependent on thiol content. These data support a role of GSH cycle in modulating 
      the extracellular matrix in end-stage heart failure patients supported by LVAD.

TI  - Is severe pulmonary hypertension a contraindication for orthotopic heart
      transplantation? Not any more.
PG  - 769-75
AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) unresponsive to pharmacological intervention is
      considered a contraindication for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHTX) due to 
      risk of postoperative right-heart failure. In this prospective study, we describe
      our experience with a treatment strategy of improving severe PH in heart
      transplant candidates by means of ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation
      and subsequent OHTX. In 11 heart transplantation candidates with severe PH
      unresponsive to pharmacological intervention we implanted VAD with the aim of
      achieving PH to values acceptable for OHTX. In all patients we observed
      significant drop in pulmonary pressures, PVR and TPG (p < 0.001 for all) 3 months
      after VAD implantation to values sufficient to allow OHTX. Seven patients
      underwent transplantation (mean duration of support 216 days) while none of
      patients suffered right-side heart failure in postoperative period. Two patients 
      died after transplantation and five patients are living in very good condition
      with a mean duration of 286 days after OHTX. In our opinion, severe PH is not a
      contraindication for orthotopic heart transplantation any more.

AB  - The function of the right ventricle (RV) in heart failure (HF) has been mostly
      ignored until recently. A 2006 report of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
      Institute identified a gap between RV research efforts and its clinical
      importance compared with that of the left ventricle. This recent shift in
      paradigm is fueled by the prognostic value ascribed to RV failure in HF and
      morbidity/mortality after myocardial infarction and surgery. In this review, we
      examine the significance of RV failure in the HF setting, its clinical
      presentation and pathophysiology, and ways to evaluate RV function using
      echocardiographic measurements. Furthermore, we discuss the medical management of
      RV failure including traditional therapies like beta-blockers and newer options
      like nitric oxide, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and calcium sensitizers.
      Mechanical support is also examined. Finally, this review places an emphasis on
      RV failure in the setting of left ventricular assist devices and heart
      transplantation.

TI  - How does successful bridging with ventricular assist device affect cardiac
      transplantation outcome?
PG  - 405-9
LID - 10.1510/icvts.2011.273722 [doi]
AB  - A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured
      protocol. The issue was to determine the impact of bridge-to-transplant
      ventricular assist device support on survival after cardiac transplantation.
      Altogether 428 papers were found using the reported search, of which 12
      represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors,
      journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type,
      relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The treatment
      options for patients with advanced heart failure or those with deteriorating
      end-organ function on maximal medical therapy are limited to intravenous
      inotropes and mechanical assistance with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or
      ventricular assist device (VAD). Studies exploring the effect of VADs on
      post-transplant mortality have yielded conflicting results. The Registry of the
      International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation continues to identify
      mechanical support as a risk factor for decreased survival after transplantation.
      A limitation of this report is that the multivariable adjustment uses variables
      recorded not at the time of device implant but at the time of transplant. Some of
      the recipient characteristics thus may be altered by the device implant. Compared
      with the previous reports the latest data show improvement in post-transplant
      survival in the recent era. In addition, the excess risk appears to be limited to
      the early post-transplant period. Experienced centers consistently report
      outstanding post-transplant results with left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      bridging. Of the 12 papers seven showed no difference in survival, and five
      showed a reduced survival. In the papers showing no difference, one year survival
      averaged from 85% in supported patients to 87% in non-supported patients. In
      papers reporting a difference in outcome, one year averaged survival was 74% in
      LVAD recipients compared to 90% in non-bridged patients. Decreased survival is
      associated with patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, transplanted
      within two weeks of LVAD implantation and bridged to transplantation before 2003 
      as opposed to patients transplanted more recently. Based on the available
      evidence we conclude that in selected patients survival after heart
      transplantation in patients bridged with VAD is comparable to those who did not
      receive the device.

TI  - [Expression and significance of beta adrenergic receptors in a model of left
      ventricular mechanical unloading].
PG  - 405-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the expression and significance of beta adrenergic receptors 
      mRNA in a model of left ventricular mechanical unloading, and explore the change 
      in cardiomyocyte in molecular level after left ventricular unloading. METHODS:
      Heart failure was reproduced in Lewis rats by ligating left anterior descending
      (LAD) artery. After 4 weeks, the failing hearts and right lungs were
      heterotopically transplanted into the abdomen of the recipients by anastomosing
      their ascending aorta to the recipients' descending aorta in the heart
      transplantation group. Two weeks after transplantation, heart weight, left
      ventricular weight, myocyte diameter and myocardial fibrosis were determined ,
      and beta adrenergics receptors mRNA expression was essayed by real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Seven normal Lewis rats served as control.
      RESULTS: The weight of the enlarged heart, left ventricular weight and myocyte
      diameter of the failing hearts were decreased to normal after transplantation.
      The levels of beta1- and beta2- adrenergic receptors mRNA expression were
      significantly lowered in heart failure group compared with that of normal
      group(0.09 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.04, 0.07 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02, both P
      <0.05). The level of beta2- adrenergic receptor mRNA expression in heart
      transplantation group (0.11 +/- 0.05) rose to normal (P>0.05), but beta1-
      adrenergic receptor mRNA expression (0.08 +/- 0.06) was lower in heart
      transplantation group than that in normal group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Myocardium 
      reverse remodeling after left ventricular unloading is accompanied by the change 
      in cardiomyocyte in molecular level , such as the change in beta adrenergic
      receptors , which may involve in the improvement of heart function after being
      supported by left ventricular assist device.

TI  - Ventricular resynchronization is the principle mechanism of benefit with cardiac 
      resynchronization therapy.
PG  - 737-46
LID - 10.1007/s10741-011-9274-y [doi]
AB  - Although there is little debate over the fact that cardiac resynchronization
      therapy (CRT) can benefit the majority of patients selected with routine
      indications, the precise mechanism for improvement may be considered
      controversial. Among patients selected with New York Heart Association functional
      class III or IV symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction </= 35% and
      electrocardiographic QRS widening of at least 120-130 ms, approximately 60-80% of
      patients improved depending on the definition of response used. Although a
      reasonable assumption is that electrocardiographic QRS widening is a surrogate
      for delays in regional ventricular mechanical activation, a large volume of data 
      has demonstrated that there is a subset of patients with widened QRS complexes
      who have no significant mechanical dyssynchrony. The reason for dissociation of
      electrical dispersion and mechanical dyssynchrony is unknown presently, but many 
      studies have demonstrated the association of dyssynchrony with favorable outcome 
      following CRT. Perhaps more importantly, several imaging studies (principally by 
      echocardiography) have shown the lack of baseline mechanical dyssynchrony to be
      as a marker for a less favorable outcome after CRT. Recently, the lack of
      dyssynchrony before CRT has been shown to be associated with a significantly
      lower long-term probability of freedom from death, heart transplantation, or left
      ventricular assist device placement. As further mechanistic evidence for the
      relationship of mechanical dyssynchrony and LV functional response to CRT, it has
      been suggested that patients who failed to improve their tissue Doppler measures 
      of dyssynchrony after CRT have a lower chance of reverse remodeling. This topic
      has been muddled by technical difficulties in measurement of mechanical
      dyssynchrony by all imaging approaches, the confounding variable of scar in
      ischemic disease, and the widely variable definitions of response used by
      different investigators. However, the weight of evidence from a
      pathophysiological basis to the recent long-term patient outcome data strongly
      support the notion that resynchronization is the principle mechanism of benefit
      from CRT.

TI  - Laparoscopic splenectomy in a patient with a Heartmate((R)) II left ventricular
      assist device.
PG  - 535-8
LID - 10.1089/lap.2011.0169 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the publication of the REMATCH trial results, it is estimated
      that almost 5 million Americans have been found to have heart failure. Limited
      availability of organs for transplantation, coupled with wider selection criteria
      for destination therapy, has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of 
      patients with permanently assisted circulation. Given the high rate of
      complications related to circulatory assist devices, it is expected that these
      patients will be undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures more commonly.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a laparoscopic splenectomy in a patient
      supported with a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device. Using this case as 
      a model, we discuss hemodynamic changes associated with pneumoperitoneum and
      anesthesia induction. Additionally, an extensive literature search was performed 
      to asses the frequency of laparoscopic procedures performed on patients with
      circulatory support. RESULTS: Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed without
      significant hemodynamic changes. To our knowledge, this is the first laparoscopic
      splenectomy performed in a patient with this mode of circulatory support.
      CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic procedures can safely be performed in patients with
      compensated heart failure, who are supported with ventricular assist devices.

TI  - Effects of continuous-flow versus pulsatile-flow left ventricular assist devices 
      on myocardial unloading and remodeling.
PG  - 546-53
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.962142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are
      increasingly used for patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). We analyzed the
      effects of ventricular decompression by continuous-flow versus pulsatile-flow
      LVADs on myocardial structure and function in this population. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Sixty-one patients who underwent LVAD implantation as
      bridge-to-transplant were analyzed (pulsatile-flow LVAD: group P, n=31;
      continuous-flow LVAD: group C, n=30). Serial echocardiograms, serum levels of
      brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and extracellular matrix biomarkers (ECM) were
      compared between the groups. Myocardial BNP and ECM gene expression were
      evaluated in a subset of 18 patients. Postoperative LV ejection fraction was
      greater (33.2+/-12.6% versus 17.6+/-8.8%, P<0.0001) and the mitral E/E' was lower
      (9.9+/-2.6 versus 13.2+/-3.8, P=0.0002) in group P versus group C. Postoperative 
      serum levels of BNP, metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP
      (TIMP)-4 were significantly lower in group P compared with group C (BNP:
      552.6+/-340.6 versus 965.4+/-805.7 pg/mL, P<0.01; MMP9: 309.0+/-220.2 versus
      475.2+/-336.9 ng/dL, P<0.05; TIMP4: 1490.9+/-622.4 versus 2014.3+/-452.4 ng/dL,
      P<0.001). Myocardial gene expression of ECM markers and BNP decreased in both
      groups; however, expression of TIMP-4 decreased only in group P (P=0.024).
      CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical unloading of the failing myocardium using pulsatile
      devices is more effective as indicated by echocardiographic parameters of
      systolic and diastolic LV function as well as dynamics of BNP and ECM markers.
      Therefore, specific effects of pulsatile mechanical unloading on the failing
      myocardium may have important implications for device selection especially for
      the purpose of bridge-to-recovery in patients with advanced HF.

TI  - Selecting patients for heart transplantation: comparison of the Heart Failure
      Survival Score (HFSS) and the Seattle heart failure model (SHFM).
PG  - 1236-43

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) risk-stratifies patients with
      chronic heart failure (CHF) referred for heart transplantation using 7
      parameters, including peak VO(2). The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) is a
      20-variable model that combines clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data.
      Although both models have excellent accuracy, only the HFSS was derived and
      validated in patients referred for transplantation, and the HFSS and SHFM have
      not been directly compared. METHODS: We tested the accuracy of the SHFM and
      compared the HFSS and SHFM in 715 patients referred for heart transplantation.
      RESULTS: Over a follow-up of 962 +/- 912 days, 354 patients died or received an
      urgent heart transplantation or a ventricular assist device. One-year event-free 
      survival was 89%, 72% and 60%, respectively, for the low-, medium- and high-risk 
      HFSS strata, and 93%, 76%, and 58%, respectively, for the low-, medium- and
      high-risk SHFM strata. The HFSS and SHFM were modestly correlated (R = -0.48, p <
      0.001). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the
      curves (AUCs) for the HFSS and SHFM were comparable (1 year: 0.72 vs 0.73;
      2-year: 0.70 vs 0.74, respectively) and incremental to New York Heart Association
      class. The 1- and 2-year combined HFSS+SHFM AUCs were 0.77 and 0.76,
      respectively, significantly better than the HFSS or SHFM alone. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      HFSS and SHFM provide accurate and comparable risk stratification in CHF patients
      referred for transplantation. Combining the HFSS and SHFM improves predictive
      ability.

TI  - The vascular marker soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 is associated with disease
      severity and adverse outcomes in chronic heart failure.
PG  - 386-94
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2011.03.032 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble
      Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) as clinical biomarkers in chronic heart
      failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Vascular remodeling is a crucial compensatory mechanism
      in chronic HF. The angiogenic ligand PlGF and its target receptor fms-like
      tyrosine kinase 1 modulate vascular growth and function, but their relevance in
      human HF is undefined. METHODS: We measured plasma PlGF and sFlt-1 in 1,403
      patients from the Penn Heart Failure Study, a multicenter cohort of chronic
      systolic HF. Subjects were followed for death, cardiac transplantation, or
      ventricular assist device placement over a median follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS: 
      The sFlt-1 was independently associated with measures of HF severity, including
      New York Heart Association functional class (p < 0.01) and B-type natriuretic
      peptide (p < 0.01). Patients in the 4th quartile of sFlt-1 (>379 pg/ml) had a
      6.17-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes (p < 0.01). This association was
      robust, even after adjustment for the Seattle Failure Model (hazard ratio: 2.54, 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76 to 2.27, p < 0.01) and clinical confounders
      including HF etiology (hazard ratio: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.63, p = 0.03).
      Combined assessment of sFlt-1 and B-type natriuretic peptide exhibited high
      predictive accuracy at 1 year (area under the receiver-operator characteristic
      curve: 0.791, 95% CI: 0.752 to 0.831) that was greater than either marker alone
      (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). In contrast, PlGF was not an independent
      marker of disease severity or outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a role 
      for sFlt-1 in the biology of human HF. With additional study, circulating sFlt-1 
      might emerge as a clinically useful biomarker to assess the influence of vascular
      remodeling on clinical outcomes.

TI  - Cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation for patients with ventricular assist
      device from exercise therapy to long-term therapy. Part I: Exercise therapy.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - In the present context of an aging population, limited donor heart availability, 
      improved reliability of mechanical cardiac support and improved patient outcomes,
      ventricular assist device (VAD) options to support end-stage heart failure
      patients are rapidly expanding. In addition, both the smaller size and lighter
      weight of the pumps now produced and early evidence that these third generation
      devices may be associated with lower risk of infection and right ventricular
      failure will probably lead to greater physician and patient acceptability. This
      is the first of a two-part review on the role of cardiovascular prevention and
      rehabilitation in patients with VAD. In this first part, we will discuss the role
      of exercise therapy in VAD patients, while the second will focus on long-term
      management. One of the prerequisites for use of a VAD--whether permanent (as
      destination therapy) or semi-permanent (as an alternative to heart
      transplantation)--is that exercise capacity, although not normal, must be
      adequate for daily life activities. An intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation
      program has the potential to increase exercise performance and improve the
      quality of life of VAD patients. Both early progressive mobilization and exercise
      training may improve the overall condition of VAD patients, and favorably impact 
      their clinical course.

AB  - Electrophysiological and pharmacological data from the human heart are limited
      due to the absence of simple but representative experimental model systems of
      human myocardium. The aim of this study was to establish and characterise adult
      human myocardial slices from small patients' heart biopsies as a simple,
      reproducible and relevant preparation suitable for the study of human cardiac
      tissue at the multicellular level. Vibratome-cut myocardial slices were prepared 
      from left ventricular biopsies obtained from end-stage heart failure patients
      undergoing heart transplant or ventricular assist device implantation, and from
      hearts of normal dogs. Multiple slices were prepared from each biopsy. Regular
      contractility was observed at a range of stimulation frequencies (0.1-2 Hz), and 
      stable electrical activity, monitored using multi-electrode arrays (MEA), was
      maintained for at least 8 h from slice preparation. ATP/ADP and
      phosphocreatine/creatine ratios were comparable to intact organ values, and
      morphology and gap junction distribution were representative of native
      myocardium. MEA recordings showed that field potential duration (FPD) and
      conduction velocity (CV) in human and dog slices were similar to the values
      previously reported for papillary muscles, ventricular wedges and whole hearts.
      Longitudinal CV was significantly faster than transversal CV, with an anisotropic
      ratio of 3:1 for human and 2.3:1 for dog slices. Importantly, slices responded to
      the application of E-4031, chromanol and 4-aminopyridine, three potassium channel
      blockers known to affect action potential duration, with an increase in FPD. We
      conclude that viable myocardial slices with preserved structural, biochemical and
      electrophysiological properties can be prepared from adult human and canine heart
      biopsies and offer a novel preparation suitable for the study of heart failure
      and drug screening.

TI  - Biventricular assist devices: a technical review.
PG  - 2313-28
LID - 10.1007/s10439-011-0348-8 [doi]
AB  - The optimal treatment option for end stage heart failure is transplantation;
      however, the shortage of donor organs necessitates alternative treatment
      strategies such as mechanical circulatory assistance. Ventricular assist devices 
      (VADs) are employed to support these cases while awaiting cardiac recovery or
      transplantation, or in some cases as destination therapy. While left ventricular 
      assist device (LVAD) therapy alone is effective in many instances, up to 50% of
      LVAD recipients demonstrate clinically significant postoperative right
      ventricular failure and potentially need a biventricular assist device (BiVAD).
      In these cases, the BiVAD can effectively support both sides of the failing
      heart. This article presents a technical review of BiVADs, both clinically
      applied and under development. The BiVADs which have been used clinically are
      predominantly first generation, pulsatile, and paracorporeal systems that are
      bulky and prone to device failure, thrombus formation, and infection. While they 
      have saved many lives, they generally necessitate a large external pneumatic
      driver which inhibits normal movement and quality of life for many patients. In
      an attempt to alleviate these issues, several smaller, implantable second and
      third generation devices that use either immersed mechanical blood bearings or
      hydrodynamic/magnetic levitation systems to support a rotating impeller are under
      development or in the early stages of clinical use. Although these rotary devices
      may offer a longer term, completely implantable option for patients with
      biventricular failure, their control strategies need to be refined to compete
      with the inherent volume balancing ability of the first generation devices. The
      BiVAD systems potentially offer an improved quality of life to patients with
      total heart failure, and thus a viable alternative to heart transplantation is
      anticipated with continued development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report our initial experience with our newly developed percutaneous
      right-ventricular assist device (VAD) with CentriMag (perc CM-RVAD). METHODS: A
      flexible outflow cannula placed from the right internal jugular vein to the
      pulmonary artery and an inflow cannula placed from the femoral vein to the right 
      atrium constituted the perc CM-RVAD. When needed, biventricular support was
      provided with left VAD (LVAD), either with a percutaneous LVAD placed through
      axillary or femoral artery access or with a fully implantable LVAD. RESULTS:
      Between January 2009 and June 2010, all of the attempted patients successfully
      received perc CM-RVAD (n = 8). Mean blood pressure, heart rate, and central
      venous pressure showed a trend toward improvement after the perc CM-RVAD, with
      less inotrope/vasopressor requirement. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO(2))
      increased significantly from 64 +/- 20 Torr to 78 +/- 6 Torr (P < 0.01). The
      percutaneous VADs were explanted after myocardial recovery in seven patients;
      however, in three of these, perc CM-RVAD was used as a temporary bridge to other 
      devices. One patient was bridged to a surgical biventricular assist device
      (BiVAD) and transferred back to the referring hospital on support. One death
      occurred due to multiple-organ failure 8 days after explantation of the RVAD with
      recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Perc CM-RVAD was feasible and provided hemodynamic
      improvement.

AB  - The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of
      Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) study shows that implanted ventricular assist 
      devices improve survival time and quality of life when used as a permanent
      therapy in patients who do not qualify for heart transplant. The success of the
      pulsatile 70 cc stroke volume left ventricular assist device (LVAD) developed by 
      Penn State has led to the development of a 50 cc stroke volume pump for use in
      patients with smaller chest cavities to benefit a larger patient population. The 
      initial 50 cc pump shows regions of in vivo thrombus formation, which correlate
      to low wall shear rates within the device. In an in vitro evaluation of three new
      designs (V-2, V-3, and V-4) of the 50 cc LVAD, identical except for the location 
      and orientation of their outlet ports, particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used
      to capture planar flow field data within the pumps. V-2 has an outlet port that
      is located parallel to the inlet. In V-3, the outlet port is rotated away from
      the inlet port, with the intention of minimizing the amount of fluid turning
      needed to exit the device. With V-4 the outlet port is moved to the center of the
      pump to prolong the desirable rotational flow. PIV data were taken at six planar 
      locations within the pump. Although the modifications to the outlet port
      locations serve their intended purpose, they also introduce unwanted changes in
      the flow. Poorer wall washing and weaker rotational flow are observed with V-3
      and V-4. Although the differences between the devices are subtle, the device that
      has the most desirable flow characteristics is V-2.

TI  - Evaluation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device in obese heart
      failure patients: effects on weight loss.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect on weight loss of
      the newer generation continuous flow HeartMate II left ventricular assist device 
      (VAD) in obese heart failure (HF) patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively 
      reviewed 3-year surgical data from a large heart transplant facility and
      identified obese patients with advanced heart failure who underwent successful
      implantation of either the HeartMate XVE((R)) or the HeartMate II((R)) VAD. For
      each patient weight and BMI at time of VAD implantation and at 6 months
      post-operatively were documented. Between group comparison was achieved with
      Student's T tests. RESULTS: We identified 14 patients who had received the
      HeartMate XVE and 8 who had received the HeartMate II. At 6 months, patients who 
      received a HeartMate XVE demonstrated a significant reduction in mean body weight
      (249.6 +/- 35.4lbs vs. 217.4 +/- 20.5 lbs; P<0.05), while patients who received
      the HeartMate II demonstrated no significant change in weight (234.5 +/- 41.7 lbs
      vs. 234.7 +/- 43.0lbs; P=0.3). CONCLUSIONS: The HeartMate XVE results in
      significant reductions in weight at 6 months in obese patients with heart failure
      while the HeartMate II does not. Further research is necessary to better
      understand the effects of VADs on weight loss in obese HF patients.

AB  - The Levitronix CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, MA) ventricular assist device 
      (VAD) is a magnetically levitated rotary pump designed for temporary
      extracorporeal support. Between February 2004 and May 2010, 42 consecutive adult 
      patients were supported with Levitronix at our institution (32 men; age 62.3 +/- 
      10.5 years, range: 31-76 years). Indications for support were (group A, n = 37)
      failure to wean from the cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy 
      (n = 23), primary donor graft failure (n = 4), or right ventricular failure after
      axial left VAD (LVAD) placement (n = 10) and (group B, n = 5) refractory heart
      failure after acute myocardial infarction. The mean support time was 11.2 +/- 6.8
      days (range: 3-43 days) in group A and 8.6 +/- 4.3 days (range: 5-11 days) in
      group B. In the postcardiotomy cohort (group A), 11 (47.8%) patients were weaned 
      from support as all were supported graft failure patients. Eight patients of
      axial LVAD cohort were weaned from right VAD (RVAD). One patient was bridged to
      heart transplantation (Htx). Thirteen (35.1%) patients died on support in group
      A. In group B, one patient was bridged to Htx and four died on support. In
      overall population, bleeding requiring reoperation occurred in 15 (35.7%) cases
      and cerebral major events in four (9.5%). There were no device failures. Of the
      23 (54.7%) patients who recovered and were discharged home, 20 (47.6%) are
      presently alive, and additionally, two patients of both groups who were bridged
      to Htx (overall n = 22, 52.3%). The Levitronix proved to be useful in patients
      previously considered nonsuitable for transplantation or long-term assist device.
      The device was technically easy to manage, and the results were encouraging.

AB  - The growing number of patients suffering from severe congestive heart failure
      (HF) worldwide still means a challenge for the therapeutic options, mainly in the
      older population. According to the rapid development in the possibilities for
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS), the increasing use of left ventricular
      assist devices (LVADs) as bridge to transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy 
      (DT) reflects a change in the up-to-date therapy of HF. This article gives a
      broad overview concerning indications, patient selection, choice of the device
      and mainly a study update. It is clearly shown, that VAD therapy has become an
      effective tool in the treatment of HF, and that the modern continuous flow pumps 
      have replaced the older, bulky, pulsatile devices, especially in the LVAD sector.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VAD) to support the left (LVAD), the right (RVAD) or 
      both ventricles (BVAD) have emerged as one standard of care for advanced heart
      failure patients. Initially used to bridge patients to transplantation (BTT) they
      are now more frequently implanted as permanent support (destination therapy, DT).
      Bridge to recovery (BTR) is a valid option for only a small number of patients.
      Although there are different devices available, patient selection, preoperative
      and intraoperative management, and the timing of VAD implantation are the
      elements critical to successful circulatory support.

TI  - Who is the high-risk recipient? Predicting mortality after heart transplant using
      pretransplant donor and recipient risk factors.
PG  - 520-7; discussion 527
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.02.086 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we sought the following: (1) To objectively assess the 
      risk related to various pretransplant recipient and donor characteristics; (2) to
      devise a preoperative risk stratification score (RSS) based on pretransplant
      recipient and donor characteristics predicting graft loss at 1 year; and (3) to
      define different risk strata based on RSS. METHODS: The United Network for Organ 
      Sharing provided de-identified patient-level data. Analysis included 11,703
      orthotopic heart transplant recipients aged 18 years or greater and transplanted 
      between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007. The primary outcome was 1-year
      graft failure. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (backward p value<0.20)
      was used to determine the relationship between pretransplant characteristics and 
      1-year graft failure. Using the odds ratio for each identified variable, an RSS
      was devised. The RSS strata were defined by calculating receiver operating
      characteristic curves and stratum specific likelihood ratios. RESULTS: The
      strongest negative predictors of 1-year graft failure included the following:
      right ventricular assist device only, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal 
      failure, extracorporeal left ventricular assist device, total artificial heart,
      and advanced age. Threshold analysis identified 5 discrete RSS strata: low risk
      (LR, RSS: <2.55; n=3242, 27.7%), intermediate risk (IR, RSS: 2.55-5.72; n=6,347, 
      54.2%), moderate risk (MR, RSS: 5.73-8.13; n=1,543, 13.2%), elevated risk (ER,
      RSS: 8.14-9.48; n=310, 2.6%), and high risk (HR, RSS: >9.48; n=261, 2.2%). The
      1-year actuarial survival (%) in the LR, IR, MR, ER, and HR groups were 93.8,
      89.2, 81.3, 67.0, and 47.0, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant recipient
      variables significantly influence early and late graft failure after heart
      transplantation. The RSS may improve organ allocation strategies by reducing the 
      potential negative impact of transplanting candidates who are at a high risk for 
      poor postoperative outcomes.

      advantage: time to re-evaluate the current UNOS policy.
PG  - 971-4
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.05.004 [doi]
AB  - Over the years, policies adopted by United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) have
      directed allocation of donor hearts in the USA. These policies have been based on
      algorithms that allocate a higher priority status to those patients who are the
      most infirm, and would thereby benefit patients in the most dire of
      circumstances. Over the last 2 decades, the increased use of LVADs as a bridge to
      transplantation has had a major impact on lowering the mortality among those on
      the heart transplant waiting list. Given the constant risk of potential
      complications related to these devices, early UNOS policies were implemented to
      specifically allocate higher priority status to patients on LVADs. However,
      recent advances in LVAD technology coupled with refinements in patient selection 
      and management have dramatically improved patient survival and led to a reduction
      in complications. It is inevitable that favorable experiences with the current
      generation of LVADs coupled with continued improvements in technology will lead
      to increased use of these devices as a bridge to transplantation or to candidacy.

AB  - Many people throughout the world are living with heart disease and advanced heart
      failure. They may be in need of a heart transplant, but because of the limited
      amount of donor hearts available, other options need to be available. Because of 
      the advancement of technology, there are now other options, and one option
      available would be a mechanical circulatory and cardiac support device.
      Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been developed over the past 30 years.
      From larger, earlier pulsatile devices to smaller, hand-held, newer axial flow or
      rotary pump devices, VADs are implanted cardiac assist devices. They are
      implanted to provide cardiac support and can be used temporarily as a bridge to
      transplant (for those awaiting a heart transplant) or implanted permanently,
      which is known as destination therapy. With the changes in the size of device,
      decrease in the size of drive line, increased length of battery life, as well as 
      length of device life, thousands of people now have these implanted VAD devices
      and are living quality lives and functioning at high levels. Currently, there are
      3 generations of the left ventricular assist devices being used throughout the
      world. Five of the most well-known type of left ventricular assist devices are
      discussed in this article.

AB  - Mycotic aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is one of the
      complications associated with infective endocarditis. However, there are no
      previous case reports in the literature describing mycotic SMA aneurysm after
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. We describe the case of a
      31-year-old male diagnosed with congestive heart failure due to nonischemic
      dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent LVAD implantation for bridge to heart
      transplantation. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was
      maintained on anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. There were no signs of
      pump failure or device-related infections. However, 7 months post-LVAD support,
      the patient complained of abdominal symptoms (nausea and vomiting) with low-grade
      fever. Computed tomography identified an aneurysmal change of the SMA (2.2 x 1.8 
      cm). There was no evidence of thrombus or septic vegetation inside the heart.
      Aneurysm and segmental small bowel resection was performed. Pathological study
      revealed typical findings of mycotic aneurysm with significant infiltration of
      inflammatory cells. The patient, however, expired due to concurrent brain
      hemorrhage. Postmortem study indicated no sign of pump thrombus or septic emboli 
      inside the pump or inflow/outflow conduit. This case report presents a rare
      mycotic aneurysm that developed in the SMA after chronic LVAD support.

PG  - 268-73
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3182223269 [doi]
AB  - The potential for long-term support on a ventricular assist device (VAD) in the
      bridge-to-transplant (BTT) and destination therapy (DT) settings has created
      unprecedented ethical challenges for patients and caregivers. Concerns include
      the patient's adaptation to life on a device and the ethical, clinical, and
      practical issues associated with living on mechanical support. On the basis of
      our experience treating 175 consecutive VAD patients, we have developed a model
      to address the ethical and psychosocial needs of patients undergoing VAD
      implantation. Patient preparation for VAD implantation encompasses three phases: 
      1) initial information regarding the physical events involved in implantation,
      risks and benefits of current device technology, and the use of VAD as a rescue
      device; 2) preimplant preparation including completion of advance directives
      specific to BTT/DT, competency determination, and identifying a patient
      spokesperson, multidisciplinary consultants, and cultural preferences regarding
      device withdrawal; and 3) VAD-specific end-of-life issues including plans for
      device replacement and palliative care with hospice or device withdrawal. This
      three-phase 10-point model addresses the ethical and psychosocial issues that
      should be discussed with patients undergoing VAD support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support is a highly effective technology to
      maintain organ perfusion in patients with cardiogenic shock as a bridge to
      transplantation. Although implantation of a left ventricular assist device alone 
      is often the preferred configuration, patients with biventricular failure and
      significant end-organ dysfunction often require biventricular assistance.
      METHODS: Between January 2000 and September 2008, 80 patients with severe
      biventricular failure were accepted for heart transplantation and received a
      pneumatic biventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplant. Patients were
      retrospectively divided into 2 groups: those successfully bridged to transplant
      (Group A) and those who died (Group B). Patients were also divided into 2 periods
      of implantation: Group X (2000-2005) and Group Y (2006-2008, which used a
      multidiscipline selection process). RESULTS: Overall success rate to
      transplantation was 71.3%, with Group Y demonstrating an 82% success to
      transplant rate vs 63% in Group X. One-year actuarial survival after transplant
      was 89% compared with 92% in patients without a ventricular assist device. There 
      were no statistically significant laboratory parameters between Groups A and B
      identifying potential risk factors for poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Biventricular
      assist device therapy represents an effective and reliable means of supporting
      selected Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
      profile 1 patients as a bridge to transplantation, with excellent success to
      transplant rates and post-transplant survival.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support after heart transplantation.
PG  - 200-6; discussion 206
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.04.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may be used for severe graft
      failure after heart transplantation, but the degree to which it is lifesaving is 
      uncertain. METHODS: Between June 1990 and December 2009, 53 patients after 1417
      heart transplants (3.7%) required post-transplant MCS for acute rejection (n=17),
      biventricular failure (n=16), right ventricular failure (n=16), left ventricular 
      failure (n=1), or respiratory failure (n=3). Although support was occasionally
      instituted remotely post-transplant (5>1 year), in 39 (73%) instances it was
      required within 1 week. Initial mode of support was extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation in 43 patients (81%), biventricular assist device in 4 (7.5%), and
      right ventricular assist device in 6 (11%). RESULTS: Risk of requiring
      respiratory support was highest in those with restrictive cardiomyopathy as
      indication for transplant, women, and those with elevated pulmonary pressure or
      renal failure. Complications of support, which increased progressively with its
      duration, included stroke in two patients (3.8%), infection in two (3.8%), and
      reoperation for bleeding (seven instances) in four (7.0%). Nineteen patients
      (36%) recovered and were removed from support, five (9.4%) underwent
      retransplantation (four after biventricular failure and one after acute
      rejection), and 29 died while on support (55%). Overall survival after initiating
      support was 94%, 83%, 66%, and 43% at 1, 3, 7, and 30 days, respectively.
      Patients requiring support for biventricular failure had better survival than
      those having acute rejection or other indications (P=0.03). Survival after
      retransplantation or removal from support following recovery was 88% at 1 year
      and 61% at 10 years. CONCLUSION: Severe refractory heart failure after
      transplantation is a rare catastrophic event for which MCS offers the possibility
      of recovery or bridge to retransplantation, particularly for patients with
      biventricular failure in the absence of rejection. Early retransplantation should
      be considered in patients who show no evidence of graft recovery on MCS.

TI  - [Technique of implantation and experience with temporary mechanical cardiac
      support in right ventricular failure].
PG  - 88-94
AB  - AIM: Severe right heart failure remains unfrequent but fatal complication of
      cardiac surgical procedures. Implantation of temporary right ventricular assist
      device may be life-saving procedure in various situations of right heart failure 
      as: heart transplantation, LVAD therapy and post-cardiotomy failure. The aim of
      the study is an introduction of the implantation technique and retrospective
      review of current experience with the method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since January
      2007 isolated right ventricular assist device Levitronix CentriMag has been
      implanted in 16 patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups: post
      transplantation (post-Tx), post LVAD implantation (post-LVAD) and other cardiac
      procedures (OCP). Success rate of weaning from RVAD, 30-days mortality and major 
      complications has been assessed. OUTCOMES: Distribution of implants in groups
      was: post-Tx 5 pts (31%), post-LVAD 6 pts (38%) and 5 in OCP group (31%). The
      mean support time was 12 days. Off-pump implantation was achieved in 9 pts. The
      device was successfully weaned in 13 (81%) patients. 30-days mortality occurred
      in 1 case only. CONCLUSION: Presented outcomes are encouraging for broader
      acceptance of the therapy. Excellent success rate has been reached in post-Tx and
      post-LVAD. This study emphasises decesive role of proactive approach in early
      indication of RVAD implantation for achieving satisfactory results.

TI  - Survival after biventricular assist device implantation: an analysis of the
      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support database.
PG  - 862-9
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.04.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients requiring biventricular assist device (BiVAD) for mechanical
      circulatory support (MCS) have substantially worse outcomes than patients
      requiring left VAD (LVAD) support only. Patient-specific risk factors have yet to
      be consistently identified in a large, multicenter registry, which may underlie
      the poorer outcomes for BiVAD patients. The Interagency Registry for Mechanically
      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) is a registry of U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration-approved durable MCS devices used for bridge-to-transplantation,
      destination therapy, or recovery. The purposes of this study were to 1) identify 
      the underlying pre-implant characteristics of the population requiring BiVAD
      support that contribute to reduced survival, and 2) identify differences in
      postoperative outcomes with respect to adverse events compared with patients
      supported with LVAD alone. METHODS: From June 2006 to September 2009, 1,646
      patients were entered into the INTERMACS database in which adverse events and
      outcomes were recorded for primary implants with LVAD or BiVAD. Competing
      outcomes methodology was used to estimate the time-related probability of death, 
      transplant, or recovery. Overall survival for all groups was analyzed with
      Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional regression analysis. RESULTS: The
      distribution of primary device implants included 1,440 LVADs and 206 BiVADs.
      BiVAD patients presented with a lower INTERMACS profile 93% in INTERMACS 1 or 2, 
      compared with 73% for LVAD patients (p < 0.001). Survival at 6 months was 86% for
      LVADs and 56% for BiVADs (p < .0001). Adverse event rates, expressed as
      episodes/100 patient-months for the BiVAD group compared with LVAD, were
      significantly higher for infection (33.2 vs 14.3), bleeding (71.6 vs 15.5),
      neurologic events (7.9 vs 2.6), and for device failure (4.9 vs 2.0). CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients requiring BiVAD support at the time of durable MCS implant are more
      critically ill at the time of MCS implant. BiVAD patients experience worse
      survival than patients supported with LVAD alone and higher rates of serious
      adverse events. Characteristics of the population present at the time of BiVAD
      implant likely influence post-implant MCS outcomes.

PG  - 358-62
LID - 10.1016/j.cjca.2011.01.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are used in cases of heart failure 
      refractory to medical therapy. Most VADs are used as a bridge to heart
      transplantation; however, in certain cases, myocardial function recovers and VADs
      can be explanted after the patient is weaned. The objectives of this study were
      to describe patients who required Heartmate II VAD insertion, followed by
      myocardial recovery and explanation in a quaternary heart centre. METHODS:
      Patients who had a VAD explanted were identified in the mechanical support
      institutional database and their outcomes were analyzed. Clinical examinations,
      biochemical markers, and serial echocardiograms were used to demonstrate
      myocardial recovery. RESULTS: Seventeen patients had a Heartmate II VAD inserted 
      between 2008 and 2010. Four patients underwent successful weaning and subsequent 
      VAD explantation. Etiology of decompensated heart failure was idiopathic dilated 
      cardiomyopathy (n = 1), ischemic (n = 1), or myocarditis (n = 2). Mean age was
      35.3 years. Patients were supported for 213 days (range 70-293 days) and were in 
      New York Heart Association class I in the community before explantation. The
      devices were explanted via a minimally invasive approach, without cardiopulmonary
      bypass. All patients survived explantation and were discharged alive from
      hospital after an average of 5.7 +/- 1.5 days post pump explantation. No adverse 
      events were reported after explantation. Only one patient required allogenic
      blood transfusion after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring VAD
      support for myocardial failure can undergo significant reverse remodelling.
      Explantation can lead to optimal outcome with minimal morbidity. Methods for
      assessment of reverse remodelling, weaning protocol, and optimal timing of
      explantation remain under evaluation.

AB  - The 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Heart Failure (HF) Guidelines Focused
      Update reviews the recently published clinical trials that will potentially
      impact on management. Also reviewed is the less studied but clinically important 
      area of sleep apnea. Finally, patients with advanced HF represent a group of
      patients who pose major difficulties to clinicians. Advanced HF therefore is
      examined from the perspectives of HF complicated by renal failure, the role of
      palliative care, and the role of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). All of
      these topics are reviewed from a perspective of practical applications. Important
      new studies have demonstrated in less symptomatic HF patients that cardiac
      resynchronization therapy will be of benefit. As well, aldosterone receptor
      antagonists can be used with benefit in less symptomatic HF patients. The
      important role of palliative care and the need to address end-of-life issues in
      advanced HF are emphasized. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of
      sleep apnea complicating the course of HF and the role of a sleep study for the
      proper assessment and management of the conditon. Patients with either acute
      severe or chronic advanced HF with otherwise good life expectancy should be
      referred to a cardiac centre capable of providing MCS. Furthermore, patients
      awaiting heart transplantation who deteriorate or are otherwise not likely to
      survive until a donor organ is found should be referred for MCS.

AB  - Risk stratification models are effective tools for the management of
      cardiovascular diseases. Although several risk scores have been proposed, the
      relevance and superiority of these predictive models have not been fully
      validated in an independent and nonclinical trial-based population. We studied
      2,472 consecutive patients initially hospitalized in our institution from April
      2004 to December 2009. Risk scores were calculated for each patient using 4 risk 
      score models, including the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), Acute
      Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry regression model, the American
      Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure score, and the
      Association of Health Aging and Body Composition Heart Failure score. The
      predictive ability for the composite end point, including total death, heart
      transplantation, and left ventricle assist device implantation, was assessed by
      calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for each
      model. During the follow-up period after admission (median 924.5 days), the
      combined end point occurred in 295 patients (11.8%), including 27 in-hospital
      deaths (1.1%). Compared with the other 3 risk score models, the SHFM risk score
      demonstrated a greater area under the curve for the combined end point at the
      overall, in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up point (0.741 to
      0.890). The survival rate predicted by SHFM demonstrated an excellent correlation
      with the actual survival rate (R(2) = 0.990). In conclusion, these results
      suggest that the SHFM risk score is the most suitable for the discrimination and 
      calibration of mortality risk stratification in patients with cardiovascular
      disease.

TI  - Left ventricular assist device support with a centrifugal pump for 2 months in a 
      5-kg child.
PG  - 253-6
LID - 10.1007/s10047-011-0572-x [doi]
AB  - The mid-term and long-term results of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      implantation for small children are still unsatisfactory. There have been few
      reports of LVAD implantation for more than a month in children weighing under 5
      kg. We report the case of a 4-month-old female infant who survived for 2 months
      after being diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with extracorporeal
      centrifugal pump support. In recent years, although pumps designed for small
      children have been introduced and are used as a bridge to transplantation or
      recovery, mid-term or long-term mechanical support for small children with heart 
      failure is still difficult. We managed to successfully provide support for a
      low-body-weight child with a centrifugal pump over a mid-term period. We achieved
      acceptable control of thrombosis, but eventually the infant died of sepsis.
      Autopsy revealed no prominent thrombosis in the perfusion cannula, drainage
      cannula, the pump, or the left ventricle. This is the first case report of LVAD
      support with the centrifugal pump, ROTAFLOW((R)) (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany), for 
      2 months in a child weighing under 5 kg. Our method may potentially save severe
      heart failure children who need mid-term LVAD support.

TI  - Results of mechanical circulatory support in France.
PG  - e112-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.04.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the analyzed results on mechanical circulatory support
      (MCS) collected over a 7-year period, from 2000 to 2006, in France. METHODS: A
      cohort of 520 patients was analyzed. Mean age was 43.7 +/- 13.6 years. The main
      causes of cardiac failure were ischemic cardiomyopathy (39%), idiopathic dilated 
      cardiomyopathy (41.3%), or myocarditis (6.4%). Bridge to transplantation was
      indicated in 87.8% of patients, bridge to recovery in 9%, while destination
      therapy was proposed in 3.2% of patients. RESULTS: For patients in cardiogenic
      shock or advanced heart failure undergoing device implantation as bridge to
      transplantation or recovery (n=458), overall mortality was 39% (n=179). The main 
      causes of mortality under MCS were multi-organ failure (MOF) (57.4%),
      neurological events (14.1%), or infections (11.9%). Heart transplantation was
      performed in 249 (54.3%) patients. The main causes of death following heart
      transplantation were primary graft failure (22.4%), MOF (14.3%), neurological
      event (14.3%), or infection (10.2%). Long-term survival in transplanted patients 
      was 75 +/- 2.8% at 1 year and 66 +/- 3.4% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: MCS is an
      essential therapeutic tool to save the life of young patients with cardiogenic
      shock or advanced cardiac failure. Early MCS implantation and the availability of
      a device that is adapted to the patient's clinical status are prerequisites for
      reducing overall mortality rates.

AB  - Pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure require mechanical circulatory
      support (MCS) just as adults do. In order to meet the special requirements for
      neonates' and infants' MCS, pediatric circulatory support devices must be compact
      with low priming volume, easily controllable with low flow, less traumatic for
      blood cells and tissues, and biocompatible with minimum anticoagulation. We have 
      designed and developed a miniature rotary centrifugal blood pump, "TinyPump,"
      with a priming volume of 5 mL, which has already demonstrated its controllable
      performance for low flow and durability in vitro. To evaluate the feasibility of 
      the TinyPump as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) suitable for neonates and
      infants, we have examined the biocompatibility and hemodynamic performance of the
      TinyPump in a pediatric animal model using Shiba goats. The TinyPump is a
      miniaturized centrifugal pump weighing 150 g comprising a disposable pump head
      with a 30-mm diameter impeller having six straight-vanes and a reusable motor
      driver. The impeller in the pump head is supported by a hydrodynamic bearing at
      its center and is driven by radial magnetic force coupled to the motor driver.
      TinyPump implantations were performed in 22 Shiba goats (17 female and 5 male),
      with body weights ranging from 8.4 to 27.2 kg. Under gas anesthesia, via left
      lateral thoracotomy, a 22 Fr inflow cannula was inserted through the left
      ventricular apex, while a 6-mm outflow graft was anastomosed to the descending
      aorta, which were then connected to a TinyPump mounted on the animal's back.
      Postoperative hemodynamic monitoring included heart rate, arterial and central
      venous pressure, pump flow, and rotation speed. Target pump flow in all animals
      was maintained at 0.9 +/- 0.1 L/min, which is approximately half the normal
      pulmonary artery flow measured in control animals. Blood samples were collected
      to evaluate peripheral organ functions, hemolysis, and thrombosis. Goats were
      divided into three groups-acute phase (6 h; n = 4), subchronic phase (6 h 2
      postoperative days [POD]; n = 11), and chronic phase (3 POD-16 POD; n = 8)-based 
      on their survival duration. In the early experiments, hemolysis and thrombi
      formation at the impeller bearing resulted in termination of the study.
      Subsequent modifications of the bearing design, pump housing design, and magnetic
      coupling force helped to minimize the hemolysis and thrombi formation, prolonging
      the survival duration of the Shiba goats to 2 weeks with minimum adverse effects 
      on the blood components and organ functions. With further experiments and
      improvements in pump durability and hemocompatibility, the TinyPump can serve as 
      a suitable circulatory support device for neonates and infants bridging to heart 
      transplantation as well as to heart recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The treatment of severe biventricular (BV) contractile failure using
      mechanical circulatory support is challenging. We analyzed our center's results
      following implantation of a biventricular assist device (BVAD). METHODS: We
      implanted 39 BVADs between September 2001 and January 2009. All patients were
      qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organ available at
      time of BVAD implantation. Fifteen patients without a history of chronic
      cardiomyopathy suffered from acute BV failure (group 1), whereas the other 24
      suffered from severe chronic cardiomyopathy (group 2). The indication for BVAD
      implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degree of
      end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was
      a candidate for bridge to recovery. RESULTS: Both groups were similar regarding
      their preoperative hemodynamics, intraoperative and early postoperative findings,
      and adverse events. Patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37+/-17 years)
      than those in group 2 (51+/-12 years). Mean duration of support in group 1 was
      137+/-109 days, and 65+/-61 days in group 2. In group 1, 33% (5/15) were weaned
      off the device and 53% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24
      patients (42%) in the chronic group were transplanted. Group 1's mortality on the
      device was lower than that of group 2 (13% vs 67%). Furthermore, 11 patients of
      group 1 survived for 1 year compared with four in group 2 (73% vs 17%).
      CONCLUSION: Implantation of a BVAD in patients with chronic heart failure and
      acute decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. By
      contrast, BVAD implantation can achieve excellent results in patients with acute 
      BV failure without a history of chronic cardiomyopathy, even if they are in
      cardiogenic shock upon admission.

TI  - Changing outcomes in patients bridged to heart transplantation with continuous-
      versus pulsatile-flow ventricular assist devices: an analysis of the registry of 
      the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
PG  - 854-61
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.03.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients bridged to heart transplantation with left ventricular
      assist devices (LVADs) have been reported to have higher post-transplant
      mortality compared with those without LVADs. Our aim was to determine the impact 
      of the type of LVAD and implant era on post-transplant survival. METHODS: In this
      study we included 8,557 patients from the registry of the International Society
      for Heart and Lung Transplantation. We examined post-transplant outcomes in 1,100
      patients bridged to transplant with pulsatile-flow LVADs between January 2000 and
      June 2004 (first era), 880 patients bridged with pulsatile-flow LVADs between
      July 2004 and May 2008 (second era), and 417 patients bridged with
      continuous-flow LVADs in the second era. Patients who required intravenous
      inotropes but not LVAD support (n = 2,728) and patients who did not require
      either LVAD or inotropes (n = 3,432) served as controls. RESULTS: Post-transplant
      survival of patients bridged with pulsatile LVADs improved significantly between 
      the first and the second era (p = 0.03). In the second era, there was no
      significant difference in post-transplant survival of patients bridged with
      pulsatile- vs continuous-flow LVADs (p = 0.26), and survival rates in the 2
      groups were not statistically different from that of the non-LVAD group. Graft
      rejection was similar in patients bridged with LVADs compared to those without
      LVADs. CONCLUSIONS: In the most recent era, the use of either pulsatile- or
      continuous-flow LVADs did not result in increased post-transplant mortality. This
      finding is important as the proportion of patients with LVADs at the time of
      transplant has been rising.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices may function as a bridge to recovery or heart
      transplantation, however, little is known about its mechanisms. This study
      examined the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-tissue inhibitors of
      metalloproteinases (TIMP) axis in the process of recovery after unloading in a
      rat ischemic-induce heart failure (HF) model. Myocardial infarction model was
      created with the coronary artery ligation. The infarcted rats hearts were
      unloaded by heterotopic cardiac transplantation (n=14). 2 weeks later, the
      function of normal and infarcted hearts with or without loading was evaluated by 
      Langendorff perfusion model. The hearts were then harvested and prepared for the 
      study of expression of MMPs and TIMPs. Developed pressure in the unloading group 
      was higher than the loading group (P=0.0074). Unloading increased the ratio of
      TIMP-1-MMP-1(1.38+/-0.11 vs. 0.76+/-0.09, P<0.05), TIMP-2-MMP-2 (1.06+/-0.10 vs. 
      0.33+/-0.07, P<0.01), TIMP-3-MMP-9(1.07+/-0.08 vs. 0.59+/-0.06, P<0.05). Although
      MMP-1, 2, 9 were downregulated (P<0.01, 0.01, 0.05, respectively), TIMP-2 and
      TIMP-3 upregulated (P<0.01, 0.05, respectively), MMP-7 and TIMP-1 was not
      affected significantly. The infarcted cardiac function could be improved by
      unloading. It was attributed to downregulation of MMP-1, 2 and 9, and
      upregulation of TIMP-2 and -3, and furthermore, the ratio of TIMPs to MMPs was
      increased, which might be more sensitive than sole MMPs or TIMPs for the judgment
      of myocardial matrix homeostasis.

AB  - In recent years, artificial heart devices have been implanted in a considerable
      number of patients with terminal cardiac failure for bridge to transplantation
      and even destination therapy. These devices provide either pulsatile or
      continuous blood flow. To determine eventual physiological effects of these
      different types of flow on the aorta,a computational fluid dynamics model of the 
      aorta and its thoracic branches was implemented. Pulsatile and continuous flow
      fields were calculated by implementing a comprehensive computational framework
      with a stabilized finite element method. The computed results revealed that the
      pulsatile pump support results in a lower mean shear stress and higher
      oscillatory shear stress index than the continuous pump support. The flow
      patterns for the pulsatile pump support above the closed aortic valves show a
      similar washout as for the continuous pump support. In summary, from the flow
      pattern simulation there was no particular preference for either pulsatile or
      continuous devices

TI  - The effect of ventricular assist devices on long-term post-transplant outcomes: a
      systematic review of observational studies.
PG  - 785-95
LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfr050 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy is widely used as a bridge to
      cardiac transplant. Studies addressing the effect of VADs on post-transplant
      outcomes have shown conflicting results. It is imperative to review this evidence
      to inform clinical decision making and future research. Our aim was to
      systematically evaluate the effect of VAD therapy on long-term post-transplant
      outcomes in heart transplant recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched online 
      databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL) and references of included
      articles. Comparative studies evaluating the effect of VADs on post-transplant
      outcomes in adults were included and study results were meta-analysed using
      random-effects models. We conducted subgroup analyses to assess the effect
      estimate of extra- vs. intra-corporeal VADs and to evaluate the impact of
      transplant era and listing status. Overall, we identified 31 observational
      studies. One-year post-transplant mortality in recipients bridged with an
      extra-corporeal VAD was significantly higher than in non-bridged recipients (RR
      1.8, 95% CI 1.53-2.13, I(2)= 1%), while patients supported with an
      intra-corporeal VAD had similar mortality to non-bridged recipients (RR 1.08, 95%
      CI 0.95-1.22, I(2)= 0%). The risks of rejection within the first post-transplant 
      year and coronary allograft vasculopathy were not significantly different between
      patients with or without VAD support prior to transplant. Publication bias was
      low; however, the risk of bias across studies was moderate to high. CONCLUSION:
      Intra-corporeal VAD support does not have a deleterious impact on post-transplant
      outcomes. However, post-transplant survival may be poorer in the subgroup of
      patients supported with extra-corporeal devices. Studies with greater
      methodological rigour are warranted.

TI  - ACCF/AHA/HFSA 2011 survey results: current staffing profile of heart failure
      programs, including programs that perform heart transplant and mechanical
      circulatory support device implantation.
PG  - 349-58
LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2011.04.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There have been no published recommendations about staffing needs for
      a heart failure (HF) clinic or an office setting focused on heart transplant. The
      goal of this survey was to understand the current staffing environment of HF,
      transplant, and mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) programs in the
      United States and abroad. This report identifies current staffing patterns but
      does not endorse a particular staffing model. METHODS: An online survey, jointly 
      sponsored by the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), American Heart
      Association (AHA), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), was sent to
      the members of all 3 organizations who had identified themselves as interested in
      HF, heart transplant, or both, between March 12, 2009, and May 12, 2009. RESULTS:
      The overall response rate to the 1,823 e-mail surveys was 23%. There were 257
      unique practices in the United States (81% of total sites) and 58 international
      sites (19%); approximately 30% of centers were in a cardiovascular group practice
      and 30% in a medical school hospital setting. The large majority of practices
      delivered HF care in both an inpatient and outpatient environment, and slightly
      more centers were implanting MCSDs (47%) than performing cardiac transplantation 
      (39%). Most practices (43%) were small, with <4 staff members, or small- to
      medium-sized (34%), with 4 to 10 staff members, with only 23% being medium (11-20
      staff) or large programs (>20 staff). On average, a U.S. HF practice cared for
      1,641 outpatients annually. An average HF program with transplant performed 10
      transplants. Although larger programs were able to perform more transplants and
      see more outpatient HF visits, their clinician staffing volume tended to double
      for approximately every 500 to 700 additional HF visits annually. The average
      staffing utilization was 2.65 physician full-time equivalents (FTEs), 2.21
      nonphysician practitioner (nurse practitioner or physician assistant) FTEs, and
      2.61 nurse coordinator FTEs annually. CONCLUSIONS: The HF patient population is
      growing in number in the United States and internationally, and the clinicians
      who provide the highly skilled and time-consuming care to this population are
      under intense scrutiny as a result of focused quality improvement initiatives and
      reduced financial resources. Staffing guidelines should be developed to ensure
      that an adequate number of qualified professionals are hired for a given practice
      volume. These survey results are an initial step in developing such standards.

TI  - Results of the post-U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approval study with a
      continuous flow left ventricular assist device as a bridge to heart
      transplantation: a prospective study using the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry
      for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support).
PG  - 1890-8

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether results with the
      HeartMate (HM) II left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (Thoratec Corporation,
      Pleasanton, California) in a commercial setting are comparable to other available
      devices for the same indication. BACKGROUND: After a multicenter pivotal clinical
      trial conducted from 2005 to 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
      the HM II LVAD for bridge to transplantation (BTT). A post-approval study was
      required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine whether results
      with the device in a commercial setting are comparable to other available devices
      for the same indication. METHODS: The study was a prospective evaluation of the
      first 169 consecutive HM II patients enrolled in the national INTERMACS
      (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) who were
      listed for transplant or likely to be listed. Patients were enrolled from April
      through August 2008 at 77 U.S. centers and followed for at least 1 year after
      implant. A comparison group (COMP) included all patients (n = 169 at 27 centers) 
      enrolled in the INTERMACS registry with other types of LVADs (79% HeartMate XVE, 
      21% Implantable Ventricular Assist Device [Thoratec Corporation]) for the same
      BTT indication in the same time period. Survival rates, adverse events, and
      quality of life with the EuroQol EQ-5D visual analog scale were obtained in the
      INTERMACS registry. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar, but
      creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were lower in the HM II versus COMP groups,
      and there were fewer patients in the highest-risk INTERMACS patient profile
      Number 1 (24% for HM II vs. 39% for COMP). Adverse event rates were similar or
      lower for HM II versus COMP for all events. Bleeding was the most frequent
      adverse event for both groups (1.44 vs. 1.79 events/patient-year). Operative
      30-day mortality for HM II was 4% versus 11% for COMP. The percentage of patients
      reaching transplant, cardiac recovery, or ongoing LVAD support by 6 months was
      91% for HM II and 80% for COMP, and the Kaplan-Meier survival for patients
      remaining on support at 1 year was 85% for HM II versus 70% for COMP. Quality of 
      life was significantly improved at 3 months of support and sustained through 12
      months in both groups compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results in a
      post-market approval, actual patient care setting BTT population support the
      original findings from the pivotal clinical trial regarding the efficacy and risk
      profile of the HM II LVAD. These data suggest that dissemination of this
      technology after approval has been associated with continued excellent results.

TI  - Quality of life for patients supported on a left ventricular assist device.
PG  - 325-37
LID - 10.1586/erd.11.9 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are mechanical pumps implanted into
      patients at risk of dying from Stage D heart failure. These devices not only
      increase survival time, they also significantly improve quality of life.
      Implantation of a LVAD improves hemodynamics and reduces congestion in both the
      pulmonary and peripheral vasculature. Improvements in forward blood flow are
      probably responsible for the significant reduction in the severity of dyspnea and
      fatigue postimplant. Quality of life is a subjective evaluation and includes
      aspects of physical, mental and social functioning. Quality of life is
      significantly improved after implantation of a LVAD, changes little over the
      duration of support and improves again following heart transplantation. Patients 
      who are discharged home on support report significantly better quality of life
      than patients who remain in hospital. At home patients can resume physical,
      mental and social activities that were compromised preimplant. A significant
      decline in functional ability while on support may be a trigger for patients to
      initiate discussions regarding LVAD withdrawal. While the bulk of evidence was
      generated during the era of pulsatile support, preliminary information suggests
      similar results can be anticipated for patients supported on continuous-flow
      devices.

TI  - Incomplete recovery of myocyte contractile function despite improvement of
      myocardial architecture with left ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 425-32
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.961326 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unloading a failing heart with a left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) can improve ejection fraction (EF) and LV size; however, recovery with
      LVAD explantation is rare. We hypothesized that evaluation of myocyte
      contractility and biochemistry at the sarcomere level before and after LVAD may
      explain organ-level changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Paired LV tissue samples were
      frozen from 8 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy at LVAD implantation
      (before LVAD) and before cardiac transplantation (after LVAD). These were
      compared with 8 nonfailing hearts. Isolated skinned myocytes were purified and
      attached to a force transducer, and dimensions, maximum calcium-saturated force, 
      calcium sensitivity, and myofilament cooperativity were assessed. Relative
      isoform abundance and phosphorylation levels of sarcomeric contractile proteins
      were measured. With LVAD support, the unloaded EF improved (10.0+/-1.0% to
      25.6+/-11.0%, P=0.007), LV size decreased (LV internal dimension at end diastole,
      7.6+/-1.2 to 4.9+/-1.4 cm; P<0.001), and myocyte dimensions decreased
      (cross-sectional area, 1247+/-346 to 638+/-254 mum(2); P=0.001). Maximum
      calcium-saturated force improved after LVAD (3.6+/-0.9 to 7.3+/-1.8 mN/mm(2),
      P<0.001) implantation but was still lower than in nonfailing hearts (7.3+/-1.8
      versus 17.6+/-1.8 mN/mm(2), P<0.001). An increase in troponin I (TnI)
      phosphorylation after LVAD implantation was noted, but protein kinase C
      phosphorylation of TnI decreased. Biochemical changes of other sarcomeric
      proteins were not observed after LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant
      improvement in LV and myocyte size with LVAD, but there is only partial recovery 
      of EF and myocyte contractility. LVAD support was associated only with
      biochemical changes in TnI, suggesting that alternate mechanisms might contribute
      to contractile changes after LVAD and that additional interventions may be needed
      to alter biochemical remodeling of the sarcomere to further enhance myofilament
      and organ-level recovery.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 108 patients with low cardiac output - a
      single-center experience.
PG  - 365-73
LID - 10.5301/IJAO.2011.7727 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For short-term ventricular and pulmonary support the extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump
      (Medtronic(R), Minneapolis, MN, USA) was applied in 108 patients with cardiac
      low-output. METHODS: From December 1996 to July 2006 the ECMO was implanted in
      108 patients (73 adult, mean age: 49.3+/-18.0 yrs and 35 children, mean age: 1.3 
      +/- 2.7 yrs) with mostly postcardiotomy cardiac low output. The surgical
      procedures included congenital heart surgery (n=35), heart transplantation (HTx) 
      (n=21), coronary artery bypass operation (CABG) and/or valvular operation (n=33),
      other operations (n=6) and 13 patients with ECMO support for bridge to recovery. 
      RESULTS: The mean supporting time was 5.1+/-5.6 days. Overall, 30-day-survival
      was 40.2%. Best survival rates were seen after congenital heart surgery (24/35,
      65.7%) and after HTx (9/21, 42.9%); the worst rates were in the group of CABG
      and/or valvular operations (5/33, 15.2%), only ECMO support (3/13, 23.1%) and
      other operations (1/6, 16.7%). Fifty-four patients died while supported by ECMO, 
      15 were weaned from ECMO but died in hospital, 39 patients were weaned and
      survived. Causes of death were multi-organ failure (40.6%), bleeding (23.2%),
      persistent cardiac low output (21.7%), thrombembolic events (8.7%), and graft
      failure (5.8%). Markers for adverse outcome were identified as older age, high
      body weight, increased AST/GOT levels, and lower thrombocyte count in adults; and
      as higher levels of serum creatinine in pediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO
      support showed best results in pediatric patients after congenital heart surgery 
      and in patients after HTx in contrast to multimorbid, older patients with often
      irreversible myocardial damage.

TI  - Osteopontin: a potential biomarker for heart failure and reverse remodeling after
      left ventricular assist device support.
PG  - 805-10
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.03.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support in end-stage heart
      failure (HF) leads to recovery of the patient's condition, size reduction of
      cardiomyocytes, and also volume reduction and change in the composition of the
      extracellular matrix (ECM). Myocardial expression of ECM osteopontin (OPN)
      protein increases with the severity of HF. We analyzed whether OPN messenger RNA 
      expression in heart tissue and/or OPN protein in plasma are associated with
      reverse remodeling during LVAD support. METHODS: Plasma and heart tissue
      specimens of 22 end-stage HF patients before and after LVAD implantation and
      subsequent heart transplantation (HTx) were used to determine the concentrations 
      of OPN protein (EIA) and OPN messenger RNA (mRNA) by quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) were
      performed to locate OPN protein and mRNA. RESULTS: The high OPN protein levels in
      plasma of HF patients did not differ significantly before and after LVAD support 
      in ischemic heart disease (IHD) (pre-LVAD 167 +/- 32 ng/ml; post-LVAD 165 +/- 28 
      ng/ml) and in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (pre-LVAD 99 +/- 12 ng/ml; post-LVAD
      (142 +/- 6 ng/ml). The OPN plasma levels after HTx decreased to control levels
      (IHD, 48 +/- 6; DCM, 40 +/- 5; control, 31 +/- 3 ng/ml). In contrast, expression 
      of OPN mRNA in heart biopsy specimens decreased significantly after LVAD support 
      (the relative quantity decreased > 90% in IHD and 50% in DCM). ISH and IHC
      revealed that OPN was present in cardiomyocytes and in the ECM. CONCLUSIONS:
      Levels of OPN mRNA in the myocardium of HF patients showed a significant decrease
      after LVAD support but OPN protein expression did not. LVAD support only induced 
      a decrease of OPN plasma levels in individual patients, whereas OPN plasma levels
      reduced significantly in all patients after HTx.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) failure is a major contributor to morbidity
      and mortality after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Accurate 
      evaluation of RV function in patients with LVAD remains challenging. We
      hypothesized that, after LVAD implantation, electrocardiographic-gated cardiac
      computed tomography (CCT) allows RV evaluation with higher feasibility and
      reproducibility compared with echocardiography. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with
      an implanted LVAD who had 2-dimensional echocardiography and CCT evaluation were 
      studied. RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction were
      quantified using CCT. RV fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic
      excursion and RV end-diastolic short-to-long axis ratio were calculated by
      echocardiography. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman
      analysis were used to assess intra- and interobserver reproducibility for all
      measurements. RESULTS: The quality of CCT studies was good in all cases except
      for one. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility for all CCT measurements was
      high (interobserver ICC for RV ejection fraction = 0.89, 95% confidence interval 
      0.74 to 0.95). Echocardiographic indices of RV function and geometry had lower
      reproducibility. The echocardiographic index that best correlated with the
      CCT-determined RV ejection fraction was RV fractional area change (r = 0.80, p < 
      0.001). In addition, CCT detected relevant post-operative findings in 50% of the 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: CCT is highly effective and reproducible compared with
      echocardiography for the evaluation of RV function in patients with LVAD support 
      and provides relevant information on post-operative findings. Our results suggest
      that CCT should be considered as a useful imaging modality in this clinical
      setting.

PG  - 870-8
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.03.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Used frequently for right ventricular dysfunction (RVD), the clinical
      benefit of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is still unclear. We conducted a
      randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to determine the effect of iNO on
      post-operative outcomes in the setting of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      placement. METHODS: Included were 150 patients undergoing LVAD placement with
      pulmonary vascular resistance >/= 200 dyne/sec/cm(-5). Patients received iNO (40 
      ppm) or placebo (an equivalent concentration of nitrogen) until 48 hours after
      separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, extubation, or upon meeting study-defined
      RVD. For ethical reasons, crossover to open-label iNO was allowed during the
      48-hour treatment period if RVD criteria were met. RESULTS: RVD criteria were met
      by 7 of 73 patients (9.6%; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-16.3) in the iNO group
      compared with 12 of 77 (15.6%; 95% confidence interval, 7.5-23.7) who received
      placebo (p = 0.330). Time on mechanical ventilation decreased in the iNO group
      (median days, 2.0 vs 3.0; p = 0.077), and fewer patients in the iNO group
      required an RVAD (5.6% vs 10%; p = 0.468); however, these trends did not meet
      statistical boundaries of significance. Hospital stay, intensive care unit stay, 
      and 28-day mortality rates were similar between groups, as were adverse events.
      Thirty-five patients crossed over to open-label iNO (iNO, n = 15; placebo, n =
      20). Eighteen patients (iNO, n = 9; placebo, n = 9) crossed over before RVD
      criteria were met. CONCLUSIONS: Use of iNO at 40 ppm in the perioperative phase
      of LVAD implantation did not achieve significance for the primary end point of
      reduction in RVD. Similarly, secondary end points of time on mechanical
      ventilation, hospital or intensive care unit stay, and the need for RVAD support 
      after LVAD placement were not significantly improved.

TI  - Less invasive off-pump implantation of axial flow pumps in chronic ischemic heart
      failure: survival effects.
PG  - 834-7
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.03.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Off-pump implantation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) axial 
      or centrifugal flow pumps in patients with low ejection fraction (EF) is of major
      clinical relevance. In addition, all pre-clinical, long-term implantations
      performed so far have been carried out in healthy animals, but this does not
      reflect the eventual clinical setting. In this study we established a new
      technique using a miniaturized axial flow pump in sheep with chronically ischemic
      myocardium. METHODS: Sheep (n = 15) underwent intracoronary sphere injection to
      create chronic ischemic heart failure. Reduced EF was assessed using
      transesophageal echocardiography. All animals underwent implantation of a new
      miniaturized axial flow pump via an extraperitoneal, subcostal surgical approach.
      RESULTS: Our technique allows easy exposure of the diaphragmatic surface of the
      heart and the descending aorta. Ten animals (range 65 to 78 kg) underwent
      off-pump implantation 30 (range 25 to 33) days after intracoronary sphere
      injection. All animals had significantly reduced EF (25 +/- 4.8%) and were
      receiving high doses of inotropic agents to maintain cardiac function. Nine
      animals survived the surgical procedure. The average 12-hour blood loss was 435
      ml. Cardiac index improved significantly in all animals. The procedure time was
      not extended by any adverse events (60 to 145 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: The
      extraperitoneal, subcostal surgical approach is less invasive than a median
      sternotomy and allows centrifugal or axial to be implanted quickly and without
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Avoiding CPB and an extensive mediastinal
      dissection can help to decrease significantly the number of complications in
      patients with end-stage organ failure.

TI  - Right heart failure and "failure to thrive" after left ventricular assist device:
      clinical predictors and outcomes.
PG  - 888-95
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.03.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study determined predictors of early post-operative right heart 
      failure (RHF) and its consequences, as well as predictors of those who clinically
      thrive longer term after insertion of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD). METHODS: Pre-operative and latest follow-up data were analyzed for
      40 consecutive patients who received third-generation centrifugal-flow LVADs. RHF
      was defined using previously described criteria, including post-operative
      inotropes, pulmonary vasodilator use, or right-sided mechanical support. Patients
      were also categorized according to clinical outcomes after LVAD insertion.
      RESULTS: LVADs were implanted as a bridge to transplantation (BTT) in 33 patients
      and as destination therapy in 7. Before LVAD implant, 22 patients were
      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)
      level 1, and 17 were at level 2. Temporary mechanical assistance was present in
      50% of the cohort at LVAD implantation. The 6-month survival/progression to
      transplant was 92.5%. Average LVAD support time was 385 days (range, 21-1,011
      days). RHF developed postoperatively in 13 of 40 patients (32.5%). RHF patients
      had more severe pre-operative tricuspid incompetence than non-RHF patients. The
      BTT patients with evidence of RHF had poorer survival to transplant (6 of 11
      [54.5%]) than those without RHF (20 of 22 [90.9%]), p = 0.027). There were no
      other hemodynamic or echocardiographic predictors of short-term RHF. After LVAD, 
      22 of the 40 patients (55%) thrived clinically. For BTT patients, 20 of 21 (95%) 
      of those who thrived progressed to transplant or were alive at latest follow-up
      vs 6 of 12 (50%) of those who failed to thrive (FTT; p < 0.005). The thrivers had
      lower New York Heart Association class (1.5 vs 2.9, p < 0.001), spent less time
      in the hospital, and had less ventricular tachycardia than the FTT patients.
      However, no differences were noted in pre-operative INTERMACS level,
      echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and biochemical indices, or in early
      post-operative RHF. Age was the only significant predictor: the thrivers were
      significantly younger (43.7 +/- 15.9 vs 60.3 +/- 12.6 years; p < 0.001). This age
      difference was unchanged after exclusion of destination strategy patients. RV
      function deteriorated in the FTT patients and remained stable in those who
      thrived. CONCLUSIONS: Early post-operative RHF results in poorer
      survival/progression to transplantation for BTT patients and is predicted by
      greater pre-operative tricuspid incompetence. The most important predictor for
      those who will clinically thrive longer-term after LVAD insertion is younger age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction is common before mechanical circulatory support
      (MCS). Mechanical circulatory support frequently improves renal function, but the
      impact of pre-MCS renal dysfunction on renal function after cardiac
      transplantation (CTX) is unknown. METHODS: Patients with MCS from January 1995
      until April 2008 at a single center were included if their MCS duration was at
      least 60 days and they underwent successful CTX. Patients were followed for 1
      year after CTX. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were included in the study.
      Mechanical circulatory support was biventricular assist device in 28% and left
      ventricular assist device in 72% (continuous flow left ventricular assist device,
      14%). Mean duration of MCS was 124 days. Patients were grouped according to
      tertiles of pre-MCS creatinine clearance (CrCl): group 1, CrCl less than 45
      mL/min; group 2, CrCl between 45 and 65 mL/min inclusive; and group 3, CrCl more 
      than 65 mL/min. Group 3 had the best renal outcomes both after MCS and 1 year
      after CTX. Regardless of group, patients who had a CrCl of at least 60 mL/min
      before CTX had similar 1-year posttransplant CrCl (55 versus 53 versus 56 mL/min 
      for groups 1 through 3, respectively; not significantly different). However, the 
      ability to achieve this level of renal function after MCS was less likely in
      those with the worst renal function before the initiation of MCS (53% versus 74% 
      versus 90% for groups 1 through 3, respectively; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use
      of MCS leads to improvements in renal function in patients after MCS. However,
      the renal outcomes after CTX seem to be more dependent on the level of renal
      function achieved during MCS than on the level of renal function before MCS.

AB  - Historically, advanced heart failure therapies were considered inappropriate for 
      patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As HIV has become a
      chronic illness with the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART),
      cardiac transplantation has been used for selected HIV patients with end-stage
      heart failure. We present a case series describing the clinical outcomes with
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) use in 4 patients with HIV. Three of the
      patients are alive: 1 after a successful bridge to transplant and the other 2 on 
      continued device support at 18 and 13 months after implantation. No infectious
      complications occurred in 3 patients, and no opportunistic infections occurred in
      the fourth patient. De novo allosensitization did not occur in our patients after
      LVAD implantation. With the ongoing donor shortage, implantation of an LVAD in
      advanced heart failure patients with HIV with controlled viremia on HAART
      represents a viable option.

TI  - Incidence and outcome of Levitronix CentriMag support as rescue therapy for early
      cardiac allograft failure: a United Kingdom national study.
PG  - 1348-54
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.02.045 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary graft failure is the most common cause of mortality early
      after heart transplantation. The availability of relatively low-cost short-term
      mechanical support devices has altered the management of primary graft failure
      but there are few data on clinical outcome. Here, we describe the UK experience
      with Levitronix CentriMag support following heart transplantation across multiple
      centres. METHODS: Data for all adult heart transplants and all CentriMag devices 
      used within 30 days of heart transplantation in the UK between November 2003 and 
      July 2008 were collected. Transplant characteristics were compared for those who 
      did and did not receive CentriMag support, and device outcomes and survival rates
      were summarised. RESULTS: A total of 572 heart transplants were performed in this
      period. As many as 38 patients (6.6%) were implanted with CentriMag devices for
      primary graft failure. Four patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      concurrently and were excluded from further analysis. There were no significant
      differences in transplant characteristics between the patients who received
      CentriMag support and those who did not. Twelve patients were explanted; nine
      survived but three died shortly afterwards. Five underwent acute
      retransplantation; two survived and three died. Seventeen patients died on
      support. The 30-day and 1-year survival rates were 50% (95% confidence interval
      (CI) 32-65%) and 32% (95% CI 18-48%), respectively. Patients who previously had a
      bridge-to-transplant ventricular assist device (VAD) had significantly better
      survival than those who did not (1-year survival 71% vs 22%, p = 0.029).
      CONCLUSIONS: Primary graft failure remains an important early complication of
      heart transplantation. Levitronix CentriMag support led to the salvage of 32% of 
      patients with severe allograft failure.

TI  - Biventricular cannulation is superior regarding hemodynamics and organ recovery
      in patients on biventricular assist device support.
PG  - 1011-7
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2011.02.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate pump flow is a prerequisite for recovery of end-organ
      failure and outcome in patients treated with a biventricular assist device
      (BiVAD). We hypothesized that hemodynamics and organ recovery would improve after
      biventricular, apical cannulation compared with right atrial cannulation.
      METHODS: Between 2003 and 2009, we treated 31 patients (21 men, 10 women; mean
      age, of 43 +/- 15 years) with a paracorporeal BiVAD (Thoratec BVAD, Pleasanton,
      CA). In 15 of 31 patients, the inflow cannula of the right VAD (RVAD) was
      positioned inside the right ventricle (RV) through the RV apex (biapical) instead
      of the right atrium (conventional). We analyzed pump flow, driving pressure, and 
      vacuum of the Thoratec driving console and recovery of kidney (creatinine, blood 
      urea nitrogen) and liver function (bilirubin). RESULTS: Mean duration of BiVAD
      support was 84 +/- 72 days. BiVAD weaning was successful in 4 of 31 patients
      (13%), 12 underwent cardiac transplantation (39%), and 15 (48%) died. We observed
      significantly higher pump flow of the LVAD and RVAD in patients after biapical
      cannulation compared with those with conventional cannulation (LVAD, 5.6 +/- 0.4 
      vs 5.1 +/- 0.3 liters/min, p = 0.002; and RVAD: 4.9 +/- 0.3 vs 4.2 +/- 0.3
      liters/min, p < 0.001). This superior circulatory support correlated with faster 
      recovery of kidney function. CONCLUSION: Cardiac support with a BiVAD is
      hemodynamically more effective after biventricular apical cannulation compared
      with conventional right atrial cannulation. Consequently, higher pump flow
      results in better end-organ recovery using biapical cannulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: End-stage heart failure can result from many cardiac and noncardiac
      entities that produce a poor prognosis. Medical and interventional modalities are
      widely used to treat this condition, although the ultimate therapy remains heart 
      transplantation. Herein we present our clinical experience with 140 patients who 
      underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. METHODS: Between February 1998 and
      September 2010, we transplanted 140 patients with a mean age of 40 +/- 13 years, 
      including 109 men (77.8%) and 31 women (22%). There were 101 patients (73%) with 
      dilated cardiomyopathy and 39 (27%) with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two patients
      were retransplanted owing to graft failure. Sixteen patients on assist device
      support were successfully bridged to transplantation. RESULTS: Eighteen patients 
      (12.8%) died within 30 days with the most common causes being right ventricular
      failure (8/18, 44%) and infection (4/18, 22%). Overall mortality of 39% (55/140) 
      was most commonly caused by infection (29%, 16/55) or right ventricular failure
      (20%, 11/55). Nine patients (16%) died suddenly outside of the hospital. Three
      patients died of rejection; 4 of graft failure, and 4 of malignant disease.
      CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation remains the standard treatment modality for
      end-stage cardiac failure. But significant waiting list mortality rates are due
      to the worldwide shortage of donors. Heart transplantation in Turkey is feasible 
      for a small and strictly selected number of patients with nonreversible
      congestive heart failure. In recent years, ventricular assist device applications
      have successful bridged subjects to transplantation, saving many patients on
      active waiting lists.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We herein review our experience with ventricular assist device (VAD)
      implantation and heart transplantation in children with end-stage heart failure. 
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective nonrandomized review of all patients who
      underwent insertion of a Berlin Heart Excor VAD or heart transplantation in our
      clinic. The study spans from July 2005 to July 2010. We transplanted 11 patients 
      of mean age 11.8 +/- 4.49 years, 3 of whom with critical hemodynamic situations
      were bridged to heart transplantation by VAD implantation. Despite the poor right
      ventricular systolic functions, they did not require right rVAD. In addition, 2
      patients who underwent VAD implantation are still awaiting a donor heart. The
      mean follow-up was 825.27 +/- 630.23 days (range, 21-1,888 days). RESULTS: There 
      was no serious complication during VAD support. The overall heart transplantation
      mortality rate was 9.1% (1/11). In all patients, impaired end-organ functions
      were improved by VAD implantation before the heart transplantation. Cardiac
      biopsies revealed 4 grade 2R rejection episodes, which were successfully
      controlled in 3 patients. CONCLUSION: Heart transplantation is highly effective
      therapy for pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure. Pediatric VAD
      implantation provided satisfactory safe circulatory support for small children in
      poor condition on the waiting list. This option should be considered for all

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the shortage of donor hearts, various ventricular asist
      devices (VAD) have been used in decompensated patients to prolong patient
      survival until a suitable heart becomes available. In this paper, we present our 
      single-center report of adult patients in whom bridging was used with VAD.
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 14 adult patients who underwent
      heart transplantation after insertion of a long-term VAD. The study spans from
      February 2006 until September 2010. The mean patient age was 44.28 +/- 11.06
      years. We used the Berlin Heart EXCOR VADs (n = 11; Berlin Heart AG Berlin,
      Germany), or the Berlin Heart Incor (n = 2), or the Abiomed AB500 (n = 1).
      Preimplantation status of the subjects were critical cardiogenic shock (n = 6),
      deterioration on inotropes (n = 3), or stable but inotrope-dependent (n = 5).
      RESULTS: Mean VAD support time was 153.71 days (range, 25-517). Major adverse
      events during VAD support included reexploration for bleeding (n = 3; 21.4%),
      neurologic events (n = 2; 14.3%), left VAD-related infection (n = 2; 14.3%),
      pneumonia (n = 1; 14.3%), or primary device failure (n = 1; 7.1%). One (7.1%)
      patient showed evidence of human leukocyte antigen sensitization. There were 2
      deaths (14.3%) over a mean of 324 days follow-up after heart transplantation: One
      due to biventricular failure in the early postoperative period and the other, at 
      69 days from pneumonia. Rejection was observed in 2 patients who had
      International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 2R without
      hemodynamic deterioration. In our series, the 1-year mortality was 14.4% among
      heart transplantations without VAD implantation and 14.2% among the
      bridge-to-transplantation group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that VAD implantation
      improved end-organ function before heart transplantation in critically ill
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support has an important role in the surgical 
      therapy for heart failure. Patients deteriorating on transplantation waiting
      lists or those unsuitable for transplantation have been treated with ventricular 
      assist devices. In this report, we have presented application of ventricular
      assist systems for patients with end-stage heart failure. METHODS: Between April 
      2007 and September 2010, we treated 37 patients with end-stage heart failure with
      mechanical circulatory support, including 5 children younger than 16 years of
      age. Three patients were females, and the overall mean age was 40 +/- 18 years
      (range, 1.5-67). In 29 patients we implanted paracorporeal pneumatic ventricular 
      assist devices. Axial flow pumps were chosen to support the left ventricle in 8
      patients. Biventricular support was applied in 9 patients because of their poor
      preoperative clinical conditions and advanced evidence of right ventricular
      failure. RESULTS: Heart transplantation was performed in 16 patients (43%). One
      subject, who was managed with a left ventricular assist device implantation and
      coronary bypass grafting, was weaned from the system because of recovery of
      ventricular functions. Eleven patients (30%) are still on pump support. Nine
      patients (24%) died during mechanical circulatory support. The most prevalent
      cause of mortality was multiorgan failure (n = 5; 13.5%). Cerebrovascular
      hemorrhage was the cause of death in 2 patients. One patient died due to acute
      lung injury, and an other due to malignant melanoma. CONCLUSION: Use of a
      ventricular assist device as a bridge-to-transplantation or as destination
      therapy can be performed with acceptable mortality. It may be the most promising 
      option for patients with end-stage heart failure. Development of device
      technology, advanced monitoring of anticoagulation and anti-aggregation therapy, 
      and greater clinical experience may yield better results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) in patients with prosthetic 
      valves may carry an increased risk of thromboembolism; however, clinical
      information is lacking. The aim of this study was to report our experience of the
      use of VADs in patients with prosthetic mitral valves. METHODS: A retrospective
      analysis of 747 VAD patients from January 1995 to May 2010 was performed.
      RESULTS: Thirteen patients with a prosthetic mitral valve (average age 56 +/- 10 
      years of age, nine mechanical valve, four biological valve) were identified.
      Indications for VAD implantation were as a bridge to transplant in 11 patients
      and destination therapy in two patients. At the time of VAD implant, no
      intervention to the prosthetic mitral valve was performed. Eight patients
      received a HeartMate I (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA), three
      patients received a HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation), and two patients
      received a Thoratec VAD (Thoratec Corporation). Among nine mechanical valve
      patients, six patients were anticoagulated with warfarin, and one patient with
      heparin, while two patients did not receive anticoagulation due to bleeding. Ten 
      patients were successfully transplanted at an average of 123 days post-VAD
      implant, one died after 48 days from multiorgan failure, and two remained on VAD 
      support. No clinical thromboembolic events were observed. No intracardiac
      thrombus was detected by echocardiogram or on the pathology of the explanted
      hearts. Five patients had experienced a bleeding event (postoperative mediastinal
      bleeds, gastrointestinal bleedings, retroperitoneal hematoma, and subconjuctival 
      bleeding). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mitral valve prostheses who require VAD 
      support, leaving the prosthesis intact does not increase the incidence of adverse
      events.

AB  - There is little information to assist in understanding the experience endured by 
      parents and children where children have been supported with a ventricular assist
      device (VAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation. Consequently, the aims of this
      study were to gain an understanding of children's and parents' experience where
      children have been supported with a VAD as a bridge to heart transplantation and 
      to use this information to improve the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) VAD
      program. This study employed a qualitative approach using purposive sampling.
      Semistructured interviews were conducted with children aged 13 years or more and 
      their parents to determine their experience of having required VAD support as a
      bridge to transplantation. Results demonstrated a lack of information that
      prepared families and children for the anticipated course of treatment on VAD
      support. Recommendations to improve the VAD program for parents and children
      include more information through meetings, as well as in a written format, and
      speaking to other families who had already experienced VAD. For children in
      particular, a visual of the VAD, its associated equipment, and an image of where 
      it is placed in the body is vital information that is necessary prior to VAD
      support. Overall, the recommendations are important and should be made available 
      to improve the experience for children and parents, not only of the RCH VAD
      program but for all hospitals offering VAD therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There have been no published recommendations about staffing needs for
      a heart failure (HF) clinic or an office setting focused on heart transplant. The
      goal of this survey was to understand the current staffing environment of HF,
      transplant, and mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) programs in the
      United States and abroad. This report identifies current staffing patterns but
      does not endorse a particular staffing model. METHODS: An online survey, jointly 
      sponsored by the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), American Heart
      Association (AHA), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), was sent to
      the members of all 3 organizations who had identified themselves as interested in
      HF, heart transplant, or both, between March 12, 2009, and May 12, 2009. RESULTS:
      The overall response rate to the 1823 e-mail surveys was 23%. There were 257
      unique practices in the United States (81% of total sites) and 58 international
      sites (19%); approximately 30% of centers were in a cardiovascular group practice
      and 30% in a medical school hospital setting. The large majority of practices
      delivered HF care in both an inpatient and outpatient environment, and slightly
      more centers were implanting MCSDs (47%) than performing cardiac transplantation 
      (39%). Most practices (43%) were small, with <4 staff members, or small- to
      medium-sized (34%), with 4 to 10 staff members, with only 23% being medium (11-20
      staff) or large programs (>20 staff). On average, a US HF practice cared for 1641
      outpatients annually. An average HF program with transplant performed 10
      transplants. Although larger programs were able to perform more transplants and
      see more outpatient HF visits, their clinician staffing volume tended to double
      for approximately every 500 to 700 additional HF visits annually. The average
      staffing utilization was 2.65 physician full-time equivalents (FTEs), 2.21
      nonphysician practitioner (nurse practitioner or physician assistant) FTEs, and
      2.61 nurse coordinator FTEs annually. CONCLUSIONS: The HF patient population is
      growing in number in the United States and internationally, and the clinicians
      who provide the highly skilled and time-consuming care to this population are
      under intense scrutiny as a result of focused quality improvement initiatives and
      reduced financial resources. Staffing guidelines should be developed to ensure
      that an adequate number of qualified professionals are hired for a given practice
      volume. These survey results are an initial step in developing such standards.

TI  - Left ventricular assist device unloading effects on myocardial structure and
      function: current status of the field and call for action.
PG  - 245-55
LID - 10.1097/HCO.0b013e328345af13 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Myocardial remodeling driven by excess pressure and volume
      load is believed to be responsible for the vicious cycle of progressive
      myocardial dysfunction in chronic heart failure. Left ventricular assist devices 
      (LVADs), by providing significant volume and pressure unloading, allow a reversal
      of stress-related compensatory responses of the overloaded myocardium. Herein, we
      summarize and integrate insights from studies which investigated how LVAD
      unloading influences the structure and function of the failing human heart.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Recent investigations have described the impact of LVAD
      unloading on key structural features of cardiac remodeling - cardiomyocyte
      hypertrophy, fibrosis, microvasculature changes, adrenergic pathways and
      sympathetic innervation. The effects of LVAD unloading on myocardial function,
      electrophysiologic properties and arrhythmias have also been generating
      significant interest. We also review information describing the extent and
      sustainability of the LVAD-induced myocardial recovery, the important advances in
      understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure derived from such studies, 
      and the implications of these findings for the development of new therapeutic
      strategies. Special emphasis is given to the great variety of fundamental
      questions at the basic, translational and clinical levels that remain unanswered 
      and to specific investigational strategies aimed at advancing the field. SUMMARY:
      Structural and functional reverse remodeling associated with LVADs continues to
      inspire innovative research. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to
      achieve sustained recovery of the failing human heart.

AB  - Until recently the only mode of mechanical circulatory support available in North
      America for use as bridge to cardiac transplantation in small children was
      extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. However, since 2005 the Berlin Heart
      pediatric ventricular assist device has been increasingly widely used for both
      biventricular and left ventricular support. The device is available in a wide
      range of sizes, allowing its use in children as small as 5 kg and as large as 60 
      kg. It has been applied in end-stage heart failure of both structural/congenital 
      and myopathic etiology (including myocarditis). In the article the technique for 
      implantation of the device will be described, with focus on certain details that 
      facilitate safe implantation and subsequent explantation, whether in the setting 
      of a heart transplant operation or in the setting of recovery of native heart
      function.

AB  - The development of mechanical circulatory support devices for infants and small
      children with heart failure has significantly lagged behind the development of
      devices for adults. In the United States, there was really very little activity
      focused on the development and implementation of durable mechanical assist
      devices for small children until the early part of this millennium. At present,
      the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device (Berlin Heart Inc.,
      The Woodlands, TX) is currently the only device available to provide long-term
      support to small children awaiting cardiac transplantation; this device is only
      available through either compassionate use solicitation or within the confines of
      an ongoing investigation device exemption trial. There are several other devices 
      being developed at this time, but it will be years before they are tested in
      clinical trials. In this article, we will review the current status of mechanical
      circulatory support devices and therapy strategies for infants and small children
      presenting in acute heart failure.

TI  - The use of advance directives among patients with left ventricular assist
      devices.
PG  - 78-84
LID - 10.3810/hp.2011.02.377 [doi]
AB  - Patients who undergo implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)
      often have improved quality of life, but may eventually succumb to their heart
      failure and/or sustain LVAD-related complications. In end-of-life situations,
      decisions must be made about when to deactivate LVAD support. Previous studies
      have demonstrated that end-of-life planning, particularly with the use of advance
      directives (ADs), can clarify patients' end-of-life preferences when they are
      unable to speak for themselves. However, many patients do not have ADs, and among
      patients who do, the ADs may lack useful information on how to guide care
      surrogates and clinicians regarding patients' preferences on life-sustaining
      treatments. The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 68 patients with
      advanced heart failure (56 men [82%]; mean [standard deviation] age, 59.0 +/-
      12.2 years) who underwent LVAD implantation between March 2003 and January 2009. 
      The indication for the LVAD was destination therapy in 36 (53%) patients and
      bridge to heart transplant in 32 (47%) patients. Overall, 32 (47%) patients had
      ADs of varying types; 25 (78%) ADs were completed before LVAD implantation.
      Although life-sustaining treatments (eg, tube feeding, cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis) were mentioned, none
      explicitly mentioned the LVAD or withdrawal of LVAD support at the end of life.
      We hypothesize that if instructions regarding LVAD management in ADs are
      explicit, surrogate and clinician distress may decrease, and ethical dilemmas may
      be avoided.

PG  - 1256-60
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.12.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe initial experience with a new
      continuous flow, ventricular assist system in the pediatric population.
      DESCRIPTION: Seven children (aged 6 to 16 years) received implantation of a novel
      third-generation, continuous flow, ventricular assist device (HeartWare,
      HeartWare Inc, Miami Lakes, FL) as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.
      EVALUATION: All children were in terminal heart failure despite inotropic
      support, and signs of renal or hepatic impairment developed. Six children had
      dilatative cardiomyopathy and 1 had congenital heart disease (hypoplastic left
      heart, total cavopulmonary connections with extracardiac conduit). Six patients
      have been successfully bridged to transplantation. Median support time was 75
      days (range, 1 to 136 days). One child is still under continuous mechanical
      support. None of the patients suffered a thromboembolic event or an infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: The HeartWare assist system can be successfully used as a bridge to 
      transplantation in children and adolescents with end-stage heart failure.

PG  - 232-6

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Destination therapy with a left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) has the potential to effectively treat a large number of patients with
      advanced heart failure who are not eligible for heart transplantation. With the
      advent of continuous-flow LVADs, safe and effective long-term circulatory support
      is available for properly identified candidates. RECENT FINDINGS: The highest
      mortality following LVAD implant is observed in the sickest patients (INTERMACS
      profile 1); therefore, there is an increasing trend toward selecting patients
      with INTERMACS profiles 2-5. The less-ill patients will be studied in the planned
      REVIVE-IT trial. The Heart Failure Survival Score, Seattle Heart Failure Model,
      and Destination Therapy Risk Score may provide guidance for patient selection and
      preoperative optimization therapy, but these tools need to be updated for current
      LVAD technology. The current 1-year survival rate for patients supported for
      destination therapy with a continuous-flow LVAD is 74%, which represents an
      increase of 6% since the clinical trial was completed 2 years ago. SUMMARY:
      Substantial progress has been made concerning survival and quality of life since 
      destination therapy was first introduced 10 years ago. Advances in patient
      selection, improved LVAD technology, and optimized treatment strategies provide
      much optimism for the treatment of more heart failure patients in the future.

TI  - Reverse remodelling and recovery from heart failure are associated with complex
      patterns of gene expression.
PG  - 321-31
LID - 10.1007/s12265-011-9267-1 [doi]
AB  - Combined left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support and pharmacological
      management of the failing heart can induce reversal of maladaptive cardiac
      remodelling leading to normalisation of cardiac structure and recovery of cardiac
      function. The purpose of this study was to compare the gene expression profiles
      of recovered and non-recovered LVAD patients in order to identify mechanisms
      underlying the recovery process and differences which may determine outcome.
      Myocardial expression of 54 genes chosen for their potential role in heart
      failure and tissue repair was measured using quantitative PCR at the time of LVAD
      implantation and again at explantation (recovery, n = 13) or transplantation
      (non-recovery, n = 5). Patients who went on to recover had higher levels of
      Gialpha2, EPAC2 and lower levels of IGF2 at the time of LVAD implant compared to 
      patients who failed to recover. During recovery, expression of BNP, IL-1beta, VWF
      and SFRP1 was decreased whilst RGS4 increased. Expression of IGF1 and
      pro-fibrotic genes was coordinated during recovery. Correlation analysis
      identified a novel co-regulation of SFRP1 and betaMHC in myocardium. In summary, 
      the gene expression profile underlying recovery is complex and comprises both
      regression and exacerbation of elements of the pathological gene program.
      Modulation of Gialpha2, EPAC2, RGS4 and SFRP1 indicates that inhibition of cAMP
      signalling may potentiate recovery prior to treatment whilst enhanced cAMP and
      Wnt signalling may underlie recovery during LVAD support.

TI  - Clinical experience with Berlin Heart Excor in pediatric patients in Argentina:
      1373 days of cardiac support.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe our experience (1373 days of support)
      with the Berlin Heart Excor (BH) ventricular-assist device (VAD) as bridging to
      cardiac transplantation in pediatric patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. This
      study involved a retrospective observational cohort. Records of patients
      supported with the BH VAD were reviewed. Data regarding age, sex, weight,
      diagnosis, preoperative condition, single versus biventricular support,
      morbidity, and mortality were collected. Criteria for single versus biventricular
      support and intensive care unit management were registered. The procedure was
      approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee, and informed consent was
      obtained. Between March 2006 and March 2010, 12 patients with diagnosis of
      dilated (n = 10) and restrictive (n = 2) cardiomyopathy were supported. Median
      age was 56.6 months (range 20.1-165.9); mean weight was 18.3 kg (range 8.5-45);
      and nine patients were female. Every patient presented with severe heart failure 
      refractory to pharmacological therapy. Biventricular support was necessary in
      four patients. Nine patients underwent heart transplantation. No child was weaned
      off the BH VAD because of myocardial recovery. Mean length of support was 73 days
      (range 3-331), and the total number of days of support was 1373. Three patients
      had fatal complications: 2 had thrombo-hemorrhagic stroke leading to brain death,
      and one had refractory vasoplegic shock. The BH VAD is a useful and reasonable
      safe device for cardiac transplantation bridging in children with end-stage heart
      failure. Team experience resulted in less morbidity and mortality, and time for
      implantation, surgical procedure, anticoagulation monitoring, and patient care
      improved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) experience and follow-up data in
      children are limited. We report the deployment and successful weaning from LVAD
      in young children with severe heart failure (HF). DESIGN: From 2004--2009, 13
      children suffering from HF were placed on LVAD. All presented with a dilated left
      ventricle (LV) with severely reduced contractility, secondary to myocarditis,
      atrial arrhythmia or idiopathic HF. This study reports their outcomes and
      longitudinal follow-up. RESULTS: Of 13 young children with HF (ages 1 month--6
      years; mean 19.2 months) placed on LVAD: eight weaned to recovery and successful 
      hospital discharge, one was transplanted and four died. Echo follow-up in the
      weaned patients (mean age 22.1 months) revealed significant improvements from
      pre-LVAD measurements: LV end-diastolic dimension (LVED) mean z-score decreased
      from +4.8 to +0.95 (P < .001); fractional shortening (FS %) improved from a mean 
      of 9.3% to 33% (P < .001); and the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR)
      significantly improved (P < .05). Time to LVAD deployment from HF diagnosis was
      more likely to be less than 30 days in the successfully weaned patients (100%)
      than patients who died or were transplanted (20%); P = .007. CONCLUSIONS: LVAD
      support can be utilized as a bridge to recovery in young children with HF.
      Following LVAD weaning, children sustain improvements in LV size, function and
      degree of MR. LVAD deployment less than 30 days from HF diagnosis improves the
      likelihood of successful weaning and illustrates that children with acute
      etiologies of HF are more likely to achieve recovery.

LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2010.10.040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct an initial clinical evaluation
      of the new HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (HeartWare, Inc., Framingham,
      Massachusetts) in a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized single-arm clinical
      trial. BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a worldwide epidemic. The effectiveness of
      heart transplantation and medical therapy is limited, resulting in the emergence 
      of mechanical circulatory support as a primary treatment for end-stage heart
      disease. Left ventricular assist devices that use rotary pumps are small and
      durable, which might reduce morbidity and mortality during support. METHODS:
      Fifty heart transplant candidates with New York Heart Association functional
      class IV symptoms were supported at 5 international centers by the HeartWare
      System for 180 days, until heart transplant, myocardial recovery and device
      explant, or death. Patients who continue to be supported have been followed for a
      minimum of 2 years. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 20 (40%) received transplants, 4
      (8%) had the pump explanted after myocardial recovery, and 17 (34%) continue
      support at 2 years. Nine (18%) patients died during support from sepsis (n = 3), 
      multiple organ failure (n = 3), or hemorrhagic stroke (n = 3). The actual
      survival at 6, 12, and 24 months was 90%, 84%, and 79%, respectively. In the
      survivors, measures of quality of life showed a significant improvement over
      baseline values. Significant improvements were found for recognition memory at 3 
      months after implant (p = 0.006). The most frequent adverse events were infection
      and bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with end-stage heart failure can be safely
      and effectively supported by the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System with
      improved quality of life and neurocognitive function.

AB  - Myocarditis secondary to H1N1 influenza has been described in children, but only 
      very rarely in adults. We describe a 36-year-old man with no significant medical 
      history who presented with flu-like symptoms of 3-week duration. When he sought
      medical attention, he was already manifesting heart failure secondary to
      fulminant myocarditis, along with multiorgan failure. Despite aggressive
      management, including circulatory support with a catheter-based mechanical
      cardiac assist device (Impella 2.5 Cardiac Assist Device, Abiomed, Danvers, MA)
      as a bridge to cardiac transplant, and aggressive antiviral and antibacterial
      therapy, the patient died of cardiac arrest. An H1N1 polymerase chain reaction
      postmortem assay produced positive results, and a diagnosis of fulminant viral
      myocarditis and multiorgan system failure was established.

TI  - [Benefit of paracorporeal pulsatile assist device in multiorgan failing patients 
      in terminal stage of heart failure].
PG  - 44-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence of terminal forms of heart failure is steadily increasing 
      and thus waiting time for heart transplantation, too. Increasing mortality on
      waiting list has urged implementation of mechanical circulatory support as an
      adjunct to the programme of heart transplantation. The objective of the study is 
      to review 7-years experience with paracorporeal assist device in bridging to
      transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 53 transplant
      candidates treated since April 2003. 50 patients received paracorporeal assist
      devices in biventricular configuration. Most frequent diagnosis was dilated
      cardiomyopathy in 51%. RESULTS: Despite a high risk profile of the patients, 37
      of them were successfully transplanted (69.8%). Cumulative support has reached
      3513 days. Local exit sites infection was identified as a most frequent
      complication, sepsis as a most frequent cause of death on support (18.8%).
      30-days post-transplant mortality remained low at 5.7%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Paracorporeal mechanical circulatory assist devices remain effective alternative 
      for terminal stage heart transplant candidates, especially for those in
      multiorgan failure who require biventricular support. Success rate of bridging to
      transplantation is acceptable, as well as complications rate and quality of life 
      while on support. Long-term post-transplant survival is not inferior to the
      results of procedures performed without necessity of previous implantation of the
      assist device.

AB  - The implantation of ventricular assist devices (VADs) is a valuable option in
      patients with end-stage heart failure. The number of VAD implantations is growing
      worldwide. Between July 1987 and July 2010, we implanted 1,598 VADs in 1,455
      patients. The majority were male (81.0%), and their mean age was 49.4 years
      (range 0.3-82 years). Indications for implantation were: cardiomyopathy (n =
      1,074), post-cardiotomy heart failure (n = 282), acute myocardial infarction (n =
      83), graft failure after heart transplantation (n = 64), and others (n = 61). In 
      55.5%, the VAD implanted was left ventricular, in 39.5% biventricular, and in
      4.8% right ventricular. Until 1995, the implanted pumps were mostly pulsatile.
      Today, however, more than 95% of the implanted VADs are continuous-flow rotary
      pumps. The average support time was 148.6 days (range 0-1,836 days). The
      percentage of biventricular VADs has dropped over the years to 20% in 2009. Three
      hundred forty-seven patients could be successfully bridged to heart
      transplantation. In 122 patients (8.3%), the device could be explanted after
      myocardial recovery. In 2009, 31.4% of the patients were implanted for permanent 
      support. During the study period, 521 patients could be discharged home or to a
      rehabilitation center. Implantation of ventricular assist devices is now an
      established treatment for patients with both acute and chronic end-stage heart
      failure. Small implantable left ventricular assist devices of the second and
      third generation are now broadly employed worldwide, with growing acceptance and 
      decreasing complications. The percentage of biventricular support has dropped
      over the years to 20%.

TI  - Acute and critically ill peripartum cardiomyopathy and 'bridge to' therapeutic
      options: a single center experience with intra-aortic balloon pump, extra
      corporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      devices.
PG  - R93
LID - 10.1186/cc10098 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) patients refractory to medical
      therapy and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation or in whom weaning 
      from these therapies is impossible, are candidates for a left ventricular assist 
      device (LVAD) as a bridge to recovery or transplant. Continuous-flow LVADs are
      smaller, have a better long-term durability and are associated with better
      outcomes. Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used as a temporary 
      support in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. The aim of this study was 
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mechanical support in acute and critically
      ill PPCM patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective search of the patient
      database of the Ghent University hospital (2000 to 2010). RESULTS: Six
      PPCM-patients were treated with mechanical support. Three patients presented in
      the postpartum period and three patients at the end of pregnancy. All were
      treated with IABP, the duration of IABP support ranged from 1 to 13 days. An ECMO
      was inserted in one patient who presented with cardiogenic shock, multiple organ 
      dysfunction syndrome and a stillborn baby. Two patients showed partial recovery
      and could be weaned off the IABP. Four patients were implanted with a
      continuous-flow LVAD (HeartMate II, Thoratec Inc.), including the ECMO-patient.
      Three LVAD patients were successfully transplanted 78, 126 and 360 days after
      LVAD implant; one patient is still on the transplant waiting list. We observed
      one peripheral thrombotic complication due to IABP and five early bleeding
      complications in three LVAD patients. One patient died suddenly two years after
      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: In PPCM with refractory heart failure IABP was safe
      and efficient as a bridge to recovery or as a bridge to LVAD. ECMO provided
      temporary support as a bridge to LVAD, while the newer continuous-flow LVADs
      offered a safe bridge to transplant.

AB  - Long-term mechanical circulatory support devices, especially left ventricular
      assist devices, are being increasingly utilized in the management of end-stage
      heart failure either as bridge to heart transplantation, recovery or as
      destination therapy. However, current technology for controllers and alarm
      systems for left ventricular assist devices does not permit their implantation in
      eligible patients with visual impairment. We report two patients in whom the
      decrease in visual acuity was a significant factor in determining eligibility for
      long-term mechanical circulatory support.

TI  - Reversibility of fixed pulmonary hypertension in left ventricular assist device
      support recipients.
PG  - 971-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.01.019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Conflicting data still exist concerning the reversibility of secondary
      severe 'fixed' pulmonary hypertension (PH) by the use of left ventricular assist 
      device (LVAD) support in terms of time necessary to provide a bridge to
      'transplantability'. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 145 patients with heart
      failure and severe PH treated by LVAD support between 2000 and 2009. There were
      133 men (91.7%) and 12 women (8.3%) with a mean age of 52.95+/-12.01 years.
      Patients were divided into two groups depending on preoperative PH reversibility.
      Fixed PH was defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >25 mmHg, a
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >2.5 Wood Unit (WU) and a transpulmonary
      gradient (TPG) >12 mmHg, despite pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-six
      patients had fixed PH (group A) and 89 reversible PH (group B). Only 27 patients 
      of group A underwent right heart catheterization evaluation during LVAD support; 
      the remaining 29 patients had other contraindications to heart transplantation
      (HTx). The 27 patients were divided into three subgroups on the basis of
      examination time during LVAD support: <6 months (11 patients), between 6 and 12
      months (six patients) and >12 months (10 patients). The mPAP, PVR, and TPG
      decreased significantly during LVAD support (mPAP, 37.26+/-6.35 mmHg vs
      21.00+/-7.51 mmHg, p=0.007; PVR, 3.49+/-1.47 WU vs 1.53+/-0.66 WU, p=0.000; and
      TPG, 15.04+/-5.22 mmHg vs 7.78+/-3.21 mmHg, p=0.019). A significant reduction of 
      all parameters was observed during the first 6 months and later on there was no
      further decrease. There were no significant differences between the three
      subgroups (mPAP, p=0.680; PVR, p=0.723; and TPG, p=0.679) in terms of time of
      reversibility. LVAD support allowed 19 patients to be transplanted. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with fixed PH can be treated with LVAD support. Our data suggest that 6 
      months after LVAD implantation it is possible to observe an important reduction
      of PH and evaluate the potential transplantability of patients. Longer support
      does not add any effect of LVAD on PH.

TI  - Pediatric heart transplantation: 23-year single-center experience.
PG  - e83-9

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early and late mortality have significantly improved during recent
      decades in pediatric patients after heart transplantation (HTx). Nevertheless
      early and late morbidity and mortality are influenced by acute rejection, cardiac
      allograft vasculopathy (CAV), malignancy, renal failure, and graft failure.
      METHODS: We evaluated our results after HTx in children under the age of 18 years
      with 23 years of follow-up. Perioperative characteristics, probability of
      survival, and time-related morbidity were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: We
      included 169 pediatric HTx recipients, transplanted between 05/1986 and 05/2010. 
      One hundred and one were males with a median age of 8.7 (0.02-23.2) years at the 
      time of HTx. Main preoperative diagnoses were cardiomyopathy (CMP) (n = 139) with
      a median survival of 7.0 (0-23.2) years and congenital heart disease (CHD) (n =
      30), median survival 11.3 (0-19.9) years. Overall survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15
      years was 87%, 76%, 68%, and 50%, respectively. Patient survival was
      significantly reduced in patients with 0-1 year at the time of HTx versus 1-10
      and 11-18 years: 2.3 (0-13.2) years versus 1-10 years = 8.6 (0-23.2) years; 11-18
      years = 5.9 (0.003-18.5) years. Fifty-one patients were on mechanical circulatory
      support as a bridge-to-HTx with increased early but not late mortality. Ten
      patients underwent retransplant due to acute or chronic graft failure after a
      median posttransplant time of 12.25 (0.3-17.45) years. Late mortality was
      influenced by rejection, infection, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease
      (PTLD) (11.8%), or CAV with an incidence of 25% at 5 years, 50% at 10 years, and 
      approximately 75% at 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric HTx is a safe and effective
      treatment for terminal heart failure. In our experience, there is no adverse
      effect of previous cardiac assist device implantation in long-term follow-up.
      Virtually all anatomic malformations are amenable to orthotopic HTx. Significant 
      progress has been achieved in controlling rejection through improved
      immunosuppression and noninvasive rejection monitoring.

TI  - Aortic valve procedures at the time of ventricular assist device placement.
PG  - 750-4
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.11.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Placement of a ventricular assist device (VAD) may lead to reduced or
      absent opening of the aortic valve and thus increase risk of thrombus formation
      in the aortic root as well as on the valve itself. The outcome of additional
      procedures to the aortic valve at the time of VAD placement is unclear. METHODS: 
      A retrospective analysis of 712 VAD patients from 1995 to 2009 was performed.
      RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were identified who underwent aortic valve
      procedures in addition to VAD placement. Indication for VAD placement was bridge 
      to transplant in 23 patients, destination therapy in 4, and postcardiotomy shock 
      in 1. Aortic valve procedures were performed for preexisting mechanical aortic
      prosthesis in 8 (7 closure and 1 aortic valve replacement with biological
      prosthesis), and for moderate or severe aortic insufficiency in 20 patients (10
      repair, 9 closure, and 1 aortic valve replacement with biological prosthesis). At
      the last follow-up, 16 patients had undergone heart transplant, 6 remained on VAD
      support, and 5 had died. While on VAD support, no adverse events related to the
      aortic valve procedures occurred. The 30-day operative mortality was 0.4%. No
      clinical thromboembolic events were observed. In 2 patients, there was evidence
      of thrombus formation in the explanted heart. Four patients had bleeding
      complications. Of the 9 patients who received aortic valve repair, 2 had
      recurrent aortic insufficiency on echocardiograms during an average follow-up of 
      118 days. CONCLUSIONS: Additional procedures to the aortic valve at the time of
      VAD placement are feasible. Overall outcomes are comparable to those seen in
      patients without the need for aortic valve manipulation at the time of VAD
      placement.

PG  - 91-8
LID - 10.1007/s11897-011-0050-z [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is an accepted treatment of
      patients with end-stage heart failure. The increased applicability and excellent 
      results with LVADs have revolutionized the treatment options available for such
      patients. Success with LVADs as bridge-to-transplant therapy has led to their
      successful use as an alternate to a transplant (ie, as destination therapy [DT]).
      The use of these devices as DT represents a relatively newer but growing
      indication. Until recently, most patients who have undergone LVAD implantation
      have been supported by pulsatile devices. Newer continuous-flow (CF) pumps have
      resulted in superior outcomes, including significantly reduced complication rates
      with improved durability over first-generation pulsatile design pumps. However,
      as with all new technology, the newer LVADs have introduced management challenges
      that were either unimportant or absent with pulsatile LVADs. This article reviews
      the current state of left ventricular devices, focusing on the CF pumps that
      currently dominate the field, including clinical outcomes, the physiologic and
      pathologic effects that are associated with CF pumps, and their unique management
      issues and complications.

TI  - Outcomes, long-term quality of life, and psychologic assessment of fulminant
      myocarditis patients rescued by mechanical circulatory support.
PG  - 1029-35
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0b013e31820ead45 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myocarditis is a rare disease that may progress rapidly to refractory 
      cardiogenic shock and death. In such situations, emergent initiation of
      mechanical circulatory assistance is the only therapeutic option to rescue these 
      dying patients. This study was designed to evaluate the outcomes, health-related 
      quality of life and frequencies of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress
      disorder symptoms in fulminant myocarditis patients rescued by mechanical
      circulatory assistance, since these major components of outcome evaluation after 
      serious illnesses have not yet been assessed in this setting. DESIGN: A
      retrospective, single-center, observational study and a cross-sectional survey to
      assess health-related quality of life by the Short Form-36 questionnaire and
      frequencies of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms by 
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale,
      respectively. SETTING: An 18-bed tertiary intensive care unit in a university
      hospital. PATIENTS: We analyzed the short- and long-term outcomes of 41 patients 
      hospitalized at our institution between 2003 and 2009 and who received either a
      Thoratec BiVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) (n = 6) or extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (n = 35) to combat refractory cardiogenic shock due to fulminant
      myocarditis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intensive care unit survival was 68%,
      and four (10%) patients underwent heart transplantation. Independent predictors
      of in-intensive care unit death were Simplified Acute Physiology Score II >/=56
      (odds ratio = 10.23) and troponin Ic >/=12 mug/L (odds ratio = 7.49) at
      admission. Complete follow-up (median, 525 days) was available for 26 of 28
      survivors. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, Short Form-36 evaluation of
      health-related quality of life revealed satisfactory mental health and vitality
      but persistent physical and psychosocial-related difficulties. Lastly, anxiety,
      depression, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were reported by 38%,
      27% and 27% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical circulatory
      assistance rescued 68% of patients with refractory circulatory failure due to
      fulminant myocarditis. Greater disease severity and higher troponin Ic levels at 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation predicted poorer prognosis.
      Because up to one-third of the patients reported anxiety, depression, and/or
      posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, strategies aimed at attenuating their
      emotional and psychologic distress might significantly improve their long-lasting
      well-being.

PG  - 616-23, 623.e1
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.06.066 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric ventricular assist devices may be superior to
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in some respects, especially for medium- and 
      long-term cardiac support. We present our nearly 20-year experience with
      pediatric ventricular assist devices. METHODS: Between 1990 and April 2009,
      Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) was implanted in 94
      children. Patients were compared according to period of treatment: group I,
      implantation between 1990 and 2001 (n = 45), and group II, implantation since
      2002 (n = 49). RESULTS: Preoperative serum creatinine (1.2 vs 0.7 mg/dL, P =
      .002) and bilirubin (1.5 vs 1 mg/dL, P = .002) were lower in period II, and fewer
      patients were artificially ventilated before surgery (26 vs 13, P = .002). In
      period I, more patients were supported with biventricular assist devices (64% vs 
      22.5%, P < .001). Median time on support was shorter in period I (10 vs 40 days, 
      P < .001). Success (weaning from system or heart transplant) was achieved in 49% 
      and 69%, respectively (P = .043). Whereas in period I 17% of children younger
      than 1 year were discharged home after transplant or weaning, rate during period 
      II was 93% (P < .001), in particular because of improvement in discharge rate of 
      patients with postcardiotomy heart failure (13% vs 50%). Rates of pump exchange
      for thrombus formation were 0.029/d in period I and 0.014/d in period II (P =
      0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Recent results show significant improvements in survival and
      discharge rate, especially for children younger than 1 year. Pediatric Berlin
      Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device may provide a safe mechanical support
      strategy in children with cardiogenic shock.

TI  - Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation support for acute fulminant myocarditis:
      analysis of a single center's experience.
PG  - 682-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.12.050 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute fulminant myocarditis (AFM) is a disease category that is
      easily neglected. Circulatory mechanical support is sometimes required for this
      devastating condition. We analyzed our experience in managing AFM with mechanical
      circulatory support. METHODS: We applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) as a first-line rescue for AFM. The diagnosis was mainly derived from
      clinical results and biopsy. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled in the 
      age range of 29.6 +/- 18.6 years and the pediatric group (< 18 years) comprised
      32% (n = 24) of our patient group. Thirty-five patients (47%) underwent
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before ECMO. The indication for ECMO included
      high inotropic support 69% (n = 54) and continuous CPR at ECMO setup 31% (n =
      23). The ECMO duration was 171 +/- 121 h. Survival to discharge was 64% (n = 48),
      61% in adult group, and 70.8% in pediatric group. Six patients were later bridged
      to ventricular assist device use (5 left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 1
      bi-ventricular assist device (BVAD)) but three died of multiple-organ failure.
      Three patients (4%) underwent heart transplantation and all of them survived to
      discharge. Resuscitation did not have a significant factor for survival. Only two
      patients (3%) developed late mortality due to a cardiac event. CONCLUSIONS: AFM
      still carries high mortality rates in spite of advanced mechanical support. Most 
      of the survivors did not require transplantation and could return to good
      lifestyle. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, ECMO can be a first-line tool
      to rescue this group of patients.

TI  - Predicting hyperresponse among pacemaker-dependent nonischemic cardiomyopathy
      patients upgraded to cardiac resynchronization.
PG  - 905-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2011.02018.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Right ventricular (RV) pacing engenders left ventricular (LV)
      dyssynchrony and may diminish LV systolic function, promote adverse cardiac
      remodeling, and foster heart failure (HF). This process may be reversible in some
      pacemaker-dependent patients upgraded to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).
      We examined the clinical characteristics of pacemaker-dependent patients who
      exhibit hyperresponse (i.e., normalization of LV function) with CRT upgrade.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 51 chronically RV-paced patients with no
      coronary artery disease, LV ejection fraction (EF) </= 35%, and severe HF
      symptoms who were upgraded to CRT-defibrillators (CRT-D). Echocardiograms were
      performed before and >/=6 months after CRT. Patients with follow-up LVEF >/= 50% 
      were deemed hyperresponders. Clinical outcomes of death, cardiac transplant,
      mechanical circulatory support, and HF hospitalizations were assessed. Fifteen
      patients were CRT hyperresponders; all demonstrated >/=15% relative LV
      end-systolic volume decrease. Hyperresponders had smaller baseline LV dimensions 
      and shorter known cardiomyopathy duration than nonhyperresponders (P < 0.01). The
      best predictors of hyperresponse using receiver operating characteristic analysis
      were LV end-systolic dimension <48 mm (area under the curve [AUC] 0.92, P <
      0.001), LV end-diastolic dimension <58 mm (AUC 0.86, P < 0.001), and
      cardiomyopathy duration <24 months (AUC 0.82, P < 0.001). No hyperresponders
      died, received a cardiac transplant, or required mechanical circulatory support
      during 42 +/- 22 months follow-up, whereas 5 nonhyperresponders died, 2 underwent
      transplant, and 1 required an assist device (log rank P = 0.049). CONCLUSION:
      Among chronically RV paced patients who are upgraded to CRT-D, smaller baseline
      LV dimensions and shorter known cardiomyopathy duration predict hyperresponse.
      Hyperresponders have excellent long-term survival.

      biopsies of patients with advanced cardiomyopathies.
PG  - 857-61

AB  - RATIONALE: Two categories of cardiac stem cells (CSCs) with predominantly
      myogenic (mCSC) and vasculogenic (vCSC) properties have been characterized in the
      human heart. However, it is unknown whether functionally competent CSCs of both
      classes are present in the myocardium of patients affected by end-stage cardiac
      failure, and whether these cells can be harvested from relatively small
      myocardial samples. OBJECTIVE: To establish whether a clinically relevant number 
      of mCSCs and vCSCs can be isolated and expanded from endomyocardial biopsies of
      patients undergoing cardiac transplantation or left ventricular assist device
      implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endomyocardial biopsies were collected with a 
      bioptome from the right side of the septum of explanted hearts or the apical LV
      core at the time of left ventricular assist device implantation. Two to 5
      biopsies from each patient were enzymatically dissociated, and, after expansion, 
      cells were sorted for c-kit (mCSCs) or c-kit and KDR (vCSCs) and characterized.
      mCSCs and vCSCs constituted 97% and 3% of the c-kit population, respectively.
      Population doubling time averaged 27 hours in mCSCs and vCSCs; 5x10(6) mCSCs and 
      vCSCs were obtained in 28 and 41 days, respectively. Both CSC classes possessed
      significant growth reserve as documented by high telomerase activity and
      relatively long telomeres. mCSCs formed mostly cardiomyocytes, and vCSCs
      endothelial and smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: The growth properties of mCSCs 
      and vCSCs isolated from endomyocardial biopsies from patients with advanced heart
      failure were comparable to those obtained previously from larger myocardial
      samples of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.

TI  - Better outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation using percutaneous emergency
      circulatory support in non-coronary patients compared to those with myocardial
      infarction.
PG  - 30-4
LID - 10.3109/17482941.2010.542466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Mobile heart-lung-machines applied by percutaneous
      cannulation are mostly used in patients suffering from acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI). Whether patients with non-coronary reasons for circulatory
      arrest benefit of percutaneous emergency circulatory support (PECS) in the same
      way is still unclear. METHODS: We included 22 consecutive patients who were
      treated by PECS during a registry period of two years. Primary study endpoint was
      30-day mortality rate. RESULTS: Circulatory arrest was caused by AMI in 14
      patients (64%). The remaining 8 patients suffered from
      cardiomyopathy/myocarditis, 4; pulmonary embolism, 2; acute pulmonary failure, 1;
      and tumor lysis syndrome, 1. Revascularization rate was 93% in the AMI group
      under PECS support. Overall survival rate was 36.4% at one month: it reached
      62.5% among non-coronary patients, but only 21.4% in the AMI group (P = 0.02).
      Weaning was possible by direct heart transplantation in two patients. Additional 
      two patients required implantation of a left ventricular assist device. Pumpless 
      extracorporeal lung assist was used in one case. CONCLUSION: In this small
      retrospective study percutaneous emergency circulatory support provided
      sufficient hemodynamic stabilization in emergency situations. One fifth of AMI
      patients were saved by immediate restoration of circulation and causal treatment 
      when other means of resuscitation failed. Higher survival rates were noted in
      non-coronary patients.

      ventricular assist device that requires minimal surgery for implantation,
      potentially allowing implantation in earlier stage heart failure. METHODS:
      HeartWare (Miami Lakes, Fla) developed transapical miniaturized ventricular
      assist device. Acute (n = 4), 1-week (n = 2), and 30-day (n = 4) bovine model
      experiments evaluated hemodynamic efficacy and biocompatibility of the device,
      which was implanted through small left thoracotomy with single insertion at apex 
      of left ventricle without cardiopulmonary bypass. The device outflow cannula was 
      positioned across the aortic valve. The international normalized ratio was
      maintained between 2.0 and 2.5 with warfarin. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic,
      fluoroscopic, hematologic, and blood chemistry measurements were evaluated.
      RESULTS: The device was successfully implanted through the left ventricular apex 
      in all 10 animals. The device was operated at 15,000 +/- 1000 rpm (power
      consumption, 3.5-6.0 W). The device maintained normal end-organ perfusion with no
      significant hemolysis (0-30 mg/dL). There were no pump failures or device-related
      complications. At autopsy, no abnormalities were seen in endocardium, aortic
      valve leaflets, or aortic root. There was no evidence of thromboembolism or
      abnormalities in any peripheral end organs. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully
      demonstrated feasibility of a novel intraventricular assist device that can be
      completely implanted through left ventricular apex. This transapical surgical
      approach eliminates needs for sternotomy, device pocket, cardiopulmonary bypass, 
      ventricular coring, and construction of an outflow graft anastomosis.

PG  - 483-8
AB  - Approximately 5 million Americans experience heart failure, which affects 10 in
      every 1000 people older than 65 years. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are a
      type of mechanical circulatory support that aids in systemic perfusion by
      maintaining unidirectional flow while reducing the oxygen demand of the failing
      ventricle. There are 3 generations of VADs in circulation used as a bridge to
      transplantation, a bridge to recovery, or as destination therapy. Due to the
      increasing use of these devices, it is likely that anesthetists will encounter
      patients with these devices more frequently, which requires adequate preoperative
      discussion with the care team. Intraoperatively, it is important to realize that 
      patients with VADs are at higher risk for aspiration, to recognize
      electromagnetic interference from surgical devices, to maintain hemodynamic
      stability, and to monitor coagulation status. With proper knowledge, and adequate
      preoperative preparation and intraoperative care, anesthetists should be able to 
      achieve safe and successful patient outcomes through anesthesia care.

AB  - A 34-year-old woman with fulminant myocarditis underwent emergent implant with
      the Toyobo (Nipro, Osaka, Japan) paracorporeal biventricular assist device
      (BiVAD). The patient had been stable for 6 months, until she started to develop
      heart failure symptoms due to severe pulmonary insufficiency. Pulmonary valve
      closure and BiVAD conversion to implantable rotary pumps was performed. A
      DuraHeart centrifugal pump (Terumo Heart Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) was used for left
      ventricular assist, and a Jarvik 2000 axial-flow pump (Jarvik Heart Inc., New
      York, NY) was used for right ventricular assist. Although strict management was
      required to balance the flow rates of the two different types of devices, her
      postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged home.

      children with acute decompensated heart failure.
PG  - 573-8
LID - 10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.10.015 [doi]
AB  - We sought to determine prospectively whether serial assessment of the natriuretic
      peptide prohormone, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP),
      correlated with clinical severity and outcomes in children hospitalized for acute
      decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Patients (>1 month of age) admitted from 2005
      to 2007 with ADHF requiring intravenous vasoactive/diuretic therapy for ADHF were
      eligible. Serum NT-pro-BNP levels were obtained within 24 hours of admission and 
      at prespecified intervals, and clinical caregivers were blinded to these levels. 
      End points included hospital discharge, death or cardiac transplantation, and
      care escalation including the need for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was
      noted. Twenty-four patients were enrolled: 22 survived to hospital discharge and 
      2 died. Ten required MCS (of which 6 underwent cardiac transplantation). Two
      patients underwent transplantation without MCS. For the entire cohort, NT-pro-BNP
      levels peaked at days 2 to 3 after admission, with a subsequent gradual decrease 
      until discharge. However, for those who did require MCS, NT-pro-BNP failed to
      decrease consistently until after MCS initiation. At discharge, NT-pro-BNP levels
      were significantly decreased from admission levels but remained well above normal
      for all patients. Single-point NT-pro-BNP levels on admission did not correlate
      with independently assessed clinical scores of heart failure severity or predict 
      the need for MCS in this cohort. In conclusion, serial NT-pro-BNP levels
      demonstrated an incremental trend after 48 hours in patients who went on to
      require MCS but decreased in all other patients and may therefore assist the
      decision to initiate or avoid MCS after admission for pediatric ADHF.

AB  - The use of left ventricular assist devices in treating patients with end-stage
      heart failure has increased significantly in recent years, both as a bridge to
      transplantation and as destination therapy in those who are ineligible for
      cardiac transplantation. This increase is based largely on the results of several
      recently completed clinical trials with the new second-generation continuous-flow
      devices that showed significant improvements in survival, functional capacity,
      and quality of life. Additional information on the use of the first- and
      second-generation left ventricular assist devices has come from a recently
      released report spanning the years 2006 to 2009, from the Interagency Registry
      for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, a National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
      Institute-sponsored collaboration between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 
      the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the scientific community. The
      authors review the latest clinical trials and data from the registry, with tight 
      integration of the landmark molecular, cellular, and genomic research that
      accompanies the reverse remodeling of the human heart in response to a left
      ventricular assist device and functional recovery that has been reported in a
      subset of these patients.

AB  - The majority of children awaiting heart transplantation require inotropic
      support, mechanical ventilation, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) support. Unfortunately, due to the limited pool of organs, many of these
      children do not survive to transplant. Mechanical circulatory support of the
      failing heart in pediatrics is a new and rapidly developing field world-wide. It 
      is utilized in children with acute congestive heart failure associated with
      congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis, both as a bridge to
      transplantation and as a bridge to myocardial recovery. The current arsenal of
      mechanical assist devices available for children is limited to ECMO, intra-aortic
      balloon counterpulsation, centrifugal pump ventricular assist devices, the
      DeBakey ventricular assist device Child; the Thoratec ventricular assist device; 
      and the Berlin Heart. In the spring of 2004, five contracts were awarded by the
      National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to support preclinical development for a
      range of pediatric ventricular assist devices and similar circulatory support
      systems. The support of early development efforts provided by this program is
      expected to yield several devices that will be ready for clinical trials within
      the next few years. Our work reviews the current international experience with
      mechanical circulatory support in children and summarizes our own experience
      since 2005 with the Berlin Heart, comparing the indications for use, length of
      support, and outcome between these modalities.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes in women versus men using a continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of large, pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)
      has been limited in women because of their small body size. METHODS: We compared 
      the survival outcomes, quality of life, and adverse events in 465 patients (104
      women, 361 men) with advanced systolic heart failure in their first 18 months of 
      support with the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) continuous-flow
      LVAD for bridge to transplantation. RESULTS: During the first 18 months, there
      were no differences in survival between women and men while on LVAD support (73% 
      +/- 3% vs 73% +/- 5%, p = 0.855) but fewer women (40%) underwent heart
      transplantation than did men (55%; p = 0.001). More women continued on support
      after 18 months (p = 0.007). Median duration of support was 238 days for women
      and 184 days for men (p = 0.003). Mortality was 20% for women and 19% for men (p 
      = 0.89). Adverse events were similar, with the exception of hemorrhagic stroke,
      which occurred more frequently in women (0.10 vs 0.04 events/patient-year, p =
      0.02), and device-related infections, which occurred less frequently in women
      (0.23 vs 0.44, p = 0.006). Functional capacity and quality of life at 6 months
      improved significantly in women and men. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous-flow left
      ventricular assistance as a bridge to transplantation is associated with similar 
      survival rates in women and men. Differences observed in higher stroke rates and 
      fewer infections among women require further study.

TI  - Aortic valve closure associated with HeartMate left ventricular device support:
      technical considerations and long-term results.
PG  - 576-82
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.11.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic valve integrity is crucial for optimal left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) support. Pre-existing native aortic insufficiency, aortic valve
      incompetence acquired during support, as well as previously placed prosthetic
      aortic valves present unique problems for these patients. METHODS: We reviewed
      and analyzed data for 28 patients who underwent left ventricular outflow tract
      closure associated with HeartMate I (n =12) and HeartMate II (n = 16) LVAD
      insertion or exchange. Indications for valve closure, surgical technique, LVAD
      function, survival rates and complications were retrospectively analyzed.
      Survival rates were compared with those of HeartMate LVAD patients (n = 104) who 
      did not undergo aortic valve closure. RESULTS: Indications for closure included
      native aortic valve insufficiency (10 patients), aortic valve deterioration after
      prolonged LVAD support (8 patients) and previously placed mechanical (9 patients)
      or bioprosthetic aortic prostheses (1 patient). There were 2 operative and 5 late
      deaths (mean 227 days post-operatively). Of the deaths, none were due to aortic
      valve closure. Actuarial survival was 78% at 1 year and 53% at 3 years, which was
      statistically better than for our patients with an intact aortic outflow (61% at 
      1 year, 45% at 3 years; p < 0.05). Five patients had transplants, 1 patient was
      successfully bridged to recovery, and 15 patients remain on LVAD support. No
      patient with outflow closure developed regurgitation, embolization or compromised
      LVAD support. CONCLUSION: Outflow tract closure in LVAD-supported patients is
      safe, often necessary and well tolerated.

      assist devices.
PG  - e44-50
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.11.074 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Both heart transplant (HTX) candidates and patients on ventricular
      assist device (VAD) support suffer from severe heart failure and have to fear
      life-threatening complications. For both patient groups, the importance of
      screening for and treatment of psychosocial problems and mental disorders to
      optimize compliance and survival has been acknowledged. We compared the use of
      psychotherapeutic support by patients with primary HTX, on VAD support, either on
      destination therapy or to be transplanted, and successfully bridged to
      transplant. In addition, we evaluated the use for supportive psychotherapy for
      the families of our patients and present two typical cases. METHODS: Patients
      with primary HTX (HTX(prim), n=16), with VAD on destination therapy (VAD(dest),
      n=15), with VAD waiting for transplant (VAD(htx), n=9), and patients who have
      been successfully bridged on VAD to transplant (HTX(vad), n=11) were analyzed
      during the preoperative and the in-hospital postoperative period. International
      Classification of Diseases (ICD 10) diagnoses, number of contacts with the
      psychologist, time expenses for individual interventions, family interventions,
      and concomitant communication were assessed. RESULTS: Adjustment disorders were
      the most prevalent disturbances. HTX(vad) patients needed more psychotherapeutic 
      interventions and required more time for individual support than HTX(prim)
      patients. Partners and families of almost one-half of all patients made use of
      supportive psychotherapy; there were no differences between the groups with
      regard to the needed time. Further, the groups did not differ in the time
      expenses for concomitant communication with the psychologist. At the latest
      contact with the psychologist, three VAD(dest) patients did not need further
      psychotherapy at this time; also, one VAD patient waiting for transplant and two 
      after primary HTX were psychosocially stable. CONCLUSION: Our data reflect the
      high emotional distress, especially of HTX(vad) patients. Our data suggest
      further that patients on VAD support experience psychosocial and emotional stress
      as severe as HTX candidates and recipients do. Patients on destination therapy
      and those who are waiting for transplantation do not differ in this regard. The
      high complexity of the psychosocial problems of VAD and HTX patients warrants
      professional psychotherapeutic support.

AB  - We postulated that postoperative B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels would be
      reflective of the degree of hemodynamic support rendered by various pump speeds
      settings (RPM) of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Twenty
      LVAD patients were evaluated prospectively (Jarvik 2000: n = 9, HeartMate II: n =
      11). The mean age was 57.7 +/- 14.9 years, and 14 were male. B-type natriuretic
      peptide levels were drawn while the patients were supported on LVADs at variable 
      RPM settings. The RPM settings were correlated with the changes in BNP levels.
      Eleven patients underwent LVAD implantation for a lifelong support while the rest
      were as a bridge therapy to transplantation. Four patients required LVAD change
      out for various causes of pump failure. Postoperative BNP levels decreased
      dramatically with the initiation of LVAD support. The levels correlated inversely
      with the degree of hemodynamic support rendered at various RPM settings of the
      HeartMate II (p < 0.001). Overall, BNP levels decreased significantly in 2 days
      after RPM increase. We observed a significant inverse correlation between the
      postoperative BNP levels and the degree of LVAD support. The effective LVAD
      support seems to result in a marked reduction in BNP levels, and monitoring
      serial BNP levels may be helpful in managing patients supported on continuous
      LVAD.

      transplantation in the United States.
PG  - 531-6, 536.e1
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.10.025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infants undergoing heart transplantation have the highest early
      posttransplant mortality of any age group. We sought to determine the
      pretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital mortality in transplanted 
      infants in the current era. METHODS: All infants under 12 months of age who
      underwent primary heart transplantation during a recent 10-year period
      (1999-2009) in the United States were identified using the Organ Procurement and 
      Transplant Network database. Multivariable logistic regression was used to
      identify independent pretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital
      mortality. RESULTS: Of 730 infants in the study (median age 3.8 months), 462
      (63%) had congenital heart disease, 282 (39%) were supported by a ventilator, 94 
      (13%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 22 (3%) with a ventricular
      assist device at the time of transplantation. Overall, 82 (11.2%) infants died
      before their initial hospital discharge. In adjusted analysis, in-hospital
      mortality was associated with repaired congenital heart disease (odds ratio [OR],
      3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8, 7.2), unrepaired congenital heart disease
      not on prostaglandin E (OR, 2.8; CI, 1.3, 6.1), extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenator support (OR, 6.1; CI, 2.8, 13.4), ventilator support (OR, 4.4; CI,
      2.3, 8.3), creatinine clearance less than 40 mL.min(-1).1.73 m(-2) (OR, 3.1; CI, 
      1.7, 5.3), and dialysis (OR, 6.2; CI, 2.1, 18.3) at transplantation. CONCLUSIONS:
      One in 9 infants undergoing heart transplantation dies before hospital discharge.
      Pretranplantation factors associated with early mortality include congenital
      heart disease, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support, mechanical
      ventilation, and renal failure. Risk stratification for early posttransplant
      mortality among infants listed for heart transplantation may improve
      decision-making for transplant eligibility, organ allocation, and posttransplant 
      interventions to reduce mortality.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are used in treatment for terminal heart
      failure or as a bridge to transplantation. We created biVAD using the artificial 
      muscles (AMs) that supports both ventricles at the same time. We developed the
      test bench (TB) as the in vitro evaluating system to enable the measurement of
      performance. The biVAD exerts different pressure between left and right ventricle
      like the heart physiologically does. The heart model based on child's heart was
      constructed in silicone. This model was fitted with the biVAD. Two pipettes
      containing water with an ultrasonic sensor placed on top of each and attached to 
      ventricles reproduced the preload and the after load of each ventricle by the
      real-time measurement of the fluid height variation proportionally to the exerted
      pressure. The LabVIEW software extrapolated the displaced volume and the pressure
      generated by each side of our biVAD. The development of a standardized protocol
      permitted the validation of the TB for in vitro evaluation, measurement of the
      performances of the AM biVAD herein, and reproducibility of data.

PG  - 79-89
LID - 10.1007/s11936-010-0100-y [doi]
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: I individualize my approach to each patient based upon their
      understanding of their disease process, acuity of their progression to Stage D
      heart failure, clinical setting (hospitalized vs outpatient), and family needs.
      My first goal is to prove intolerance of traditional therapies for heart failure 
      by challenging patients with various medication combinations, including staggered
      dosing regimens and alternatives to angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors/beta-blockers, and by considering cardiac resynchronization therapy if
      they meet criteria. As patients develop progressive hypotension and side effects 
      from medicines, I often will discontinue these medicines after careful
      communication. For patients with refractory heart failure, I consider cardiac
      transplantation for those who are candidates and left ventricular assist device
      as destination therapy for those who are not transplant candidates, both of which
      require multidisciplinary input from psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, and
      cardiac surgeons. If patients are not candidates for these advanced therapies, I 
      try to delineate their goals for living and discuss strategies to maximize their 
      survival (however limited) and increase my focus on their quality of life by
      minimizing unnecessary testing. For the select patient, I use continuous inotrope
      support only if this improves their quality of life and possibility of having a
      meaningful existence outside of the hospital. Palliative care consultants are
      often involved at this stage. For the patient who is clearly at the end of life, 
      I refer to hospice and focus on comfort. Return ambulatory visits and extent of
      the care received are guided by the preferences of the patient and their family. 
      When there are disparate views of family members, especially when the patient is 
      not cognitively able to participate in the discussion, I tend to be more
      paternalistic in my approach to therapeutic options in an attempt to possibly
      dissipate family dynamic problems occurring after the patient dies.

AB  - The third annual report of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted
      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) provides documentation of the current landscape
      of durable mechanical circulatory support in the United States. With nearly 3,000
      patients entered into the database, the transition to continuous-flow pump
      technology is evident and dramatic. This report focuses on the rapidly expanding 
      experience with mechanical circulatory support as destination therapy. The
      current 1-year survival of 75% with continuous-flow destination therapy provides 
      a benchmark for the evolving application of this therapy.

      device support.
PG  - 497-506
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.11.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is commonly used in
      patients with heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation. Whereas
      myocardial gene expression profile changes have been well established after LVAD 
      support, the consequences on the protein level largely remain unclear. METHODS:
      Pre-LVAD and post-LVAD myocardial tissue specimens from dilated cardiomyopathy
      (DCM) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients were analyzed by fluorescent
      2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, and differentially expressed
      proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In the DCM group, 16
      proteins were detected that showed statistically significant downregulation from 
      pre-LVAD to post-LVAD tissue. In IHD patients, 50 alterations were found,
      including upregulated (n = 12) and downregulated (n = 38) proteins. The
      identified proteins in both groups partially overlapped and included proteins
      from cytoskeleton and mitochondrial energy metabolism. The latter changes were
      paralleled by severe abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology, as shown by
      electron microscopy. Post-LVAD proteomes of both DCM and IHD patients largely
      mimicked the protein profiles of non-failing hearts. Downregulation of the serine
      protease inhibitor alpha-1-antichymotrypsin in both DCM and IHD patients after
      LVAD support was confirmed by immunosorbent assay. CONCLUSIONS: LVAD-induced
      cardiac remodeling in DCM and IHD patients is associated with downregulation of
      alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and specific atrophic changes in protein expression
      profiles predominantly involved in cytoskeleton integrity and mitochondrial
      energy metabolism.

AB  - The HeartWare (HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA) ventricular assist device (HVAD)
      is designed to be implanted with the pump in the pericardial space and its
      integrally attached inflow cannula in the left ventricle. The uniquely
      incorporated inflow cannula was originally designed to be inserted into the
      diaphragmatic surface of the heart, allowing the pump to sit on the flattened
      diaphragmatic surface. Commonly, however, the inflow cannula is placed through
      the usual left ventricular assist device insertion site, anterolateral to the
      left ventricular apex. We describe the original, intended technique for inflow
      cannula insertion and HVAD placement on the diaphragmatic surface of the left
      ventricle. Our experience has confirmed that this placement results in the
      optimal left ventricular position, with orientation of the inlet cannula parallel
      to the short axis of the left ventricle and anterior to the papillary muscle
      insertion. This approach should protect against inflow obstruction and
      endocardial contact, with resulting arrhythmias. In addition, this position
      results in lateral placement of the outflow graft, avoiding the anterior and
      retrosternal surface of the right ventricle.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy for mechanical circulatory support: a comprehensive review.
PG  - 60-77
LID - 10.1345/aph.1P459 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive review of the pharmacotherapy associated
      with the provision of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to patients with
      end-stage heart failure and guidance regarding the selection, assessment, and
      optimization of drug therapy for this population. DATA SOURCES: The
      MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from 1960 to July
      2010 for articles published in English using the search terms mechanical
      circulatory support, ventricular assist system, ventricular assist device, left
      ventricular assist device, right ventricular assist device, biventricular assist 
      device, total artificial heart, pulsatile, positive displacement, axial,
      centrifugal, hemostasis, bleeding, hemodynamic, blood pressure, thrombosis,
      antithrombotic therapy, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, right ventricular failure,
      ventricular arrhythmia, anemia, arteriovenous malformation, stroke, infection,
      and clinical pharmacist. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All relevant
      original studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, and reviews were
      assessed for inclusion. References from pertinent articles were examined for
      content not found during the initial search. DATA SYNTHESIS: MCS has advanced
      significantly since the first left ventricular assist device was implanted in
      1966. Further advancements in MCS technology that occurred in the latter decade
      are changing the overall management of endstage heart failure care and cardiac
      transplantation. These pumps allow for improved bridge-to-transplant rates,
      enhanced survival, and quality of life. Pharmacotherapy associated with MCS
      devices may optimize the performance of the pumps and improve patient outcomes,
      as well as minimize morbidity related to their adverse effects. This review
      highlights the knowledge needed to provide appropriate clinical pharmacy services
      for patients supported by MCS devices. CONCLUSIONS: The HeartMate II clinical
      investigators called for the involvement of pharmacists in MCS patient assessment
      and optimization. Pharmacotherapeutic management of patients supported with MCS
      devices requires individualized care, with pharmacists as part of the team, based
      on the characteristics of each pump and recipient.

PG  - 306-7

AB  - As ventricular assist devices are increasingly adopted and widely implemented as 
      a highly effective therapy for end-stage heart disease, extended utilization
      periods for destination therapy or bridge-to-transplantation have created the
      possibility of device failure, infection, or thrombosis, requiring challenging
      implant exchanges. A major problem in these operations is the risk of air
      embolization, particularly in a nonsternotomy approach that precludes access to
      the outflow aortic graft and to the ascending aorta. We report a minimally
      invasive, nonsternotomy HeartMate II implantable left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) exchange, using peripheral cardiopulmonary support and a novel approach to
      continuous intravascular ascending aortic air removal.

AB  - This report describes the management of biventricular assist device (BIVAD)
      implantation in a patient with necrotic pancreatitis. BIVADs provide mechanical
      support for ventricular ejection in the failing heart and have become an accepted
      treatment for end-stage heart failure. They also have proved to be a successful
      bridge to heart transplantation. As their popularity has grown, the number of
      patients with BIVADs presenting for noncardiac surgery is increasing. We report
      the successful management of an implanted extracorporeal BIVAD in a patient with 
      end-stage heart failure and with pancreatic stents in a case of necrotic
      pancreatitis. Historical, physical, laboratory, and imaging data allowed
      conservative management leading to a favorable outcome.

LID - 10.1532/HSF98.20101068 [doi]
AB  - The use of short-term mechanical circulatory support during postcardiotomy acute 
      heart failure provides an opportunity to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic
      state while determining the best long-term strategy. Because all of these devices
      require anticoagulation treatment of various intensities, management of major
      bleeding can be critical for the overall outcome of the therapy. In this regard, 
      the newest generation of magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow pumps affords
      several potential advantages in terms of thrombogenicity and eventual
      discontinuation of anticoagulation treatment. We report the use of a short-term
      biventricular assist device (Levitronix CentriMag) for 94 days in a 55-year-old
      man with refractory ventricular arrhythmias after combined heart surgery. Despite
      serious complications while the patient was on the assist device, including
      severe intestinal bleeding with the necessity of discontinuing anticoagulation
      for 10 days and, ultimately, hemicolectomy, the circulatory support was completed
      with successful heart transplantation.

AB  - The CardioWest total artificial heart (SynCardia Systems, Tuscon, AZ, USA) is the
      only FDA-approved total artificial heart determined as a bridge to human heart
      transplantation for patients dying of biventricular heart failure. Implantation
      provides immediate hemodynamic restoration and clinical stabilization, leading to
      end-organ recovery and thus eventually allowing cardiac transplantation.
      Occasionally, implantation of a total artificial heart is not feasible for
      anatomical reasons. For this patient group, we have developed an alternative
      technique using the paracorporeal Thoratec biventricular support system
      (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as a modified total artificial heart. A detailed 
      description of the implantation technique is presented.

PG  - 343-6
AB  - Heart failure is considering one of the most prevalent diseases in recent years. 
      Despite advances in the treatment with new drugs and devices such as implantable 
      defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy, the progression in heart
      failure leads to deterioration in the quality of life, frequent hospitalizations 
      and high mortality rates. Advanced stage of this disease remains heart
      transplantation for treatment choice, although is not the adequate therapy for
      all the patients. Many of them require support with inotropic drugs, which lead
      to a progressive deterioration and limited survival, because waiting times are
      prolonged or transplantation is not performed. Therefore, progress in circulatory
      support devices allow to consider these as the treatment while awaiting
      transplantation and an alternative when the transplant is not considered an
      option. It is our objective to review the progress and the usefulness of
      circulatory support devices in patients with advanced heart failure, in which the
      last option is heart transplantation.

      stratified by pre-operative INTERMACS classification.
PG  - 402-7
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.10.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has
      emerged as an important tool in patient selection and outcomes assessment. Most
      studies examining risk stratification have been limited to pulsatile devices. We 
      use the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
      (INTERMACS) to stratify patients with continuous-flow devices and assess outcomes
      in less severe, but functionally impaired, heart failure patients. METHODS: This 
      study included 101 bridge-to-transplant and destination-therapy patients at 3
      centers. Three groups were studied: Group 1, cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS Profile
      1); Group 2, inotrope-dependent (INTERMACS Profile 2 or 3); and Group 3,
      ambulatory advanced heart failure (INTERMACS Profiles 4 to 7). The outcomes of
      interest were actuarial survival, survival to discharge and length of stay.
      RESULTS: Survival at 36 months was better in Group 3 than in Group 1 (95.8% vs
      51.1%, p = 0.011), but not between Groups 2 and 3 (68.8 vs 95.8%, p = 0.065).
      Lengths of stay for Groups 1 to 3 were 44, 41 and 17 days: Groups 1 vs 3, p <
      0.001; Groups 2 vs 3, p < 0.001; and Groups 1 vs 2, p = 0.62. Lengths of stay for
      survivors were 49, 39 and 14 for the 3 groups: Groups 1 vs 3, p < 0.001; Groups 2
      vs 3, p < 0.001; and Groups 1 vs 2, p = 0.28. CONCLUSION: INTERMACS
      classification is a useful metric for risk-stratifying candidates for MCS. Less
      acutely ill but functionally impaired heart failure patients receiving
      continuous-flow LVADs had longer short- and long-term survival and shorter
      lengths of stay compared with patients who were more acutely ill.

TI  - HeartMate(R) II continuous-flow left ventricular assist system.
PG  - 11-21
LID - 10.1586/erd.10.77 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have emerged as a beneficial therapeutic 
      strategy proven to improve the morbidity and mortality of patients with advanced 
      heart failure. Continuous-flow rotary LVADs have been developed in the hopes of
      delivering circulatory support in a more durable manner with fewer device-related
      complications. The HeartMate((R)) II continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      system (LVAS; Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) has become the standard 
      of care for heart failure patients who require long-term mechanical circulatory
      support. The efficacy of the HeartMate II has been demonstrated in patients where
      temporary support with an LVAD is needed until a suitable donor organ can be
      found for transplant (termed 'bridge to transplantation'), as well as for
      terminally-ill heart failure patients who are not candidates for transplant
      ('destination therapy'). When directly compared with a pulsatile LVAD, the
      implantation of a HeartMate II LVAS resulted in an overall improvement in
      survival with a reduction in the number of device-related complications and
      adverse events. The purpose of this article is threefold: to describe the history
      of the development of continuous-flow LVADs; to describe the technology of the
      HeartMate II; and, finally, to review the clinical outcomes in patients who have 
      been implanted with the device.

AB  - Although heart transplantation is the gold standard for the treatment of advanced
      stage heart failure, the implantation of mechanical circulatory support devices
      (MCSDs) has become a well-established therapy for this disease. As the population
      of patients with severe heart failure has grown, the utilization of MCSDs has
      increased considerably. That trend is expected to continue, especially in light
      of dramatic advances in MCSD technology. This review outlines the current status 
      and future directions of mechanical circulatory support therapy in the setting of
      a constantly evolving field of supportive devices and adjuvant therapies.

AB  - Ventricular assist device (VAD) support inpatients with a prosthetic heart valve 
      had previously been considered a relative contraindication due to an increased
      risk of thromboembolic complications. We report our clinical experience of VAD
      implantation in patients with prosthetic heart valves, including both mechanical 
      and bioprosthetic valves. The clinical records of 133 consecutive patients who
      underwent VAD implantation at a single institution from January 2002 through June
      2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Six of these patients had a prosthetic valve 
      in place at the time of device implantation. Patient demographics,operative
      characteristics, and postoperative complications were reviewed.Of the six
      patients,four were male.The mean age was 57.8 years (range 35-66 years). The
      various prosthetic cardiac valves included a mechanical aortic valve (n = 2), a
      bioprosthetic aortic valve (n = 3), and a mechanical mitral valve (n = 1).The
      indications for VAD support included bridge to transplantation (n = 2), bridge to
      recovery (n = 1), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure(n = 3). Three patients
      underwent left ventricular assist device placement and three received a right
      ventricular assist device. Postoperatively, standard anticoagulation management
      began with a heparin infusion (if possible)followed by oral anticoagulation.The
      30-day mortality was50% (3/6). The mean duration of support among survivors was
      194.3 days (range 7-369 days) compared with 16.0 days(range 4-29 days) for
      nonsurvivors. Of the three survivors,two were successfully bridged to heart
      transplantation and one recovered native ventricular function.Among the three
      nonsurvivors,acute renal failure developed in each case, and two developed
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This study suggests that VAD placement in
      patients with a prosthethic heart valve, either mechanical or
      bioprosthetic,appears to be a reasonable option.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of low dosing of double antiplatelet therapy during
      long-term left ventricular support with the INCOR system.
PG  - 202-6
LID - 10.1007/s10047-010-0527-7 [doi]
AB  - Adverse events due to anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during left
      ventricular assistance device (LVAD) support are very common, and every effort
      must be made to reduce their impact. We report our experience using a low dose of
      double antiplatelet therapy for patients provided with the INCOR LVAD system as a
      bridge to transplantation. Twelve patients (10 males, 35-60 years old) with acute
      or end-stage heart failure were included in this study. The mean follow-up was 10
      months (cumulative 4.9 years). For antiplatelet therapy, we use an association of
      variable doses of aspirin and clopidogrel. The use of a platelet aggregation test
      (PAT) allows reducing the dose of the drugs to the minimum needed. The primary
      end point was to check the safety of the therapy, analyzing the incidence of
      major and minor bleeding complications. The secondary end point was to check the 
      effectiveness of the therapy, evaluating the incidence of major and minor
      thromboembolic events. We had three (25%) cases of early postoperative
      mediastinal bleeding. On the contrary, no episodes of major bleeding occurred
      during the follow-up period. The rate of minor bleeding complications was low:
      0.2 events per patient/year. The rate of major and minor thromboembolic events
      was acceptable (respectively 0.09 and 0.2 per patient/year). During LVAD support,
      double antiplatelet therapy with a low dose of aspirin and clopidogrel was safe
      and effective. PAT allows reducing the dose of antiplatelet drugs, avoiding
      complications related to excessive or insufficient dose administration.

TI  - Role of cardiac resynchronization in end-stage heart failure patients requiring
      inotrope therapy.
PG  - 931-7
LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2010.07.253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outcomes among inotrope-treated heart failure (HF) patients receiving
      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) have not been well characterized,
      particularly in those requiring intravenous inotropes at the time of implant.
      METHODS: We analyzed 759 consecutive CRT-defibrillator recipients who were
      categorized as never on inotropes (NI; n = 585), weaned from inotropes before
      implant (PI; n = 124), or on inotropes at implant (II; n = 50). Survival free
      from heart transplant or ventricular assist device and overall survival were
      compared using the Social Security Death Index. A patient cohort who underwent
      unsuccessful CRT implantation and received a standard defibrillator (SD; n = 94) 
      comprised a comparison group. Propensity score analysis was used to control for
      intergroup baseline differences. RESULTS: Compared with the other cohorts, II
      patients had more comorbidities. Both survival endpoints differed significantly
      (P < .001) among the 4 cohorts; II patients demonstrated shorter survival than NI
      patients, with the PI and SD groups having intermediate survival. After adjusting
      for propensity scores, overall differences and patterns in survival endpoints
      persisted (P < .01), but the only statistically significant pairwise difference
      was overall survival between the NI and II groups at 12 months (hazard ratio
      2.95, 95% confidence interval 1.05-8.35). CRT recipients ever on inotropes (PI
      and II) and SD patients ever requiring inotropes (n = 17) experienced similar
      survival endpoints. Among II patients, predictors of hospital discharge free from
      inotropes after CRT included male gender, older age, and ability to tolerate
      beta-blockade. CONCLUSIONS: Inotrope-dependent HF patients show significantly
      worse survival despite CRT than inotrope-naive patients, in part because of more 
      comorbid conditions at baseline. CRT may not provide a survival advantage over a 
      standard defibrillator among patients who have received inotropes before CRT.
      Weaning from inotropes and initiating neurohormonal antagonists before CRT should
      be an important goal among inotrope-dependent HF patients.

      review.
PG  - 335-43
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcq205 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart transplantation (HTx), the gold standard therapy for advanced
      heart failure, is limited by donor availability; alternative therapies are now
      becoming available. AIM: We examined the outcome of HTx with current
      immunosuppressive and adjunctive therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analysed the
      outcome of 399 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation at our centre
      (1995-2007). Prior to HTx 23% (98) required inotropic support, 8.5% (34) an
      intra-aortic balloon pump and 11% (43) a ventricular assist device. RESULTS:
      Actuarial patient survival was 86% at 30 days, 79% at 1 year and 62% at 10 years.
      Survival was similar regardless of the heart failure severity, P=0.22. The
      cumulative incidence of allograft vasculopathy, Costanzo grade>/=2, was 7% at 5
      years and 23% by 10 years with an 11% cumulative probability of requiring a
      percutaneous coronary intervention by 10 years. Allograft function was preserved 
      with a mean+/-SD left ventricular ejection fraction of 73+/-7% at 1 year and
      74+/-8% at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of malignancy by 10 years was 27%
      (skin malignancy 13% and post transplant lymphoproliferative diseases 10%). The
      cumulative incidence of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated
      glomerular filtration rate</=45 ml/min/1.73 m2 was 42% at 1 year, 62% at 5 years 
      and 72% at 10 years and of requiring long-term renal replacement therapy was
      10.6% at 10 years. CONCLUSION: HTx provided good medium-term survival for
      patients with advanced heart failure, independent of its severity. The incidence 
      of allograft vasculopathy was lower than reported previously but malignancy and
      CKD remain cause for concern.

TI  - Implementation of a comprehensive interdisciplinary care coordination of infants 
      and young children on Berlin Heart ventricular assist devices.
PG  - 231-8
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0b013e3181f29a2e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Young children supported on a ventricular assist device (VAD) can
      have prolonged hospitalizations awaiting heart transplantation. The adult VAD
      literature demonstrates that comprehensive programs optimize transplantation
      outcomes. The goal of this intervention was to create an interdisciplinary
      program to optimize care coordination and delivery in young children requiring a 
      VAD. METHOD: This study was a case review. RESULTS: We have supported 8 infants
      and young children with Berlin Heart VAD. These children's hospitalizations have 
      been more complex than those of our older VAD patients, and they have required
      intensive care for prolonged periods. An interdisciplinary group evaluated our
      practices and identified areas for potential improvement. The focus group from
      our intensive care unit introduced multiple interventions to optimize
      interdisciplinary care coordination and consistency of practice. These included
      (1) interdisciplinary care guidelines for chronically, critically ill patients;
      (2) institution of a primary cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) physician
      and nurse practitioner system; (3) introduction of a psychological intervention
      for families to minimize the impact of their extended CVICU stay; (4)
      implementation of early jejunal feeds; (5) a focused developmental and
      rehabilitation protocol, 6) implementation of a structured approach to minimizing
      blood transfusions; (7) increased structure for our interdisciplinary rounds to
      optimize team communication; (8) comprehensive nursing education including wound 
      care, anticoagulation management, and laboratory draws; and (9) a protocol for
      off-unit rehabilitative/developmental interventions. These changes in both
      practice and approach for young VAD patients have also been of benefit to other
      chronically, critically ill children in the CVICU, as well as to our CVICU team. 
      CONCLUSION: Comprehensive interdisciplinary care coordination and standardized
      practice can be achieved in the critical care setting for complex pediatric heart
      failure patients who require long-term VAD support.

AB  - Despite the remarkable advances with the use of ventricular assist devices (VAD) 
      in adults, pneumatic pulsatile support in children is still limited. We report on
      our experience in the pediatric population. A retrospective review of 17
      consecutive children offered mechanical support with Berlin Heart as a bridge to 
      heart transplant from February 2002 to April 2010 was conducted. The median
      patient age was 3.9 years (75 days to 13.3 years). The median patient weight was 
      14.1 kg (2.9-43kg). Before VAD implantation, all children were managed by
      multiple intravenous inotropes and mechanical ventilation (14) or extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation (3). All patients had right ventricular dysfunction. Nine
      patients required biventricular mechanical support (BVAD), but in all other cases
      a single left ventricular assist device proved sufficient (47%). The median
      duration of VAD support was 47 days (1-168 days). The median pre-VAD pulmonary
      vascular resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5 to 14.4WU/m(2) ). Eleven
      patients (65%) were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median 
      duration of mechanical support of 68 days (6-168 days). Six deaths occurred
      (35%), three for neurological complications, one for sepsis, and two others for
      device malfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our patients has
      increased from 43% to 80%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from 86% to 30%.
      In two patients with Rpi >10WU/m(2) , unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilatator
      therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of BVAD support,
      respectively. Seven patients (41%) required at least one pump change. Of 11
      patients undergoing heart transplant, four developed an extremely elevated (>60%)
      panel reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed by
      Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of rejection in the
      first month after heart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The survival rate
      after heart transplantation was 100% with a median follow-up of 25.4 months (6
      days to 7.7 years). Mechanical support in children with end-stage heart failure
      is an effective strategy as a bridge to heart transplantation with a reasonable
      morbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer an additional means to reverse
      extremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: End-stage heart failure is a challenging disease with growing 
      incidence. With decreasing heart transplant rates worldwide organ preserving
      therapies become, again, of interest. The purpose of the present review is to
      examine the potential challenges of surgical therapies in patients with end-stage
      heart failure. RECENT FINDINGS: The gold-standard for end-stage heart failure is 
      and will be cardiac transplantation. However, due to organ shortage this therapy 
      is limited to a few patients. Therefore implantation of ventricular assist
      devices (VADs) or long-term minimal-invasive partial support devices will
      increase. Improvements in device design with smaller devices, easier implantation
      techniques, and modified anticoagulation outcome and long-term success will
      likely improve. In addition, good quality of life as destination therapy is
      almost available. Organ conservation surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting and
      surgical ventricular restoration or surgical repair of mitral valve
      regurgitation) in end-stage heart failure patients could not prove the expected
      results. Transcatheter or minimal-invasive approaches of these therapies might
      become routine in the near future. SUMMARY: Due to the overwhelming outcome
      rates, cardiac transplantation is the most established surgical therapy for
      end-stage heart failure. VAD therapy is increasing and minimized VADs might
      further open the market for destination therapy/permanent support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low cardiac output (LCO) after corrective surgery remains a serious
      complication in pediatric congenital heart diseases (CHD). In the case of
      refractory LCO, extra corporeal life support (ECLS) extra corporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) or ventricle assist devices (VAD) is the final therapeutic
      option. In the present study we have reviewed the outcomes of pediatric patients 
      after corrective surgery necessitating ECLS and compared outcomes with pediatric 
      patients necessitating ECLS because of dilatated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS: A
      retrospective single-centre cohort study was evaluated in pediatric patients,
      between 1991 and 2008, that required ECLS. A total of 48 patients received ECLS, 
      of which 23 were male and 25 female. The indications for ECLS included CHD in 32 
      patients and DCM in 16 patients. RESULTS: The mean age was 1.2 +/- 3.9 years for 
      CHD patients and 10.4 +/- 5.8 years for DCM patients. Twenty-six patients
      received ECMO and 22 patients received VAD. A total of 15 patients out of 48
      survived, 8 were discharged after myocardial recovery and 7 were discharged after
      successful heart transplantation. The overall mortality in patients with
      extracorporeal life support was 68%. CONCLUSION: Although the use of ECLS shows a
      significantly high mortality rate it remains the ultimate chance for children.
      For better results, ECLS should be initiated in the operating room or shortly
      thereafter. Bridge to heart transplantation should be considered if there is no
      improvement in cardiac function to avoid irreversible multiorgan failure (MFO).

TI  - Preventing cardiac remodeling: the combination of cell-based therapy and cardiac 
      support therapy preserves left ventricular function in rodent model of myocardial
      ischemia.
PG  - 1374-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.07.070 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cellular and mechanical treatment to prevent heart failure each holds 
      therapeutic promise but together have not been reported yet. The goal of the
      present study was to determine whether combining a cardiac support device with
      cell-based therapy could prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling, more than
      either therapy alone. METHODS: The present study was completed in 2 parts. In the
      first part, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rodent femurs and seeded on
      a collagen-based scaffold. In the second part, myocardial infarction was induced 
      in 60 rats. The 24 survivors were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: control,
      stem cell therapy, cardiac support device, and a combination of stem cell therapy
      and cardiac support device. Left ventricular function was measured with biweekly 
      echocardiography, followed by end-of-life histopathologic analysis at 6 weeks.
      RESULTS: After myocardial infarction and treatment intervention, the ejection
      fraction remained preserved (74.9-80.2%) in the combination group at an early
      point (2 weeks) compared with the control group (66.2-82.8%). By 6 weeks, the
      combination therapy group had a significantly greater fractional area of change
      compared with the control group (69.2% +/- 6.7% and 49.5% +/- 6.1% respectively, 
      P = .03). Also, at 6 weeks, the left ventricular wall thickness was greater in
      the combination group than in the stem cell therapy alone group (1.79 +/- 0.11
      and 1.33 +/- 0.13, respectively, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Combining a cardiac
      support device with stem cell therapy preserves left ventricular function after
      myocardial infarction, more than either therapy alone. Furthermore, stem cell
      delivery using a cardiac support device is a novel delivery approach for
      cell-based therapies.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support with the ABIOMED BVS 5000: the Toronto General
      Hospital experience.
PG  - 467-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hemodynamic collapse resulting in cardiogenic shock and
      impending end-organ failure is usually associated with certain death. The
      introduction of short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices offers
      potential therapy to these critically ill patients. The BVS 5000 device (ABIOMED 
      Inc, USA) is widely used in the United States, but rarely in Canada, where device
      reimbursement remains a barrier. OBJECTIVE: To present the Toronto General
      Hospital's (Toronto, Ontario) initial five-year experience with this device to
      highlight the indications for use, common complications and overall success
      rates. METHODS AND RESULTS: The institutional MCS database from 2001 to 2006 was 
      reviewed, and 18 patients who received 30 devices in a variety of configurations 
      were identified. The most common support configuration consisted of biventricular
      support (n=12), followed by isolated left ventricular support (n=4) and isolated 
      right ventricular support in two recipients of an implantable long-term left
      ventricular assist device. Overall survival to device explant or transplant was
      55% (n=10), of which five (50%) were successfully discharged from the hospital.
      The overall survival from device implant to hospital discharge was 28% (five of
      18). The most common cause of death was multisystem organ failure. CONCLUSIONS:
      MCS with the ABIOMED BVS 5000 can successfully resuscitate critically ill
      patients; however, earlier institution of this device would avoid irreversible
      end-organ injury, and lead to higher rates of device explant and hospital
      discharge. Short-term MCS devices should be available in all cardiac surgical
      centres in Canada to permit stabilization and evaluation of the acutely ill
      cardiac patient and subsequent management in a heart transplant facility.

PG  - 549-65
LID - 10.1007/s11936-010-0093-6 [doi]
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Both acute and chronic systolic heart failure can progress to 
      an advanced phase, resulting in stage D heart failure and even cardiogenic shock.
      Despite significant progress in the treatment of systolic heart failure using
      medical and device therapies, this terminal phase continues to be prevalent and
      associated with unacceptably high morbidity and mortality. Given the inability to
      offer cardiac transplantation to the majority of those presenting with advanced
      heart failure, alternative strategies for cardiac replacement therapy are often
      required. Although there has been interest in using mechanical devices to support
      the circulation since the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass, it is only in the
      past 20 years that ventricular assist devices (VAD) have become viable options
      for therapy. Indeed, we are now entering an era where circulatory assist devices 
      are being used not only to temporarily support patients with post-cardiotomy
      shock, but also as a long-term treatment in ambulatory heart failure patients.
      Furthermore, we are now able to utilize data from multicenter trials and
      registries to guide treatment decisions. These data have clearly shown that VADs 
      improve survival and quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure when
      implanted as a temporary measure (bridge to recovery and bridge to transplant) or
      as long-term support (destination therapy). However, with a growing heart failure
      population there is much work to be done to improve VAD technology, patient
      selection, post-implantation management, and to define the optimal role for
      assist devices in the management of systolic heart failure. We are also in the
      nascent stages of fully understanding the impact of mechanical support on the
      failing myocardium, and developing research methodologies to study novel
      therapies in tandem with VADs to facilitate ventricular recovery. These important
      questions are currently being addressed in ongoing clinical trials, registry
      analyses, and translational research endeavors.

TI  - Long-term mechanical circulatory support in 198 patients: largest single-center
      experience worldwide.
PG  - 9-16
LID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3181fe2187 [doi]
AB  - During recent years, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices have been
      increasingly used for long-term support. Nevertheless, problems of embolic and
      bleeding complication, infections, and technical failure still inhibit successful
      permanent support. We analyzed the courses of 198 patients who were supported for
      >1 year by 12 different MCS devices. Of the 198 patients, 87 had first-generation
      MCS devices (pulsatile), 43 second-generation devices (nonpulsatile with standard
      bearings), and 68 third-generation devices (nonpulsatile with magnetic bearings),
      implanted between July 1994 and March 2009. The mean time on support of the total
      group was approximately 2 years (690 +/- 321 [366-1,875] days). Of the first
      generation, 83 patients (95%) could be discharged; in the second and third group,
      all patients could be discharged. Rehospitalizations were observed in all
      patients. Reasons for readmission were coagulation disorders, wound infections,
      stroke, and technical failure. Seventy-seven patients received heart
      transplantation, 66 are still receiving support, 53 died, and two patients have
      been weaned from the device. All types of devices can be used for extended
      periods of time. Device- and nondevice-related rehospitalizations were observed
      in all three groups of patients. Close outpatient monitoring and support are
      crucial to ensure good long-term results.

TI  - Would access to device therapies improve transplant outcomes for adults with
      congenital heart disease? Analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing
      (UNOS).
PG  - 395-401
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.09.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) now survive into
      adulthood and often present with end-stage heart failure (HF). HF management and 
      approach to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) may differ from adults without CHD.
      We sought to compare OHT waitlist characteristics and outcomes for these 2
      groups. METHODS: The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United 
      Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to identify adults (>/=18
      years) listed for OHT from 2005 to 2009. The cohort was divided into those with
      or without CHD. RESULTS: Of 9,722 adults included, 314 (3%) had CHD. Adults with 
      CHD were younger (35 +/- 13 vs 52 +/- 12 years, p < 0.01) and more often had
      undergone prior cardiac surgery (85% vs. 34%, p < 0.01). Patients with CHD were
      less likely to have a defibrillator (44% vs 75%, p < 0.01) or ventricular assist 
      device (5% vs 14%, p < 0.01) and were more likely to be listed at the lowest
      urgency status than patients without CHD (64% vs 44%, p < 0.01). Fewer CHD
      patients achieved OHT (53% vs 65%, p < 0.001). Although overall waitlist
      mortality did not differ between groups (10% vs 8%, p = 0.15), patients with CHD 
      were more likely to experience cardiovascular death (60% vs 40%, p = 0.03),
      including sudden in 44% and due to HF in 16%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower urgency 
      status, patients with CHD have greater cardiovascular mortality awaiting OHT than
      those without. Increased defibrillator use could improve survival to OHT, because
      sudden death is common. VAD support may benefit select patients, but experience
      in CHD is limited. Referral to specialized adult congenital heart centers can
      enhance utilization of device therapies and potentially improve waitlist
      outcomes.

PG  - 951-4
AB  - Circulatory support devices and cardiac transplantation are closely interlinked
      and are the treatment of severe heart failure refractory to medical therapy. In
      acute situation, ECMO allows stabilization of unstable hemodynamic situation
      related to cardiogenic shock. In patients who require longer term support, the
      use of continuous flow pumps is associated with better survival and better
      quality of life. Those pumps can be used either as a bridge to transplantation or
      as a bridge to recovery but also as destination therapy. Early implantation
      before occurrence of severe right heart failure allows preferential use of LVAD. 
      Approximately 350 cardiac transplantations are performed every year in France.
      Indication in based on several criteria appreciating the severity of functional
      impairment. Contra-indications have to be discussed case by case, and chronologic
      age should not be a too rigid limit. High urgency list allows transplanting the
      sickest patients in priority. Conditional half-life in patients surviving the
      first year post transplantation is 12 years. Mechanical circulatory support and
      cardiac transplantation should be used as complementary treatment of severe heart
      failure in order to avoid progressive but sometime irreversible deterioration of 
      patients with chronic heart failure.

TI  - Relationship of echocardiographic dyssynchrony to long-term survival after
      cardiac resynchronization therapy.
PG  - 1910-8
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.954768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability of echocardiographic dyssynchrony to predict response to 
      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 
      prospective, longitudinal study was designed with predefined dyssynchrony indexes
      and outcome variables to test the hypothesis that baseline dyssynchrony is
      associated with long-term survival after CRT. We studied 229 consecutive class
      III to IV heart failure patients with ejection fraction </=35 and QRS duration
      >/=120 milliseconds for CRT. Dyssynchrony before CRT was defined as tissue
      Doppler velocity opposing-wall delay >/=65 milliseconds, 12-site SD (Yu Index)
      >/=32 milliseconds, speckle tracking radial strain anteroseptal-to-posterior wall
      delay >/=130 milliseconds, or pulsed Doppler interventricular mechanical delay
      >/=40 milliseconds. Outcome was defined as freedom from death, heart
      transplantation, or left ventricular assist device implantation. Of 210 patients 
      (89) with dyssynchrony data available, there were 62 events: 47 deaths, 9
      transplantations, and 6 left ventricular assist device implantations over 4
      years. Event-free survival was associated with Yu Index (P=0.003), speckle
      tracking radial strain (P=0.003), and interventricular mechanical delay
      (P=0.019). When adjusted for confounding baseline variables of ischemic origin
      and QRS duration, Yu Index and radial strain dyssynchrony remained independently 
      associated with outcome (P<0.05). Lack of radial dyssynchrony was particularly
      associated with unfavorable outcome in those with QRS duration of 120 to 150
      milliseconds (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The absence of echocardiographic
      dyssynchrony was associated with significantly less favorable event-free survival
      after CRT. Patients with narrower QRS duration who lacked dyssynchrony had the
      least favorable long-term outcome. These observations support the relationship of
      dyssynchrony and CRT response.

TI  - Robot-assisted stenting of a high-grade anastomotic pulmonary artery stenosis
      following single lung transplantation.
PG  - 612-6
LID - 10.1583/10-3208R.1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report robot-assisted stenting of a stenosis at the pulmonary artery 
      anastomosis following lung transplantation, a rare complication that conveys poor
      prognosis even after surgical correction. TECHNIQUE: The technique is illustrated
      in a 72-year-old man with end-stage lung disease who received a left single lung 
      transplant. On postoperative day 54, he was evaluated for recurrent dyspnea on
      exertion that was due to a severe stenosis at the site of the pulmonary artery
      anastomosis. Balloon angioplasty was performed, and a 10-mm stent was deployed,
      with marked clinical improvement. Fourteen months later, he presented with
      recurrent symptoms due to in-stent restenosis. Multiple attempts at
      catheterization and balloon angioplasty of the stent failed. Due to the technical
      difficulty involved in maneuvering the balloon while maintaining stability, it
      was decided to repeat the angioplasty with the assistance of a Hansen Sensei
      remote robotic navigation system. The robotic arm markedly enhanced stability and
      facilitated successful navigation of the stented site. A 16-mm-diameter Wallstent
      was placed through the previously placed balloon-expandable stent and
      postdilated. CONCLUSION: A remote robotic catheter navigation system was able to 
      assist stenting of an anastomotic pulmonary artery stenosis following failure of 
      conventional interventional techniques.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Full mechanical support with a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      is generally limited to end-stage heart-failure patients. We have been studying
      the safety and efficacy of the partial support Synergy(R) Pocket Micro-pump as
      bridge-to-transplant in a less-sick group of patients as a prelude to a study of 
      its use for destination therapy. METHODS: The CircuLite(R) Synergy device is
      implanted via a small right-sided thoracotomy with an inflow cannula in the left 
      atrium and an outflow graft connected to the right subclavian artery without the 
      use of extracorporeal circulation. The micro-pump is the size of an AA battery,
      sits in the 'pacemaker' pocket subcutaneously in the right clavicular groove and 
      pumps up to 3.0 l min(-)(1) from the left atrium to the right subclavian artery. 
      RESULTS: The device has been implanted in 27 patients awaiting cardiac transplant
      (22 males), age 54.8 +/- 10.0 years with ejection fraction (EF) 21 +/- 6%, mean
      arterial pressure 73.5 +/- 8.8 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)
      27.5 +/- 7.8 mm Hg and cardiac index (CI) 2.0 +/- 0.4 l min(-)(1) m(-)(2).
      Duration of support has ranged from 6 to 281 days. Right-heart catheterization
      showed significant hemodynamic improvement in the short- and intermediate term
      after implant, with increases in CI from 2.0 +/- 0.4 to 2.8 +/- 0.6 l min(-)(1)
      m(-)(2) (p < 0.001) and reductions in PCWP from 28 +/- 6 to 18 +/- 7 mm Hg (p =
      0.002) at an average of 9.5 +/- 5.5 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The Synergy device
      provides partial hemodynamic support and its use is associated with significantly
      improved hemodynamics, thus appearing to interrupt and partially reverse the
      progressive hemodynamic deterioration typical of end-stage heart failure. Ongoing
      efforts are aimed at demonstrating additional clinical benefits and continuing to
      further improve the risk/benefit ratio.

      pump as bridge to decision for refractory cardiogenic shock.
PG  - 1416-21
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.07.083 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cardiogenic shock still carries a very high mortality. We adopted
      veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation using the Levitronix
      centrifugal pump (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, Massachusetts) as a first-line
      treatment of cardiogenic shock in a "bridge to decision" strategy. This article
      provides our experience of this clinical approach. METHODS: Since 1988, 160
      ventricular assist devices have been implanted at our hospital for heart failure.
      Since 2005, 15 consecutive patients have been treated with veno-arterial
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory cardiogenic shock.
      Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been implanted either
      centrally or peripherally. RESULTS: Mean age was 44.7 +/- 20.0 years (2-78
      years). There were 5 women. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was
      implanted peripherally in 8 cases (53.4%) and centrally in the remaining 7
      (46.6%). Mean veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration was 11.5
      +/- 8.1 days (range, 1-30). No patient experienced any neurologic event or
      vascular complication at the cannulation site. Twelve patients (80%) were weaned 
      from veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or bridged to either a
      long-term left ventricular assist device or heart transplantation. Three patients
      died during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support secondary
      to multi-organ failure. Seven patients (46.6%) were discharged from the hospital,
      with a 100% survival at follow-up. The survivors include 2 patients affected by
      fulminant myocarditis, who were bridged to recovery, and 5 patients who were
      bridged to heart transplantation. Survivors were younger than nonsurvivors (mean 
      age, 28.5 vs 58.8 years, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the use
      of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as bridge to decision has
      been effective to promptly restore adequate systemic perfusion, allowing further 
      time to evaluate myocardial recovery or candidacy for ventricular assist device
      or heart transplantation. Younger patients, with no or mild end-organ injury, had
      the best outcomes. Peripheral cannulation decreases the surgical trauma and makes
      emergency implantation possible, even in the intensive care unit.

TI  - Heart failure reversal by ventricular unloading in patients with chronic
      cardiomyopathy: criteria for weaning from ventricular assist devices.
PG  - 1148-60
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehq353 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Unloading-promoted reversal of heart failure (HF) allows long-term
      transplant-free outcome after ventricular assist device (VAD) removal. However,
      because few patients with chronic cardiomyopathy (CCM) were weaned from VADs (the
      majority only recently), the reliability of criteria used for weaning decisions
      to predict long-term post-weaning success is barely known. After 15 years of
      weaning experience, we assessed this issue. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 47 patients
      with CCM as the underlying cause for HF, who were part of a total of 90 patients 
      weaned from bridge-to-transplant-designed VADs since 1995, we analysed data on
      cardiac morphology and function collected before VAD implantation,
      echocardiographic parameters recorded during 'off-pump' trials, duration of HF
      before implantation, and stability of recovery before and early after VAD
      removal. Post-weaning 5 year freedom from HF recurrence reached 66%. Only five
      patients (10.6%) died due to HF recurrence or weaning-related complications.
      Pre-explantation off-pump left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >/=50 and 
      >/=45% revealed predictive values for cardiac stability lasting >/=5 years after 
      VAD removal of 91.7 and 79.1%, respectively. With each unit of LVEF reduction,
      the risk of HF recurrence became 1.5 times higher. The predictive value of LVEF
      >/=45% also became >90% if additional parameters like pre-explantation LV size
      and geometry, stability of unloading-induced cardiac improvement before VAD
      removal, and HF duration before VAD implantation were also considered. Definite
      cut-off values for certain parameters (including tissue-Doppler-derived LV wall
      motion velocity) allowed formulation of weaning criteria with high predictability
      for post-weaning stability, also in patients with incomplete cardiac recovery.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular assist device removal in CCM patients is feasible and
      can be successful even after incomplete cardiac recovery. Parameters of
      pre-explantation cardiac function, LV size and geometry, their stability during
      final off-pump trials, and HF duration allow detection of patients with the
      potential to remain stable for >5 post-weaning years.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) frequently is used to treat medically
      refractory end-stage heart failure. Initially designed to be a bridge to
      transplantation, MCS also has proven itself as a durable therapy for patients who
      are not transplant candidates. As outcomes for patients with MCS have improved,
      research interest in device development has flourished, with many new device
      types under investigation. In addition to improvement of MCS devices,
      investigational work continues to achieve appropriate patient selection and
      complication management.

AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) greatly support heart recovery, but
      recurrent heart failure after LVAD removal limits their use as 'a bridge to
      recovery'. The combination of LVADs and cell transplantation (CTx) is expected to
      be effective to improve the success rate of LVAD removal. We investigated the
      feasibility of combined CTx therapy and LVAD support with a new heterotopic rat
      heart-lung transplantation model that could simulate LVAD support and LVAD
      removal. The heart and both lungs of a rat were heterotopically transplanted, and
      the heart was kept unloaded for two weeks. The heart was then reloaded for two
      weeks (LVAD group). Syngenic smooth muscle cells were transplanted into the
      hearts that had been unloaded for a week, and the hearts were kept unloaded for
      another week and then reloaded (CT-LVAD group). In the unloaded state, CTx could 
      reduce the left ventricle (LV) volume more effectively than LVAD therapy alone
      (P<0.01) and maintain the LV volume even after the hearts were reloaded (P<0.01).
      The results suggest that CTx with LVAD support can prevent recurrent LV dilation 
      after LVAD removal and improve the success rate of LVAD removal.

      ventricular assist device implantation.
PG  - 164-74
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.08.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection is a significant source of morbidity and mortality after
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Newer generation
      continuous-flow (CF) LVADs are smaller, requiring smaller pump pockets and
      drive-line exit sites as compared with pulsatile-flow (PF) devices. With their
      recent adoption, CF device patients benefit from improved provider experience in 
      the detection and treatment of infectious complications. Given these advances in 
      design and experience, we examined the incidence of infectious complications in
      patients receiving CF and PF devices. METHODS: We reviewed patients who received 
      CF or PF LVADs (June 2000 to May 2009) at our institution. Incidences and timing 
      of systemic infections (bacteremia, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock),
      device-associated infections (drive-line, LVAD pocket, sternal wound) and
      non-device-associated infections (catheter-related bloodstream, pneumonia,
      urinary tract) were compared between devices. Primary outcomes were sepsis,
      severe sepsis, a composite of drive-line and LVAD pocket infection, and
      catheter-related bloodstream infection. RESULTS: Of 133 LVADs, 86 were CF. CF
      patients had lower pre-operative risk, more recent device implantation, and
      longer LVAD support time. Device type was highly correlated with reduced
      infections; however, on multivariate analysis, implantation date appeared to
      drive this association. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from all primary
      outcomes were improved with more recent implantation (p < 0.05). On multivariate 
      analysis, implantation date was predictive of all primary outcomes except severe 
      sepsis, for which advanced age and worse Seattle Heart Failure Model score were
      predictive. CONCLUSION: In this institutional review of post-LVAD infections, a
      decrease in infectious complications in CF patients was likely related to
      increased provider experience associated with a more recent date of implantation.

TI  - Results of HeartMate II left ventricular assist device implantation on renal
      function in patients requiring post-implant renal replacement therapy.
PG  - 182-7
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.08.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal function is often compromised in patients with advanced heart
      failure. METHODS: We evaluated renal function in heart failure patients supported
      by the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) who required renal replacement therapy (RRT) by 
      continuous venovenous hemofiltration dialysis (CVVHD) or hemodialysis, or both.
      Indications for RRT included oliguria (urine < 400 ml/day) unresponsive to
      diuretic therapy for > 24 hours with a creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dl or 1.5 times 
      that of the pre-implant creatinine level, severe acidemia, and volume overload.
      RESULTS: Of 107 consecutive patients who underwent HeartMate II implantation at
      our center and had been supported for > 30 days, 15 (13 men and 2 women) required
      post-implant RRT. Of the 15 patients, 3 received CVVHD and 12 received CVVHD and 
      hemodialysis. Renal function improved within 2 months of support compared with
      average values before support (creatinine clearance, 64 +/- 39 vs 92 +/- 55
      ml/min, p = 0.041; glomerular filtration rate, 46.9 +/- 20.7 vs 73.2 +/- 38.9
      ml/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.032). Renal function improved after HeartMate II
      implantation in 10 patients, and RRT was removed. Of these 10 patients, 2
      underwent heart transplantation 4 months after RRT was removed, 1 underwent heart
      and kidney transplantation 4 years later, 2 died at home of conditions unrelated 
      to renal function 6 months after RRT was removed, and 5 are awaiting heart
      transplantation, with good quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients 
      who experienced clinical recovery after the LVAD implant had subsequent recovery 
      of renal function after continuous-flow LVAD support.

TI  - Surgical closure of left ventricular outflow tract after left ventricular assist 
      device implantation in patients with aortic valve pathology.
PG  - 59-63
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.08.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with refractory heart failure, aortic valve (AV)
      insufficiency or the presence of a prosthetic AV has been considered a relative
      contraindication to left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. Nevertheless, 
      we have successfully implanted LVADs in 5 patients with native AV insufficiency
      or an AV prosthesis by closing the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT).
      METHODS: The method of LVOT closure was tailored to the patients' differing
      circumstances. Patient 1 had a regurgitant tri-leaflet native AV. Patient 2 had
      undergone previous aortic root reconstruction with a porcine bioprosthesis.
      Patient 3 had a congenitally bicuspid AV with significant insufficiency. Patient 
      4 had a native tri-leaflet valve that developed thrombus and insufficiency after 
      previous LVAD placement. Patient 5 required removal of a recently placed
      mechanical AV. Accordingly, the LVOT was closed with a bovine pericardial patch
      in Patients 1, 4 and 5, and the lines of coaptation of the AV leaflets were
      closed primarily in Patients 2 and 3. RESULTS: Four months post-operatively, 1
      patient underwent heart transplantation; on removal of the heart, LVOT patch
      integrity was confirmed visually. After a follow-up period of 6 months to 2
      years, the remaining 4 patients are in New York Heart Association Functional
      Class I while awaiting cardiac transplantation. Transesophageal echocardiography 
      has confirmed persistent LVOT closure. CONCLUSION: In all 5 cases, LVOT closure
      circumvented the challenges associated with LVAD therapy in the presence of
      native AV insufficiency or an AV prosthesis.

TI  - Adult candidates for heart transplantation with larger body surface area have
      better prognosis on waiting list after progression to critically ill status.
PG  - 317-22
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.08.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Smaller body size is one of the characteristics of female patients. We
      analyzed whether lower body surface area (BSA) of adult patients affects their
      prognosis after listing for heart transplantation (HTx). METHODS: Adult
      candidates (>/= 18 and <65 years) for de novo HTx in our center, who were newly
      listed as T (transplantable) by Eurotransplant without ventricular assist device 
      (VAD) support between 2000 and 2009 (n = 545), were studied. The patients were
      divided into two groups: group S (n = 272): BSA<1.9563 m(2) (median value of
      total patients) and group L (n = 273): BSA >/= 1.9563 m(2). Most female patients 
      (82/84, 97.6%) belong to group S. Among all these patients, 286 progressed to
      critically ill status, that is, they were listed in urgent status or received a
      VAD. Actuarial survival rates were studied in each group. RESULTS: Overall
      survival rates after listing for HTx in group S were comparable to those in group
      L (43.0% vs 43.7% for 7-year survival, p=0.95). However, 1-year survival rate on 
      waiting list after progression to critically ill status in group S (58.0%, n =
      135) and that of female patients in group S (55.8%, n = 33) were significantly
      lower than those in group L (67.3%, n = 151, all were men; p = 0.042 and p =
      0.044, respectively). After multivariate Cox analysis, BSA<1.9563 m(2) (hazard
      ratio 2.120, p = 0.0019), serum creatinine (hazard ratio 1.202, p = 0.033),
      obesity defined as body mass index >/= 30 kg m(-2) (hazard ratio 2.043, p =
      0.0096) and primary use of VAD (hazard ratio 3.243, p < 0.0001) were identified
      as independent risk factors for mortality on waiting list after progression to
      critically ill status. One-year survival rate on waiting list after VAD
      implantation in group S (44.4%, n = 65) and that of female patients in group S
      (38.1%, n = 14) were significantly lower than those in group L (63.0%, n = 78,
      all were men; p = 0.020 and p = 0.012, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adult HTx
      candidates with lower BSA, including most women, had worse prognosis on waiting
      list after progression to critically ill status, especially after VAD
      implantation. As almost all HTx are nowadays performed in critical status, this
      problem has emerged as important.

PG  - 699-704
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.08.031 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the ventricular assist device (VAD) has been a
      well-established therapy for larger adolescents and adult patients with advanced 
      heart failure, current experience with the use of VAD for mechanical circulatory 
      support in infants and young children with small body surface area is still
      limited. METHODS: Between January 1999 and December 2009, 56 small children with 
      body surface area<1.2 m(2) were implanted with Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric VAD
      in Germany Heart Institute Berlin. The etiology of end-stage myocardial failure
      included non-congenital (75%) and congenital heart disease (25%); the median age 
      at implant was 1 year (12 days to 14 years), and the median support time was 55
      days (1-432 days). RESULTS: Of the 56 pediatric patients, 24 were bridged to
      heart transplantation, 12 were explanted following myocardial recovery, two
      continued to receive support, and the other 18 died on support. The accurate rate
      of survival on VAD support was 81.1% +/- 5.8% and 51.4% +/- 9.3% at 30 days and 1
      year after EXCOR implantation. Patients receiving biventricular support had a
      trend towards higher post-implantation mortality as compared with children
      implanted with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (P = 0.09). Lower
      post-implantation survival was also observed in patients with congenital cardiac 
      disease compared with children with a non-congenital etiology (P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric VAD could provide satisfactory and safe
      circulatory support for small children with end-stage heart disease.

AB  - Patient satisfaction with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) external
      equipment has not yet been reported. We aimed to evaluate the quality of two
      different systems based on patients' perspective and its interrelationship with
      quality of life. Differential assessment of the HeartMate II axial flow pump (n =
      17; Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and the HVAD centrifugal pump (n = 10;
      HeartWare, Inc., Miramar, FL, USA) was obtained from 27 outpatients by a
      questionnaire 2 months to 2.9 years after device implantation. In addition, a
      health-related quality of life questionnaire (Short Form-36 [SF-36]) was
      completed. Overall patients' satisfaction was high. Severe limitations were
      attributed to the loudness of the power base unit in HeartMate II patients (P =
      0.00), and HVAD patients were dissatisfied by the length of the driveline (P =
      0.02). Between HVAD and HeartMate II patients, no significant differences in the 
      quality of life (assessed by SF-36) were reported. While the overall satisfaction
      of outpatients on LVAD support was high, differences between the systems were
      found. Patients' perspectives may have an important impact on future modification
      of external components. Ultimately, this may also contribute to an improvement in
      the quality of life of chronic LVAD patients.

AB  - The ventricular assist device inflow cannulation site is the primary interface
      between the device and the patient. Connecting these cannulae to either atria or 
      ventricles induces major changes in flow dynamics; however, there are little data
      available on precise quantification of these changes. The objective of this
      investigation was to quantify the difference in ventricular/vascular hemodynamics
      during a range of left heart failure conditions with either atrial (AC) or
      ventricular (VC) inflow cannulation in a mock circulation loop with a rotary left
      VAD. Ventricular ejection fraction (EF), stroke work, and pump flow rates were
      found to be consistently lower with AC compared with VC over all simulated heart 
      failure conditions. Adequate ventricular ejection remained with AC under low
      levels of mechanical support; however, the reduced EF in cases of severe heart
      failure may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. AC is therefore more
      suitable for class III, bridge to recovery patients, while VC is appropriate for 
      class IV, bridge to transplant/destination patients.

AB  - Despite optimization of standard medical therapy, some patients with chronic
      heart failure will deteriorate to the point that they require hospitalization for
      intravenous therapies and inpatient monitoring. Once the condition is recognized,
      the therapeutic goals are to reverse hemodynamic derangements, correct metabolic 
      abnormalities, and provide symptomatic relief. Achievement of these goals
      requires individualized care and a familiarity with the risks and benefits of
      particular therapies.

TI  - Infectious complications in patients with left ventricular assist device:
      etiology and outcomes in the continuous-flow era.
PG  - 1270-7
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.04.093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are
      increasingly being used in patients with end-stage heart failure and have largely
      replaced older generation pulsatile devices. While significant rates of infection
      have been reported in patients with pulsatile device support, incidence and
      outcomes of this complication for the continuous-flow device patients remain
      unknown. METHODS: Between June 2005 and August 2009, 81 patients were implanted
      with continuous-flow LVADs at Washington University School of Medicine either as 
      bridge to transplantation or as destination therapy. Outcomes of this study
      included incidence of postimplantation infection, types of infection,
      microbiologic profile, and association of postimplantation infections with
      clinical endpoints. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (51.9%) had at least one type of 
      infection on continuous-flow LVAD support with a mean follow-up period of 9.2 +/-
      9.2 months. Patients who had an infection on LVAD support had a significantly
      prolonged hospital stay (37.9 +/- 32.0 versus 20.7 +/- 23.0 days, p = 0.008) and 
      a trend toward increased mortality (33.1% versus 18.7% at 2 years, respectively, 
      log rank p = 0.102) compared with patients who did not. Subgroup analysis
      revealed that postimplantation sepsis was significantly associated with increased
      mortality in the continuous-flow LVAD cohort (61.9% versus 18.0% at 2 years,
      respectively, in septic and nonseptic patients, log rank p = 0.001). The majority
      of the sepsis cases occurred before hospital discharge, whereas most of the
      device related infections occurred after discharge. Resistant Staphylococcus and 
      Pseudomonas species were the most common pathogens leading to device- and
      nondevice-related local infections. Development of driveline or pocket infection 
      had no effect on survival in patients with continuous-flow assist device support 
      (p = 0.193). CONCLUSIONS: Even though better clinical outcomes have been achieved
      with the newer generation continuous-flow devices, infection complications-in
      particular sepsis-are still a major risk for patients with continuous-flow LVAD
      implantation. Prevention strategies with aggressive medical and surgical
      management of infections may increase survival and decrease morbidity among
      continuous-flow LVAD patients.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Stem cell therapy for cardiac disease may be facing two major 
      problems nowadays: although vasculogenesis likely occurs as a result of cell
      therapy, its clinical applications are limited and significant, integrated
      cardiomyogenesis has not demonstratively been shown to occur, even in the
      experimental setting, with any other source than embryonic or other pluripotent
      stem cells. RECENT FINDINGS: In this article, we highlight several factors that
      will need to be optimized if we are to achieve clinically effective
      cardiomyogenesis, such as the identification of optimal stem cell populations,
      and the ideal time and methods for cell transplantation. So far, educated
      attempts at achieving transplanted stem cell-induced myogenesis have largely
      failed outside of the embryonic stem cell realm, and we present the rationale for
      also considering acellular techniques, which may enhance the potential of
      endogenous progenitor populations. SUMMARY: In today's cardiovascular field, once
      a cardiomyocyte is lost it is lost for good, without any form of direct
      therapeutic option. For these reasons, cell therapy justifies our continued
      attention and efforts, and may constitute the holy grail of cardiovascular
      therapeutics.

AB  - During the past two decades, important progress has been achieved in the
      treatment of end-stage congestive heart failure in newborns and infants. The use 
      of ventricular assist devices (VAD) in these patients is now available as a
      bridge to heart transplantation. The use of a VAD may reveal the presence of a
      silent interatrial septal defect or a patent foramen ovale (PFO), inducing a
      right to left shunt resulting in systemic desaturation and hemodynamic
      instability. We present two cases of low weight infants on circulatory support
      with VADs and right to left shunt through interatrial septum that were
      successfully treated by percutaneous intervention with an occlusion device.

TI  - Cardiomyocyte survivin protein expression is associated with cell size and DNA
      content in the failing human heart and is reversibly regulated after ventricular 
      unloading.
PG  - 1286-92
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.06.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical support in congestive heart failure (CHF) by a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) is associated with decreased cardiac hypertrophy
      and altered cardiomyocyte molecular pathways. Survivin initiates cell cycle
      progression by increased cyclinD1/cdk4 complexes by abrogation of the inhibitory 
      effect of p16(INK4a) on cdk4. Accordingly, the role of survivin in CHF and after 
      unloading was explored. METHODS: In 20 myocardial samples from patients with
      terminal CHF (before and after LVAD), the protein expression of survivin, cyclin 
      D1, cdk4, p16(INK4a), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was
      immunohistochemically investigated and morphometrically quantified by calculating
      the percentage of positive cardiomyocytes per visual field. These data were
      correlated with cardiomyocyte size and DNA content. RESULTS: The mean percentage 
      of cardiomyocytes immunoreactive against survivin, cyclin D1, cdk4, p16(INK4a),
      and PCNA was significantly increased in CHF compared with controls and
      significantly decreased after unloading (57.6% to 26.6%, 42% to 18.3%, 45.4% to
      15.3%, 73.0% to 60.5%, and 43.5% to 25.2%, respectively; p < 0.05). All
      investigated parameters, in particular survivin and cyclin D1, significantly
      correlated with cardiomyocyte diameters (r = 0.405; r = 0.563) and DNA content (r
      = 0.430; r = 0.480), both in CHF (cardiac remodelling) and after unloading (p <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that survivin is reversibly regulated by 
      ventricular unloading and might be involved in cell size/DNA content regulation
      and cardiomyocyte proliferation in cardiac remodelling during CHF. It is
      suggested that after ventricular unloading, decreased survivin protein expression
      might contribute to cardiac hypertrophy decrease by lowering the number of cyclin
      D1/cdk4 complexes.

AB  - Currently available mechanical circulatory support systems are limited for
      adolescent and adult patients with a Fontan physiology. To address this growing
      need, we are developing a collapsible, percutaneously-inserted, axial flow blood 
      pump to support the cavopulmonary circulation in Fontan patients. During the
      first phase of development, the design and experimental evaluation of an axial
      flow blood pump was performed. We completed numerical modeling of the pump using 
      computational fluid dynamics analysis, hydraulic testing of a plastic pump
      prototype, and blood bag experiments (n=7) to measure the levels of hemolysis
      produced by the pump. Statistical analyses using regression were performed. The
      prototype with a 4-bladed impeller generated a pressure rise of 2-30 mmHg with a 
      flow rate of 0.5-4 L/min for 3000-6000 RPM. A comparison of the experimental
      performance data to the numerical predictions demonstrated an excellent agreement
      with a maximum deviation being less than 6%. A linear increase in the plasma-free
      hemoglobin (pfHb) levels during the 6-h experiments was found, as desired. The
      maximum pfHb level was measured to be 21 mg/dL, and the average normalized index 
      of hemolysis was determined to be 0.0097 g/100 L for all experiments. The
      hydraulic performance of the prototype and level of hemolysis are indicative of
      significant progress in the design of this blood pump. These results support the 
      continued development of this intravascular pump as a bridge-to-transplant,
      bridge-to-recovery, bridge-to-hemodynamic stability, or bridge-to-surgical
      reconstruction for Fontan patients.

AB  - Since its initial application in the pediatric patient population, the Berlin
      Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device has become a widely accepted form of
      mechanical circulatory support in Europe and the USA. The versatility of the
      device makes it ideal for pediatric patients because it can be tailored to the
      size and needs of the patient. In this review, we will explore the broad range of
      clinical applications of this device including bridge to cardiac transplantation,
      bridge to recovery, and bridge to bridge implantation where the need for cardiac 
      transplantation may be unclear but long-term mechanical support may be required.

AB  - Remodelling is the central feature that occurs in the progression of heart
      failure. However, unloading of the heart with a left ventricular assist device
      (LVAD) can lead to reversal of many of the remodelling changes even in patients
      with advanced heart failure. LVAD unloading can also lead to improved myocardial 
      function and this improvement can be sufficient to allow removal of the device
      leaving the patient to lead a normal life. We review the molecular changes that
      have been demonstrated with LVAD unloading in patients bridged to transplantation
      and also those that have occurred in the myocardium of patients that have
      recovered their myocardial function enough to have the device removed. Changes in
      both the myocyte and the matrix are reviewed.

      left ventricular assist device.
PG  - 1337-41
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.07.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as destination
      therapy (DT) is increasing and has proven beneficial in prolonging survival and
      improving quality of life in select patients with end-stage heart failure.
      Nonetheless, end-of-life (EOL) issues are inevitable and how to approach them
      underreported. METHODS: Our DT data registry was queried for eligible patients,
      defined as those individuals who actively participated in EOL decision making.
      The process from early EOL discussion to palliation and death was reviewed. We
      recorded the causes leading to EOL discussion, time from EOL decision to
      withdrawal and from withdrawal to death, and location. Primary caregivers were
      surveyed to qualify their experience and identify themes relevant to this
      process. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2009, 92 DT LVADs were implanted in 69
      patients. Twenty patients qualified for inclusion (mean length of support: 833
      days). A decrease in quality of life from new/worsening comorbidities usually
      prompted EOL discussion. Eleven patients died at home, 8 in the hospital and 1 in
      a nursing home. Time from EOL decision to LVAD withdrawal ranged from <1 day to 2
      weeks and from withdrawal until death was <20 minutes in all cases. Palliative
      care was provided to all patients. Ongoing assistance from the healthcare team
      facilitated closure and ensured comfort at EOL. CONCLUSIONS: With expanding
      indications and improved technology, more DT LVADs will be implanted and for
      longer durations, and more patients will face EOL issues. A multidisciplinary
      team approach with protocols involving DT patients and their families in EOL
      decision making allows for continuity of care and ensures dignity and comfort at 
      EOL.

      assist device support.
PG  - 604-11
LID - 10.1007/s12265-010-9216-4 [doi]
AB  - The discrepancy between the limited availability of donor hearts and the
      ever-increasing number of patients with heart failure has led to the increasing
      use of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) as a bridge to transplant. One of
      the main complications inherent following institution of LVAD therapy is right
      ventricular (RV) failure, manifested by the need for inotropic and/or nitric
      oxide support >14 days after LVAD implant and/or the need for right-sided
      mechanical circulatory support. RV failure is a major contributor of significant 
      morbidity and mortality after LVAD placement. The complex pathophysiology of RV
      failure, which could potentially be related to RV myocardial dysfunction,
      interventricular dependence, and RV afterload, has led to inconsistencies in
      predicting risk factors for RV dysfunction. Several strategies have evolved over 
      the years of experience with mechanical circulatory support that have aimed to
      avoid as well as reduce the incidence of RV failure. It is imperative that
      patients who definitely need biventricular support are identified. Despite the
      numerous risk factors identified in many studies as well as the development of
      risk factor profile scores, this continues to be a challenging problem. However, 
      the lower incidence of RV failure following LVAD in the current era is
      encouraging, suggesting a favorable relationship between RV unloading and
      function, and continuous-flow physiology.

TI  - Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
      (INTERMACS)-defined morbidity and mortality associated with pediatric ventricular
      assist device support at a single US center: the Stanford experience.
PG  - 682-8
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.918672 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to bridge pediatric
      patients to heart transplantation has increased dramatically over the last 15
      years. In this report, we present the largest US single-center report of
      pediatric VAD use to date. We present detailed descriptions of morbidity and
      mortality associated with VAD support, using standard Interagency Registry for
      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) criteria for pediatrics to 
      facilitate the comparison of these results to other studies. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      We retrospectively identified 25 patients younger than 18 years with 27 episodes 
      of mechanical circulatory support using VADs as bridge to heart transplantation
      from January 1998 to December 2007. Survival to transplant for the entire cohort 
      was 74%. The most common major morbidities, as defined by INTERMACS criteria for 
      a pediatric population, were respiratory failure, major localized infections,
      major bleeding events, hepatic dysfunction, and right heart failure. Major
      neurological events occurred in 48% of the study population. The median time to
      the first occurrence of an adverse event was less than 14 days for respiratory
      failure, right heart failure, major localized infection, and major bleeding.
      Patients who died before transplantation had significantly more adverse events
      per day of support than did those who were successfully transplanted. Episodes of
      major bleeding, tamponade, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and right
      heart failure were all associated with increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: 
      INTERMACS criteria can be successfully used to analyze pediatric VAD outcomes.
      These data serve as a baseline for future studies of VAD support in children and 
      indicate good survival rates but considerable morbidity.

TI  - Paediatric heart transplantation - the impact of a ventricular assist device on
      operative outcomes.
PG  - 664-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of a ventricular assist device (VAD) is a life-saving option 
      for patients with heart failure refractory to conventional therapy. AIM: To
      assess the effect of VAD on outcomes of heart transplantation in children.
      METHODS: Between October 1988 and June 2009, a consecutive series of 95 children 
      (mean age 8.6 + or - 6.7 years, range 5 days-17.9 years) underwent heart
      transplantation: patients in group 1 (n = 11) received VAD as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation (left ventricular VAD in 4, biventricular VAD in 7), and patients
      in group 2 (n = 84) underwent heart transplantation without previous cardiac
      support using VAD. The indication for heart transplantation was
      cardiomyopathy/myocarditis in 66 (69.5%) of children and congenital heart disease
      in 29 (30.5%) patients. RESULTS: Congenital heart disease was diagnosed more
      often in group 2 than in group 1 (p = 0.047). The two groups did not differ
      significantly with respect to age, weight and parameters of preoperative liver
      and kidney function (except for aspartate aminotransferase activity, p = 0.020). 
      The mean waiting time for transplantation was 64.2 + or - 87.4 days (range 1-443 
      days) and did not differ between the groups. The mean follow-up was 6.8 + or -
      5.4 years (range 1 day-17.6 years). Mortality during long-term follow-up was 9.1%
      (n = 1) in group 1 and 20.2% (n=17) in group 2 (p = 0.632). We found no
      significant differences in postoperative ventilatory support time (p = 0.773),
      duration of hospital stay (p = 0.853), and incidence of acute rejection episodes 
      (p = 0.575). CONCLUSIONS: The use of VAD as a bridge to heart transplantation in 
      children with severe heart failure had no negative effect on treatment outcomes.

TI  - Application of the Seattle Heart Failure Model in ambulatory patients presented
      to an advanced heart failure therapeutics committee.
PG  - 706-14
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.110.944280 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to assess the predictive value of the Seattle Heart Failure
      Model (SHFM) when applied to ambulatory patients with advanced heart failure (HF)
      presented to an advanced HF therapeutics committee at a tertiary care US
      institution. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated model discrimination and
      calibration in 215 consecutive ambulatory patients who were presented to the
      Cleveland Clinic advanced HF therapeutics committee between 2004 to 2007 for
      evaluation for advanced options including transplantation and ventricular assist 
      device (VAD). Analyses were stratified by committee decision (not listed versus
      listed United Network of Organ Sharing [UNOS] Status 2). Eighty-five percent had 
      1 or no missing SHFM variables. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause 
      mortality, VAD, or urgent (UNOS Status 1) transplantation. During a median
      follow-up of 24 months, 68 died, 18 received VAD support, and 81 underwent heart 
      transplantation. Discrimination was modest both for those not listed (c-index,
      0.683 at 1 year and 0.648 at 2 years), and for those listed UNOS status 2
      (c-index, 0.629 at 1 year and 0.628 at 2 years). Calibration was acceptable among
      those patients not listed for heart transplantation but with substantial
      underestimation of risk (ie, overestimation of survival free of VAD or urgent
      transplantation) among UNOS status 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory
      patients presented to an advanced HF therapeutics committee for evaluation for
      heart transplantation, the SHFM offers modest discrimination of risk for the
      primary composite outcome of mortality, VAD, or urgent transplantation, with
      underestimation of risk in those patients listed for nonurgent transplantation.
      Interpretation of risk prediction by the SHFM in this patient population must be 
      done with caution.

TI  - Intracranial hemorrhage surgery on patients on mechanical circulatory support: a 
      case series.
PG  - 30-4
LID - 10.1097/ANA.0b013e3181eee55e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac disease is the leading cause of death in the United States
      and late-stage heart failure is associated with a high level of morbidity and
      mortality. The ventricular assist devices and extracorporeal membrane oxygenators
      are the mainstay of mechanical circulatory support devices for the patients with 
      extremely low cardiac output. However, they come at a price of significant risk
      factors, including intracranial hemorrhage. The incidence of intracranial
      hemorrhage on extracorporeal membrane oxygenators and on ventricular assist
      devices is 37% and 13% to 14%, respectively. METHODS/RESULTS: The cases in this
      series focus on the risks of ICH and the decompressive craniotomies that were
      carried out on patients while they were on mechanical circulatory support. The
      intraoperative anesthetic management for patients on mechanical circulatory
      support for the noncardiothoracic anesthesiologist is highlighted. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results of recent cardiothoracic surgery trials have led to an increase of
      surgical management instead of medical management in the treatment of heart
      failure. Although most agree with the immediate reversal of anticoagulation and
      antiplatelet therapy, there is no standard protocol for restarting
      anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after craniotomy in this population. The 
      standard practices of resuscitation and ACLS including inotropes, vasopressors,
      and vasodilators (with the exception of chest compressions that can dislodge the 
      devices), can be used as needed. The identification of cardiothoracic surgeons
      and perfusionists who are available for immediate assistance as and when required
      during the surgery and transportation is an important factor.

PG  - 601-5
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01098.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients requiring ventricular assist devices
      (VAD) have had previous valvular corrections, including valve repair and valve
      replacement with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves. The operative and
      peri-operative management of these patients has been varied. METHODS: A
      retrospective study of VADs between January 1994 and June 2008 revealed 10
      patients with previous prosthetic valves requiring management during and after
      VAD placement. Three patients were supported postcardiotomy after valve surgery. 
      Two patients were supported due to cardiogenic shock postoperatively. Four
      patients were supported as a bridge to transplantation. One patient was supported
      as a destination therapy (DT). RESULTS: The mitral, valve was left untreated
      during VAD implantation regardless of valve repair or replacement. For aortic
      valves, the mechanical aortic valve was replaced with tissue valve in two
      patients and left untreated in one case. One patient had tricuspid valve repair
      previously and was left untouched. All patients with prosthetic valves in aortic,
      mitral and tricuspid position during VAD support received anticoagulation
      therapy. There were four deaths, and four went on to transplantation. One patient
      was weaned from VAD and discharged from the hospital. One patient received
      HeartMate I as DT. The most common causes of death were multisystem organ failure
      (MSOF) and sepsis. One patient had a thromboembolic event. CONCLUSIONS: The
      survival rate of 60% is encouraging when compared to overall survival rates. The 
      most common cause of death was MSOF. Patients with prosthetic valves may be
      safely managed during VAD support.

LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.06.006 [doi]
AB  - The increased applicability and excellent results with left ventricular assist
      devices (LVADs) have revolutionized the available treatment options for patients 
      with advanced heart failure. Pre-existing valve abnormalities are common in this 
      population, and subsequent development of valve abnormalities after LVAD
      placement is also often noted. Although native mitral and tricuspid valve disease
      is more common in heart failure patients before LVAD placement, aortic valves are
      much more likely to generate abnormal pathophysiology in the LVAD patient during 
      as well as after LVAD placement. The aim of this comprehensive review is to
      review aortic valve function in LVAD patients and highlight the consideration of 
      pre-existing valve disease on patient treatment at the time of LVAD implant. The 
      basis for structural changes leading to valve pathophysiology during and after
      LVAD placement will be described, providing a basis for improved clinical
      understanding and new strategies to prevent these conditions.

AB  - Cardiogenic shock after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a
      life-threatening complication and is most often related to abrupt vessel closure.
      We present the case of a patient who developed cardiogenic shock after PCI and
      was supported with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and the Levitronix
      CentriMag short-term mechanical circulatory support. He was evaluated for
      implantation of a ventricular assist device as bridge-to-transplantation.
      Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed a massive thrombus of the 
      aortic root and ascending aorta despite optimal anticoagulation regimen. The
      patient succumbed due to multiorgan failure.

TI  - Initial clinical experience with a novel left ventricular assist device with a

AB  - BACKGROUND: Third-generation rotary blood pumps have magnetically levitated
      rotors that eliminate mechanical wear over the years. Together with their
      potential for miniaturization, these pumps seem suitable for long-term support of
      patients with a wide range of body surface areas (BSA). Recently, the novel HVAD 
      pump (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA), a miniaturized centrifugal pump with a
      hydrodynamic, magnetically levitated rotor, became ready for clinical
      application. METHODS: In a multi-institutional trial in Europe and Australia, 23 
      patients (mean age, 47.9 +/- 12 years) in end-stage heart failure were enrolled
      in 5 centers. The primary end point of the bridge-to-transplant study was
      survival to heart transplant or survival to 180 days on the device, whichever
      occurred first. Follow-up data at 1 year are presented. The small size of the
      device allows for intrapericardial placement of the pump. RESULTS: Implant
      procedures were generally fast and uneventful. Mean duration of support was 167
      +/- 143 days (range, 13-425 days), and mean blood flow provided by the pump was
      6.1 +/- 1.1 liters/min. At the 180-day end point, 2 patients had undergone
      successful transplant at 157 and 175 days, 2 patients died while on the device,
      and 19 patients continued pump support for more than 180 days. Actuarial survival
      after 6 months was 91% and was 86% at the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The
      design of the HVAD pump enables a quick and less invasive implantation. The
      results to date demonstrate satisfactory long-term survival with excellent
      quality of life in this cohort of 23 patients of the initial multi-institutional 
      Conformite Europeene (CE) mark trial.

AB  - Pulsatile flow left ventricular assist devices (PF-LVADs) have successfully
      supported patients with severe heart failure for bridge-to-transplant (BTT) and
      destination therapy (DT). End-organ dysfunction is often reversed, optimizing the
      patient's condition to enhance survival, and quality of life. Questions have been
      raised regarding the potential for continuous flow LVADs (CF-LVADs) to provide
      the same quality of circulatory support. Prior research showing that PF is
      superior to continuous, non-PF does not appear to be relevant with CF-LVADs for
      BTT and DT. Under most clinical conditions, arterial pulsatility is present
      during CF-LVAD support, and this type of support should not be termed
      "nonpulsatile." Clinical studies have shown that renal, hepatic, and
      neurocognitive function is either maintained within a normal range, or is
      significantly improved, during CF-LVAD support for durations up to 15 months.
      Results of the randomized clinical trial between the CF HeartMate II and the
      pulsatile HeartMate XVE (both by Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA, USA) are pending 
      final US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and are not yet published.
      Studies of microcirculation during CF-LVAD support indicate that capillary blood 
      flow is adequate to support cellular function. There are anecdotal cases of
      patients being supported with a CF-LVAD for over seven years with preserved
      end-organ function. Presently, there are no clinical reports indicating that
      end-organ function is not well maintained. Current clinical evidence indicates
      that end-organ perfusion and function can be well maintained for extended
      durations of support with a CF-LVAD.

AB  - A totally implantable mechanical circulatory support system would be very
      desirable for destination therapy. However, implanting all components of a
      pulsatile total artificial heart (TAH) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      is complex because of the requirement for a continuous electrical power supply
      and the need for volume compensation. Implantable compliance chambers were
      developed for early LVAD designs, and although they functioned properly during
      initial laboratory tests, air loss by diffusion and the development of fibrous
      tissue around the sac eventually rendered them ineffective. Because these
      problems have not yet been overcome, volume displacement LVADs are currently
      designed with either a direct communication to an external drive console or an
      atmospheric vent. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETSs) were also
      developed, but because the skin was being penetrated for volume compensation, it 
      seemed more efficient to transmit electrical power through wires incorporated
      into the venting apparatus. More recently, TETSs were used clinically for both a 
      pulsatile TAH and LVAD in a small number of patients, but for reasons unrelated
      to the TETS, neither of these devices is presently in use. Because the newer
      continuous-flow LVADs do not require a compliance chamber, they present a
      potential future application for TETS technology, because infections of the
      percutaneous tube continue to be one of the most important limitations of
      long-term circulatory support. A totally implantable LVAD with an incorporated
      TETS for destination therapy could become an important advance in the treatment
      of end-stage heart failure.

TI  - Ventricular assist device: saving the failing heart.
PG  - 134-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving the survival and quality of life of patients with end-stage
      heart failure is the primary goal of using a ventricular assist device, generally
      known as mechanical circulatory support. Ventricular assist devices are a
      practical long-term surgical option for a select group of patients with end-stage
      heart failure. METHOD: A case study is used to demonstrate the process of
      selection and evaluation of patients with end-stage heart failure for ventricular
      assist device therapy. Also, a detailed description of all aspects of care of
      patients before, during, and after implantation of a ventricular assist device is
      presented. CONCLUSION: A ventricular assist device is a superior therapeutic
      option for patients with end-stage heart failure who have become intolerant to
      medical therapy or in whom medical therapy has been unsuccessful. Advances in
      device technology through the development of nonpulsatile continuous flow devices
      are showing favorable long-term outcomes for patients with a ventricular assist
      device by minimizing complications and enhancing quality of life.

AB  - Most infants and children implanted with ventricular assist devices (VADs) go on 
      to cardiac transplantation. Recovery of dilated cardiomyopathies with the
      combination left ventricular decompression with a VAD and treatment with maximal 
      medical therapy has been possible in some adults, and may be more feasible in
      infants and children. We used pulsatile and continuous flow VADs and the total
      artificial heart (TAH) as bridges to transplantation or to recovery. Candidates
      for native heart recovery were treated with maximal medical therapy for
      congestive heart failure and short-term dobutamine prior to weaning off device
      support. Since 1997, 28 infants and children, ages 1 month to 16 years, were
      implanted for durations of 3-107 days (mean 27). Eighteen received left VADs
      (LVAD), seven biventricular assist devices (BiVADs), and three TAHs.
      Device-related mortality was 7/28 (25%), leaving 21/28 (75%) surviving to
      transplantation or weaning from device support and 20/28 (71%) discharged from
      the hospital and currently surviving for 2 months to 9 years. Ten of 11
      transplant recipients (90%) have survived 2 to 9 years. All 10 with recovered
      hearts are alive and well for 2 months to 5 years. Eight of 12 (67%) LVAD
      patients with dilated hearts recovered. None of the recovery patients were over 6
      years old. Infants and children who have failed inotropic therapy may be treated 
      with an LVAD and medical therapy for congestive heart failure anticipating native
      heart recovery. A variety of devices have been tried. All small LVADs yielded
      comparable results. Larger and older children also have a chance of recovery, but
      our experience with them is too small except to note that they do well with
      larger devices and transplantation.

TI  - The use of percutaneous ECMO support as a 'bridge to bridge' in heart failure
      patients: a case report.
PG  - 321-5, 327
LID - 10.1177/0267659110378387 [doi]
AB  - A 65-year-old male with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy was admitted
      to the intensive care unit in cardiogenic shock. Cardiac catheterization revealed
      bi-ventricular hypokinesis, with an estimated ejection fraction of 15%. Despite
      moderate inotropic support, the patient's liver enzymes, international
      normalization ratio (INR), and creatinine became grossly elevated, indicating
      multi-organ injury from hypoperfusion. Due to the patient's state of shock and
      probable bleeding complications, a full sternotomy and emergent biventricular
      assist device insertion was deemed very high risk. In order to achieve
      hemodynamic stability, a decision was made for extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) support. ECMO support was quickly initiated by percutaneous
      cannulation of the femoral vein and artery. The ECMO circuit was comprised of a
      Centrimag blood pump and Quadrox-D Safeline-coated membrane oxygenator. With
      successful perfusion and organ resuscitation, abnormal liver function tests, INR,
      and creatinine all returned to normal in less than one week. With normal organ
      function, especially the liver, the patient successfully underwent an implantable
      left ventricular assist device, HeartMate II LVAD, without requiring mechanical
      right heart support. Prior to ECMO, the patient was at very high risk of needing 
      biventricular support. Thus, the temporary use of ECMO allowed for a safer and
      more durable bridge to transplantation. The use of percutaneous ECMO has many
      advantages, including improving the patient condition and allowing for time to
      evaluate fully the LVAD patient.

      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) between 2004 and 2009. RESULTS: Eleven
      children </= 10 kg with end-stage heart failure (cardiomyopathy or myocarditis)
      were treated with VAD as bridge to OHT: the median weight was 8.0 (range 3.9-10.0
      kg)kg and median age was 12.3 (range 1.2-33.9 months) months. Five (45%) required
      ECMO support pre-BH and six were on mechanical ventilation and inotropes. In 9/11
      (82%), the support mode was left ventricular assist device (L-VAD) (all alive):
      one of two patients needing Bi-VAD support died. On BH, the median support time
      was 27 days and time to extubation was 8 days. Two out of 11 (18%) suffered
      strokes confirmed on brain imaging; both recovered and one underwent resection of
      infarcted small bowel. Ten out of 11 (91%) were transplanted, one remains in
      hospital and nine are at home in good health. When compared to patients >10 kg
      bridged with BH (n = 15), the mortality (p = 0.51) and rates of neurological
      complications (p = 0.54) were similar. Post-transplant recovery (ventilation
      times and time to home discharge) was similar between the bridged children </= 10
      kg and non-bridged children </= 10 kg who underwent OHT. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical 
      bridging to transplantation is clinically feasible in children </= 10 kg,
      achieving excellent outcomes. Judicious use of VADs in smaller children will
      optimise the use of donor organs; however, the effect on overall OHT waiting
      times, if mechanical bridging was extended to a large number of small children,
      is unknown.

AB  - Advances in palliation of congenital heart disease have resulted in improved
      survival to adulthood. Many of these patients ultimately develop end-stage heart 
      failure requiring left ventricular assist device implantation (LVAD). However,
      morphologic differences in the systemic ventricle of these patients require
      careful attention to cannula placement. We report on the evolution of our
      surgical technique for implanting LVADs in 3 patients with transposition of the
      great arteries and congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.
      Applying standard LV cannulation techniques to the systemic ventricle led us too 
      anteriorly in our first patient, creating obstruction by the moderator band.
      Subsequent use of epicardial and transesophageal echocardiography allowed for
      intraoperative localization of the intracardiac muscular structures to identify
      the optimal cannulation site. The acute angle of the inflow cannula on the
      DeBakey LVAD (MicroMed Technology, Houston, TX) required flipping the device 180 
      degrees . The HeartMate II device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) could be shifted
      towards the midline. One patient underwent successful transplant and 2 are home
      waiting for a donor organ. We conclude from our experience that LVAD surgery can 
      be safely performed in patients with congenital heart disease when implanted
      under echocardiographic guidance.

      ventricular assist devices.
PG  - 1172-6
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.05.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used as
      long-term therapy for end-stage heart failure patients. We compared the
      prevalence of aortic insufficiency (AI) after HeartMate II (HMII) vs HeartMate
      XVE (HMI) support and assessed the role of aortic root diameter and aortic valve 
      opening in the development of AI. METHOD: Pre-operative and post-operative
      echocardiograms of 93 HMI and 73 HMII patients who received implants at our
      center between January 2004 and September 2009 were retrospectively reviewed.
      After excluding patients with prior or concurrent surgical manipulation of the
      aortic valve, with baseline AI, or without baseline echoes, 67 HMI and 63 HMII
      patients were studied. AI was deemed significant if mild to moderate or greater. 
      Pathology reports were reviewed for 77 patients who underwent heart transplant.
      RESULTS: AI developed in 4 of 67 HMI (6.0%) and in 9 of 63 HMII patients (14.3%).
      The median times to AI development were 48 days for HMI patients and 90 days for 
      HMII patients. For patients who remained on device support at 6 and 12 months,
      freedom from AI was 94.5% and 88.9% in HMI patients and 83.6% and 75.2% in HMII
      patients (log rank p = 0.194). Aortic root diameters, as determined by
      echocardiography for the patients with AI, trended to be larger at baseline (3.43
      +/- 0.43 vs 3.15 +/- 0.40; p = 0.067) and follow-up (3.58 +/- 0.54 vs 3.29 +/-
      0.50; p = 0.130) compared with those who did not have AI. Aortic root
      circumferences were assessed directly by a pathologist in those patients who
      underwent transplant and were significantly larger in HMII patients who had
      developed AI compared with those patients who did not (8.44 +/- 0.89 vs 7.36 +/- 
      1.02 cm; p = 0.034). Lastly, AI was more common in patients whose aortic valve
      did not open (11 of 26 vs 1 of 14; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Aortic insufficiency
      occurs frequently in patients who receive continuous-flow support with a HMII
      LVAD, and may be associated with aortic root diameter enlargement and aortic
      valve opening. These findings warrant a more thorough preoperative patient
      evaluation and additional studies to investigate the factors, that may be
      associated with AI development.

TI  - Left ventricular assist device or heart transplantation: impact of transpulmonary
      gradient and pulmonary vascular resistance on decision making.
PG  - 310-6
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.05.031 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fixed pulmonary hypertension is a contraindication for heart
      transplantation. Left ventricular assist device support may lower it and bridge
      patients to heart transplantation. The aim of the study was to investigate the
      optimal parameters for treatment decisions and the time course of their potential
      reversal to normal values during preoperative inotropic support. METHODS: Mean
      pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary
      gradient were retrospectively analysed in 120 heart failure patients with severe 
      pulmonary hypertension (mean age 51.7 +/- 1.1 years, 93.3% males) treated between
      2000 and 2009 with inotropes before left ventricular assist device implantation. 
      The population was divided into three groups: patients with mean pulmonary
      arterial pressure > 25 mm Hg (group A, n = 113), patients with pulmonary vascular
      resistance > 2.5 Wood units (WU) (group B, n = 75) and patients with
      transpulmonary gradient > 12 mm Hg (group C, n = 55). Patients could be assigned 
      to more than one group. RESULTS: After 24h of inotropic support, pulmonary
      vascular resistance decreased (4.1 +/- 0.2 to 3 +/- 0.1, -25%, p<0.001), as did
      the transpulmonary gradient (17 +/- 0.5 to 14 +/- 0.7, -18%, p < 0.001). There
      was no significant decrease of mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Fifty percent of
      patients presented transpulmonary gradient < 12 mmHg on the 3rd day and pulmonary
      vascular resistance < 2.5 WU on the 4th day. No further changes were observed in 
      the following days. Left ventricular assist device support allowed 63 patients to
      be listed for heart transplantation and 40 received transplantation. A 30-day
      mortality after heart transplantation was higher in patients with fixed pulmonary
      hypertension, despite inotropes, than in those with reversible hypertension in
      groups B and C (12.5% and 11.1% vs 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Transpulmonary
      gradient and pulmonary vascular resistance, but not mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure, are predictive parameters for successful heart transplantation in cases
      of severe postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. When no significant decrease in
      pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient after 3-4 days of
      pharmacological therapy is observed, mechanical circulatory support is the only
      option to bridge end-stage heart failure patients to heart transplantation.
      Survival after heart transplantation is strictly related to the reversibility of 
      pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient before assist
      implantation, but not related to mean pulmonary artery pressure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the remarkable advances with the use of ventricular assist
      devices (VAD) in adults, pneumatic pulsatile support in children is still
      limited. We report a retrospective review of our experience in very small
      children (<10 kg of body weight). METHODS: Ten consecutive children weighing less
      than 10 kg were offered mechanical support with Berlin Heart (Berlin Heart AG,
      Berlin, Germany) as a bridge to heart transplant from March 2002 to March 2010.
      RESULTS: The median patient age was 10.4 months (38 days to 2.2 years). The
      median patient weight was 6.4 kg (2.9 to 10 kg). Prior to VAD implantation, all
      children were managed by multiple intravenous inotropes and mechanical
      ventilation (8) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (2). The median pre-VAD
      pulmonary vascular resistance index was 5.7 Woods units/m(2). Three patients
      required biventricular mechanical support, but in all other cases a single left
      VAD proved sufficient. The median duration of VAD support was 61 days (2 to 168
      days). Four deaths occurred; from stroke in three and sepsis in one. Five
      patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median
      duration of mechanical support of 89 days (37 to 168 days) and another is still
      waiting a suitable organ after 77 days of VAD support. There were no
      complications related to postoperative bleeding. Five patients required at least 
      one pump change. Of 5 patients undergoing heart transplant, 3 developed an
      extremely elevated (>60%) panel reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay, confirmed by Luminex (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX). All 3 experienced at
      least one acute episode of rejection in the first month after heart transplant,
      needing plasmapheresis. The survival rate after heart transplantation was 100%
      with a median follow-up of 7.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in very
      small children with end-stage heart failure is an effective strategy of bridge to
      heart transplantation with a reasonable mortality rate. The high rate of
      complications suggests to optimize indications and timing of VAD implantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Levitronix CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, Mass) ventricular
      assist system is designed for temporary left, right, or biventricular support.
      Advantages include ease of use, excellent reliability, and low thrombosis risk,. 
      which may allow wider application of short-term support and improved outcomes in 
      patients with cardiogenic shock. This multi-institutional study evaluated safety,
      effectiveness, and outcomes of the CentriMag in patients with cardiogenic shock. 
      METHODS: Thirty-eight patients were supported at 7 centers. Patients included 12 
      after cardiotomy, 14 after myocardial infarction, and 12 with right ventricular
      failure after implantable left ventricular assist device placement. Devices were 
      implanted in left (n = 8), right (n = 12), or biventricular (n = 18)
      configuration. Support was continued until recovery, transplantation, or
      implantation of long-term ventricular assist device. RESULTS: Mean support
      duration for the entire cohort (n = 38) was 13 days (1-60 days), with 47% of
      patients (18/38) surviving 30 days after device removal. Mean CentriMag
      biventricular support (n = 18) duration was 15 days (1-60 days), with 44% (8/18) 
      surviving at 30 days. Mean CentriMag right ventricular support with a
      commercially available left ventricular assist device (n = 12) duration was 14
      days (1-29 days), with 58% (7/12) surviving at 30 days. Complications included
      bleeding (21%), infection (5%), respiratory failure (3%), hemolysis (5%), and
      neurologic dysfunction (11%). There were no CentriMag or pump failures.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, the CentriMag provided short-term support
      for patients with cardiogenic shock with a low incidence of device-related
      complications and no device failures.

AB  - Recent advances in heart failure therapy include a variety of mechanical and
      device-based technologies that target structural aspects of heart failure that
      cannot be treated with drug therapy alone; these newer therapies can collectively
      be described as interventional heart failure therapy. This article is the second 
      in a 2-part series reviewing interventional heart failure therapy. Interventions 
      included in this discussion include those indicated for the treatment of
      end-stage refractory heart failure, including interventional medical therapy,
      interventional treatment of valvular disease, mechanical assist devices, and
      heart transplantation. Also included is a review of the currently available
      catheter-based pumps, which are intended to provide temporary support in patients
      with acute hemodynamic compromise. The use of cellular or stem cell therapy for
      the treatment of heart failure is an emerging interventional therapy and data
      supporting its use for the treatment heart failure will also be presented, as
      will a discussion of the role of palliative care and self-care in heart failure
      therapy.

AB  - Mechanical ventricular assistance has become a reliable tool for the support of
      children and infants with heart failure. The devices have shown efficacy both as 
      a bridge to transplantation and as a bridge to recovery. The potential
      complications that may occur with long-term support have not been fully
      described. This article reports the occurrence of a large pseudoaneurysm
      associated with the ascending aorta following explantation of the EXCOR Pediatric
      ventricular assist device. A management strategy for this potentially lethal
      complication is described.

      circulatory support.
PG  - 981-8
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.04.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide effective treatment for
      end-stage heart failure; however, most patients experience > or =1 major adverse 
      events (AEs) while on VAD support. Although early, non-fatal AEs may increase the
      risk of later death during VAD support, this relationship has not been
      established. Therefore, we sought to determine the impact on 1-year mortality of 
      AEs occurring during the first 60 days of VAD support. METHODS: A retrospective
      analysis was performed using prospectively collected data from a single-site
      database for patients aged > or =18 years receiving left ventricular or
      biventricular support during 1996 to 2008 and who survived >60 days on VAD
      support. Fourteen major classes of AEs occurring during this 60-day period were
      examined. One-year survival rates of patients with and without each major AE were
      compared. RESULTS: The study included 163 patients (80% men; mean age, 49.5
      years), of whom 87% were European American, 72% had left ventricular support, and
      83% were bridge to transplant. The occurrence of renal failure, respiratory
      failure, bleeding events, and reoperations during the first 60 days after
      implantation significantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality. After
      controlling for gender, age, VAD type, and intention to treat, renal failure was 
      the only major AE significantly associated with later mortality (hazard ratio,
      2.96; p = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Specific AEs, including renal failure, respiratory 
      and bleeding events, and reoperations, significantly decrease longer-term
      survival. Renal failure conferred a 3-fold increased risk of 1-year mortality.
      Peri-operative management should focus on strategies to mitigate risk for renal
      failure in order to maximize later outcomes.

AB  - Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that a heterogeneous group of
      bone-marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells, with variations in phenotype
      and function, provide an endogenous repair mechanism, contributing to vascular
      healing and remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions, such as
      cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and end-stage heart failure.
      Implantation of ventricular assist devices (VADs) for circulatory support is
      indicated in selected patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart 
      transplantation, however seldom; improvement of ventricular contractility has
      been well documented with prolonged cardiac unloading. The current review
      summarizes recent findings from in vitro and in vivo studies, focusing on the
      biological features and the possible role of progenitor cells in the transient
      myocardial recovery, occasionally seen after VAD implantation, and speculates on 
      their clinical utilities for the treatment of the failing human heart.

AB  - Timing of therapy and selection of patients in the use of ventricular assist
      devices (VADs) can be difficult. In general, consideration for VAD implantation
      is appropriate in patients with endstage heart failure who are failing optimal
      medical therapy and in whom no alternative traditional surgical treatment options
      are available. However, identifying when a particular patient has reached this
      point is not always straightforward. There are a broad range of medical and
      surgical therapies for patients with overt heart failure, and this armamentarium 
      is constantly expanding. The risks, benefits, and expected outcomes with VAD
      therapy have also undergone dramatic changes over the last decade. Advances in
      technology have led to a proliferation of newer generation devices that are
      smaller, lighter, easier to implant, and more reliable than previous generation
      devices. This, in turn, has led to a markedly improved risk-benefit ratio, with
      increased durability and reduced morbidity. The indications for the implantation 
      of ventricular assist devices have also evolved over the last several years, and 
      specific patient presentations and goals of therapy have led to specific
      indications. Device therapy has traditionally been classified as bridge to
      recovery, bridge to transplantation, and destination therapy. However, such
      designations may not be well defined at the time of implantation, and recovery
      and response following initiation of VAD support may allow patients to change
      from one classification to another. The current data regarding indications and
      timing of device implantation are reviewed.

AB  - Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is valuable in saving the lives of patients 
      with severe cardiogenic shock. However, their survival is limited if multiorgan
      failure (MOF) proves to be irreversible. Although ventricular assist devices
      (VADs) have been shown to reverse end-organ failure in some patients, the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of end-organ failure and its regression are not
      fully understood, and clinical markers and thresholds for the "point of no
      return" are lacking. We investigated predictors of 30-day survival in patients
      supported with a biventricular assist device (BVAD). We studied 157 patients
      implanted with a Berlin Heart EXCOR BVAD between 1987 and 2006. Children younger 
      than 10 years and cases with postcardiotomy syndrome and transplant failure were 
      excluded from the analysis as well as patients with technical or bleeding
      problems requiring rethoracotomy. In total, 69 clinical, hemodynamic,
      echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Most of the patients
      suffered from ischemic cardiomyopathy or acute myocardial infarction. In
      addition, the preoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and the
      sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated. The patients
      were divided into two groups regarding procedural success: group I-survival >30
      days or heart transplantation or weaning from device (n = 105) and group II-death
      on system <30 days after surgery (n = 52). The 30-day procedural success rate was
      67%. The patients in group I had higher systolic blood pressure (96.7 vs. 90.1 mm
      Hg, p = 0.027), lower serum creatinine (1.96 vs. 2.4 mg/dl, p = 0.001), and
      higher arterial pH (7.43 vs. 7.37, p = 0.02). The multivariate analysis
      recognized age, body temperature, systolic blood pressure, MODS score, and higher
      arterial pH as significant predictors for 30-day mortality. Standard markers for 
      severity of cardiogenic shock and MOF do not predict survival on BVAD. As
      expected, older patients are at higher risk for death on BVAD. Acidosis and high 
      MODS score predict unfavorable outcome. However, the prediction of clinical
      outcome in patients in severe cardiogenic shock supported by BVAD is possible in 
      extreme situations only.

AB  - Most infants and children implanted with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) 
      are bridged to cardiac transplantation. Prioritizing recovery may decrease this
      trend. Patients were treated with LVAD ventricular decompression, medical heart
      failure therapy, and bolus therapy with a beta-agonist before weaning trials.
      Devices were removed if adequate function was observed. Eleven patients with a
      mean age of 1.7 years presented for LVAD implantation. The mean Z score for left 
      ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was +5.5 (+1.6 to +7.3), and the mean 
      fractional shortening was 9% (5%-14%). They were on maximal medical therapy and
      inotropic support. Duration of device support ranged from 6 to 22 days (mean: 13 
      days). There were three deaths, one from preimplant anoxic brain damage and two
      from thromboembolism. Eight patients (73%) recovered, were explanted, and are
      alive 0.6-6 years with hearts that have a mean Z score for LVEDD of 1.0
      (0.09-3.7) and fractional shortening of 23%-36%. Left ventricular assist device
      decompression of dilated left ventricles in infants and children led to long-term
      survival in 73%. Ventricular size was significantly reduced and contractility
      significantly increased. None of these patients required transplantation.

      pulsatile pediatric ventricular assist device.

AB  - Because of the shortage of organs for transplant in pediatric patients with
      end-stage heart failure, Penn State is developing a pneumatically driven 12 cc
      pulsatile pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD). A major concern is the flow
      field changes related to the volume decrease and its effect on device
      thrombogenicity. Previous studies of similar devices have shown that changes in
      the orientation of the inlet valve can lead to improvement in the flow field.
      Herein, the fluid dynamic effects of orientation changes at both the inlet and
      outlet valves are studied. Using two-dimensional particle image velocimetry, we
      examine the flow field in vitro using an acrylic model of the PVAD in a mock
      circulatory loop. Regardless of valve orientation, the overall flow pattern
      inside the PVAD remains similar, but important differences were seen locally in
      the wall shear rates, which is notable because shear rates >500 s may prevent
      thrombus formation. As the inlet valve was rotated toward the fluid side of the
      PVAD, we observed an increase in inlet jet velocity and wall shear rates along
      the inlet port wall. A corresponding rotation of the outlet valve increases the
      wall shear rate along the outer wall near the device outlet. Wall shear rates
      were all higher when both valves were rotated toward the fluid side of the
      device, with the best rates found at orientations of +15 degrees for both the
      inlet and outlet valves. Overall, orientations of +15 degrees or +30 degrees of
      both the inlet and outlet valve resulted in an increase in wall shear rates and
      could aid in the reduction of thrombus formation inside the PVAD.

AB  - The ventricular assist device (VAD) Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatrics was utilized at
      our institution since 2004 for bridging pediatric patients to cardiac
      transplantation or myocardial recovery. The present study reviewed our results
      following VAD implantation. We retrospectively reviewed patients that underwent
      implantation of a VAD between October 2004 and October 2008. Data collected
      included age at implantation, gender, weight, underlying disease, pre- and
      postdevice clinical status, complications, and outcome. Fifteen patients were
      identified (9 female and 6 male, average age: 8.8 years, range 0.3-14.8; average 
      weight 31.1 kg, range 5.2-86.4). Indications for VAD support were dilated
      cardiomyopathy in 14 patients and progressing heart failure with a single
      ventricle physiology (bidirectional Glenn shunt) in one patient. Three patients
      (20%) were bridged from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to VAD. Average
      support was 29 (1-108) days. Fourteen patients were on a bi-VAD, one patient
      (single ventricle) had single VAD support. Three patients developed
      mediastinal/pericardial fluid collections, requiring surgical exploration in two,
      and drain insertion in one. Three patients presented with neurological symptoms. 
      In two patients, a total of three blood pumps were exchanged due to thrombus
      formation. No patient was weaned off the VAD; two patients (13%) died on the VAD.
      All surviving patients are neurologically intact at follow-up. In our experience,
      VAD support provides an effective means of bridging children with advanced
      dilated cardiomyopathy or heart failure to transplantation with a relatively
      small number of complications and deaths given the complexity of the patient
      population.

AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has long been the sole means of
      mechanical support for pediatric patients with end-stage cardiac failure, but has
      a high waitlist mortality and a reported survival to hospital discharge of less
      than 50%. The purpose of this study was to compare waitlist mortality and
      survival for ECMO versus ventricular assist device (VAD) support. A review was
      conducted of all patients listed for heart transplantation (HTx) since 2002 and
      requiring mechanical support. VAD support has been available from 2004 (Berlin
      Heart Excor Pediatrics). Competing risks analysis was used to model survival to
      one of four outcomes (HTx, death on waitlist, delisting, improvement). Thirty-six
      patients were on mechanical support while awaiting HTx (21 ECMO, 12 VAD, three
      both). Median age at listing was 1.2 years (birth-16.6 years) for ECMO and 11.3
      years (0.3-14.6 years) for VAD. Diagnosis was cardiomyopathy in 33% for ECMO and 
      93% for VAD. Median time to HTx was 37 days (1-930) overall, 20 days (1-85) for
      ECMO, and 39 days (5-108) for VAD. Mechanical support was associated with
      increased odds of HTx (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [1.7-3.3], P < 0.0001) but also
      delisting or death waiting (HR 3.0 [1.1-7.8], P = 0.03). Waitlist mortality of
      38% on ECMO was reduced to 13% with VAD use. Survival post-HTx to hospital
      discharge was better in the group on VAD support (92 vs. 80%). Pediatric patients
      requiring mechanical support as a bridge to HTx have short wait times but high
      waitlist mortality. Those patients who survived to be put on the Berlin Heart
      Excor Pediatric device based on individualized clinical decision making then had 
      a lower waitlist mortality, a longer duration of support, and a higher survival
      to transplantation and hospital discharge.

AB  - In many adult cardiac programs, intracorporeal mechanical circulatory support has
      become a routine treatment for end-stage cardiac failure. For the pediatric
      population, options are often limited by a small body habitus. Even when an
      adolescent's weight may suggest adequate space for device implant, most
      intracorporeal adult devices remain too large for adolescents. The Thoratec
      HeartMate II (HM II) (approved by the FDA in April of 2008) is a small, noiseless
      device that is easily operated and monitored. By having an uncomplicated
      operating system and small percutaneous drive line, the HM II provides an
      opportunity for these patients to aggressively rehabilitate to become a better
      transplant candidate and also provides the potential to be discharged home. The
      two youngest patients ever to utilize the HM II are also the first two cases of
      using the HM II at a freestanding pediatric hospital. A 12-year-old, 53 kg, girl 
      with dilated cardiomyopathy was supported for 85 days before receiving her heart 
      transplant. The second patient, a 13-year-old, 149 kg, Hispanic male suffering
      from morbid obesity and dilated cardiomyopathy, was supported for 128 days. The
      HM II allowed for rehabilitation and nutritional education, resulting in this
      patient losing 50 kg before heart transplant. Despite both of these patients'
      size, their thoracic cavities were that of a preadolescent and thus techniques
      were developed to avoid morbidities like chest wall abrasion and bleeding.
      Because of differences between adult and pediatric patients and institutions,
      these cases provided unique challenges. However, as pediatric device therapy is
      now maturing, pediatric programs such as Texas Children's Hospital have begun to 
      develop strategies for mechanical support that factor in patient's size and need 
      for long-term or temporary support, utilizing the growing number of devices
      (i.e., Jostra Rotoflow, Tandem Heart PTVA, Thoratec CentriMag, Berlin Heart
      EXCOR, etc.) that are now available to children.

TI  - Dyssynchrony by speckle-tracking echocardiography and response to cardiac
      resynchronization therapy: results of the Speckle Tracking and Resynchronization 
      (STAR) study.
PG  - 1690-700
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehq213 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The Speckle Tracking and Resynchronization (STAR) study used a prospective 
      multi-centre design to test the hypothesis that speckle-tracking echocardiography
      can predict response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We studied 132 consecutive CRT patients with class III and IV heart
      failure, ejection fraction (EF) < or =35%, and QRS > or =120 ms from three
      international centres. Baseline dyssynchrony was evaluated by four speckle
      tracking strain methods; radial, circumferential, transverse, and longitudinal (>
      or =130 ms opposing wall delay for each). Pre-specified outcome variables were EF
      response and three serious long-term events: death, transplant, or left
      ventricular assist device. Of 120 patients (91%) with baseline dyssynchrony data,
      both short-axis radial strain and transverse strain from apical views were
      associated with favourable EF response 7 +/- 4 months and long-term outcome over 
      3.5 years (P < 0.01). Radial strain had the highest sensitivity at 86% for
      predicting EF response with a specificity of 67%. Serious long-term unfavourable 
      events occurred in 20 patients after CRT, and happened three times more
      frequently in those who lacked baseline radial or transverse dyssynchrony than in
      patients with dyssynchrony (P < 0.01). Patients who lacked both radial and
      transverse dyssynchrony had unfavourable clinical events occur in 53%, in
      contrast to events occurring in 12% if baseline dyssynchrony was present (P <
      0.01). Circumferential and longitudinal strains predicted response when
      dyssynchrony was detected, but failed to identify dyssynchrony in one-third of
      patients who responded to CRT. CONCLUSION: Dyssynchrony by speckle-tracking
      echocardiography using radial and transverse strains is associated with EF
      response and long-term outcome following CRT.

TI  - Total artificial heart and physical therapy management.
PG  - 13-21
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the total artificial heart (TAH) device as a bridge to heart
      transplantation (BTT), and related physical therapy management, while comparisons
      to left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are made. SUMMARY: The SynCardia
      CardioWest Temporary TAH System is the only TAH approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA), Health Canada and Consultants Europe (CE) for BTT.
      CardioWest implantation involves cardiectomy thus avoiding pulmonary
      hypertension, right heart failure, inotropic or anti-arrhythmic agents,
      myocardial and valve related problems. CardioWest has a fixed beat rate and
      cardiac output is dependent upon venous return and preload. Both TAH and LVADs
      are adaptive with exercise, increasing cardiac output during activities, allowing
      for conditioning to occur peripherally. Left ventricular assist devices have
      portable drivers permitting discharge home, while the CardioWest's large driver
      console necessitates inpatient therapy. Exercise progression, positioning, and
      monitoring of exercise intolerance are similar with LVAD and TAH. Ventricular
      fill volumes in TAH dictate cardiac output and require close attention.
      Cardiectomy in TAH prevents electrocardiography, telemetry, and native pulse rate
      monitoring. CONCLUSION: While mechanical differences exist between TAH and LVAD, 
      physical therapists can provide evidence-based treatment for patients with TAH
      using previously established guidelines for patients with heart failure and
      mechanical circulatory support.

TI  - Physiologic benefits of pulsatile perfusion during mechanical circulatory support
      for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure in adults.
PG  - 529-36
LID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2010.00996.x [doi]
AB  - A growing population experiencing heart failure (100,000 patients/year), combined
      with a shortage of donor organs (less than 2200 hearts/year), has led to
      increased and expanded use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices. MCS
      devices have successfully improved clinical outcomes, which are comparable with
      heart transplantation and result in better 1-year survival than optimal medical
      management therapies. The quality of perfusion provided during MCS therapy may
      play an important role in patient outcomes. Despite demonstrated physiologic
      benefits of pulsatile perfusion, continued use or development of pulsatile MCS
      devices has been widely abandoned in favor of continuous flow pumps owing to the 
      large size and adverse risks events in the former class, which pose issues of
      thrombogenic surfaces, percutaneous lead infection, and durability.
      Next-generation MCS device development should ideally implement designs that
      offer the benefits of rotary pump technology while providing the physiologic
      benefits of pulsatile end-organ perfusion.

TI  - Mechanical circulatory support in patients of advanced age.
PG  - 990-4
LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfq076 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In recent years, non-pulsatile assist devices have been increasingly used
      for long-term circulatory support. However, it remains to be established whether 
      pulsatile and non-pulsatile systems can ensure a similarly low rate of
      complications for extended periods of time in elderly patients. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Of 174 patients implanted between June 1991 and January 2009 [mean age: 
      65 +/- 3.7 (60-80) years], 64 were on pulsatile (39 Berlin Heart EXCOR, 18
      Novacor, 4 LionHeart, and 3 HeartMate I) and 110 on non-pulsatile assist devices 
      (65 Berlin Heart INCOR, 18 DeBakey, 14 HeartMate II, 7 DuraHeart, and 6
      Jarvik2000). In the pulsatile group, the mean support time was 157 +/- 343
      (1-1836) days, and in the non-pulsatile group 281 +/- 336 (1-1619) days (P <
      0.05). The 1-year survival was 15% in the pulsatile group and 36% in the
      non-pulsatile group, and 2-year survival was 12 and 26%, respectively (P < 0.05).
      In the pulsatile group, 11 patients (17%) were supported for >6 months, 7
      patients (11%) for >1 year, and 3 patients (5%) for >2 years, and 3 patients
      underwent heart transplantation, 3 were weaned, and 3 still have a device. In the
      non-pulsatile group, 46 patients (42%) were supported for >6 months, 34 (28%) for
      >1 year, and 14 (13%) for >2 years, and 17 patients are still on support, 9
      underwent transplantation, and 3 were weaned. CONCLUSION: Although both types of 
      device can be used for extended periods of time, non-pulsatile systems have a
      significantly higher survival rate in elderly patients. They allow elderly
      patients additional years of life in their familiar environment.
