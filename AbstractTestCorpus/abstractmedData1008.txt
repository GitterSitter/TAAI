While relatively uncommon, fungal infections present aserious concern given a high association with adverse events including death. We sought to further characterize the epidemiology of fungemias during LVAD support.METHODS: Retrospective review of 292 patients receiving LVAD support from October1996 to April 2009 at the University of Michigan Health System was done.RESULTS: Seven cases of LVAD-associated fungemia were observed during the studyperiod (0.1 infections/1000 days of device support). Five patients had infection with Candida species and two with Aspergillus species. The two patients withAspergillus infection presented with disseminated disease, quickly dying ofmultiorgan failure, and sepsis. All five patients with Candida infections weresuccessfully treated with systemic antifungal therapy along with transplantation in four of five patients. The fifth patient is receiving mechanical support asdestination therapy. He remains on long-term suppression with high-dosefluconazole.CONCLUSIONS: Fungal infections appear to be a rare but serious complication ofLVAD support. Future studies should aim to improve our understanding of riskfactors for fungal infection during mechanical support, especially disseminatedAspergillus. Short-term perioperative antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazoleappears to be an effective and reasonable approach to prevention.
