We used the Medos ventricular assist devicecannula (Medos, Aachen, Germany) and a centrifugal pump to support pediatricpatients with dilated cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. FromJanuary 2007 to December 2008, three pediatric patients with dilatedcardiomyopathy were supported using a centrifugal pump as the left ventricularassist device. The Medos arterial cannula was sutured to the ascending aorta, andthe Apex cannula was fixed into the left ventricular apex. When the patient wasweaned off of cardiopulmonary bypass, the left ventricular assist device pump wasstarted. The pump flow was gradually titrated according to the filling status of the left ventricle. All the left ventricular assist devices were successfullyimplanted and functioned well. Two patients on extracorporeal membraneoxygenation had severe lung edema before left ventricular assist deviceimplantation. Both patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the postoperative period until the pulmonary edema was resolved. Among the threepatients, two successfully bridged to heart transplantation after support for 6and 11 days, respectively. The first patient (10 kg) expired due to systemicemboli 30 days after left ventricular assist device support. In summary, theseresults suggest that the Medos ventricular assist device cannula and acentrifugal pump is an option for temporary left ventricular assist devicesupport in patients with intractable heart failure and as a bridge to hearttransplantation.
