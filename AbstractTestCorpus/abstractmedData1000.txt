This single-center study investigatedoutcomes of elective versus emergent implementation of permanent MCS in theelderly.METHODS: Between January 1, 2006 and April 1, 2009, 31 patients, >65 years ofage, were supported with a ventricular assist device (VAD), intended forpermanent support, at our institution. The 28 left VAD (LVAD) recipients weredivided into two groups: a survival group, n = 13 (ongoing MCS at 180 days orweaned); and a non-survival group, n = 15 (death on device within 180 days). Inaddition, the survival rate of LVAD recipients according to pre-operativeINTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support)status was analyzed.RESULTS: The cumulative survival rates for the LVAD patients were 75% at 30 days,46% at 180 days and 39% at 1 year after VAD implantation. The cumulative survivalrates at 30 days, 180 days and 1 year were 71%, 47% and 35% for INTERMACS Level Ito III (n = 17) patients vs 81%, 45% and 45% for INTERMACS Level IV to V (n = 11)patients (p = 0.9), respectively. Median age of LVAD recipients was 69 (range 66 to 80) years; 4 were women. Median support time was 565 (range 228 to 1,257)days. In 9 recipients support is ongoing. Both complications profiles and causes of death are reported.CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that permanent MCS may be successful inhighly selected elderly patients with terminal heart failure, especially whenelective implantation is performed before development of inotropic dependency or cardiogenic shock. However, outcomes at 12 months in this selective elderlypopulation remain uniformly poor.Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
