We aimed to summarize thecurrent evidence on outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007 to December 2013, supplemented with manual review. Three reviewers independently assessed each study for saliency on patient-centered outcomes. Data weresummarized in tabular form. Overall study characteristics encouraged inclusion ofall indications (destination therapy and bridge to transplant) and preventedmeta-analysis. The electronic search identified 465 abstracts, of which 50 metinclusion criteria; manual review added 2 articles in press. The articlesincluded 10 industry-funded trials and registries, 10 multicenter reports, andthe remainder single-center observational experiences. Estimated actuarialsurvival after continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ranged from 56% to87% at 1 year, 43% to 84% at 2 years, and 47% at 4 years. Improvements infunctional class and quality of life were reported, but missing data complicated interpretation. Adverse events were experienced by the majority of patients, but estimates for bleeding, stroke, infection, right heart failure, arrhythmias, and rehospitalizations varied greatly.CONCLUSIONS: The totality of data for continuous-flow left ventricular assistdevices show consistent improvements in survival and quality of lifecounterbalanced by a range of common complications. Although this summary should provide a practical resource for healthcare provider-led discussions withpatients, it highlights the critical need for high-quality patient-centered data collected with standard definitions.Â© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.PMCID: PMC4241134 [Available on 2015-11-01]
