Anthracyclines and newer targetedtherapies, including trastuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are importantagents implemented in clinical practice that carry cardiotoxic risk. While acute heart failure is often self-limited and reversible, delayed-onset heart failuresignificantly reduces survival. Extremes of age, renal dysfunction, pre-existing coronary artery disease, HER2 positivity, and multi-drug therapy are predictorsof irreversible heart failure after chemotherapy. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and cardiac transplantation can be performed safely inpatients with end-stage heart failure (HF) from chemotherapy. However,co-existing right ventricular dysfunction, hepatic congestion, and increased riskof bleeding make LVAD therapy challenging and dependent on careful patientselection. Cardiac transplantation in patients with chemotherapy-induced heartfailure can be performed with good 10-year survival, but requires 5Â years ofcancer freedom and post-transplant infections remain a problem. Improvements inLVAD therapy and the expanding role of the total artificial heart and otherdurable biventricular support devices will likely provide more reliable surgical options for the management of end-stage HF after chemotherapy.
