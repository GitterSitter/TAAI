Epub 2009 Dec 31.Duration of left ventricular assist device support: Effects on abnormal calciumcycling and functional recovery in the failing human heart.Ogletree ML(1), Sweet WE, Talerico C, Klecka ME, Young JB, Smedira NG, StarlingRC, Moravec CS.Author information: (1)Kaufman Center for Heart Failure, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195,USA.BACKGROUND: Intracellular Ca(2+) handling is abnormal in human heart failure.Studies have demonstrated that left ventricular assist device (LVAD) supportreverses phenotypic alterations, suggesting that, in select patients, LVADsupport may be a bridge to recovery. Few studies have related support duration tophenotypic recovery. We hypothesized that reversal of impaired sarcoendoplasmicreticulum (SR) Ca(2+) cycling following LVAD implantation is duration-dependent.METHODS: We used post-rest potentiation to assess SR function, and Western blotanalysis to measure Ca(2+)-cycling proteins. Left ventricular tissue from 10non-failing hearts, 8 failing hearts and 10 LVAD-supported hearts was analyzed.Support ranged from 7 to 334 days. The median duration, 115 days, dividedpatients into short- and long-term support groups.RESULTS: Post-rest potentiation (PRP) response recovered after short-term LVADsupport to a level (116.8 +/- 12.1%; n = 5) close to non-failing (123.4 +/-12.0%; n = 10) hearts, but recovery after long-term support (23.5 +/- 7.0%; n =5) remained closer to that of failing hearts (13.5 +/- 5.6%). We found a similar pattern of normalization for SR Ca(2+)-ATPase protein and the phospholamban/SRCa(2+)-ATPase ratio (non-failing: 0.66 +/- 0.11; failing: 1.21 +/- 0.23;short-duration LVAD: 0.68 +/- 0.14; long-duration LVAD: 1.67 +/- 0.30;correlation p < 0.001; r = 0.93). The ratio also tended to correlate with the PRPresponse after unloading (p = 0.05; r = -0.65).CONCLUSIONS: SR Ca(2+) handling improved during early LVAD support, but long-termsupport was associated with abnormal Ca(2+) cycling. These findings cast doubt onstrategies designed to wean patients after complete unloading with an LVAD.Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
