TheLevitronix CentriMag system (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) offersexpanded options for short-term support for this population. We report ourexperience with the successful use of the CentriMag in the pediatric populationas a bridge to decision after postcardiotomy ventricular failure and as a bridge to recovery after heart transplantation. The first patient was bridged to along-term HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation) as a bridge to potential recovery. The second patient was supported after severe graft failure post hearttransplantation, with a full recovery. The Levitronix CentriMag has proven to be a versatile, safe, and effective short-term circulatory support system for ourpediatric patients.
