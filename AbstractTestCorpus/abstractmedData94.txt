Case study.Religa G(1), JasiÅ„ska M(2), CzyÅ¼ewski Å?(2), Torba K(2), RÃ³Å¼aÅ„ski J(1).Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, Institute of Cardiology,Warsaw, Poland. (2)Department of Anaesthesiology, Institute of Cardiology,Warsaw, Poland.BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments forend-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right timebefore the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance forsurvival and prolong life.CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient with heart failure in dilatativecardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood circulatory support andextracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO), followed by a 13-dayimplantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa Heart EXT, was used as abridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT,the patient was discharged home with stable function of the circulatory system.We describe our experiences with the qualification, preparation, and procedure ofsequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save thepatient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricularafterload. The experimental implantation of an innovative Religa Heart EXTprosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. Too short timeof Religa Heart EXT implantation in the discussed patient prevented thepossibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications andinfections compared to the documented complications of POLVAD implanted untilnow. OHT is a safe and efficacious method of treatment of patients previouslysupported by ECMO and Religa Heart EXT.: 25333376  [pubmed - as supplied by publisher]95. ann transplant. 2014 oct 21;19:537-40. doi: 10.12659/aot.891266.the effect of the sequential therapy in end-stage heart failure (eshf)--fromecmo, through the use of implantable pump for a pneumatic heart assist system,religa heart ext, as a bridge for orthotopic heart transplant (oht). case study.religa g(1), jasiå„ska m(2), czyå¼ewski å?(2), torba k(2), rã³å¼aå„ski j(1).author information: (1)department of cardiac surgery and transplantation, institute of cardiology,warsaw, poland.
