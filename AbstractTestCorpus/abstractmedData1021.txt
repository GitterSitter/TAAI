LVADs may be used asa bridge to recovery, a bridge to transplantation or as destination therapy.Although the morbidity rate of individuals on device support remains high,experience suggests that patients who are discharged home have satisfactoryoutcomes during support and following heart transplantation.METHODS: A retrospective review of 24 patients implanted with an LVAD betweenOctober 2001 and December 2006 was performed. Nineteen patients received a deviceas a bridge to transplantation and five received a device as destination therapy.Postoperative follow-up was performed routinely in the heart function/LVAD clinicat the Toronto General Hospital (Toronto, Ontario) and all adverse events wererecorded.RESULTS: The majority of patients were men, with a mean age of 44 years and adiagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (62%). Seventeen patients (71%) weredischarged home on support; one died, 14 were transplanted, one was explanted andone patient remains on support in the community. Post-transplant survival was 93%in patients discharged home compared with 40% transplanted during their hospital stay. Outpatients spent 56% of their overall support time at home, with only 12readmissions totalling 120 patient days.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD patients can be safely managed in the community. Patients whoare discharged home experience better outcomes in both pre- and post-transplantsurvival. Successful outpatient management provides a strong foundation for theestablishment of destination therapy within mechanical circulatory supportprograms in Canada.PMCID: PMC2776567
