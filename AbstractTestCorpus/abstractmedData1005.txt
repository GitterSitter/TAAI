There are currentlyvarious LVAD systems available based on different types of pump technology. Wepresent the VentrAssist LVAD, a centrifugal pump, and focus on a surgicalimplantation technique that may help reduce the complications typicallyassociated with VAD surgery.METHODS AND RESULTS: 412 patients underwent VentrAssist LVAD implantation betweenJune 2003 and January 2009 worldwide. The overall rate of success was 81 % (i.e.,ongoing, HTX, or recovery). Interestingly hemolysis is greatly reduced with this intracorporeal centrifugal LVAD compared to other VAD systems with other pumpdesigns. Our surgical implantation technique and strategy may contribute toreducing complications.CONCLUSION: The VentrAssist is a powerful and effective LVAD; its use canconsiderably reduce hemolysis. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determinewhether the VentrAssist is appropriate as a bridge to transplant as well asfeasible for long-term application.(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York.
