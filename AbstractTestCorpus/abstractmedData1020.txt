Epub 2009 Aug 19.Leptin signaling in the failing and mechanically unloaded human heart.McGaffin KR(1), Moravec CS, McTiernan CF.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh,PA, USA. mcgaffinkr@upmc.eduComment in    Circ Heart Fail. 2010 May;3(3):e12; author reply e16.BACKGROUND: Increased circulating leptin is present in human heart failure, andleptin deficiency is linked to worse outcomes in chronic ischemic injury. In the present observational study, we tested the hypothesis that cardiac leptinproduction and signaling are increased in the failing human heart, and thatmechanical unloading with a ventricular assist device (VAD) reverses thesechanges.METHODS AND RESULTS: All studies were performed using human cardiac tissueobtained from (1) hearts not matched for transplantation (nonfailing), (2) at thetime of cardiac transplant (failing), or (3) paired samples at the time of VADimplant (pre-VAD) and removal (post-VAD). The expression of brain natureticpeptide, leptin, leptin receptor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA wasmeasured, and the protein expression of leptin and its receptor was examined byWestern blot and immunofluorescent staining of cardiac sections. The assessmentof leptin signaling was performed by measuring the phosphorylation state of theleptin receptor. The phosphorylation state of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and AMP-activated kinase proteins were also measured. All dataare expressed as mean+/-SEM with a statistical significance in failing relativeto nonfailing groups determined by Student independent t test, and thesignificance between pre- and post-VAD groups determined by paired t test. Infailing human hearts, the mRNA expressions of leptin and its receptor wereincreased 5.4+/-0.3-fold (P<0.05) and 4.5+/-0.3-fold (P<0.05), respectively, withsimilar changes in protein. The phosphorylation state of both the leptin receptorand signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 proteins were increased1.4+/-0.1-fold (P<0.05), and the level of phosphorylated AMP-activated kinaseprotein was increased 1.9+/-0.2-fold (P<0.05). Mechanical unloading of thefailing human heart with a VAD resulted in no change in tumor necrosis factoralpha expression but a marked decrease in leptin production to 1.7+/-0.1%(P<0.05) and leptin receptor expression to 3.0+/-0.2% (P<0.05) of pre-VAD levels.Phosphorylation of the leptin receptor, signal transducer and activator oftranscription-3, and AMP-activated kinase were also decreased to 45+/-7%,75+/-8%, and 58+/-8% of pre-VAD values, respectively (P<0.05 for all values).CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the failing human heart increasesexpression of leptin and its receptor and that mechanical unloading downregulatesthis increase. Further, a cardioprotective role for leptin in the failing humanheart is suggested through the activation of signal transducer and activator oftranscription-3 and AMP-activated kinase signaling.PMCID: PMC2780432
