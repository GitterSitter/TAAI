Initially designed as atemporary support to allow ventricular recovery or as a bridge for patients tocardiac transplantation, these devices are now being used as a permanent form of "destination" therapy. Improvements in technological design, durability, andmedical management have allowed individuals with VADs to be managed in theircommunities. Although these devices provide excellent hemodynamic support andenhance patient functional status, discharged individuals face many uniquechallenges. In this article, we discuss 1) the spectrum of VADs for outpatienttherapy, including their basic physiology and hemodynamics; 2) themultidisciplinary approach required to care for a patient with such a device inthe community; 3) routine general cardiac issues that are encountered; 4)associated long-term device and nondevice-related complications; and 5) thereported overall improvements in quality of life.
