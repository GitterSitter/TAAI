The scarcity of the gold      standard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.      For patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been of      great benefit on survival. To allow explantation of the assist device and obviate      heart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.      However, explant rates so far are low. Combining mechanical circulatory support      with regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might       give rise to improved long-term results. Although synergistic effects are      suggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in both      preclinical and clinical setting is lacking.

We sought to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and short- and      long-term all-cause mortality of patients with AKI following VAD implantation.      METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent VAD implantation at the      University of Chicago between January 1, 2008, and January 31, 2012. We evaluated      the incidence of AKI, defined as a >/=50\\\% increase in serum creatinine over the      first 7 postoperative days (RIFLE Risk-Creatinine). A logistic regression model      was used to identify risk factors for the development of AKI, and a Cox      proportional hazards model was used to examine factors associated with 30-day and      365-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 157 eligible patients had VAD      implantations with 44 (28\\\%) developing postimplantation AKI. In a multivariate      analysis, only diabetes mellitus [odds ratio = 2.25 (1.03-4.94), p = 0.04] was      identified as a significant predictor of postoperative AKI. Using a multivariable      model censored for heart transplantation, only AKI [hazard ratio, HR = 3.01      (1.15-7.92), p = 0.03] and cardiopulmonary bypass time [HR = 1.01 (1.001-1.02), p      = 0.02] were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Preoperative body mass      index [HR = 0.95 (0.90-0.99), p = 0.03], preoperative diabetes mellitus [HR =      1.89 (1.07-3.35), p = 0.03] and postimplantation AKI [HR = 1.85 (1.06-3.21), p =       0.03] independently predicted 365-day mortality.

The IABP      confers a wide variety of vaguely understood effects on cardiac physiology and      mechano-energetics.

Indicatively, the results of recently      performed prospective studies have put IABP\\s utility in the setting of      post-infarction cardiogenic shock into question. However, the particular issue      remains open to further research. IABP support in high-risk patients undergoing      PCI is associated with favorable long-term clinical outcome. In cardiac surgery,       the use of IABP in cases of peri-operative low-output syndrome, refractory angina      or ischemia-related mechanical complications is a usual, but poorly justified      strategy. Anecdotal cases of treatment of incessant ventricular arrhythmias,      reversal of right ventricular dysfunction and partial myocardial recovery have      also been reported with its use. Converging data demonstrate the potential of      safe long-term IABP support as a bridge to decision making or a bridge to      transplantation modality in patients with heart failure. The feasibility of IABP       insertion via other than the femoral artery sites enhances this potential.      Despite the fact that several other counterpulsation devices have been developed       and tested overtime none has managed to substitute the IABP, which continues to      be most frequently used mechanical assist device.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To facilitate pragmatic research efforts, data regarding the prognostic      importance of noninvasively assessed pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in      stable ambulatory patients with HF are needed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined      the association between echocardiographic PASP and outcomes in 417 outpatients      with HF (age, 54 +/- 13 years; 60.7\\\% men; 50.4\\\% whites; 24.9\\\% with preserved      ejection fraction). Median PASP was 36 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR]: 29, 46).      After a median follow-up of 2.6 years (IQR: 1.7, 3.9) there were 72 major events       (57 deaths; 9 urgent heart transplants; and 6 ventricular assist device      implantations) and 431 hospitalizations for HF. In models adjusting for clinical       risk factors and therapy, a 10-mm Hg higher PASP was associated with 37\\\% higher      risk (95\\\% CI: 18, 59; P<0.001) for major events, and 11\\\% higher risk (95\\\% CI: 1,       23; P=0.039) for major events or HF hospitalization. The threshold that maximized      the likelihood ratio for both endpoints was 48 mm Hg; those with PASP >/= 48 mm      Hg (N=84; 20.1\\\%) had an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.33 (95\\\% CI: 1.96, 5.65;      P<0.001) for major events and 1.47 (95\\\% CI: 1.02, 2.11; P=0.037) for major events      or HF hospitalization.

Unlike      other devices requiring open-heart surgery, thin active flexible membrane of      IntraVAD, made of ionic polymer-metal composites and shape memory alloys (SMA),      enables transcatheter implantation and eliminates thoracotomy. Actuation      mechanism of the device mimics the natural motion of the heart, applies almost no      shear stress on blood cells, and leaves no stagnant points. Hence, it reduces      hemolysis and thrombosis risks. The first step in designing the device is      defining the objectives based on hemodynamics of eligible patients. A      3-dimensional model is extracted from magnetic resonance images of a subject to      provide a precise representation of the inner shape of the ventricle. Numerical      solution to the mathematical model of the behavior of ionic polymer-metal      composites is then used to check their compliancy with the objectives. Different       actuator designs are evaluated to perform the desired motions and address the      cardiac insufficiency.

After implant, functional improvement was evident in 6-min walk      distance which increased from 268 +/- 92 m at baseline to 399 +/- 105 m at 6      months, and 100\\\% of patients were in NYHA class I or II at 6 months compared to      0\\\% at baseline. Adverse events included localized non-device-related infection      (4/6), arrhythmias (3/6) and percutaneous lead infection (1/6). There were no      re-thoracotomies for bleeding and no strokes or pump replacements. All patients      were alive at 6 months and all were transplanted after 1.96-3.58 years of LVAD      support.

However, many of these patients can be titrated on beta-blockers, but there is      little evidence of successful clinical strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We      analysed the records of inotropy-dependent patients referred for assessment for      heart transplantation. Thirty-six patients (45\\\%) could not be weaned (NW) and      underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation or transplantation,       or died. However, 44 (55\\\%) were successfully weaned (SW). Neither the aetiology      (ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic) nor cardiac indexes were different in the SW as      compared with the NW group (2.27+/-0.5 vs. 2.15+/-0.6 L/min/m2). The NW patients       had lower LVEF (15+/-5\\\% vs. 19+/-5\\\%, P=0.001), higher right atrial pressure      (12+/-6 vs. 8+/-6 mmHg, P=0.02), and more severe mitral regurgitation (P<0.001)      than the SW patients. At discharge, 35 of 44 SW patients were receiving      beta-blockers. In 29 of them, a beta-blocker could only be initiated or continued      during concomitant support with i.v. enoximone for a duration of 14.1+/-7.2 days.      Patients discharged on a beta-blocker had an LVAD/transplantation-free cumulative      survival of 71\\\% during a follow-up of 2074+/-201 days (confidence interval      1679-2470). CONCLUSION: It takes time to put severely ill HF patients on      beta-blockers and it may require bridging with inotropes which are independent of      beta-adrenergic receptors. Whether such a strategy may result in a better      clinical outcome warrants further research.CI  - (c) 2013 The Authors.

Nine patients (6 males, 3 females; mean       33.5 +/- 7.8 years; New York Heart Association class III or IV) received the HVAD      as a bridge to transplantation between 2011 and 2012. Six had dilated      cardiomyopathy, 2 secondary cardiomyopathy, and 1 dilated phase hypertrophic      cardiomyopathy. All operations were uneventful, with a mean operation time of 269      +/- 77 min and cardiopulmonary bypass time of 121 +/- 40 min. One required a      temporary right ventricular assist device and was weaned on postoperative day 20,      while another required pump exchange due to foreign tissue in the inflow. Mean      support duration was 245 +/- 162 days (range: 50-535 days) and mean pump blood      flow at 1 month postoperatively was 4.8 +/- 0.8 l/min. There was no mortality      after 30 days, though 1 patient died during support due to cerebral hemorrhage.      Presently, the others are waiting for heart transplantation without problems,      except 1 who suffered from an active infection. There was no pump mechanical      failure in any case.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In 416 patients with chronic systolic heart      failure, we performed speckle-tracking analyses of left ventricular longitudinal,      circumferential, and radial strain and strain rate on archived echocardiography      images (30 frames per second). Cox regression models were used to determine the      associations between strain and strain rate and risk of all-cause mortality,      cardiac transplantation, and ventricular-assist device placement. The area under       the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) was also calculated at 1 year and 5 years.      Over a maximum follow-up of 8.9 years, there were 138 events (33.2\\\%). In      unadjusted models, all strain and strain rate parameters were associated with      adverse outcomes (P<0.001). In multivariable models, all parameters with the      exception of radial strain rate (P=0.11) remained independently associated, with       patients in the lowest tertile of strain or strain rate parameter having a      approximately 2-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes compared with the      reference group (P<0.05). Addition of strain to ejection fraction (EF) led to a      significantly improved AUC at 1 year (0.697 versus 0.633, P=0.032) and 5 years      (0.700 versus 0.638, P=0.001). In contrast, strain rate did not provide      incremental prognostic value to EF alone. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal and      circumferential strain and strain rate, and radial strain are associated with      chronic heart failure prognosis. Strain provides incremental value to EF in the      prediction of adverse outcomes, and with additional study may be a clinically      relevant prognostic tool.FAU - Zhang, Kathleen WAU  - Zhang KWAD  -

Understanding the neurohormonal, inflammatory and      molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology of this syndrome has led to      the development of effective and widely used pharmacological treatments. Despite       this, mortality and hospitalization rates associated with this condition remain      high.

The short- and long-term survival in      patients with cardiogenic shock or end-stage heart failure has improved      considerably by recent technological advances in short and long-term mechanical      circulatory support devices. For short-term mechanical support, veno-arterial      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has been increasingly used as      bridge-to-decision and bridge-to-recovery in cardiogenic shock patients.      Long-term mechanical circulatory support devices such as left ventricular assist       devices (LVADs) are widely available and play a central role in      bridge-to-transplantation in those eligible for heart transplantation (HTX) and      as destination therapy (DT) in those not eligible for heart transplantation.      Nevertheless, patients with critical cardiogenic shock show a deleterious outcome      after LVAD-implantation or HTX with higher mortality, more complications and      higher burden on financial resources. These considerations underscore the      importance of optimal timing and appropriate patient selection for eventual LVAD       therapy.

The difficulties in procuring fresh      left ventricular (LV) myocardium from humans for assessment of mitochondrial      function have resulted in the reliance on surrogate markers of mitochondrial      function and limited our understanding of cardiac energetics. We isolated      mitochondria from fresh LV wall tissue of patients with heart failure and reduced      systolic function undergoing heart transplant or left ventricular assist device      placement, and compared their function to mitochondria isolated from the      non-failing LV (NFLV) wall tissue with normal systolic function from patients      with pulmonary hypertension undergoing heart-lung transplant. We performed      detailed mitochondrial functional analyses using 4 substrates: glutamate-malate      (GM), pyruvate-malate (PM) palmitoyl carnitine-malate (PC) and succinate. NFLV      mitochondria showed preserved respiratory control ratios and electron chain      integrity with only few differences for the 4 substrates. In contrast, HF      mitochondria had greater respiration with GM, PM and PC substrates and higher      electron chain capacity for PM than for PC. Surprisingly, HF mitochondria had      greater respiratory control ratios and lower ADP-independent state 4 rates than      NFLV mitochondria for GM, PM and PC substrates demonstrating that HF mitochondria      are capable of coupled respiration ex vivo. Gene expression studies revealed      decreased expression of key genes in pathways for oxidation of both fatty acids      and glucose. Our results suggest that mitochondria from the failing LV myocardium      are capable of tightly coupled respiration when isolated and supplied with ample       substrates. Thus energy starvation in the failing heart may be the result of      dysregulation of metabolic pathways, impaired substrate supply or reduced      mitochondrial number but not the result of reduced mitochondrial electron      transport capacity.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to assess whether Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)      implantation modifies the inflammatory and apoptotic profile in the heart through      the modulation of Casp-1 expression level. METHODS: Cardiac tissue was collected       from end-stage HF patients before LVAD implant (pre-LVAD group, n=22) and at LVAD      removal (post-LVAD, n=6), and from stable HF patients on medical therapy without       prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at heart transplantation, as control. The      cardiac expression of Casp-1, of its inhibitors caspase recruitment domain (CARD)      only protein (COP) and CARD family, member 18 (ICEBERG), was evaluated by      real-time PCR in the three groups of patients. RESULTS: Casp-1 was increased in      the pre-LVAD group compared to HTx (p=0.006), while on the contrary the ICEBERG      level was significantly decreased in pre-LVAD with respect to HTx patients      (p<0.001); no difference in COP expression level was found. CONCLUSIONS: This      study describes a specific pattern of the Casp-1 system associated with      inflammation and apoptosis markers in patients who require LVAD insertion. The      inflammation could be the key process regulating, in a negative loop, Casp-1      signaling and its down-stream effects, apoptosis included.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, due to the limited      availability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)      have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patients      with refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with the      HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as a      bridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was a      retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVAD      implantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were       classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support       (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-heart      transplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 years      old (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart      disease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], and      chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12      patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwent      HMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative       days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery      (21.7\\\%), mediastinal infection (21.7\\\%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinal      collection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1\\\%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0\\\%),       and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3\\\%). All patients were discharged      from hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced driveline      infections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to the      following conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0\\\%), gastrointestinal      bleeding (13.0\\\%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0\\\%), transient ischemic attack      (8.7\\\%), arrhythmia (8.7\\\%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aortic      regurgitation (8.7\\\%), right ventricular failure (4.3\\\%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3\\\%),      and hematuria (4.3\\\%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally New      York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three       patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient was      successfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were two      mortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was      522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to be      effective in our Asian population. Driveline infection rate remains low even in      the tropical hot, humid climate in Singapore. With more patients ending up on      extended periods of LVAD support, increased emphasis in the detection and      management of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will be      needed.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Lim, Choon PinAU  - Lim CPAD  - National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore.FAU - Sivathasan, CumaraswamyAU  - Sivathasan CFAU - Tan, Teing EeAU  - Tan TEFAU - Lim, Chong HeeAU  - Lim CHFAU - Kerk, Ka LeeAU  - Kerk KLFAU - Sim, David Kheng LengAU  - Sim DKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140107PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMCIN - Artif Organs. 2014 Jun;38(6):521-3. - 24392937own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140721dcom- 20150309is  - 1525-1594 (electronic)is  - 0160-564x (linking)vi  - 38ip  - 7dp  - 2014 julti  - use of left ventricular assist device (heartmate ii): a singapore experience.pg  - 543-8lid - 10.1111/aor.12247 [doi]ab  - recent advances in medical and device therapies in heart failure have improved      the survival of patients with heart failure. however, due to the limited      availability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (lvads)      have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patients      with refractory heart failure in singapore. we report our experience with the      heartmate ii (hmii) lvad (thoratec corporation, pleasanton, ca, usa) as a      bridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. this was a      retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent hmii lvad      implantation in our center between may 2009 and december 2012. all patients were       classified as interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support       (intermacs) levels 1 to 3 and underwent lvad implantation as a bridge-to-heart      transplant. there were 17 male and 6 female patients. the mean age was 43.6 years      old (range 14 to 64). the etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart      disease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], and      chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. nine patients were intermacs level 1, 12      patients level 2, and two patients level 3. all patients successfully underwent      hmii lvad implantation. there was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative       days. postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery      (21.7\\\%), mediastinal infection (21.7\\\%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinal      collection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1\\\%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0\\\%),       and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3\\\%). all patients were discharged      from hospital after lvad implantation. three patients experienced driveline      infections during outpatient follow-up. there were 19 readmissions due to the      following conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0\\\%), gastrointestinal      bleeding (13.0\\\%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0\\\%), transient ischemic attack      (8.7\\\%), arrhythmia (8.7\\\%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aortic      regurgitation (8.7\\\%), right ventricular failure (4.3\\\%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3\\\%),      and hematuria (4.3\\\%). post-lvad implantation, 20 patients were functionally new      york heart association (nyha) class i, while 3 reported nyha iii symptoms. three       patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. one patient was      successfully explanted 11 months after lvad implantation. there were two      mortalities during the follow-up period. the average duration of lvad support was      522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). the heartmate ii lvad has proven to be      effective in our asian population. driveline infection rate remains low even in      the tropical hot, humid climate in singapore. with more patients ending up on      extended periods of lvad support, increased emphasis in the detection and      management of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will be      needed.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 international center for artificial organs and transplantation      and wiley periodicals, inc.fau - lim, choon pinau  - lim cpad  - national heart centre singapore, singapore.fau - sivathasan, cumaraswamyau  - sivathasan cfau - tan, teing eeau  - tan tefau - lim, chong heeau  - lim chfau - kerk, ka leeau  - kerk klfau - sim, david kheng lengau  - sim dkla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20140107pl  - united statesta  - artif organsjt  - artificial organsjid - 7802778sb  - imcin - artif organs. 2014 jun;38(6):521-3.

We hypothesized that IL-33/ST2 pathway, a new mechanism regulated during      cardiac stress, may be involved in the functional worsening of end-stage HF      patients, candidates for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and       potentially responsible for their outcome. METHODS: IL-33, ST2, and conventional       cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) were determined in cardiac biopsies and      plasma of 22 patients submitted to LVAD implantation (pre-LVAD) and compared with      (1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at the moment of heart       transplantation without prior circulatory support (HT); (2) patients supported by      LVAD at the moment of LVAD weaning (post-LVAD). RESULTS: Cardiac expression of      ST2/IL-33 and cytokines was lower in the pre-LVAD than in the HT group. LVAD      determined an increase of inflammatory mediators comparable to levels of the HT      group. Only ST2 correlated with outcome indices after LVAD implantation.      CONCLUSIONS: IL-33/ST2 and traditional cytokines were involved in decline of      cardiac function of ESHF patients as well as in hemodynamic recovery induced by      LVAD. IL-33/ST2 pathway was also associated to severity of clinical course. Thus,      a better understanding of inflammation is the key to achieving more favorable      outcome by new specific therapies.FAU - Caselli, CAU  - Caselli CAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - D\\Amico, AAU  - D\\Amico AAD  - Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant\\Anna, 56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Ragusa, RAU  - Ragusa RAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Caruso, RAU  - Caruso RAD  - Cardiovascular Department, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale       delle Ricerche (CNR), Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Prescimone, TAU  - Prescimone TAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Cabiati, MAU  - Cabiati MAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Nonini, SAU  - Nonini SAD  - Cardiotoracovascular Department, Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162 Milan, Italy.FAU - Marraccini, PAU  - Marraccini PAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy ; Cardiovascular Department, Institute of Clinical Physiology,       Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162      Milan, Italy.FAU - Del Ry, SAU  - Del Ry SAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Trivella, M GAU  - Trivella MGAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.FAU - Parodi, OAU  - Parodi OAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy ; Cardiovascular Department, Institute of Clinical Physiology,       Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, 20162      Milan, Italy.FAU - Giannessi, DAU  - Giannessi DAD  - Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biochemistry, Institute of Clinical Physiology,      Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Area della Ricerca, Via Moruzzi 1,      56100 Pisa, Italy.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20131210PL  - United StatesTA  - Mediators InflammJT  - Mediators of inflammationJID - 9209001RN  - 0 (Cytokines)RN  - 0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)RN  - 0 (IL33 protein, human)RN  - 0 (Inflammation Mediators)RN  - 0 (Interleukins)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)SB  - IMMH  - Cytokines/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*etiology/immunology/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Inflammation Mediators/*physiologyMH  - Interleukins/*physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiologyMH  - Signal TransductionPMC - PMC3872445OID - NLM: PMC3872445EDAT- 2014/01/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/04 06:00PHST- 2013/09/27 [received]PHST- 2013/11/13 [accepted]PHST- 2013/12/10 [epublish]AID - 10.1155/2013/498703 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Mediators Inflamm. 2013;2013:498703. doi: 10.1155/2013/498703.

The question addressed was: Can the temporary use of right ventricular       assist devices (RVADs) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute right      ventricular failure after cardiac surgery? More than 183 papers were found using       the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer the      clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient      group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are      tabulated. Indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass       surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assist      device insertion. Significant reductions in central venous pressure (P = 0.005)      and mean pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.01) were reported during and after      RVAD support. Furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (P <      0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05), right ventricular stroke      work (P < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (P < 0.05) were also      seen. Assessment by one study showed that on Day 7 after RVAD removal, the right       ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40\\\%. Dynamic      echocardiography studies performed before, during and after RVAD placement      demonstrated that after RVAD implantation, right ventricular end-diastolic      dimensions (P < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (P < 0.05) and right       ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) increased. Although several studies      successfully weaned patients from an RVAD, there were several complications,      including bleeding requiring surgical intervention. However, this may be reduced       by using percutaneous implantation (bleeding incidence: 4 of 9 patients) rather      than by a surgically implanted RVAD (bleeding incidence: 5 of 5 patients).      However, mortality is higher in percutaneous RVAD patients rather than in      surgical RVAD (80-44\\\%) patients. Causes of death cited for patients on an RVAD      included multiorgan failure, sepsis, thromboembolic events, reoccurring right      heart failure and failure to wean due to persistent right ventricular failure. We      conclude that RVADs have been successfully used to bridge patients to recovery      after cardiac surgery; however, RVADs carry numerous risks and a high mortality      rate.FAU - Lang, Sommer AAU  - Lang SAAD  - School of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.FAU - O\\Neill, BridieAU  - O\\Neill BFAU - Waterworth, PaulAU  - Waterworth PFAU - Bilal, HarisAU  - Bilal HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20131225PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - BenchmarkingMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects/mortalityMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Patient SelectionMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction,      Right/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Ventricular Function, RightPMC - PMC3957279OID - NLM: PMC3957279OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart assist devicesOT  - ReviewOT  - Ventricular dysfunction, rightEDAT- 2013/12/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/28 06:00PHST- 2013/12/25 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt472 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt472 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2014 Apr;18(4):499-510. doi:      10.1093/icvts/ivt472.

The impact of CHF medication optimization following CRT,      however, has never been comprehensively evaluated. In the current study, we      therefore investigated the effect of CHF medication dosage on morbidity and      mortality in CHF patients after CRT implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chronic      heart failure medication was assessed in 185 patients after CRT implantation.      During an overall mean follow-up of 44.6 months, 83 patients experienced a      primary endpoint (death, heart transplantation, assist device implantation, or      hospitalization for CHF). Treatment with higher dosages of angiotensin-converting      enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (P = 0.001) and       beta-blockers (P < 0.001) as well as with lower dosages of loop diuretics (P <      0.001) was associated with a reduced risk for the primary combined endpoint as      well as for all-cause mortality. Echocardiographic super-responders to CRT were      treated with higher average dosages of ACE-I/ARBs (68.1 vs. 52.4\\\%, P < 0.01) and       beta-blockers (59 vs. 42.2\\\%, P < 0.01). During follow-up, the average dosage of      loop diuretics was decreased by 20\\\% in super-responders, but increased by 30\\\% in       non-super-responders (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of higher dosages of      neurohormonal blockers and lower dosages of diuretics is associated with reduced       morbidity and mortality following CRT implantation. Our data imply a beneficial      effect of increasing neurohormonal blockade whenever possible following CRT      implantation.FAU - Schmidt, SusannAU  - Schmidt SAD  - Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Zurich, University Heart Center,      Ramistrasse 100, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.FAU - Hurlimann, DavidAU  - Hurlimann DFAU - Starck, Christoph TAU  - Starck CTFAU - Hindricks, GerhardAU  - Hindricks GFAU - Luscher, Thomas FAU  - Luscher TFFAU - Ruschitzka, FrankAU  - Ruschitzka FFAU - Steffel, JanAU  - Steffel JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20131225PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263RN  - 0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)RN  - 0 (Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists)RN  - 0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)RN  - 0 (Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors)SB  - IMMH  - Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/administration & dosageMH  - Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosageMH  - Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosageMH  - Cardiac Resynchronization TherapyMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/*administration & dosageMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Randomized Controlled Trials as TopicMH  - Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/administration & dosageMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cardiac resynchronization therapyOT  - Chronic heart failureOT  - Optimal medical therapyEDAT- 2013/12/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/28 06:00PHST- 2013/12/25 [aheadofprint]AID - eht514 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht514 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Heart J. 2014 Apr;35(16):1051-60. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/eht514.

METHODS: We examined the      clinical course of 5 patients (4 boys, 1 girl; mean age, 10.6 +/- 1.5 years;      range, 8-12 years) who underwent implantation of a pneumatic extracorporeal      ventricular assist device between February 2004 and May 2009. Four patients had      dilated cardiomyopathy and one had corrected transposition of the great arteries.      RESULTS: The mean period between onset of heart failure and ventricular assist      device implantation was 594 +/- 750 days (range, 94-1702 days), and the mean      duration of ventricular assist support was 112 +/- 98 days (range, 44-284 days).       Four patients underwent heart transplantation overseas and one died of cerebral      hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Careful management of pediatric VAD patients and      development of a device designed specifically for pediatric patients are      essential for improving clinical outcomes in the future.FAU - Komagamine, MasahideAU  - Komagamine MAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tokyo Women\\s Medical University, Tokyo -      Japan.FAU - Nishinaka, TomohiroAU  - Nishinaka TFAU - Iwata, YusukeAU  - Iwata YFAU - Tsukui, YukiAU  - Tsukui YFAU - Saito, SatoshiAU  - Saito SFAU - Yamazaki, KenjiAU  - Yamazaki KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131212PL  - ItalyTA  - Int J Artif OrgansJT  - The International journal of artificial organsJID - 7802649SB  - IMMH  - Age FactorsMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - MaleMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Time-to-TreatmentMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftEDAT- 2013/12/24 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/19 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/24 06:00PHST- 2013/12/23 [ppublish]PHST- 2013/12/12 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2013/08/22 [accepted]AID - E88E8654-60C4-4F43-877A-A858073C06D6 [pii]AID - 10.5301/ijao.5000263 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Artif Organs. 2013 Dec;36(12):887-91. doi: 10.5301/ijao.5000263.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from patients receiving      the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device in the ADVANCE bridge to transplant (BTT)      trial and continued access protocol were reviewed. Of 382 consecutive patients      who completed follow-up between August 2008 and June 2013 (mean time on support      389 days, median 271 days), 262 (68.6\\\%) underwent isolated HeartWare Ventricular       Assist Device implantation, 75 (19.6\\\%) a concurrent valve procedure, and 45      (11.8\\\%) concurrent nonvalvular procedures. Of the concurrent valve procedures, 56      were tricuspid, 13 aortic, and 6 mitral. Survival was similar between groups (79\\\%      for concurrent valve procedures and 85\\\% for HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device      only at 1 year; P=0.33). Concurrent valve procedures were also associated with      increased unadjusted early right heart failure (RHF). A multivariable analysis      for death and RHF (121 total events) identified female sex (odds ratio=2.0 [95\\\%      confidence interval, 1.2-3.3; P=0.0053]) and preimplant tricuspid regurgitation      severity (odds ratio=2.9 [95\\\% confidence interval, 1.8-4.8, P<0.0001]) as      independent predictors while concurrent tricuspid valve procedures (TVP) were not      predictors. Furthermore, patients with significant preimplant tricuspid      regurgitation who did not receive a TVP experienced an increased rate of late RHF      compared with those who received TVP (0.19 versus 0.05 events per patient-year,      respectively; P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HeartWare Ventricular Assist      Device alone, survival was equivalent for the concurrent valve procedure group.      Tricuspid regurgitation severity was the most important predictor of increased      postoperative RHF, and concurrent TVP was not an independent predictor of RHF      overall. Concurrent TVP may reduce the rate of late RHF for patients with      significant preimplant tricuspid insufficiency. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL:       http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Percutaneous implantation of an extracorporeal life support (ECLS)      system achieves immediate cardiopulmonary stabilization, sufficient end-organ      perfusion and reduction of subsequent multiorgan failure (MOF). METHODS:      Forty-one patients undergoing percutaneous ECLS implantation for cardiogenic      shock from February 2012 until August 2013 were retrospectively analysed. Mean      age was 52 +/- 13 years, 6 (15\\\%) were female. Mean pH values obtained before ECLS      implantation were 7.15 +/- 0.24, mean lactate concentration was 11.7 +/- 6.4      mmol/l. Levels obtained 6 h after ECLS implantation were 7.30 +/- 0.14 and 8.7      +/- 5.0 mmol/l, respectively. In 23 patients (56\\\%) cardiogenic shock resulted      from an acute coronary syndrome in 13 (32\\\%) from cardiomyopathy, in 5 (12\\\%) from       other causes. Twenty-seven (66\\\%) had been resuscitated, in 14 (34\\\%) implantation       was performed under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Of note, 97\\\% of       the acute coronary syndrome patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention      (PCI) either before ECLS implantation or under ECLS support. Extracorporeal life       support implantation was performed on scene (Emergency Department, Cath Lab,      Intensive Care Unit) by a senior cardiac surgeon and a trained perfusionist, in 8      cases (20\\\%) in the referring hospital. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 51\\\% [21       patients, due to MOF (n = 14), cerebral complications (n = 6) and heart failure      (n = 1)]. Logistic regression analysis identified 6-h pH values as an independent      risk factor of 30-day mortality (P < 0.001, OR = 0.000, 95\\\% CI 0.000-0.042).      Neither CPR nor implantation under ongoing CPR resulted in significant      differences. In 26 cases (63\\\%), the ECLS system could be explanted, after mean      support of 169 +/- 67 h. Seven of these patients received cardiac surgery      [ventricular assist device implantation (n = 4), heart transplantation (n = 1),      other procedures (n = 2)]. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the evolution of transportable      ECLS systems and percutaneous techniques implantation on scene is feasible.      Extracorporeal life support may serve as a bridge-to-decision and      bridge-to-treatment device. Neurological evaluation before ventricular assist      device implantation and PCI under stable conditions are possible.

However, the supply of      donor hearts is diminishing and demand greatly exceeds supply. Ventricular assist      devices (VADs) are surgically implanted pumps used as an alternative to      transplant (ATT) or as a bridge to transplant (BTT) while a patient awaits a      donor heart. Surgery and VADs are costly. For the NHS to allocate and deliver      such services in a cost-effective way the relative costs and benefits of these      alternative treatments need to be estimated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate for      patients aged >/= 16 years with advanced HF eligible for HT: (1) the clinical      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation VADs used as      BTT compared with medical management (MM); and (2) the clinical effectiveness and      cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation VADs used as an ATT in      comparison with their use as BTT therapy. DATA SOURCES: Searches for clinical      effectiveness studies covered years from 2003 to March 2012 and included the      following data bases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations,       EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of       Reviews of Effects (DARE), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), HTA      databases [NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD)], Science Citation      Index and Conference Proceedings (Web of Science), UK Clinical Research Network      (UKCRN) Portfolio Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health      Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and National Library of Medicine (NLM) Gateway,      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Current Controlled      Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked,      and VAD manufacturers\\ websites interrogated. For economic analyses we made use      of individual patient data (IPD) held in the UK Blood and Transplant Database      (BTDB). REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of evidence on clinical effectiveness       and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation US Food and Drug      Administration (FDA) and/or Conformite Europeenne (CE) approved VADs.      Publications from the last 5 years with control groups, or case series with 50 or      more patients were included. Outcomes included survival, functional capacity      (e.g. change in New York Heart Association functional classification), quality of      life (QoL) and adverse events. Data from the BTDB were obtained. A discrete-time,      semi-Markov, multistate model was built. Deterministic and probabilistic methods       with multiple sensitivity analyses varying survival, utilities and cost inputs to      the model were used. Model outputs were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios      (ICERs), cost/quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and cost/life-year      gained (LYG). The discount rate was 3.5\\\% and the time horizon varied over 3      years, 10 years and lifetime. RESULTS: Forty publications reported clinical      effectiveness of VADs and one study reported cost-effectiveness. We found no      high-quality comparative empirical studies of VADs as BTT compared with MM or as       ATT compared with BTT. Approximately 15-25\\\% of the patients receiving a device      had died by 12 months. Studies reported the following wide ranges for adverse      events: 4-27\\\% bleeding requiring transfusion; 1.5-40\\\% stroke; 3.3-48\\\% infection;       1-14\\\% device failure; 3-30\\\% HF; 11-32\\\% reoperation; and 3-53\\\% renal failure. QoL       and functional status were reported as improved in studies of two devices      [HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) and HeartWare (HW;      HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA)]. At 3 years, 10 years and lifetime, the      ICERs for VADs as BTT compared with MM were pound122,730, pound68,088 and      pound55,173 respectively. These values were stable to changes in survival of the       MM group. Both QoL and costs were reduced by VADs as ATT compared with VADs as      BTT giving ICERs in south-west quadrant of the cost effectiveness plain (cost      saving/QALY sacrificed) of pound353,467, pound31,685 and pound20,637 over the 3      years, 10 years and lifetime horizons respectively. Probabilistic analyses      yielded similar results for both research questions. LIMITATIONS: Conclusions      about the clinical effectiveness were limited by the lack of randomised      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of different VADs for BTT or      comparing BTT with any alternative treatment and by the overlapping populations      in published studies. Although IPD from the BTDB was used to estimate the      cost-effectiveness of VADs compared with MM for BTT, the lack of randomisation of      populations limited the interpretation of this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 years,      10 years and lifetime the ICERs for VADs as BTT compared with MM are higher than       generally applied willingness-to-pay thresholds in the UK, but at a lifetime time      horizon they approximate threshold values used in end of life assessments. VADs      as ATT have a reduced cost but cause reduced QALYs relative to BTT. Future      research should direct attention towards two areas. First, how any future      evaluations of second- or third-generation VADs might be conducted.

and (2) the clinical effectiveness and      cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation vads used as an att in      comparison with their use as btt therapy. data sources: searches for clinical      effectiveness studies covered years from 2003 to march 2012 and included the      following data bases: medline, medline in-process & other non-indexed citations,       embase, cochrane database of systematic reviews (cdsr), database of abstracts of       reviews of effects (dare), nhs economic evaluation database (nhs eed), hta      databases [nhs centre for reviews and dissemination (crd)], science citation      index and conference proceedings (web of science), uk clinical research network      (ukcrn) portfolio database, cumulative index to nursing and allied health      literature (cinahl), psycinfo and national library of medicine (nlm) gateway,      cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), current controlled      trials and clinicaltrials.gov. reference lists of relevant articles were checked,      and vad manufacturers\\ websites interrogated. for economic analyses we made use      of individual patient data (ipd) held in the uk blood and transplant database      (btdb). review methods: systematic reviews of evidence on clinical effectiveness       and cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation us food and drug      administration (fda) and/or conformite europeenne (ce) approved vads.      publications from the last 5 years with control groups, or case series with 50 or      more patients were included. outcomes included survival, functional capacity      (e.g. change in new york heart association functional classification), quality of      life (qol) and adverse events. data from the btdb were obtained. a discrete-time,      semi-markov, multistate model was built. deterministic and probabilistic methods       with multiple sensitivity analyses varying survival, utilities and cost inputs to      the model were used. model outputs were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios      (icers), cost/quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) gained and cost/life-year      gained (lyg). the discount rate was 3.5\\\% and the time horizon varied over 3      years, 10 years and lifetime. results: forty publications reported clinical      effectiveness of vads and one study reported cost-effectiveness. we found no      high-quality comparative empirical studies of vads as btt compared with mm or as       att compared with btt. approximately 15-25\\\% of the patients receiving a device      had died by 12 months. studies reported the following wide ranges for adverse      events: 4-27\\\% bleeding requiring transfusion; 1.5-40\\\% stroke; 3.3-48\\\% infection;       1-14\\\% device failure; 3-30\\\% hf; 11-32\\\% reoperation; and 3-53\\\% renal failure. qol       and functional status were reported as improved in studies of two devices      [heartmate ii (hmii; thoratec inc., pleasanton, ca, usa) and heartware (hw;      heartware inc., framingham, ma, usa)]. at 3 years, 10 years and lifetime, the      icers for vads as btt compared with mm were pound122,730, pound68,088 and      pound55,173 respectively. these values were stable to changes in survival of the       mm group. both qol and costs were reduced by vads as att compared with vads as      btt giving icers in south-west quadrant of the cost effectiveness plain (cost      saving/qaly sacrificed) of pound353,467, pound31,685 and pound20,637 over the 3      years, 10 years and lifetime horizons respectively. probabilistic analyses      yielded similar results for both research questions. limitations: conclusions      about the clinical effectiveness were limited by the lack of randomised      controlled trials (rcts) comparing the effectiveness of different vads for btt or      comparing btt with any alternative treatment and by the overlapping populations      in published studies. although ipd from the btdb was used to estimate the      cost-effectiveness of vads compared with mm for btt, the lack of randomisation of      populations limited the interpretation of this analysis. conclusions: at 3 years,      10 years and lifetime the icers for vads as btt compared with mm are higher than       generally applied willingness-to-pay thresholds in the uk, but at a lifetime time      horizon they approximate threshold values used in end of life assessments. vads      as att have a reduced cost but cause reduced qalys relative to btt. future      research should direct attention towards two areas. first, how any future      evaluations of second- or third-generation vads might be conducted. for ethical      reasons a rct offering equal probability of ht for each group would not be      feasible; future studies should fully assess costs, long-term patient survival,      qol, functional ability and adverse events, so that these may be incorporated      into economic evaluation agreement on outcomes measures across future studies.      second, continuation of accurate data collection in the uk database to encompass       qol data and comparative assessment of performance with other international      centres. funding: the national institute for health research health technology      assessment programme.fau - sutcliffe, pau  - sutcliffe pad  - warwick evidence, warwick medical school, university of warwick, coventry, uk.fau - connock, mau  - connock mfau - pulikottil-jacob, rau  - pulikottil-jacob rfau - kandala, n-bau  - kandala nbfau - suri, gau  - suri gfau - gurung, tau  - gurung tfau - grove, aau  - grove afau - shyangdan, dau  - shyangdan dfau - briscoe, sau  - briscoe sfau - maheswaran, hau  - maheswaran hfau - clarke, aau  - clarke ala  - engpt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\\tpt  - reviewpl  - englandta  - health technol assessjt  - health technology assessment (winchester, england)jid - 9706284rn  - 0 (cardiotonic agents)sb  - immh  - age factorsmh  - cardiotonic agents/economics/therapeutic usemh  - cost-benefit analysismh  - great britainmh  - heart failure/*mortality/*therapymh  - heart-assist devices/adverse effects/*economicsmh  - humansmh  - models, economicmh  - quality of lifemh  - quality-adjusted life yearsmh  - state medicinemh  - technology assessment, biomedicaledat- 2013/11/28 06:00mhda- 2014/08/12 06:00crdt- 2013/11/28 06:00aid - 10.3310/hta17530 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - health technol assess. 2013 nov;17(53):1-499, v-vi. doi: 10.3310/hta17530.',medicine

We describe the use of this device to support       the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York Heart      Association class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustard      procedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. CASE REPORT: A      HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and      pulmonary edema. RESULTS: The patient\\s edema and acute kidney injury resolved      after device placement. She was discharged home and successfully underwent device      removal with heart transplant five months later. CONCLUSION: The HeartWare device      may be used for extended support as a systemic RV in a pediatric patient.

Recently, VADs have similarly taken a prominent      role in the management of end-stage heart failure in children. The purpose of      this review is to describe the indications for VADs in children, types of devices      available, current outcomes, and future directions of VAD therapy. RECENT      FINDINGS: There has been a dramatic increase in VAD utilization in children over       the last decade. For small children, paracorporeal pneumatic pulsatile pumps      (e.g., Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD, Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin, Germany) are most      commonly utilized for long-term support. In older children, intracorporeal      continuous flow devices (e.g., HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist System,      Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, California, USA and HeartWare Ventricular      Assist System, HeartWare Incorporated, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA) have been       used and allow the possibility of destination therapy. Other devices, such as the      total artificial heart, can be utilized for selected patients. Although overall      outcomes of pediatric VADs are favorable, complication rates remain high. The      utilization of VADs in complex circulations, such as single ventricle patients,      remains infrequent and is associated with a high rate of adverse outcomes.      SUMMARY: VADs are well-established treatment for end-stage heart failure in      children. Further investigation is needed to refine patient selection criteria,      minimize complications, and develop additional pediatric-specific devices.FAU - O\\Connor, Matthew JAU  - O\\Connor MJAD  - The Cardiac Center, The Children\\s Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of      Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania,      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.FAU - Rossano, Joseph WAU  - Rossano JWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin CardiolJT  - Current opinion in cardiologyJID - 8608087SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart, ArtificialMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2013/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/02 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/26 06:00AID - 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000030 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Cardiol. 2014 Jan;29(1):113-21. doi: 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000030.- 24270395own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20131204dcom- 20140801is  - 1531-7080 (electronic)is  - 0268-4705 (linking)vi  - 29ip  - 1dp  - 2014 janti  - ventricular assist devices in children.pg  - 113-21lid - 10.1097/hco.0000000000000030 [doi]ab  - purpose of review: ventricular assist devices (vads) have revolutionized heart      failure management in adults. recently, vads have similarly taken a prominent      role in the management of end-stage heart failure in children. the purpose of      this review is to describe the indications for vads in children, types of devices      available, current outcomes, and future directions of vad therapy. recent      findings: there has been a dramatic increase in vad utilization in children over       the last decade. for small children, paracorporeal pneumatic pulsatile pumps      (e.g., berlin heart excor vad, berlin heart gmbh, berlin, germany) are most      commonly utilized for long-term support. in older children, intracorporeal      continuous flow devices (e.g., heartmate ii left ventricular assist system,      thoratec corporation, pleasanton, california, usa and heartware ventricular      assist system, heartware incorporated, framingham, massachusetts, usa) have been       used and allow the possibility of destination therapy. other devices, such as the      total artificial heart, can be utilized for selected patients. although overall      outcomes of pediatric vads are favorable, complication rates remain high. the      utilization of vads in complex circulations, such as single ventricle patients,      remains infrequent and is associated with a high rate of adverse outcomes.      summary: vads are well-established treatment for end-stage heart failure in      children. further investigation is needed to refine patient selection criteria,      minimize complications, and develop additional pediatric-specific devices.fau - o\\connor, matthew jau  - o\\connor mjad  - the cardiac center, the children\\s hospital of philadelphia, department of      pediatrics, perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania,      philadelphia, pennsylvania, usa.fau - rossano, joseph wau  - rossano jwla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - curr opin cardioljt  - current opinion in cardiologyjid - 8608087sb  - immh  - childmh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - heart, artificialmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - treatment outcomeedat- 2013/11/26 06:00mhda- 2014/08/02 06:00crdt- 2013/11/26 06:00aid - 10.1097/hco.0000000000000030 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - curr opin cardiol. 2014 jan;29(1):113-21. doi: 10.1097/hco.0000000000000030.',medicine

Renal failure after LVAD      placement can occur to varying degrees from cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) or due to       intrinsic renal disease. Patients with severely impaired renal function after      LVAD may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) as a temporary or permanent      means of support. We present a unique case of a patient who initiated peritoneal       dialysis (PD) 1 year after placement of an LVAD for destination therapy (DT). One      year later, PD continues to be successfully utilized by this patient for RRT.      There are several proven and theoretical benefits to PD in LVAD patients.      Peritoneal dialysis can provide sustained daily ultrafiltration offering greater       hemodynamic stability, preservation of residual renal function, and a lower risk       of systemic infection. Conversely, limitations to PD include nutritional risks      due to peritoneal albumin losses, hyperglycemia, and potential limitations to      successful catheter placement. Considering our patient\\s successful outcome and      the potential benefits associated with PD, despite the limitations, we conclude      that PD should strongly be considered in patients with LVADs that require RRT.FAU - Guglielmi, Anthony AAU  - Guglielmi AAAD  - From the Center for Heart Transplant and Assist Devices, Advocate Christ Medical       Center, Oak Lawn, Illinois.FAU - Guglielmi, Kelly EAU  - Guglielmi KEFAU - Bhat, GeethaAU  - Bhat GFAU - Siemeck, RoxanneAU  - Siemeck RFAU - Tatooles, Antone JAU  - Tatooles AJLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kidney Diseases/*complications/therapyMH  - MaleMH  - *Peritoneal DialysisEDAT- 2013/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/26 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000020 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Jan-Feb;60(1):127-8. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000020.- 24270236own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20131225dcom- 20140822is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 60ip  - 1dp  - 2014 jan-febti  - peritoneal dialysis after left ventricular assist device placement.pg  - 127-8lid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000020 [doi]ab  - patients with refractory congestive heart failure may be considered for      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (lvad). renal failure after lvad      placement can occur to varying degrees from cardiorenal syndrome (crs) or due to       intrinsic renal disease. patients with severely impaired renal function after      lvad may require renal replacement therapy (rrt) as a temporary or permanent      means of support. we present a unique case of a patient who initiated peritoneal       dialysis (pd) 1 year after placement of an lvad for destination therapy (dt). one      year later, pd continues to be successfully utilized by this patient for rrt.      there are several proven and theoretical benefits to pd in lvad patients.      peritoneal dialysis can provide sustained daily ultrafiltration offering greater       hemodynamic stability, preservation of residual renal function, and a lower risk       of systemic infection. conversely, limitations to pd include nutritional risks      due to peritoneal albumin losses, hyperglycemia, and potential limitations to      successful catheter placement. considering our patient\\s successful outcome and      the potential benefits associated with pd, despite the limitations, we conclude      that pd should strongly be considered in patients with lvads that require rrt.fau - guglielmi, anthony aau  - guglielmi aaad  - from the center for heart transplant and assist devices, advocate christ medical       center, oak lawn, illinois.fau - guglielmi, kelly eau  - guglielmi kefau - bhat, geethaau  - bhat gfau - siemeck, roxanneau  - siemeck rfau - tatooles, antone jau  - tatooles ajla  - engpt  - case reportspt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109sb  - immh  - agedmh  - heart failure/*complications/surgerymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - kidney diseases/*complications/therapymh  - malemh  - *peritoneal dialysisedat- 2013/11/26 06:00mhda- 2014/08/26 06:00crdt- 2013/11/26 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000020 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2014 jan-feb;60(1):127-8. doi: 10.1097/mat.0000000000000020.',medicine

Although availability of heart      donor for transplantation has declined over the past several years, innovations      in ventricular assist device (VAD) technology has provided an alternative      therapeutic option for patients with advanced heart failure. Initiated as a      mechanical option to \\\"bridge\\\" critically ill patients awaiting transplantation,      VADs are being increasingly deployed as \\\"destination\\\" devices to provide      long-term support. With technical advances resulting in improved mechanical      reliability, reduced postoperative morbidity and greater likelihood of patient      acceptance, there is interest in expanding the applicability of VAD beyond the      current indication, as destination therapy for severely ill patients who are not       candidates for transplant. This review examines the rational as well as the      technical details of the different generation of VADs for mechanical cardiac      support, implanted either surgical or percutaneously.

Therapies      include cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support, as well      inotropic agents for the short-term. Despite a growing armamentarium of      resources, the clinician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each      therapy to develop an optimal treatment strategy. While cardiac transplantation      remains the only true \\\"cure\\\" for end-stage disease, this resource is limited and       the demand continues to far outpace the supply.

Particularly for the non-operative patient, intravenous       inotropes can be utilized for symptom control. Regardless of the treatments      considered, care of the heart failure patient requires thoughtful dialogue,      multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized care.

Recently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has      shown better results than a right ventricular assist device or retransplantation.      Two HT patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had cold ischemic times beyond      >240 minutes. After HT, their right heart function worsened and was unresponsive       to medical therapy.

Little is known about their post-transplant outcomes. The       aim of this analysis was to determine whether there was a difference in early      survival for children bridged to transplant with EXCOR versus status 1A pediatric      heart transplant patients not transplanted with ventricular assist device      support. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pediatric heart transplant patients (n=106) bridged      to transplantation with EXCOR were compared with a similarly aged cohort (n=1021)      within the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) database (both cohorts      from May 2007 to December 2010). In the EXCOR group, 12-month post-transplant      survival (88.7\\\%) was similar to OPTN patients listed status 1A who were not on      ventricular assist device support at transplant (89.3\\\%; P=0.85) and significantly      better than 12-month survival in OPTN patients on extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation at transplant (60.3\\\%; P<0.001). Rejection (50\\\%) was a significantly      (P=0.005) higher cause of 12-month post-transplant mortality in the EXCOR      compared with the OPTN group. Death after transplant was also higher in EXCOR      patients with congenital heart disease compared with those with cardiomyopathy      (26.1\\\% versus 7.2\\\%; P=0.02). Post-transplant survival was similar in EXCOR      patients with >/=1 serious adverse event during ventricular assist device support      as those without an event during support. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month      post-transplant survival with EXCOR is comparable with overall pediatric heart      transplant survival and superior to survival after extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation. Neither adverse events during support nor factors associated with      mortality during support influence post-transplant survival.

Recently, left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation has been increasingly used in      reducing pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with PH unresponsive to      medical therapy. Herein, we aimed to compare the efficacy of continuous-flow and       pulsatile-flow blood pumps on the improvement of PH in mechanical circulatory      support patients. Twenty-seven patients with end-stage heart failure who      underwent LVAD implantation surgery were enrolled. Fifteen of them (55.6\\\%) had      continuous-flow pump (HeartWare Ventricular Assist System, HeartWare, Inc.,      Miramar, FL, USA), and 12 of them (44.4\\\%) had pulsatile pump (Berlin Heart EXCOR       ventricular assist device, Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany). The efficacy of      LVADs on the improvement of PH was compared between continuous-flow and pulsatile      pumps by the evaluation of systolic PAP, tricuspid annular plane systolic      excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular systolic motion (RVSM), right ventricular      ejection fraction (RVEF), and grade of tricuspid insufficiency (TI) for each of      the study participants. All of the 15 patients who underwent continuous-flow      blood pump implantation surgery (Group 1) were male with a mean age of 46.9 +/-      11.7 years, and in pulsatile-flow blood pump implanted participants (Group 2),      the mean age was 40.6 +/- 16.8 years, all of whom were also male (P=0.259). Mean       follow-up was 313.7 +/- 241.3 days in Group 1 and 448.7 +/- 120.7 days in Group 2      (P=0.139). In Group 1, mean preoperative and postoperative systolic PAP were      measured as 51.7 +/- 12.2 mm Hg and 22.2 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, while those      in Group 2 were 54.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg and 33.9 +/- 6.4 mm Hg, respectively. A      significantly greater decrease in systolic PAP was noticed in patients with      continuous-flow blood pumps (P=0.023); however, no statistically significant      difference was found when we considered the change in TAPSE between study groups       (P=0.112). A statistical significance in the alteration of RVEF, RVSM, and the      grade of TI during study visits was not found between the study groups (P=0.472,       P=0.887, and P=0.237, respectively). Although the two studied types of LVADs were      found to be effective in reducing PAP in heart transplantation candidates with      PH, lesser postoperative systolic PAP values were achieved in patients who      underwent continuous-flow pump implantation surgery.CI  - (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs      and Transplantation.FAU - Ozturk, PelinAU  - Ozturk PAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Ege University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.FAU - Engin, Aysen YaprakAU  - Engin AYFAU - Nalbantgil, SanemAU  - Nalbantgil SFAU - Oguz, EmrahAU  - Oguz EFAU - Ayik, FatihAU  - Ayik FFAU - Engin, CagatayAU  - Engin CFAU - Yagdi, TahirAU  - Yagdi TFAU - Erkul, SinanAU  - Erkul SFAU - Balcioglu, OzlemAU  - Balcioglu OFAU - Ozbaran, MustafaAU  - Ozbaran MLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130911PL  - United StatesTA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Blood PressureMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/complications/*surgeryMH  - Heart Ventricles/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Hypertension, Pulmonary/complications/*physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Pulmonary Artery/*physiopathologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart failureOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - Pulmonary artery pressureOT  - Pulmonary hypertensionEDAT- 2013/09/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/17 06:00PHST- 2013/09/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/aor.12164 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Artif Organs. 2013 Sep;37(9):763-7. doi: 10.1111/aor.12164.

We present      our remote monitoring experience with an axial-flow LVAD (HeartAssist-5, MicroMed      Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA). Five consecutive patients who were      implanted a HeartAssist-5 LVAD because of end-stage heart failure due to ischemic      (n=4) or idiopathic (n=1) cardiomyopathy, and discharged from hospital between      December 2011 and January 2013 were analyzed. The data (pump speed, pump flow,      power consumption) obtained from clinical visits and remote monitoring were      studied. During a median follow-up of 253 (range: 80-394) days, fine tuning of      LVADs was performed at clinical visits. All patients are doing well and are in      New York Heart Association Class-I/II. A total of 39 alarms were received from      three patients. One patient was hospitalized for suspected thrombosis and was      subjected to physical examinations as well as laboratory and echocardiographic      evaluations; however, no evidence of thrombus washout or pump thrombus was found.      The patient was treated conservatively. Remaining alarms were due to insufficient      water intake and were resolved by increased water consumption at night and summer      times, and fine tuning of pump speed. No alarms were received from the remaining       two patients. We believe that remote monitoring is a useful technology for early       detection and treatment of serious problems occurring out of hospital thereby      improving patient care. Future developments may ease troubleshooting, provide      more data from the patient and the pump, and eventually increase physician and      patient satisfaction.

Once medical management has hit its ceiling, attention is turned to surgical      options for mechanical support. The approach to these options has to bear in mind      that there may be many potential causes for pump failure, and that these occur      often in the context of pulmonary hypertension and poor gas exchange. Although      extracorporeal life support has been the mainstay of treatment for acute heart      failure, in the last decade, attention has been focusing on longer-term options      to bridge to recovery or eventual transplant.

CentriMag      (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) is an extracorporeal short-term circulatory      assist device Conformite Europeenne-marked in Europe for use up to 30 days.      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 41 patients with advanced heart failure who,      from 2003 to 2011, were supported with CentriMag for >30 days as a bridge to      recovery, long-term VAD or transplantation. RESULTS: Forty-one adult patients      were supported with 46 CentriMag devices for a total of 2695 days with a mean      support time of 59 (range: 31-167) days. Indications were post-cardiotomy      cardiogenic shock (PC = 4), primary graft failure (PGF = 7) and refractory heart       failure (RHF = 35). Six devices were used to support the left ventricle, 19 to      support the right ventricle and 21 to support both the ventricles (biventricular       support considered as single device unit). In the PC cohort, 3 (75\\\%) patients      were weaned from support, while 4 (57\\\%) were weaned from support in the PGF      cohort. In the RHF cohort, 8 patients were bridged to long-term VAD and 5 were      bridged to transplantation; heart function recovered and device explanted in 14,       while 8 patients died on support. There were no device failures. Overall, 34      (74\\\%) patients were recovered or bridged, with a 1-year survival of 54\\\%.      CONCLUSIONS: CentriMag proved to be a versatile, safe and effective short-term      circulatory support for patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge to      solution. Its use over 30 days is associated with acceptable survival and does      not increase device-related complications.FAU - Mohite, Prashant NAU  - Mohite PNAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation & Mechanical Support, Royal Brompton      and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.FAU - Zych, BartlomiejAU  - Zych BFAU - Popov, Aron FAU  - Popov AFFAU - Sabashnikov, AntonAU  - Sabashnikov AFAU - Saez, Diana GAU  - Saez DGFAU - Patil, Nikhil PAU  - Patil NPFAU - Amrani, MohamedAU  - Amrani MFAU - Bahrami, ToufanAU  - Bahrami TFAU - DeRobertis, FabioAU  - DeRobertis FFAU - Maunz, OlafAU  - Maunz OFAU - Marczin, NandorAU  - Marczin NFAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRFAU - Simon, Andre RAU  - Simon ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130829PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgery/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Postoperative Complications/etiologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesOTO - NOTNLMOT  - CentriMagOT  - End-stage heart failureOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/08/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/06 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/31 06:00PHST- 2013/08/29 [aheadofprint]AID - ezt415 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt415 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Nov;44(5):e310-5. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt415.

Heart transplant or long-term ventricular assist device.PG  - 276-81LID - 10.1111/aor.12157 [doi]AB  - Chronic heart failure is a progressive and eventually fatal illness. Although the      disease cannot be cured and treatment is symptom oriented, most of the patients      benefit from optimum medical treatment. Patients with rapid deterioration in      chronic advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment need inotropic      support and may need intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain circulatory support,      which of course cannot be prolonged beyond a certain limit. The outcome of heart       transplant and long-term ventricular assist device (VAD) in such patients is      poor. The short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) offered to such      patients not only provides effective circulatory support and stabilizes them      hemodynamically, but also halts the ensuing or reverts the established end-organ       failure. As the name suggests, the short-term MCS offers support for the short      term, usually less than a month. Although some patients with acute heart failure       experience recovery of myocardial function with short-term MCS support, others      become dependent.

We reviewed the      evidence on clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of 2 types of continuous-flow      LVADs (HeartMate II [HM II] and HeartWare), for BTT and DT patients. We      systematically searched the scientific literature (January 2008-June 2012) and      identified 14 clinical studies (approximately 2900 HM II and approximately 200      HeartWare patients), and 3 economic evaluations (HM II) using simulation models.       Data were, however, limited to 2-3 studies per outcome. We made policy      recommendations on the basis of our systematic review. Although complications      after implantation are frequent, LVAD therapy is often highly effective across      transplantation eligibility status and device, with 1-year survival reaching 86\\\%       for BTT and 78\\\% for DT (compared with 25\\\% for medical therapy). Neither BTT nor      DT currently meet traditional cost-effectiveness limits in models using      historical data, although BTT is standard practice for a limited number of      patients in many regions. We found that BTT and DT as implantation strategies      tend to be no longer mutually exclusive. We conclude that evidence is sufficient       to support LVAD use, regardless of transplantation eligibility status, as long as      patients are carefully selected and program infrastructure and budget are      adequate. However, evidence gaps, limitations in economic models, and the lack of      Canadian data point to the importance of mandatory, systematic monitoring of LVAD      use and outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

METHODS: Left ventricular (LV) core samples were collected from      177 patients with severe heart failure at the time of LVAD implantation, and      samples were histologically examined and graded for severity of hypertrophy and      fibrosis. Granulomatous myocarditis incidentally seen in a subset of samples was       characterized by staining and culturing for mycobacteria and fungi. Various      clinical parameters in these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 177 LV core       samples examined, 6 (3.4\\\%) showed nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in      the myocardial wall. Stains and cultures for mycobacteria and fungi were      negative. All six patients [three women, three men; five African American, one      Asian; mean age, 52+/-9 years (range, 41-61 years)] had arrhythmias and required       an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Before LVAD implantation,      the patients\\ mean cardiac index was 1.8+/-0.4 l/min/m(2); cardiac output,      2.9+/-0.6 l/min; and ejection fraction, 20+/-2\\\%. One year after LVAD      implantation, one patient had undergone heart transplantation. At 2 years, a      second patient was transplanted, and one died. At 3 years, a third patient was      transplanted and died postoperatively; two patients remained on support. No      clinical evidence indicated involvement of other organs or recurrence in the      transplanted patients. CONCLUSION: The incidental diagnosis of granulomatous      myocarditis in our patients indicates that histological study of LV core samples       in patients who undergo LVAD implantation may contribute to the diagnosis and be       a consideration in the management of the underlying cause of heart failure.CI  - (c) 2013.FAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Pathology Research, Texas Heart Institute at St.      Luke\\s Episcopal Hospital, Houston, TX.

We report our experience with MCS in      children eligible for HTx and its effect on waiting list mortality. METHODS:      Retrospective single-centre cohort study, National Paediatric HTx Programme      including all children eligible for HTx, since the introduction of MCS-VAD in      2006. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were eligible for HTx, median age 11.7      years [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 3.0-14.7]. In 18 patients, (42\\\%) a VAD was      implanted, 11 (61\\\%) survived to HTx (n = 9) or recovery (n = 2). Techniques and      devices used were left ventricular assist device (n = 16, 89\\\%), in 4 cases      preceded by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and biventricular assist       device (n = 2, 11\\\%), both preceded by ECMO. In the VAD group, median time to      death (n = 7) was 18 days (IQR 7-75), median time to HTx (n = 9) 66 days (IQR      33-223) and 2 patients recovered after 30 and 308 days. The main cause of death      on MCS was neurological injury in 4 patients (22\\\%) and systemic thrombo-embolic      events in 2 (11\\\%). The most common serious adverse events included confirmed      thrombus requiring pump replacement (in 11 patients, 61\\\%) and pericardial      effusion leading to rethoracotomy (in 5 patients, 28\\\%). Compared with the era      before MCS (1998-2006), waiting list mortality decreased from 44 to 21\\\%, and is      now mainly related to complications of VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Since the      introduction of MCS-VAD, waiting list mortality halved and more children with      end-stage heart failure survived to heart transplantation, thus improving      outcome. Although there is substantial mortality and morbidity, overall mortality      decreases, making MCS-VAD an essential therapeutic tool. The need for donor      organs remains critically urgent.CI  - (c) The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the      European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

Here, we present a case of a       patient with hemolytic anemia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist      device (CF-LVAD) implantation that was successfully treated with pentoxifylline.       Our case is a 64-year-old African American woman who was implanted with a      HeartMate II device on August 6, 2010, as a bridge to transplant for end-stage      heart failure. Her postoperative course was complicated by recurrent      gastrointestinal bleeding and antiplatelet therapy was discontinued. On October      25, 2011, she was readmitted with anemia and hemoglobin of 6.6 mg/dl and no      identifiable source of bleeding. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 936 IU/L,      indicating severe hemolysis. Due to her evidence of hemolytic anemia and her      inability to tolerate antiplatelet therapy due to recurrent bleeding, she was      discharged on pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily on October 27, 2011, with      hemoglobin of 11.2 mg/dl after transfusion. After 60 days of pentoxifylline, her       hemoglobin and LDH in clinic were 10.1 mg/dl and 223 IU/L, respectively. The      patient was successfully bridged to transplant in June 2012.

Ventricular assist device therapy is fast      becoming an accepted alternative treatment to treat end-stage heart failure and      is being implemented as a bridge to decision, bridge to myocardial recovery,      bridge to heart transplantation or as a destination therapy. LVADs not only      enable hemodynamic stabilization and recovery of secondary organ failure in      severely ill patients, but have also been shown to reduce pulmonary vascular      resistance in nontransplantable candidates. Technology of ventricular assist      devices has evolved over several decades of time and generations of devices. The       HVAD(R) Pump (HeartWare International, Inc., MA, USA) is a third-generation,      miniaturized, continuous-flow ventricular assist device.

METHODS: In 535 consecutive individuals with CHF      scheduled for implantation of a CRT device, LVD was assessed by tissue Doppler      imaging (TDI), defined as an electromechanical delay (EMD) difference of >/=40 ms      in 2 opposed left ventricular wall regions (septal vs. lateral, anterior vs.      inferior). All-cause mortality, heart transplantation, or assist device      implantation was defined as combined primary end point. Secondary end points were      measures of reverse LV remodeling and of symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Mean      follow-up was 68 +/- 36 [range: 4-150] months. LVD at baseline was present in 308      patients (61\\\%). Of these, 24\\\% reached the combined primary endpoint in contrast      to 58\\\% of patients without LVD (p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with LVD showed      pronounced improvement of all secondary end point parameters. In our cohort LVD      was an independent predictor for outcome (hazard ratio [95\\\% CI]: 0.30      [0.21-0.42], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LVD at baseline as assessed by TDI is      associated with a more pronounced clinical improvement and is a predictor for      transplant-free long-term survival in CRT recipients.CI  - (c) 2013.FAU - Prinz, ChristianAU  - Prinz CAD  - Department of Cardiology, Heart and Diabetes Centre of North-Rhine Westphalia,      Ruhr University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany.

Conversion of very complex congenital heart anatomy, such      as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, double-outlet right ventricle or double-inlet      left ventricle, to a single ventricle has grown in popularity as morbidity and      mortality have improved. As these patients grow, survivors are at risk for      impaired ventricular dysfunction, plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy       and late failure. Late failing Fontan patients represent a particularly vexing      scenario for clinicians, as the only durable treatment option is cardiac      transplantation.

This may be of therapeutic relevance in identifying novel      pharmacological targets for therapies that could facilitate recovery after VAD      implantation. METHODS: Twenty-two patients bridged to heart transplantation (HTx)      with VAD were included in the study. A group of patients underwent moderate      intensity aerobic exercise (GT), while another group of patients did not receive       exercise training (CG). Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1) protein and      total (t) and phosphorylated (p) protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal      kinase (JNK) kinase signalling were measured in myocardial tissue by western      blotting at pre-VAD and pre-HTx period. In addition, Thyroid hormone (TH) levels       were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Peak oxygen consumption (VO2) at pre-HTx period      was higher in patients subjected to training protocol [18.0 (0.8) for GT when      compared with 13.7 (0.7) for CG group, P = 0.002]. N-terminal-prohormone of brain      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were 1068 (148) for CG vs 626 (115) for GT      group, P = 0.035. A switch towards up-regulation of physiological growth      signalling was observed: the ratio of p-Akt/t-Akt was 2-fold higher in GT vs CG,       P < 0.05 while p-JNK/t-JNK was 2.5-fold lower (P < 0.05) in GT vs CG, in pre-HTx       samples. This response was accompanied by a 2.0-fold increase in TRalpha1      expression in pre-HTx samples with concomitant increase in circulating T3 in GT      vs CG, P < 0.05. No differences in peak VO2, NT-proBNP, T3, TRalpha1, p/t-AKT and      p/t-JNK were found between groups in the pre-VAD period. CONCLUSIONS: The      unloaded failing myocardium responded to physical training by enhancing thyroid      hormone signalling. This response was associated with an up-regulation of Akt and      suppression of JNK activation.FAU - Adamopoulos, StamatiosAU  - Adamopoulos SAD  - Department of Cardiology, Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Athens, Greece.FAU - Gouziouta, AggelikiAU  - Gouziouta AFAU - Mantzouratou, PolixeniAU  - Mantzouratou PFAU - Laoutaris, Ioannis DAU  - Laoutaris IDFAU - Dritsas, AthanasiosAU  - Dritsas AFAU - Cokkinos, Dennis VAU  - Cokkinos DVFAU - Mourouzis, IordanisAU  - Mourouzis IFAU - Sfyrakis, PetrosAU  - Sfyrakis PFAU - Iervasi, GiorgioAU  - Iervasi GFAU - Pantos, ConstantinosAU  - Pantos CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20130702PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 0 (Peptide Fragments)RN  - 0 (Thyroid Hormone Receptors alpha)RN  - 0 (Thyroid Hormones)RN  - 0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))RN  - 114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)RN  - EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)RN  - EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - *Exercise TherapyMH  - FemaleMH  - GreeceMH  - Heart Failure/blood/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolismMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardium/*metabolismMH  - Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/bloodMH  - Oxygen ConsumptionMH  - Peptide Fragments/bloodMH  - PhosphorylationMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktMH  - *Signal TransductionMH  - Thyroid Hormone Receptors alpha/metabolismMH  - Thyroid Hormones/*bloodMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular FunctionPMC - PMC3781806OID - NLM: PMC3781806OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Exercise trainingOT  - Heart failureOT  - Kinase signallingOT  - Thyroid hormoneOT  - Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1EDAT- 2013/07/04 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/04 06:00PHST- 2013/07/02 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt294 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt294 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2013 Oct;17(4):664-8. doi: 10.1093/icvts/ivt294.

Recently, continuous flow VAD (CVAD) has emerged as an attractive      clinical option for long-term mechanical support of HF patients, with      bridge-to-transplant outcomes comparable with pulsatile flow VAD (PVAD).      Continuous flow VADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than the      first-generation PVAD. Despite the widespread clinical use, CVAD support has been      associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, and aortic valve       insufficiency. Speculation that diminished arterial pressure pulsatility      associated with continuous flow devices may be contributing to these      complications has sparked much debate over CVAD support. Studies comparing      pulsatile flow and continuous flow (CF) support have presented conflicting      findings, and the relevance to CVAD as DT is uncertain due to variations in      device operation, support duration, and the criteria used to quantify      pulsatility. Currently, there is interest in developing control algorithms for      CVAD to increase the delivered pulsatility as a strategy to mitigate adverse      event risks associated with CVAD therapy.

Factors associated with this      occurrence of commissural fusion are unknown. The aim of this study was to      examine histological characteristics of cf-LVAD-induced commissural fusion in      relation to clinical variables. METHODS: Gross and histopathological examinations      were performed on 19 hearts from patients supported by either HeartMate II (n =      17) or HeartWare (n = 2) cf-LVADs and related to clinical characteristics (14      heart transplantation, 5 autopsy). RESULTS: Eleven of the 19 (58\\\%) aortic valves       showed fusion of single or multiple commissures (total fusion length 11 mm [4-20]      (median [interquartile range]) per valve), some leading to noticeable nodular      displacements or considerable lumen diameter narrowing. Multiple fenestrations      were observed in one valve. Histopathological examination confirmed commissural      fusion, with varying changes in valve layer structure without evidence of      inflammatory infiltration at the site of fusion. Commissural fusion was      associated with continuous aortic valve closure during cf-LVAD support (P =      0.03). LVAD-induced aortic valve insufficiency developed in all patients with      commissural fusion and in 67\\\% of patients without fusion. Age, duration of      cf-LVAD support and aetiology of heart failure (ischaemic vs dilated      cardiomyopathy) were not associated with the degree of fusion. CONCLUSIONS:      Aortic valve commissural fusion after support with cf-LVADs is a non-inflammatory      process leading to changes in valve layer structure that can be observed in >50\\\%       of cf-LVAD patients. This is the first study showing that patients receiving full      cf-LVAD support without opening of the valve have a significantly higher risk of       developing commissural fusion than patients on partial support.FAU - Martina, Jerson RAU  - Martina JRAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht,      Netherlands.FAU - Schipper, Marguerite E IAU  - Schipper MEFAU - de Jonge, NicolaasAU  - de Jonge NFAU - Ramjankhan, FaizAU  - Ramjankhan FFAU - de Weger, Roel AAU  - de Weger RAFAU - Lahpor, Jaap RAU  - Lahpor JRFAU - Vink, AryanAU  - Vink ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130624PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aortic Valve/*pathologyMH  - Aortic Valve Insufficiency/*etiology/pathologyMH  - AutopsyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/pathology/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC3781792OID - NLM: PMC3781792OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Aortic stenosisOT  - Aortic valveOT  - Rotary blood pumpEDAT- 2013/06/27 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/27 06:00PHST- 2013/06/24 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt263 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt263 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2013 Oct;17(4):616-24. doi:      10.1093/icvts/ivt263.

In      contrast, partial unloading of failing human hearts with left ventricular (LV)      assist devices (LVADs) can in some patients ameliorate heart failure symptoms.      Here we tested in heterotopic rat heart transplant models whether partial      volume-loading (VL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonary       artery of donor to left atrium of donor, superior vena cava of donor to inferior       vena cava of recipient; n = 27) is superior to the classical model of myocardial       unloading (UL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonary      artery of donor to inferior vena cava of recipient; n = 14) with respect to      preservation of ventricular morphology and function. Echocardiography, magnetic      resonance imaging, and LV-pressure-volume catheter revealed attenuated myocardial      atrophy with ~30\\\% higher LV weight and better systolic contractile function in VL      compared with UL (fractional area shortening, 34\\\% vs. 18\\\%; maximal change in      pressure over time, 2,986 +/- 252 vs. 2,032 +/- 193 mmHg/s). Interestingly, no      differences in fibrosis (Picrosirus red staining) or glucose metabolism      (2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET) between VL and UL were observed. We      conclude that the rat model of partial VL attenuates atrophic remodelling and      shows superior morphological as well as functional preservation, and thus should       be considered more widely as a research model.FAU - Didie, MichaelAU  - Didie MAD  - Institute of Pharmacology, University Medical Center Gottingen and Deutsches      Zentrum fur Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung, partner site Gottingen, Germany;FAU - Biermann, DanielAU  - Biermann DFAU - Buchert, RalphAU  - Buchert RFAU - Hess, AndreasAU  - Hess AFAU - Wittkopper, KatrinAU  - Wittkopper KFAU - Christalla, PeterAU  - Christalla PFAU - Doker, StephanAU  - Doker SFAU - Jebran, FawadAU  - Jebran FFAU - Schondube, FriedrichAU  - Schondube FFAU - Reichenspurner, HermannAU  - Reichenspurner HFAU - El-Armouche, AliAU  - El-Armouche AFAU - Zimmermann, Wolfram-HubertusAU  - Zimmermann WHLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20130614PL  - United StatesTA  - Am J Physiol Heart Circ PhysiolJT  - American journal of physiology.

Moreover latest generation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is      characterized by improved technologies.

Therefore, less      invasive surgery is now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange      of LVADs. Although experience with these new techniques is still limited,      minimally invasive procedures are thought to improve surgical outcomes by      declining the rates of operative complications such as bleeding or wound      infection. The miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive      techniques will be used for most LVAD-related procedures in the future.

Ventricular assist devices (VADs) for      adults have evolved dramatically over the last decade, both as a bridge to      transplantation and for permanent support.

However,      survival is poorer in HHTx recipients, and with improving results in continuous      flow ventricular assist devices (VADs), many patients can be bridged to allow      normalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic heart      transplant (OHTx) candidates. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyse the      survival of our HHTx cohort and compare them with our VAD bridge patients.      METHODS: A retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 OHTx and 27      HHTx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124      bridge-to-transplant VAD patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received       an OHTx. Pulmonary artery pressures before and after VAD implant were analysed.      Survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS:      HHTx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older,      smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the OHTx cohort. Comparison of the      VAD types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longer time      supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than the      pulsatile devices. The continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonary      artery pressures pretransplant. The HHTx cohort had a significantly poorer      survival than the OHTx cohort (P=0.002). Survival on a continuous device and then      OHTx was significantly better than either HHTx or pulsatile device support.      CONCLUSIONS: The main indication for HHTx, namely fixed elevated pulmonary      hypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by       continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.FAU - Marasco, Silvana FAU  - Marasco SFAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery Unit, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.FAU - Bell, DavidAU  - Bell DFAU - Lee, GeraldineAU  - Lee GFAU - Bailey, MichaelAU  - Bailey MFAU - Bergin, PeterAU  - Bergin PFAU - Esmore, Donald SAU  - Esmore DSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130531PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heterotopic heart transplantOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2013/06/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/30 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/05 06:00PHST- 2013/05/31 [aheadofprint]AID - ezt281 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Feb;45(2):372-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281.

Assessment of a stable and unchangeable      arrhythmogenic substrate is often difficult. Structural abnormality and      ventricular dysfunction, the two major risk parameters, may recover, and heart      failure symptoms can improve so that ICD therapy may not be indicated. Risk      stratification can take time while the patient continues to be at high risk of      arrhythmic death, and patients may need temporary bridging by a defibrillator in       cases of interrupted ICD therapy. The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD)      combines a long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring system with an external      automatic defibrillator. The LIfeVest(R) (ZOLL, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) is composed       of a garment, containing two defibrillation patch electrodes on the back, and an       elastic belt with a front-defibrillation patch electrode and four non-adhesive      ECG electrodes, connected to a monitoring and defibrillation unit. The WCD is a      safe and effective tool to terminate ventricular tachycardia/ventricular      fibrillation events, unless a conscious patient withholds shock delivery. It may       be used in patients in the early phase after acute myocardial infarction with      poor left ventricular function, after acute coronary revascularization procedures      (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) and      reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (</=35\\\%), in patients with acute heart      failure in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy of uncertain aetiology and prognosis. The      WCD may be helpful in subjects with syncope of assumed tachyarrhythmia origin or       in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The WCD may replace ICD      implantation in patients waiting for heart transplantation or who need a      ventricular-assist device. This review describes the technical details and      characteristics of the WCD, discusses its various potential applications, and      reports the currently available experience with the wearable defibrillator.FAU - Klein, Helmut UAU  - Klein HUAD  - University of Rochester Medical Center, Heart Research Follow-up Program, Box      653, 265 Crittenden Blvd. Rochester, NY 14620, USA.      helmut.klein@heart.rochester.eduFAU - Goldenberg, IlanAU  - Goldenberg IFAU - Moss, Arthur JAU  - Moss AJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20130531PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263SB  - IMMH  - Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*therapyMH  - Death, Sudden, Cardiac/*prevention & controlMH  - *DefibrillatorsMH  - Defibrillators, ImplantableMH  - *Electric CountershockMH  - ElectrocardiographyMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Preoperative CareMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk ManagementMH  - Syncope/prevention & controlOTO - NOTNLMOT  - ICD therapyOT  - Risk stratificationOT  - Sudden cardiac deathOT  - Wearable cardioverter-defibrillatorEDAT- 2013/06/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/13 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/05 06:00PHST- 2013/05/31 [aheadofprint]AID - eht167 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht167 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Heart J. 2013 Aug;34(29):2230-42. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/eht167.

This      project aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a bridge-to-transplantation      (BTT)-VAD approach relative to direct heart transplantation in      transplant-eligible patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was used to      evaluate survival benefits and costs for BTT-VAD versus nonbridged heart      transplant recipients. Three different scenarios were considered according to      severity of patients\\ baseline hemodynamic status (high, medium, and low risk).      Results are presented in terms of survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratio.       Sensitivity analyses were used to analyze uncertainty in model estimates. Over a       20-year time horizon, BTT-VAD therapy increased survival at an increased cost      relative to nonbridged heart transplant recipients: $100 841more in costs and      1.19 increased life years (LYs) in high-risk patients ($84 964/LY), $112 779 more      in costs and 1.14 more LYs ($99 039/LY) in medium-risk patients, and an      additional cost of $144 334 and incremental clinical benefit of 1.21 more LYs      ($119 574/LY) in low-risk patients. The sensitivity analysis estimated a 59\\\%,      54\\\%, and 43\\\% chance of BTT-VAD therapy being cost-effective for high-, medium-,      and low-risk patients at a willingness-to-pay level of $100 000/LY. Subgroup      analyses indicated that risk of post-VAD and transplantation complications,      waiting time, renal dysfunction, and patient age substantially affected the      cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSIONS: BTT-VAD therapy is associated with      improved survival and increased costs.

Emergent use of MCS is often required before      establishing the likelihood of OHTx. This can require bridge-to-bridge strategies      to increase survival on the waiting list. We compared the outcome of children      with heart failure who underwent single MCS with those who required multiple MCS       as a bridge to OHTx. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients aged less than 16      years was conducted. From March 1998 to October 2005, we used either a      veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VA-ECMO), or the Medos(R)      para-corporeal ventricular assist device (VAD). From November 2005 onwards, the      Berlin Heart EXCOR(R) (BHE) device was implanted in the majority of cases.      Several combinations of bridge-to-bridge strategies have been used: VA-ECMO and      then conversion to BHE; BHE and then conversion to VA-ECMO; left VAD and then      upgraded to biventricular support (BIVAD); conversion from pulsatile to      continuous-flow pumps. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients received MCS with the      intent to bridge to OHTx, including 21 (23\\\%) supported with more than one      modality. The mean age and weight at support was similar in both groups, but      multimodality MCS was used more often in infancy (P = 0.008) and in children less      than 10 kg in weight (P = 0.02). The mean duration of support was longer in the      multiple MCS group: 40 +/- 48 vs 84 +/- 43 days (P = 0.0003). Usage of      multimodality MCS in dilated cardiomyopathy (19\\\%) and in other diagnoses (29\\\%)      was comparable. Incidence of major morbidity (haematological sequelae,      cerebrovascular events and sepsis) was similar in both groups. Survival to      OHTx/explantation of the device (recovery) and survival to discharge did not      differ between single MCS and multiple MCS groups (78 vs 81\\\% and 72 vs 76\\\%,      respectively). CONCLUSION: Bridge to OHTx with multiple MCS does not seem to      influence the outcome in our population. Infancy and body weight less than 10 kg       do not tend to produce higher mortality in the multiple MCS group. However,      children receiving more than one modality are supported for longer durations.CI  - (c) The Author 2015.

We sought to investigate whether a similar      association exists in patients undergoing emergency heart transplantation.      METHODS AND RESULTS: By means of the Spanish National Heart Transplant Registry      database, we identified 704 adult patients treated with emergency heart      transplantation in 15 Spanish centers between 2000 and 2009. Post-transplant      outcomes were analyzed pertaining to patient preoperative INTERMACS profiles,      which were retrospectively assigned by 2 blinded cardiologists. Before      transplantation, INTERMACS profile 1 (critical cardiogenic shock) was present in       207 patients, INTERMACS profile 2 (progressive decline) in 291, INTERMACS profile      3 (inotropic dependence) in 176, and INTERMACS profile 4 (resting symptoms) was      present in 30 patients. In-hospital postoperative mortality rates were,      respectively, 43\\\%, 26.8\\\%, and 18\\\% in patients with profiles 1, 2, and 3 to 4      (P<0.001). INTERMACS 1 patients also presented the highest incidence of primary      graft failure (1: 31.3\\\%, 2: 22.3\\\%, 3-4: 21.8\\\%; P=0.03) and postoperative need for      dialysis (1: 33.2\\\%, 2: 18.9\\\%, 3-4: 21.5\\\%; P<0.001). Adjusted odds-ratios for      in-hospital postoperative mortality were 4.38 (95\\\% confidence interval,      2.51-7.66) for profile 1 versus 3 to 4, 2.49 (95\\\% confidence interval, 1.56-3.97)      for profile 1 versus 2, and 1.76 (95\\\% confidence interval, 1.02-3.03) for profile      2 versus 3 to 4. Long-term survival after hospital discharge was not influenced      by preoperative INTERMACS profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative INTERMACS profiles       determine outcomes after emergency heart transplantation.

Unloading of the heart with a left ventricular assist      device (LVAD) can lead to the reversal of many remodeling changes whose      underlying mechanisms are not yet completely known. Molecular analysis might play      a role in obtaining further insight into the regulatory mechanisms of this      process. A critical step in an RT-PCR study is the selection of reference genes      for data normalization. This study aimed to determine an optimal combination of      stably expressed reference genes in different regions of the human heart in order      to study the effects of LVAD implants on cardiac remodeling, and in particular to      check their reliability on the evaluation of pro-inflammatory cytokine      expression. DESIGN AND METHODS: We validated nine of the most commonly used      reference genes in human myocardium samples obtained at heart transplantation      from patients with LVAD implant (n=30 from a total of six patients) and from      heart transplant (HT from a total of seven patients) recipients as controls      (n=35). Samples from both left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles were analyzed. The       normalization strategy was tested by analyzing mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8 and       TNF-alpha, whose protein levels were measured by immunometric assay. RESULTS: The      most stable gene combinations changed according to the experimental groups (the      LVAD and HT groups and the different myocardial regions). Considering all the      cardiac samples as a whole, the three most stably expressed genes were PPIA,      RPL13A, and YWHAZ (M=0.70). Using the best normalization strategy, a significant       increase in IL-6, IL-8 mRNA expression was observed in LVAD samples compared to      HT (p<0.0001). Similar results were obtained by protein analysis. CONCLUSIONS:      Our results underline the importance of always selecting reference genes for the       specific system studied. The most appropriate normalization strategy is of      pivotal importance for understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with the      pathophysiology of HF, such as inflammation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It can be used for      long-term support of the left and/or right ventricule during end-stage heart      failure. The aim of this study was to share our clinical experience in 54      patients. METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, 54 patients with end-stage      heart failure underwent Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device      implantation, including 5 females and 9 children. Twenty-four patients (44\\\%) were      in Intermacs level 1, 11 (21\\\%) in level 2, and 19 (35\\\%) in level 3. Biventricular      support was applied to 13 patients. Device implantation was performed with an \\\"on      pump\\\" beating heart technique while 6 other patients underwent intervention      operations while the aortic valve has under cross-clamp. Tricuspid annuloplasty      was performed in 6 patients. RESULTS: There was no peroperative death. Nine      patients (17\\\%) underwent re-exploration because of hemorrhage in the early      postoperative period. Heart transplantation was performed in 32 patients (59\\\%),      while 10 (19\\\%) are still under pump support with a mean follow-up of 13 months.      Although 1 was successfully weaned from the system, 11 patients (20\\\%) died during      the support. Pump-head exchange was required 19 times in 17 patients because of      visible thrombus or fibrin deposit in the pump head or due to membrane rupture.      DISCUSSION: The use of long-term paracorporeal assist devices has decreased in      recent years because of the increased popularity of implantable devices that      permit longer survival and a better quality of life. We believe that the Berlin      Heart EXCOR has a special role because it can be used in pediatric patients and      especially in critical conditions like Intermacs levels 1 and 2.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We report our      initial experience with the DuraHeart as a bridge to heart transplantation.      METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, 23 patients (17 males; mean age 35      years, range 16-53 years) with endstage heart failure underwent implantation with      the DuraHeart LVAD at Osaka University Hospital. Of those, 7 underwent conversion      surgery from a Nipro paracorporeal LVAD to the DuraHeart. There were no deaths      during the mean support period of 559+/-241 days (176-999 days). In total, 17      patients (74\\\%) remain with the LVAD and 5 (22\\\%) underwent heart transplantation      after 580+/-302 days (176-982 days) of support. Major adverse events included 8      (34\\\%) driveline/pocket infections, 4 (17\\\%) cerebrovascular accidents, 4 (17\\\%)      right heart failures requiring mechanical support, and 3 (13\\\%) mechanical device       failures (magnetic levitation failure caused by driveline fracture). Of the 5      patients who developed pump pocket infection, 3 underwent previous conversion      surgery from the Nipro LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with the      DuraHeart LVAD in Japan demonstrated excellent long-term survival with acceptable      rates of adverse events. With refinement of the system, including mechanical      durability, this pump will further enhance the quality of life for patients who      require long-term mechanical circulatory support.FAU - Sakaguchi, TaichiAU  - Sakaguchi TAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of      Medicine, Osaka, Japan.FAU - Matsumiya, GoroAU  - Matsumiya GFAU - Yoshioka, DaisukeAU  - Yoshioka DFAU - Miyagawa, ShigeruAU  - Miyagawa SFAU - Nishi, HiroyukiAU  - Nishi HFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Fukushima, SatsukiAU  - Fukushima SFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Ueno, TakayoshiAU  - Ueno TFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20130418PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *MagneticsMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Prosthesis ImplantationMH  - *Quality of LifeEDAT- 2013/04/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/05 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/19 06:00PHST- 2013/04/18 [aheadofprint]AID - DN/JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-12-1410 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2013;77(7):1736-41.

While      there have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage      cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has      increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the       setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardium      also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to      its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets       of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to      summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery      following VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric      myocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients.      Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions of      their cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of information      about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to      determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or      just recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult gene      expression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40\\\% of genes to be      oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.      These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling       specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical      strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Weia, Benjamin CAU  - Weia BCAD  - Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.FAU - Adachi, IkiAU  - Adachi IFAU - Jacot, Jeffrey GAU  - Jacot JGLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150410TA  - Artif OrgansJT  - Artificial organsJID - 7802778OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Bridge to recoveryOT  - Gene expressionOT  - Heart failureOT  - Pediatric cardiomyopathyOT  - Reverse remodelingOT  - Ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00AID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/aor.12451.- 25865791own - nlmstat- publisherda  - 20150413lr  - 20150414is  - 1525-1594 (electronic)is  - 0160-564x (linking)dp  - 2015 apr 10ti  - clinical and molecular comparison of pediatric and adult reverse remodeling with       ventricular assist devices.lid - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]ab  - ventricular assist device (vad) support induces reverse remodeling of failing      myocardium that leads to occasional functional recovery of the adult heart. while      there have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage      cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has      increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric vads in the       setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. pediatric myocardium      also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to      its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. to identify potential targets       of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to      summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery      following vad support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric      myocardium induced by vad support compared with those observed in adult patients.      several clinical series of pediatric vad cases report that small proportions of      their cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of information      about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to      determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or      just recovery from acute illness. a comparison of pediatric and adult gene      expression changes with vad support reveals approximately 40\\\% of genes to be      oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.      these observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling       specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical      strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.ci  - copyright (c) 2015 international center for artificial organs and transplantation      and wiley periodicals, inc.fau - weia, benjamin cau  - weia bcad  - department of bioengineering, rice university, houston, tx, usa.fau - adachi, ikiau  - adachi ifau - jacot, jeffrey gau  - jacot jgla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20150410ta  - artif organsjt  - artificial organsjid - 7802778oto - notnlmot  - bridge to recoveryot  - gene expressionot  - heart failureot  - pediatric cardiomyopathyot  - reverse remodelingot  - ventricular assist deviceedat- 2015/04/14 06:00mhda- 2015/04/14 06:00crdt- 2015/04/14 06:00aid - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]pst - aheadofprintso  - artif organs. 2015 apr 10. doi: 10.1111/aor.12451.',medicine

Since the arrival of newer ventricular assist devices,      mechanical circulatory support constitutes an alternative therapy for patients      with advanced heart failure. The first-generation of pulsatile-flow devices were       used only for bridging the sickest patients to transplantation. Frequent adverse       events, limited durability and the patients\\ discomfort made them unsuitable for       lifetime support. The second-generation continuous-flow devices were smaller,      quieter and more durable. Survival rates of patients improved significantly. This      led to a marked growth of device implantations, largely caused by an increase of       lifetime support. Survival of destination therapy patients is somewhat inferior      to the survival of bridge-to-transplant patients, in part due to their co-morbid       conditions which limit life expectancy. A subgroup of patients on destination      therapy with advanced, but stable heart failure and a low-risk profile reach      short-term survival rates equal or superior to the survival after heart      transplantation. These patients may be offered the choice of destination therapy       versus heart transplantation. However it remains unclear if long-term survival,      quality of life and functional status on lifetime support can compete with the      excellent results after transplantation.

The oxygenator enabled      immediate reversal of hypoxaemia and hypercarbia and recovery of the RVAD      function. The oxygenator remained within the VAD circuit for 15 days,      facilitating complete lung recovery. An oxygenator used in conjunction with a VAD      may be a life-saving therapy, allowing adequate oxygenation and ventilation in      severe respiratory and cardiac failure. Extended use may facilitate the      prevention of ventilator-associated lung injury and organ dysfunction.

However, mechanisms underlying      this benefit are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a model of mechanical unloading      of the left ventricle, we observed progressive myocyte atrophy, autophagy, and      robust activation of the transcription factor FoxO3, an established regulator of       catabolic processes in other cell types. Evidence for FoxO3 activation was      similarly detected in unloaded failing human myocardium. To determine the role of      FoxO3 activation in cardiac muscle in vivo, we engineered transgenic mice      harboring a cardiomyocyte-specific constitutively active FoxO3 mutant      (caFoxO3(flox);alphaMHC-Mer-Cre-Mer). Expression of caFoxO3 triggered dramatic      and progressive loss of cardiac mass, robust increases in cardiomyocyte      autophagy, declines in mitochondrial biomass and function, and early mortality.      Whereas increases in cardiomyocyte apoptosis were not apparent, we detected      robust increases in Bnip3 (Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3), an       established downstream target of FoxO3. To test the role of Bnip3, we crossed the      caFoxO3(flox);alphaMHC-Mer-Cre-Mer mice with Bnip3-null animals. Remarkably, the       atrophy and autophagy phenotypes were significantly blunted, yet the early      mortality triggered by FoxO3 activation persisted. Rather, declines in cardiac      performance were attenuated by proteasome inhibitors. Consistent with involvement      of FoxO3-driven activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we detected      time-dependent activation of the atrogenes program and sarcomere protein      breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, these data point to FoxO3, a protein      activated by mechanical unloading, as a master regulator that governs both the      autophagy-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasomal pathways to orchestrate cardiac      muscle atrophy.FAU -

Between January 2002 and January 2012, all patients <18 years of age who      underwent the implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR at Bambino Gesu Children\\s      Hospital were included. A total of 25 patients were included in this study.      Median age and weight at implantation were 22.4 months (range 3.6-154.2) and 10      kg (range 4.5-36), respectively. Diagnosis included cardiomyopathy (n = 20) and      congenital heart disease (n = 5). Eleven patients received atrial cannulation.      Nine patients underwent biventricular assist device support. Seven patients      underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before the implantation of the      EXCOR VAD. Median duration of VAD support was 51 days (range 2-167). Nine      patients had evidence of acute BI including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 5) and      cerebral ischemia (n = 4). Freedom from BI at 30, 60, and 90 days from VAD      implantation was 80.7, 69.9, and 43.3\\\%, respectively. Weight <10 kg at      implantation was significantly associated with BI. BI is a frequent complication       among children supported with EXCOR VAD and is associated with lower weight at      implantation.

Because of the      insufficient numbers of donor hearts, physicians and engineers are turning to      mechanical circulatory support in the form of ventricular assist devices (VADs).       Their clinical performance and increasing availability of various types, sizes,      and functions are increasing VAD recognition. However, for any implantable      medical device, especially one that is life supporting, performance and safety      must be evaluated both pre- and postmarket. It has been demonstrated that      specific pathology analysis can provide unique and important information to      augment the evaluation of performance and safety. To help ensure the safety and      efficacy of a device, we propose that regulatory agencies include pathology      analysis by experienced, independent pathologists with relevant expertise as an      integral component of device submissions. We believe that this analysis should      include both gross and microscopic components and, when warranted, supplementary       data obtained through radiography, electron microscopy, or both. The pathology      data acquired through these analyses should be correlated with clinical data to      yield a more thorough data set for submission to the governing regulatory body.      Submitting this coordinated analysis of data will demonstrate to regulatory      agencies (United States Food and Drug Administration, Therapeutic Goods      Administration, Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency, etc.) that the device      manufacturer shares their objective: making medical devices as safe and effective      as possible.

Mechanical      circulatory support using VADs has been an essential therapeutic tool for      patients with severe heart failure waiting for a heart transplant in clinical      site. Adaptive control of VADs that automatically adjust the pump output with      changes in a patient state is one of the important approaches for enhanced      therapeutic efficacy, prevention of complications and quality of life      improvement. However adaptively controlling a VAD in the realistic situation      would be difficult because it is necessary to model the whole including the VAD      and the cardiovascular dynamics. To solve this problem, we propose an application      of attractor selection algorithm using stochastic behavior to a VAD control      system. In this study, we sought to investigate whether this proposed method can       be used to adaptively control of a VAD in the simple case of a continuous flow      VAD. The flow rate control algorithm was constructed on the basis of a      stochastically searching algorithm as one example of application. The validity of      the constructed control algorithm was examined in a mock circuit. As a result, in      response to a low-flow state with the different causes, the flow rate of the pump      reached a target value with self adaptive behavior without designing the detailed      control rule based on the experience or the model of the control target.FAU - Ohnuma, KentaroAU  - Ohnuma KFAU - Sumikura, HirohitoAU  - Sumikura HFAU - Homma, AkihikoAU  - Homma AFAU - Tsukiya, TomonoriAU  - Tsukiya TFAU - Mizuno, ToshihideAU  - Mizuno TFAU - Takewa, YoshiakiAU  - Takewa YFAU - Tatsumi, EisukeAU  - Tatsumi ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tPL  - United StatesTA  - Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol SocJT  - Conference proceedings : ...

Several studies showed that use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      in patients with fixed PH who were initially deemed ineligible for HTx      effectively decreased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), thus permitting HTx. We       recently encountered a candidate for HTx who had severe PH with extremely high      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). A 27-year-old female who had been diagnosed       with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and who was approved for HTx at      age 25 was referred to our institute because of severe fatigability with moderate      dyspnea even at rest due to severe bilateral heart failure. Despite continuous      inotrope infusion, the patient\\s symptoms were not relieved. Right heart      catheterization (RHC) disclosed a PAP of 62/40 mmHg with severely reduced cardiac      output (1.8 l/min). A PVR of 15.9 Wood units suggested progressive worsening of      left ventricular function with almost irreversible remodeling of the pulmonary      vasculature, and the patient was thought to be contraindicated for HTx. Following      3 weeks of aggressive medical treatment, repeat RHC demonstrated PVR lowering to       8.16 Wood units. This suggested it was likely that PVR could be reversed, and the      patient underwent LVAD implantation. RHC performed after LVAD implantation showed      a fall in PVR from the initial, extremely high measurement of 15.9 Wood units to       3.4 Wood units at 2 months postoperatively, and to 2.2 Wood units at 1 year.

The clinical results of eight      patients, who underwent LVAD implantation with the Jarvik 2000 (median age 55.0      years; six men) between 2005 and 2010, including two who participated in a      multicenter clinical trial in Japan, were reviewed. Two patients underwent LVAD      implantation as destination therapy. Four patients underwent Jarvik 2000      implantation via median sternotomy, while the other four underwent implantation      via left thoracotomy. There were no major complications during surgery. Four      patients were supported for more than 2 years. The longest support duration was      1,618 days. Six patients successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a      median 725 days of support. One patient on destination therapy died of a cerebral      infarction. The other patient on destination therapy had had the LVAD for 1,618      days. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100, 86, and 86\\\%,      respectively. The median postoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase level was      860.5 U/L at 1 month, 735 U/L at 6 months, and 692 U/L at 1 year. There were no      fatal device-related infections. We found that the Jarvik 2000 with pin bearing      could support patients with end-stage heart failure with acceptable mortality and      morbidity rates.

Patients listed for HTx have a prolonged waiting time (that is about 2.3 years in      the 2006-2010 time period in Italy) that is superior compared with patients who      receive HTx (median time around 6 months), to underline the presence of an      allocation system that prioritizes candidates in critical conditions. Patients      listed for HTx have a poor quality of life and their annual mortality is around      8-10\\\%. Another 10-15\\\% of HTx candidates are removed from the waiting list each      year because they are no longer suitable for transplantation. On the other hand,       continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been demonstrated to      improve survival and quality of life of patients with advanced/refractory HF.      LVAD therapy can represent a valid alternative to HTx, and it is recommended for       patients with advanced HF in the recent edition of the European Society of      Cardiology guidelines on HF management. In the United States, a larger number of       centers compared with European ones started to apply a strategy of LVAD implant      for many patients who meet clinical criteria for listing for HTx. Data from our      center concerning the last 6 years of LVAD implant (51 implants since 2006)      reported a 75.5\\\% survival rate at 1 year. In Italian series, as in our center,      current HTx survival is only slightly superior (83\\\% survival rate at 1 year),      based on data from the Italian National Transplant Center.

However, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition after      application of LVADs is not clearly defined. The purpose of the present study was      to investigate ECM remodeling after mechanical unloading in a rat heart      transplant model. Sixty male Lewis rats were subjected to abdominal heterotopic      heart transplantation, and the transplanted hearts were pressure- and      volume-unloaded. The age- and weight- matched male Lewis rats who had undergone      open thoracic surgeries were used as the control. Left ventricle ECM accumulation      and the expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue      inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were measured on the third,      seventh, and fourteenth days after transplantation/sham surgery. Compared with      the control group, myocardial ECM deposition significantly increased on the      seventh and fourteenth days after heart transplantation (P < 0.05) and peaked on       the 14th day. The gelatinase activity as well as mRNA expression of MMP-2 and      MMP-9 significantly increased after transplantation (P < 0.05). Both mRNA and      protein levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 significantly increased compared with those      of the control group. Mechanical unloading may lead to adverse remodeling of the       ECM of the left ventricle.

One of the most promising       new alternatives to heart transplantation is use of ventricular assist devices      (VADs). To date, there are no guidelines for appropriate selection for use of      these devices that are approved by national societies in the field. This review      addresses all of the general criteria for clinicians to keep in mind regarding      when to refer a patient for evaluation and the specific issues addressed in      patient selection. The field of mechanical circulatory support has advanced      significantly over the past 10 years, resulting in rapid expansion of patients      with advanced heart failure who can benefit from implantable devices. With      progress of technology, limitations associated with age, body size, and      comorbidities gradually become less prohibitive. The continuing simplification of      design along with continued reduction in size of the devices, plus eventual      elimination of the external drive line will make the use of VADs a superior      option to heart transplant and even to medical management in many patients.

We sought to establish the      important haemodynamic determinants of alterations in serum creatinine. METHODS      AND RESULTS: We reviewed data from 443 patients treated for ADHF with      haemodynamic guidance in a single centre. WRF and IRF were defined as a 25\\\%      increase or decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from time of       admission to pulmonary artery catheter removal, respectively. Of the 443      patients, 46 (10\\\%) experienced WRF and 127 (29\\\%) had IRF. Baseline eGFR was lower      in patients with IRF when compared with stable patients or those with WRF (45 +/-      25 vs. 63 +/- 30 vs. 68 +/- 27 mL/min/m(2), respectively, P < 0.0001). In      contrast, the relative decrease in mean blood pressure (BP) was more pronounced      in patients with WRF when compared with stable patients or those with IRF (15 +/-      15 vs. 9 +/- 17 vs. 4 +/- 15\\\%, respectively, P = 0.003). With larger decreases in      mean BP, there was greater likelihood of experiencing WRF (P = 0.04) but less      likelihood of experiencing IRF (P = 0.01). In contrast, the degree of changes in       right atrial pressure or cardiac index did not affect the propensity for      developing WRF or IRF. There was no difference in adverse clinical outcomes      (death, heart transplantation, LV assist device implantation, or readmission)      between the three groups (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Blood pressure decrease, rather       than alterations in cardiac output or central venous pressure, were associated      with changes in serum creatinine during treatment of ADHF.FAU - Dupont, MatthiasAU  - Dupont MAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland      Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.FAU - Mullens, WilfriedAU  - Mullens WFAU - Finucan, MichaelAU  - Finucan MFAU - Taylor, David OAU  - Taylor DOFAU - Starling, Randall CAU  - Starling RCFAU - Tang, W H WilsonAU  - Tang WHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20130102PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595RN  - AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Blood Pressure/*physiologyMH  - Creatinine/*bloodMH  - FemaleMH  - Glomerular Filtration RateMH  - Heart Failure/*blood/drug therapy/*physiopathologyMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Kidney/physiopathologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedEDAT- 2013/01/05 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/24 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/05 06:00PHST- 2013/01/02 [aheadofprint]AID - hfs209 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs209 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2013 Apr;15(4):433-40. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs209.

We report on our      two-center experience with MCS therapy. METHODS: Between January 2000 and      December 2012, 116 adult patients (mean age 56.8 +/- 9.9 years, range: 31 to 76      years) were primarily supported on temporary or long-term ventricular assist      devices (VADs) or total artificial hearts (TAHs) at our institutions. Temporary      extracorporeal radial VAD support was established in 50 patients (43.1\\\%) (Group      A) whereas 66 (56.8\\\%) patients received long-term paracorporeal and      intracorporeal VAD or TAH (Group B). LVAD support was established in 63 patients       (54.3\\\%), with BVAD/TAH support in 29 (25\\\%). A temporary CentriMag was the only      device adopted as an isolated RVAD support, being placed in 24 patients (20.6\\\%).       RESULTS: In Group A, the overall mean support time was 10.2 +/- 6.6 days (range:       3 to 43 days) and the overall success rate was 55.1\\\% (27 patients). The mean LVAD      support time was 357 +/- 352.3 days (range: 1 to 902 days) in Group B and 98 +/-       82.6 days (range: 8 to 832 days) in BVAD/TAH patients, with success rates of      72.5\\\% (37 patients) and 46.6\\\% (seven patients), respectively. The heart      transplantation (Htx) rate for both groups combined was 25.8\\\% (n = 30). The      overall one- and five-year survival rates after Htx were 73.3\\\% and 60\\\%,      respectively.

Cardiac transplantation has been the gold standard      treatment with high post-transplant survival rates and relatively good quality of      life. However, there has been an extreme shortage of organ donations, limiting      transplants to only a very small portion of patients with the condition. This led      to a growing interest in alternative options for the increasing population of      patients who are waitlisted or ineligible for transplantation. In recent years,      ventricular assist device (VAD) technologies have advanced from pulsatile blood      pumps to continuous-flow pumps that have demonstrated unprecedented      post-implantation survival rates. The HeartMate II, the only commercially      available, continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in the United      States and Europe, has been implanted in over 10,000 patients worldwide, setting       a benchmark for biomedical modalities of advanced heart failure treatment. Thanks      to the successes of contemporary LVADs, patients are able to enjoy a better      lifestyle, with a significantly prolonged life span and the ability to regularly       partake in physical activities. In this new biomedical generation, the usage of      LVADs has begun to expand towards the treatment for a wider range of heart      conditions, including earlier stages of heart failure. In fact, LVAD      implantations have surpassed the number of transplants taken place annually. An      increasing number of patients are considering the permanent, circulatory support       with an LVAD, namely destination therapy, as a promising option for treating      heart failure.FAU - Yamakawa, MichaelAU  - Yamakawa MAD  - Department of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, University of Tokyo      Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.FAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SFAU - Yamakawa, SeanAU  - Yamakawa SFAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MFAU - Kinugawa, KoichiroAU  - Kinugawa KFAU - Nishimura, TakashiAU  - Nishimura TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121221PL  - JapanTA  - Gen Thorac Cardiovasc SurgJT  - General thoracic and cardiovascular surgeryJID - 101303952SB  - IMMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Survival RateEDAT- 2012/12/25 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/25 06:00PHST- 2012/08/10 [received]PHST- 2012/12/21 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s11748-012-0181-5 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2013 Mar;61(3):111-7. doi: 10.1007/s11748-012-0181-5.

Bearings obtained       from HMII pumps explanted after clinical use in the Destination Therapy and      Bridge to Transplantation clinical trials were analyzed for wear using surface      profilometry. Geometric profile variations measured on the inlet bearing ball      were used to calculate the wear. Bearing wear was normalized to the total pump      support duration to obtain an annualized bearing wear rate. Bearing life was      estimated assuming a linear wear rate, as the time to reach a wear limit of 25      microm, which includes a 3x safety factor, to ensure that there is no contact      between the rotor blades and the blood bore housing. One hundred and eighty-three      bearings from left ventricular assist devices implanted in 181 patients were      analyzed. Average age of the patients was 56.3 +/- 14.6 years, 76\\\% were male, 46\\\%      had an ischemic etiology of heart failure. Mean support duration for the pumps      was 363 +/- 349 days (median: 238, range: 1-1,621 days). Sixty pumps (33\\\%) were      explanted at heart transplantation, 20 (11\\\%) after device replacement, 6 (3\\\%) for      ventricular recovery, 94 (51\\\%) after patient death, and 3 (2\\\%) were explanted for      other reasons. Mean bearing wear was 0.59 +/- 0.37 microm (median: 0.46 microm      [5-95\\\% interval: 0.25-1.48]). The median bearing wear rate for patients supported      for at least 1 year was 0.30 [5-95\\\% interval: 0.09-0.94] microm/yr. The 5-95\\\%      limits of the bearing wear rate corresponded to an estimated bearing life between      27 and 269 years. The pump having the highest bearing wear rate (1.46 microm/yr)       had an estimated bearing life of at least 17 years. HMII bearing wear is      extremely small, with an estimated bearing life well in excess of 17 years; it is      not a limiting factor for long-term support with the HMII left ventricular      assistive system.FAU - Sundareswaran, Kartik SAU  - Sundareswaran KSAD  - Department of Research and Development, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton,      California, USA.

As a non-stopping      pumping machine, it operates continuously to pump blood through our bodies to      supply all cells with oxygen and necessary nutrients. When the heart fails, the      supplement of blood to the body\\s organs to meet metabolic demands will      deteriorate. The treatment of the participating causes is the ideal approach to      treat heart failure (HF). As this often cannot be done effectively, the medical      management of HF is a difficult challenge. Implantable rotary blood pumps (IRBPs)      have the potential to become a viable long-term treatment option for bridging to       heart transplantation or destination therapy. This increases the potential for      the patients to leave the hospital and resume normal lives. Control of IRBPs is      one of the most important design goals in providing long-term alternative      treatment for HF patients. Over the years, many control algorithms including      invasive and non-invasive techniques have been developed in the hope of      physiologically and adaptively controlling left ventricular assist devices and      thus avoiding such undesired pumping states as left ventricular collapse caused      by suction.

We report on our experiences of these      patients with a follow-up of 132 patient years. METHODS: Seventy-four HeartMate      II axial flow pumps and 41 HeartWare centrifugal pumps were implanted in patients      with non-ischaemic (n = 70) or ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 45). The mean age of      the patients was 50 +/- 13 years. All patients were on inotropic support prior to      implantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used as a bridging      procedure in 21 cases. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 14\\\%. Hospital      discharge occurred on average after 46 +/- 33 days. Twenty-two patients of this      cohort received a heart transplant 492 +/- 342 days after implantation of the      device. Two patients died after heart transplantation. A 1-year survival of 73\\\%      and a 2-year survival of 69\\\% were recorded, despite a low incidence of transplant      procedures. The longest support time was 1686 days. CONCLUSIONS: Modern left      ventricular assist device technology can be used successfully for heart failure.       The scarcity of donor hearts leads to prolonged periods on the device, and      chronic ventricular assist device therapy has become a reality, although bridge      to transplant was intended; therefore, sufficient support services for outpatient      care of these patients are required.FAU - Meyer, Anna LAU  - Meyer ALAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery, Hannover      Medical School, Hannover, Germany.FAU - Malehsa, DorisAU  - Malehsa DFAU - Bara, ChristophAU  - Bara CFAU - Haverich, AxelAU  - Haverich AFAU - Strueber, MartinAU  - Strueber MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121209PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Cardiomyopathies/*surgeryMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Length of StayMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - HeartMate IIOT  - HeartWareOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - OutcomeEDAT- 2012/12/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/07 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/12 06:00PHST- 2012/12/09 [aheadofprint]AID - ezs568 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs568 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Jun;43(6):1233-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs568.

We      describe our experience with the conversion of an extracorporeal ventricular      assist system (VAS), the NIPRO VAS, to an implantable LVAS, the EVAHEART LVAS. A       32-year-old man underwent a NIPRO VAS implantation as a bridge to decision for a       condition consistent with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support profile 1. He was later diagnosed with secondary      cardiomyopathy due to cardiac sarcoidosis. During the period in which he had      NIPRO VAS support, no significant bacterial cultures were obtained from the      cannula-piercing site, and no systemic infection occurred. Approximately 5 months      after the NIPRO VAS implantation, he underwent an EVAHEART LVAS implantation as a      BTB. The procedure required technical modifications, including the anastomosis of      outflow grafts, trimming of the apical cuff, and creation of a pump pocket. The      operation was completed uneventfully. The patient completed the discharge program      for awaiting heart transplantation at home. Approximately 6 months after the      EVAHEART LVAS implantation, he continues to do well without any complications,      including infection, and visits our hospital as an outpatient.

So long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been proposed as an       alternative treatment option to assist patients scheduled on HTx waiting list      bridging them for a variable time period to cardiac transplantation-the so-called      bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) strategy. Nowadays approximately 90\\\% of patients       being considered for MCS receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). In      fact, LVAD experienced several improvements in the last decade and the      predominance of continuous-flow over pulsatile-flow technology has been evident      since 2008. The aim of the present report is to give an overview of      continuous-flow LVAD utilization in the specific setting of the BTT strategy      taking into consideration the most representative articles of the scientific      literature and focusing the attention on the evolution, clinical outcomes,      relevant implications on the HTx strategy and future perspectives of the      continuous-flow LVAD technology.FAU - Pozzi, MatteoAU  - Pozzi MAD  - 1 Department of Cardiac Surgery, \\\"Louis Pradel\\\" Cardiologic Hospital, Hospices      Civils de Lyon, \\\"Claude Bernard\\\" University, Lyon, France ;

Heart transplantation (HTx) can be postponed and for certain      patients even replaced by smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices      (LVAD). Mechanical support of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate      hemodynamic stabilisation and recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in       these severely ill patients. These new devices may be of great help to bridge      patients until a suitable cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed      as definitive treatment for patients who do not qualify for transplantation. Main      indications for LVAD implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to      transplantation or destination therapy. LVAD may be an important tool for      patients with an expected prolonged period on the waiting list, for instance      those with blood group 0 or B, with a body weight over 90 kg and those with      potentially reversible secondary organ failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.      However, LVAD implantation means an additional heart operation with inherent      peri-operative risks and complications during the waiting period. Finally,      cardiac transplantation in patients with prior implantation of a LVAD represents       a surgical challenge. This review summarises the current knowledge about LVAD and      continuous flow devices especially since the latter have been increasingly used      worldwide in the most recent years. The review is also based on the institutional      experience at Berne University Hospital between 2000 and 2012. Apart from      short-term devices (Impella, Cardiac Assist, Deltastream and ECMO) which were      used in approximately 150 cases, 85 pulsatile long-term LVAD, RVAD or bi-VAD and       44 non-pulsatile LVAD (mainly HeartMateII and HeartWare) were implanted. After an      initial learning curve, one-year mortality dropped to 10.4\\\% in the last 58      patients.FAU - Carrel, ThierryAU  - Carrel TAD  - Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland.      thierry.carrel@insel.chFAU - Englberger, LarsAU  - Englberger LFAU - Martinelli, Michele VAU  - Martinelli MVFAU - Takala, JukkaAU  - Takala JFAU - Boesch, ClaudiaAU  - Boesch CFAU - Sigurdadottir, VilborgAU  - Sigurdadottir VFAU - Gygax, ErichAU  - Gygax EFAU - Kadner, AlexanderAU  - Kadner AFAU - Mohacsi, PaulAU  - Mohacsi PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121018PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Swiss Med WklyJT  - Swiss medical weeklyJID - 100970884SB  - IMMH  - ComorbidityMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/instrumentationMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Perioperative Care/methodsMH  - Waiting ListsEDAT- 2012/11/09 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/23 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/09 06:00AID - 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 [doi]AID - smw-13701 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Swiss Med Wkly. 2012 Oct 18;142:w13701. doi: 10.4414/smw.2012.13701.- 23135811own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20121108dcom- 20130522is  - 1424-3997 (electronic)is  - 0036-7672 (linking)vi  - 142dp  - 2012ti  - continuous flow left ventricular assist devices: a valid option for heart failure      patients.pg  - w13701lid - 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 [doi]lid - swiss med wkly. 2012;142:w13701 [pii]ab  - recent outstanding clinical advances with new mechanical circulatory systems      (mcs) have led to additional strategies in the treatment of end stage heart      failure (hf). heart transplantation (htx) can be postponed and for certain      patients even replaced by smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices      (lvad). mechanical support of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate      hemodynamic stabilisation and recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in       these severely ill patients. these new devices may be of great help to bridge      patients until a suitable cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed      as definitive treatment for patients who do not qualify for transplantation. main      indications for lvad implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to      transplantation or destination therapy. lvad may be an important tool for      patients with an expected prolonged period on the waiting list, for instance      those with blood group 0 or b, with a body weight over 90 kg and those with      potentially reversible secondary organ failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.      however, lvad implantation means an additional heart operation with inherent      peri-operative risks and complications during the waiting period. finally,      cardiac transplantation in patients with prior implantation of a lvad represents       a surgical challenge. this review summarises the current knowledge about lvad and      continuous flow devices especially since the latter have been increasingly used      worldwide in the most recent years. the review is also based on the institutional      experience at berne university hospital between 2000 and 2012. apart from      short-term devices (impella, cardiac assist, deltastream and ecmo) which were      used in approximately 150 cases, 85 pulsatile long-term lvad, rvad or bi-vad and       44 non-pulsatile lvad (mainly heartmateii and heartware) were implanted. after an      initial learning curve, one-year mortality dropped to 10.4\\\% in the last 58      patients.fau - carrel, thierryau  - carrel tad  - clinic for cardiovascular surgery, inselspital, bern, switzerland.      thierry.carrel@insel.chfau - englberger, larsau  - englberger lfau - martinelli, michele vau  - martinelli mvfau - takala, jukkaau  - takala jfau - boesch, claudiaau  - boesch cfau - sigurdadottir, vilborgau  - sigurdadottir vfau - gygax, erichau  - gygax efau - kadner, alexanderau  - kadner afau - mohacsi, paulau  - mohacsi pla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewdep - 20121018pl  - switzerlandta  - swiss med wklyjt  - swiss medical weeklyjid - 100970884sb  - immh  - comorbiditymh  - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/instrumentationmh  - heart failure/*surgerymh  - heart transplantation/methodsmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - hemodynamicsmh  - humansmh  - perioperative care/methodsmh  - waiting listsedat- 2012/11/09 06:00mhda- 2013/05/23 06:00crdt- 2012/11/09 06:00aid - 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 [doi]aid - smw-13701 [pii]pst - epublishso  - swiss med wkly. 2012 oct 18;142:w13701. doi: 10.4414/smw.2012.13701.',medicine

Surgical and device-based approaches have been introduced with the aim of      increasing systemic perfusion and in some circumstances promoting left      ventricular recovery by inducing reverse remodelling. Innovative counterpulsation      devices based on the established principle of the intra-aortic balloon pump have       been developed, and of these, the CardioVad and the C-Pulse System have been      introduced in clinical practice with convincing evidence of haemodynamic      efficacy. The evolution from pulsatile to continuous-flow left ventricular assist      devices has been associated with improved survival rates during the first 2 years      of support with the potential of matching heart transplantation outcomes.      However, blood contact with the device remains a significant challenge despite      the highly sophisticated technology currently available. Innovative      extra-vascular counterpulsation devices have been shown to overcome the      limitations of the intra-aortic balloon pump and rend the device suitable for      prolonged support. Monitoring of the performance of these novel devices is      essential, and carotid Doppler ultrasonography is of utility in assessing the      haemodynamic performance of the devices in a clinical setting.

VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of       life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of our      pediatric patients while supported with a VAD. DESIGN: In this prospective study,      pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement, and their parents, were      administered a generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then      periodically until heart transplant or death. Their final scores while on support      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.      RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VAD      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was       10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.      Eleven (85\\\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\\\%) patient remaining      alive on support. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was       1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total      and physical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups.      Self-reported psychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy      controls only. Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all      three comparison groups for all three categories (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A large       deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patients supported by a VAD compared      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant      patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group with more severe heart      failure. Improvements in QoL must be made, as time spent with a VAD will likely      continue to increase.CI  - (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Miller, Jacob RAU  - Miller JRAD  - Section of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of      Medicine, St. Louis, Mo, USA.FAU - Boston, Umar SAU  - Boston USFAU - Epstein, Deirdre JAU  - Epstein DJFAU - Henn, Matthew CAU  - Henn MCFAU - Lawrance, Christopher PAU  - Lawrance CPFAU - Kallenbach, JacobAU  - Kallenbach JFAU - Simpson, Kathleen EAU  - Simpson KEFAU - Canter, Charles EAU  - Canter CEFAU - Eghtesady, PiroozAU  - Eghtesady PLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150410TA  - Congenit Heart DisJT  - Congenital heart diseaseJID - 101256510OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart FailureOT  - PediatricOT  - Quality of LifeOT  - Ventricular Assist DeviceEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00PHST- 2015/03/16 [accepted]AID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Congenit Heart Dis. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.- 25864509own - nlmstat- publisherda  - 20150413lr  - 20150414is  - 1747-0803 (electronic)is  - 1747-079x (linking)dp  - 2015 apr 10ti  - pediatric quality of life while supported with a ventricular assist device.lid - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]ab  - objective: ventricular assist devices (vads) have emerged as an important      treatment option for bridging pediatric patients with heart failure to      transplant. vads have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of       life (qol) while on vad support is unknown. we aimed to evaluate the qol of our      pediatric patients while supported with a vad. design: in this prospective study,      pediatric patients who underwent vad placement, and their parents, were      administered a generic pediatric quality of life inventory (pedsql) 4.0 pre-vad      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then      periodically until heart transplant or death. their final scores while on support      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.      results: from january 2008 to july 2014, 13 pediatric patients required vad      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a pedsql. the mean age at implant was       10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.      eleven (85\\\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\\\%) patient remaining      alive on support. the median duration of support prior to their final pedsql was       1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. patients self-reported significantly (p < .05) lower total      and physical qol scores when compared with all three comparison groups.      self-reported psychosocial qol scores were significantly lower than healthy      controls only. parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all      three comparison groups for all three categories (p < .05). conclusions: a large       deficit exists in the total qol of pediatric patients supported by a vad compared      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant      patients; however, vad patients do represent a group with more severe heart      failure. improvements in qol must be made, as time spent with a vad will likely      continue to increase.ci  - (c) 2015 wiley periodicals, inc.fau - miller, jacob rau  - miller jrad  - section of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery, washington university school of      medicine, st. louis, mo, usa.fau - boston, umar sau  - boston usfau - epstein, deirdre jau  - epstein djfau - henn, matthew cau  - henn mcfau - lawrance, christopher pau  - lawrance cpfau - kallenbach, jacobau  - kallenbach jfau - simpson, kathleen eau  - simpson kefau - canter, charles eau  - canter cefau - eghtesady, piroozau  - eghtesady pla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20150410ta  - congenit heart disjt  - congenital heart diseasejid - 101256510oto - notnlmot  - heart failureot  - pediatricot  - quality of lifeot  - ventricular assist deviceedat- 2015/04/14 06:00mhda- 2015/04/14 06:00crdt- 2015/04/14 06:00phst- 2015/03/16 [accepted]aid - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]pst - aheadofprintso  - congenit heart dis. 2015 apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.',medicine

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects       of Iva during MU, in a rodent model of HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the      chronic effects (4 weeks) of Iva (10 mg/kg/day) alone and in combination with MU       [induced by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)] on whole-heart      and cellular structure, function, and excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in a       rodent (rat) model of HF, 12 weeks post-left coronary artery (LCA) ligation.      Effects of Iva were compared with those of beta-blockade using metoprolol [(Met),      250 mg/kg/day]. Iva, but not Met, reversed myocardial fibrosis, alone and in      combination with MU. MU-induced restoration of deranged E-C coupling was enhanced      by Iva to a greater extent than Met: both Iva and Met enhanced the recovery of      the Ca(2+) transient amplitude and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)      content, but Iva alone maintained MU-induced normalization of L-type Ca(2+)      current and t-tubule abnormalities. Met prevented MU-induced reduction in the      myocardial size (myocardial atrophy); Iva had no effect on this parameter.      CONCLUSION: Iva shows beneficial structural and E-C coupling effects during MU:      Iva reverses myocardial fibrosis and enhances the restoration of deranged E-C      coupling, displaying more beneficial effects than that of Met. These results      suggest that Iva may prove effective in enhancing functional recovery in heart      failure patients receiving LVAD therapy.FAU - Navaratnarajah, ManorajAU  - Navaratnarajah MAD  - Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung       Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Electrophysiology, Harefield Hospital,      Middlesex, Harefield UB9 6JH, UK.FAU - Ibrahim, MichaelAU  - Ibrahim MFAU - Siedlecka, UrszulaAU  - Siedlecka UFAU - van Doorn, CarinAU  - van Doorn CFAU - Shah, AdarshAU  - Shah AFAU - Gandhi, AjayAU  - Gandhi AFAU - Dias, PriyanthiAU  - Dias PFAU - Sarathchandra, PadminiAU  - Sarathchandra PFAU - Yacoub, Magdi HAU  - Yacoub MHFAU - Terracciano, Cesare MAU  - Terracciano CMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20121018PL  - EnglandTA  - Cardiovasc ResJT  - Cardiovascular researchJID - 0077427RN  - 0 (Benzazepines)RN  - 0 (Calcium Channels, L-Type)RN  - 3H48L0LPZQ (ivabradine)RN  - GEB06NHM23 (Metoprolol)RN  - SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - AtrophyMH  - Benzazepines/*pharmacology/therapeutic useMH  - Calcium/metabolismMH  - Calcium Channels, L-Type/physiologyMH  - Excitation Contraction Coupling/drug effectsMH  - FibrosisMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Rate/drug effectsMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - Metoprolol/pharmacologyMH  - Myocardium/pathologyMH  - RatsMH  - Ventricular Remodeling/*drug effectsEDAT- 2012/10/20 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/03 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/20 06:00PHST- 2012/10/18 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2012/11/09 [aheadofprint]AID - cvs318 [pii]AID - 10.1093/cvr/cvs318 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Cardiovasc Res. 2013 Feb 1;97(2):230-9. doi: 10.1093/cvr/cvs318.

These numbers continue to rise due to advancing technology and successes in      treating cardiac conditions and potentially fatal events such as myocardial      infarctions. According to Carrier (2005), individuals with damaged hearts are      living longer, and lives are being successfully saved with the surge of      cardiovascular assist devices developed in recent years, which are increasingly      used as a bridge to transplant. Despite the lifesaving capabilities of      ventricular-assist devices, these innovations pose risks and complications that      can be debilitating for patients and their families (Carrier, 2005). As this      complex trajectory is navigated, nurses provide care and support to the patient      and family while playing a unique role in the assessment and monitoring of these       devices. A family-centred nursing model provides a framework for practice when      nursing patients and families are in crisis. The foundations of the McGill Model       of Nursing are focused on a strengths-based approach, revolving around      collaboration between patients, family resources, and tailored interventions      (Gottlieb & Feeley, 2005). As students placed in a critical care setting, we      began to realize the complexity of care required to nurse these patients and      their families.

METHODS: A descriptive analysis was      performed of all heart transplantations performed until 31 December 2011.      RESULTS: The total number of transplantations is 6528. The average clinical      profile of the Spanish heart transplantation patient in 2011 was that of a      53-year-old male who had been diagnosed with nonrevascularizable ischemic heart      disease accompanied by severely depressed ventricular function and poor      functional status. The implanted heart was typically from a 38-year-old donor who      had died from brain hemorrhage. The average waiting list time was 122 days. Mean       survival time has progressively increased over the years. For the overall series,      the probability of survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 77\\\%, 66\\\%, 53\\\%, and 39\\\%,      respectively, whereas over the past 5 years the probability of survival at 1 and       5 years was 80\\\% and 73\\\%, respectively. The most frequent cause of death was acute      graft failure (16\\\%), followed by infection (15.6\\\%), the combination of graft      vascular disease and sudden death (14\\\%), tumors (12.3\\\%) and acute rejection      (7.7\\\%). CONCLUSIONS: The survival rates obtained in Spain from heart      transplantation, especially in recent years, place heart transplantation as the      treatment of choice in irreversible heart failure patients without other      established medical or surgical options.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia.

Studies have suggested that outcomes after VAD implantation may be      dependent on institutional procedural volume, and outcome data from      non-transplant centres are lacking. This study reviews the outcomes of patients      who received a long-term VAD at our centre to determine if these devices can be      safely implanted at tertiary care, low-volume, non-transplant centres. METHODS:      We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study, examining the clinical      outcomes of consecutive patients who received a long-term VAD over a 42-month      period. RESULTS: During the study period 73 patients required MCS, of whom 16      received a long-term VAD. This select group had a mean Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile of 1.6 (0.9) and      before implantation 94\\\% required at least 1 inotropic medication, 69\\\% had      suffered a cardiac arrest, 63\\\% required an intra-aortic balloon pump, 69\\\%      required mechanical ventilation, and 44\\\% required short-term MCS. The primary      outcome of survival to transplant or ongoing MCS at 1 year was achieved in 75\\\% of      patients. Operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital survival were 100\\\%,      88\\\%, and 81\\\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term VADs can be implanted at      low-volume, nontransplant centres with survival rates comparable with      contemporary clinical trials. Availability of a specialty trained      multidisciplinary team with expertise in short-term and long-term MCS options      facilitates appropriate patient selection and might be more important than      institutional volume in determining outcomes after implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

In this      patient cohort, there have been mixed results in mechanical circulatory support      device use as a bridge-to-decision therapy. We evaluated a continuous-flow      external ventricular assist device (VAD), CentriMag VAD (Thoratec Corp.,      Pleasanton, CA), in patients with various causes of refractory cardiogenic shock.      METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective review of adult patients who      underwent surgical CentriMag VAD insertion as bridge-to-decision therapy. From      January 2007 through June 2012, 143 patients received CentriMag VAD. The cause of      refractory cardiogenic shock was failure of medical management in 71 patients,      postcardiotomy shock in 37, graft failure post-heart transplantation in 22, and      right ventricular failure post-implantable left VAD in 13. Mean age was 52+/-16      years, and 71\\\% were in INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted       Circulatory Support) profile 1. Among 158 device runs, device configuration was      BiVAD in 67\\\%, isolated right VAD in 26\\\%, and isolated left VAD in 8\\\%. Median      duration of support was 14 days (interquartile range, 8-26). Survival was 69\\\% at       30 days and 49\\\% at 1 year. The next destination after the CentriMag VAD was      myocardial recovery in 30\\\%, device exchange to an implantable VAD in 15\\\%, and      heart transplantation in 18\\\%. The failure of medical management and the graft      failure post-heart transplantation groups had higher 30-day survival compared      with the postcardiotomy shock group. Major bleeding events occurred in 33\\\% and      cerebrovascular accidents in 14\\\%. There was no CentriMag pump failure or      thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bridge-to-decision therapy with CentriMag VAD is      feasible in a variety of refractory cardiogenic shock settings. Patients with      postcardiotomy shock have inferior survival.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Takayama, HirooAU  - Takayama HAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY. hirofu2@hotmail.com.FAU - Soni, LoriAU  - Soni LAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Kalesan, BinduAU  - Kalesan BAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Truby, Lauren KAU  - Truby LKAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Ota, TakeyoshiAU  - Ota TAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Cedola, SophiaAU  - Cedola SAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Khalpey, ZainAU  - Khalpey ZAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Colombo, PaoloAU  - Colombo PAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Mancini, Donna MAU  - Mancini DMAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Jorde, Ulrich PAU  - Jorde UPAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.FAU - Naka, YoshifumiAU  - Naka YAD  - From the Departments of Surgery (H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K.,      Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C., D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY.LA  - engGR  - T32 HL007854/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140715PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.

We report on our experience in the pediatric population. METHODS:      Retrospective review of 27 consecutive children offered mechanical support with      Berlin Heart as a bridge to heart transplant, and Jarvik 2000 as a destination      therapy from February 2002 to October 2011. RESULTS: The median patient age was      4.8 years (range = 75 days to 20.5 years). The median patient weight was 18.6 kg       (range = 2.9-63 kg). We divided the patients in two groups, including in group I       patients assisted for bridging to heart transplantation and in group II patients       with Duchenne\\s dystrophy assisted as destination therapy. In the group I, 11      patients required biventricular mechanical support (BVAD), but in all other      cases, a single left VAD proved sufficient (56\\\%). The median duration of VAD      support was 48 days (1 to 192 days). The median pre-VAD pulmonary vascular      resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5 to 14.4 WU/m(2)). Twelve patients      (48\\\%) were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median duration       of mechanical support of 63 days (range = 2-168 days). Ten deaths occurred (40\\\%),      three for neurological complications, two for sepsis, two for multiorgan failure,      and three other for device malfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our      patients has increased from 33\\\% to 75\\\%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from       89\\\% to 23\\\%. In the group II, two patients with mean age of 15.3 years were      assisted with Jarvik 2000, and both of them are alive in a follow-up of 10.4      months. In two patients with Rpi > 10 WU/m(2), unresponsive to pulmonary      vasodilatator therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2 WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of      BVAD support, respectively. Six patients (32\\\%) required at least one pump change.      Of 12 patients undergoing heart transplantation, five developed an extremely      elevated (>60\\\%) panel-reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,      confirmed by Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of      rejection in the first month after heart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The       survival rate after heart transplantation was 100\\\% with a median follow-up of      34.4 months (45 days to 8.7 years). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in children      with end-stage heart failure is an effective strategy as a bridge to heart      transplantation with a reasonable morbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer      an additional means to reverse extremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.       The total implantable system opens a future scenarios for patients not eligible      for heart transplantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The latter has become      increasingly popular in recent years, in the face of a donor organ shortage and a      rise in elderly patients ineligible for heart transplants. For these patients in       particular, device durability is a key contributor to survival, morbidity, and      quality of life. This systematic review aimed to assess the long-term durability       of current continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched      from their dates of inception to August 2014 for original studies reporting on      patients receiving continuous-flow LVADs. LVAD failure was defined as device      malfunction necessitating exchange or explantation, or causing patient mortality.      Pooled averages were calculated for outcomes and rates of device failure were      reconstructed from digitized graph curves using the software, WebPlotDigitizer      v3.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective observational studies with a total of 5,471      patients were included for analysis. The mean duration of LVAD support was 504.7       (range, 303-568) days, and the overall weighted incidence of device failure was      3.9\\\% (range, 1-11.3\\\%). On average, pump thrombosis was the most common cause of      device failure (50.5\\\%), followed by lead or cable damage (21.7\\\%), mechanical pump      failure (11.6\\\%), device-related infection (11.1\\\%), and surgical complications      from implantation (2.5\\\%). Long-term device failure rates at 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and       24-months post-implantation were 0.5\\\%, 1.8\\\%, 2.9\\\%, 4.5\\\% and 6.5\\\%, respectively.      CONCLUSIONS: With the expected rise in LVAD usage for end-stage heart failure,      particularly as a DT, the steady minority of patients experiencing device failure      is likely to increase. Further investigation is required into the incidence and      mechanism of major causes of failure, as well as design improvements that may      address these complications. There is currently a lack of guidelines and large      randomized studies reporting on the etiology and outcomes of LVAD failure.FAU - Xie, AshleighAU  - Xie AAD  - 1 The Collaborative Research (CORE) Group, Macquarie University, Sydney,      Australia ;

Routine postoperative care      encompasses patients who have undergone emergency ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation for acute cardiogenic shock, as a bridge to decision making, and      semi-elective patients who have undergone VAD implantation for end-stage heart      failure, either as destination therapy or as a bridge to heart transplantation.      Early postoperative management should focus on haemodynamic optimisation,      including fluid and inotrope therapy, VAD settings and support of right      ventricular function. Echocardiography is an essential tool in optimising      haemodynamics and identifying complications. Early postoperative complications      include bleeding, arrhythmias, right ventricular failure and infection. Late      postoperative problems include bleeding, thrombosis and thrombo-embolism, device       failure and psychological problems. In a small percentage of patients, weaning      and explantation of the VAD are possible.

From a surgical perspective, the treatment options for      effective long-term survival are usually limited to heart transplantation,      heart-lung transplantation or implantation of a destination mechanical      circulatory support device. Assuming an advanced heart-failure patient is indeed       deemed a candidate for transplantation, the patient is subject to shortages in      donor organ availability and thus possible further decompensation and potential      death while awaiting transplantation. Various extracorporeal and implantable      ventricular-assist devices (VADs) may be able to provide temporary or long-term      circulatory support for many end-stage heart-failure patients but mechanical      circulatory support options for patients requiring long-term biventricular      support remain limited. Implantation of a total artificial heart (TAH) currently       represents one, if not the best, long-term surgical treatment option for patients      requiring biventricular mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplant.      The clinical applicability of available versions of positive displacement pumps      is limited by their size and complications. Application of continuous-flow      technology can help in solving some of these issues and is currently being      applied in the research towards a new generation of smaller and more effective      TAHs. In this review, we discuss the history of the TAH, its development and      clinical application, implications for anaesthetic management, published outcomes      and the future outlook for TAHs.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While in      hospital, patients with a VAD have traditionally been taught by an educator nurse      with VAD expertise in preparation for discharge. In 2004, our centre implemented       a successful competency-based patient education program in post-heart transplant       patients and thought that a similar program may provide increased confidence for       bedside nurses to actively participate in VAD patient education prior to      discharge. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to create a      competency-based education program that would provide consistency in patient      teaching. A questionnaire was developed and completed by 13 bedside nurses. This       pre-test questionnaire indicated the need for a systematic and organized approach      to VAD patient teaching. Furthermore, adequate resources, consistency in teaching      methods, and feedback were seen to be essential. A pilot competency-based program      was designed to lead bedside nurses and patients through a series of learning      phases and has successfully been implemented. Since its implementation, the      questionnaire has been repeated with results reflecting satisfaction with the      revised competency-based program.

Renal       impairment can range from reversible ischemic damage to renal failure requiring      short- or long-term renal replacement therapy (2). Patients who require      mechanical circulatory support, such as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD),       as definitive treatment for congestive heart failure or as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation pose a unique challenge with respect to receiving dialysis,      because they experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality from infection in      the post-LVAD period (3-7). Acute dialysis access can pose an increased infection      risk. In this article, we present a patient who required renal replacement      therapy and a LVAD for management of acute-on-chronic cardiorenal syndrome while       awaiting heart transplantation. A literature review to determine whether      peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is superior for patients with profound      hemodynamic dysfunction and the need to minimize risk of infection did not offer       clear guidance about which modality is superior in patients with advanced      congestive heart failure. However, there is clear evidence of the superiority of       peritoneal dialysis in reducing the risk of systemic infection secondary to acute      dialysis access. Given the high risk of LVAD infection, we therefore conclude      that, to decrease mortality secondary to systemic infection, peritoneal dialysis       should strongly be considered in patients who require renal replacement therapy      before or after LVAD placement.FAU - Thomas, Bernadette AAU  - Thomas BAAD  - Nephrology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98125, USA.      bathomas@u.washington.eduFAU - Logar, Christine MAU  - Logar CMFAU - Anderson, Arthur EAU  - Anderson AELA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - Perit Dial IntJT  - Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for      Peritoneal DialysisJID - 8904033SB  - IMMH  - Cardio-Renal Syndrome/*therapyMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Peritoneal DialysisMH  - Renal DialysisMH  - Renal Insufficiency/*therapyMH  - Renal Replacement Therapy/methodsPMC - PMC3524848OID - NLM: PMC3524848EDAT- 2012/08/04 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/12 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/04 06:00AID - 32/4/386 [pii]AID - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Perit Dial Int. 2012 Jul-Aug;32(4):386-92. doi: 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076.- 22859837own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120803dcom- 20130611lr  - 20141105is  - 1718-4304 (electronic)is  - 0896-8608 (linking)vi  - 32ip  - 4dp  - 2012 jul-augti  - renal replacement therapy in congestive heart failure requiring left ventricular       assist device augmentation.pg  - 386-92lid - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076 [doi]ab  - \\\"cardiorenal syndrome\\\" is a term used to describe a dys-regulation of the heart      affecting the kidneys, or vice versa, in an acute or chronic manner (1,2). renal       impairment can range from reversible ischemic damage to renal failure requiring      short- or long-term renal replacement therapy (2). patients who require      mechanical circulatory support, such as a left ventricular assist device (lvad),       as definitive treatment for congestive heart failure or as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation pose a unique challenge with respect to receiving dialysis,      because they experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality from infection in      the post-lvad period (3-7). acute dialysis access can pose an increased infection      risk. in this article, we present a patient who required renal replacement      therapy and a lvad for management of acute-on-chronic cardiorenal syndrome while       awaiting heart transplantation. a literature review to determine whether      peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is superior for patients with profound      hemodynamic dysfunction and the need to minimize risk of infection did not offer       clear guidance about which modality is superior in patients with advanced      congestive heart failure. however, there is clear evidence of the superiority of       peritoneal dialysis in reducing the risk of systemic infection secondary to acute      dialysis access. given the high risk of lvad infection, we therefore conclude      that, to decrease mortality secondary to systemic infection, peritoneal dialysis       should strongly be considered in patients who require renal replacement therapy      before or after lvad placement.fau - thomas, bernadette aau  - thomas baad  - nephrology, university of washington, seattle, wa 98125, usa.      bathomas@u.washington.edufau - logar, christine mau  - logar cmfau - anderson, arthur eau  - anderson aela  - engpt  - case reportspt  - journal articlepl  - canadata  - perit dial intjt  - peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the international society for      peritoneal dialysisjid - 8904033sb  - immh  - cardio-renal syndrome/*therapymh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - *peritoneal dialysismh  - renal dialysismh  - renal insufficiency/*therapymh  - renal replacement therapy/methodspmc - pmc3524848oid - nlm: pmc3524848edat- 2012/08/04 06:00mhda- 2013/06/12 06:00crdt- 2012/08/04 06:00aid - 32/4/386 [pii]aid - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - perit dial int. 2012 jul-aug;32(4):386-92. doi: 10.3747/pdi.2011.00076.',medicine

However, studies of a large series of      applications are still lacking. We evaluate the safety and efficacy of the      HeartWare pump in 141 patients with end-stage heart failure at a single centre.      METHODS: A total of 141 patients (116 men and 25 women with a mean age of 52      years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV received implantation of the      HeartWare Ventricular Assist System between August 2009 and April 2011 at the      Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin. The outcomes were measured in terms of laboratory      data, adverse events, NYHA functional class and survival during device support.      RESULTS: The HeartWare system provided an adequate haemodynamic support for      patients both inside and outside the hospital. NYHA class improved to I-II. Organ      function and pulmonary vascular resistance improved significantly. In this cohort      of patients, 14 patients underwent heart transplantation, one had had the device       explanted following myocardial recovery, one had changed to another assist      device, 81 were on ongoing support and 44 died. The overall actuarial survival      rates at 6 and 12 months were 70 and 67\\\%, respectively, and the 3-, 6- and      12-month survival rates on a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support for      bridge to transplantation patients were 82, 81 and 79\\\%, respectively. Infection      and bleeding were the main adverse events. Four patients underwent an LVAD      exchange for pump thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The HeartWare system provides a safe      and effective circulatory support in a population with a wide range of body      surface areas, with a satisfactory actuarial survival time and an improved      quality of life. It can be used for univentricular or biventricular support,      being implanted into the pericardial space with simplified surgical techniques.FAU - Wu, LongAU  - Wu LAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xiehe Hospital, Tongji Medical College,      Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. wulong72@gmail.comFAU - Weng, Yu-GuoAU  - Weng YGFAU - Dong, Nian-GuoAU  - Dong NGFAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TFAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Hennig, EwaldAU  - Hennig EFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120801PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Apr;45(4):765. - 22858453own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130614dcom- 20140501is  - 1873-734x (electronic)is  - 1010-7940 (linking)vi  - 44ip  - 1dp  - 2013 julti  - outcomes of heartware ventricular assist system support in 141 patients: a      single-centre experience.pg  - 139-45lid - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs263 [doi]ab  - objectives: a third-generation ventricular assist device, the heartware      ventricular assist system, has demonstrated its reliability and durability in      animal models and clinical experience. however, studies of a large series of      applications are still lacking. we evaluate the safety and efficacy of the      heartware pump in 141 patients with end-stage heart failure at a single centre.      methods: a total of 141 patients (116 men and 25 women with a mean age of 52      years) in new york heart association (nyha) class iv received implantation of the      heartware ventricular assist system between august 2009 and april 2011 at the      deutsches herzzentrum berlin. the outcomes were measured in terms of laboratory      data, adverse events, nyha functional class and survival during device support.      results: the heartware system provided an adequate haemodynamic support for      patients both inside and outside the hospital. nyha class improved to i-ii. organ      function and pulmonary vascular resistance improved significantly. in this cohort      of patients, 14 patients underwent heart transplantation, one had had the device       explanted following myocardial recovery, one had changed to another assist      device, 81 were on ongoing support and 44 died. the overall actuarial survival      rates at 6 and 12 months were 70 and 67\\\%, respectively, and the 3-, 6- and      12-month survival rates on a left ventricular assist device (lvad) support for      bridge to transplantation patients were 82, 81 and 79\\\%, respectively. infection      and bleeding were the main adverse events. four patients underwent an lvad      exchange for pump thrombosis. conclusions: the heartware system provides a safe      and effective circulatory support in a population with a wide range of body      surface areas, with a satisfactory actuarial survival time and an improved      quality of life. it can be used for univentricular or biventricular support,      being implanted into the pericardial space with simplified surgical techniques.fau - wu, longau  - wu lad  - department of cardiovascular surgery, xiehe hospital, tongji medical college,      huazhong university of science and technology, wuhan, china. wulong72@gmail.comfau - weng, yu-guoau  - weng ygfau - dong, nian-guoau  - dong ngfau - krabatsch, thomasau  - krabatsch tfau - stepanenko, alexanderau  - stepanenko afau - hennig, ewaldau  - hennig efau - hetzer, rolandau  - hetzer rla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20120801pl  - germanyta  - eur j cardiothorac surgjt  - european journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the european      association for cardio-thoracic surgeryjid - 8804069sb  - imcin - eur j cardiothorac surg. 2014 apr;45(4):765.

METHODS: A cohort of 124 consecutive patients received ECMO for      refractory cardiogenic shock in our institution. Twenty-six of these were out of       hospital cardiac arrests and were excluded from this analysis. The median age was      43years, in the range of 11 to 73years. RESULTS: The median duration of ECMO      support was 4.5days. Mortality while supported by ECMO was 50\\\% with a median      support time of 2days. Weaning from ECMO was achieved for 49 patients with the      following outcomes: cardiac recovery (60\\\%), heart transplantation (26\\\%), and VAD       implantation (14\\\%). Median duration of support before weaning was 8days. Hospital      survival was 83\\\%, 61.5\\\% and 71\\\% for cardiac recovery, heart transplantation and      VAD implantation, respectively. ECMO weaning was significantly improved in all      patients who had normalized their renal function, and when duration of      support>6days (HR: 4.255 [1.255-14.493], p=0.02 and HR: 2.164 [1.152-4.082],      p=0.02, respectively). A creatinine level>14mg/l the day of weaning was a      significant predictor of death (HR: 5.807 [1.089-30.953]; p=0.04). Median follow       up was 2.4years; one-year survival rate was 78\\\%, 51\\\% and 75\\\% for cardiac      recovery, heart transplantation and VAD implantation, respectively. CONCLUSION:      With at least 6days of support, ECMO allowed a better patient selection for      myocardial recovery, VAD implantation or heart transplantation. Whether VAD      implantation or heart transplant in those patients is a better indication remains      to be evaluated.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The HeartWare Ventricular      Assist System HVAD; HeartWare, Inc.; Miramar, Fla, USA) is a new device that is a      centrifugal, intracorporeal, miniaturized and continuous flow pump that serves      simple patient use and enhanced life quality. This article reports the midterm      results of patients who underwent the heartware support system. MATERIALS AND      METHODS: We retrospectively compiled our data from December 2010, including 10      patients of mean age 51.8 years with 90\\\% males, 70\\\% of the overall patient cohort      had dilated cardiomyopathy and remaining ones, ischemic disease. Mean left      ventricular ejection fraction was 20.1\\\% and mean systolic pulmonary artery      pressure was 49.2 mm Hg. A single patient was grade 1; seven were grade 2; and      remaining ones, grade 3 according to the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) scale. All patients were operated with      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with moderate hypothermia. Tricuspid ring      annuloplasty was performed in 3 (30\\\%) patients. In one patient we removed a left       ventricular thrombus. In a case with severe aortic regurgitation, we placed a      simple coaptation stitch at the central portion of the three aortic cusps under      the aortic cross clamp. The mean CPB duration was 95.5 minutes. RESULTS: There      was no operative or in-hospital mortality. Mean support time was 250.67 days.      During the early postoperative period, one patient experienced a minor      hemorrhagic neurological event also requiring a tracheostomy due to pneumonia.      This patient has completely healed and on follow-up continues a normal life. All       patients were asymptomatic regarding heart failure. One patient unfortunately      died because of possible pancreatic cancer and sepsis. Two patients underwent      transplantations on days 159 and 172 of support. CONCLUSION: The HVAD system      provided effective circulatory support for patients with end-stage heart failure       with low adverse event rates. Long-term results are needed particularly for      destination therapy candidates.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Cellular      proteases, such as cathepsins, are involved in the progression of HF. The aim of       this study was to evaluate the role of cathepsin system in HF patients supported       by LVAD, in order to determine their involvement in cardiac remodeling. METHODS:       The expression of cysteine (CatB, CatK, CatL, CatS) and serine cathepsin (CatG),       and relative inhibitors (Cystatin B, C and SerpinA3, respectively) was determined      in cardiac biopsies of 22 patients submitted to LVAD (pre-LVAD) and compared      with: 1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at the moment of      heart transplantation without prior LVAD (HT, n = 7); 2) patients supported by      LVAD at the moment of transplantation (post-LVAD, n = 6). RESULTS: The expression      of cathepsins and their inhibitors was significantly higher in pre-LVAD compared       to the HT group and LVAD induced a further increase in the cathepsin system.      Significant positive correlations were observed between cardiac expression of      cathepsins and their inhibitors as well as inflammatory cytokines. In the      pre-LVAD group, a relationship of cathepsins with dilatative etiology and length       of hospitalization was found. CONCLUSIONS: A parallel activation of cathepsins      and their inhibitors was observed after LVAD support.

2) patients supported by      lvad at the moment of transplantation (post-lvad, n = 6). results: the expression      of cathepsins and their inhibitors was significantly higher in pre-lvad compared       to the ht group and lvad induced a further increase in the cathepsin system.      significant positive correlations were observed between cardiac expression of      cathepsins and their inhibitors as well as inflammatory cytokines. in the      pre-lvad group, a relationship of cathepsins with dilatative etiology and length       of hospitalization was found. conclusions: a parallel activation of cathepsins      and their inhibitors was observed after lvad support. the possible clinical      importance of these modifications is confirmed by their relation with patients\\      outcome. a better discovery of these pathways could add more insights into the      cardiac remodeling during hf.fau - d\\amico, andreaau  - d\\amico aad  - scuola superiore sant\\anna, institute of life sciences, 56100, pisa, italy.      andrea.damico@ifc.cnr.it.fau - ragusa, rosettaau  - ragusa rad  - laboratory of cardiovascular biochemistry, institute of clinical physiology,      consiglio nazionale delle ricerche (cnr), area della ricerca - via moruzzi, 1,      56100, pisa, italy. rosetta.ragusa@gmail.com.fau - caruso, raffaeleau  - caruso rad  - cardiovascular department, institute of clinical physiology, consiglio nazionale       delle ricerche (cnr), niguarda ca granda hospital, 20162, milan, italy.      raffaele.caruso@ospedaleniguarda.it.fau - prescimone, tommasoau  - prescimone tad  - laboratory of cardiovascular biochemistry, institute of clinical physiology,      consiglio nazionale delle ricerche (cnr), area della ricerca - via moruzzi, 1,      56100, pisa, italy. tommaso.prescimone@ifc.cnr.it.fau - nonini, sandraau  - nonini sad  - cardiovascular department, niguarda ca\\ granda hospital, 20162, milan, italy.      sandra.nonini@ospedaleniguarda.it.fau - cabiati, manuelaau  - cabiati mad  - laboratory of cardiovascular biochemistry, institute of clinical physiology,      consiglio nazionale delle ricerche (cnr), area della ricerca - via moruzzi, 1,      56100, pisa, italy. manuela.cabiati@ifc.cnr.it.fau - del ry, silviaau  - del ry sad  - laboratory of cardiovascular biochemistry, institute of clinical physiology,      consiglio nazionale delle ricerche (cnr), area della ricerca - via moruzzi, 1,      56100, pisa, italy. delry@ifc.cnr.it.fau - trivella, maria giovannaau  - trivella mgad  - laboratory of cardiovascular biochemistry, institute of clinical physiology,      consiglio nazionale delle ricerche (cnr), area della ricerca - via moruzzi, 1,      56100, pisa, italy. trivella@ifc.cnr.it.fau - giannessi, danielaau  - giannessi dad  - laboratory of cardiovascular biochemistry, institute of clinical physiology,      consiglio nazionale delle ricerche (cnr), area della ricerca - via moruzzi, 1,      56100, pisa, italy. danielag@ifc.cnr.it.fau - caselli, chiaraau  - caselli cad  - laboratory of cardiovascular biochemistry, institute of clinical physiology,      consiglio nazionale delle ricerche (cnr), area della ricerca - via moruzzi, 1,      56100, pisa, italy. chiara.caselli@ifc.cnr.it.la  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20141212pl  - englandta  - j transl medjt  - journal of translational medicinejid - 101190741sb  - impmc - pmc4274696oid - nlm: pmc4274696edat- 2014/12/17 06:00mhda- 2014/12/17 06:00crdt- 2014/12/16 06:00phst- 2014/09/11 [received]phst- 2014/12/02 [accepted]phst- 2014/12/12 [aheadofprint]aid - 10.1186/s12967-014-0350-7 [doi]aid - s12967-014-0350-7 [pii]pst - epublishso  - j transl med. 2014 dec 12;12(1):350. doi: 10.1186/s12967-014-0350-7.',medicine

In the UK, there was a      significant reduction in heart transplantation rates over the last decade, so      that transplantation from VADs is much less frequent. The objective of this study      was to determine outcomes and their predictors in this situation of low BTT      rates, and as patients were exposed to long-term support, the incidence and      outcomes of VAD thrombosis. METHODS: We analysed outcomes for 102 consecutive      patients between 2009 and 2013 (mean age 47 +/- 13; VentrAssist n = 6 and      HeartWare n = 96). The median duration of support was 462 +/- 426 days. RESULTS:       Survival rates on the device were 75 and 66\\\% at 1 and 2 years, respectively.      Older age and more acute INTERMACS groups were significantly related to reduced      survival within the first 90 days (P = 0.030 and 0.010, respectively). Poor      preoperative right ventricular (RV) function had a negative effect on survival      after 1 year (P = 0.009), though not earlier. VAD thrombosis (n = 24 HeartWare      and n = 1 VentrAssist) occurred at 0.18 events per patient-year for HeartWare and      0.07 for VentrAssist devices at a median time of onset at 404 +/- 281 days. There      was no significant effect of VAD thrombosis on survival. Only 14 of 102 patients       were transplanted at a median of 334 +/- 347 days, and only 3 were transplanted      within the first 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation left ventricular assist       device implants with a low rate of transplantation have similar survival to      destination therapy, and are susceptible to long-term complications of VAD      thrombosis and right heart failure.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.

METHODS: The aim of the study is to investigate the      significance of pre-existing RV dysfunction, tricuspid valve (TV) insufficiency,       and the severity of septal deviation following LVAD implantation on RV      dysfunction, as well as the outcome and short-term complications in 51 patients      from June 2006 to August 2010. Student t test was used to compare the data and      estimate the p value. RESULTS: Mean age was 55.1 +/- 13, with a male to female      ratio of 3.25. The 30-day mortality was 13.7\\\% (7/51 patients), and the overall      mortality was 23.5\\\% (12/51 patients). Meanwhile, 21 patients (21/51; 41.2\\\%) have       undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. The mean time of support was      314.5+/-235 days with a median of 240 days at the time of closing this study.      Echocardiographic evaluation of RV function pre- and post-implantation of an LVAD      demonstrated septal deviation towards the left ventricle in immediate      postoperative phase, which correlated with acute RV dysfunction (p = 0.002).      Preoperative RV dysfunction was a significant predictor of postoperative right      heart dysfunction following implantation of an LVAD (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION:      Preoperative RV dysfunction is a predictor of RV failure in LVAD patients. The      adjustment of septal deviation through gradual increase of the LVAD flow can      prevent the acute RV dysfunction following LVAD placement.FAU - Neragi-Miandoab, SiyamekAU  - Neragi-Miandoab SAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New      York, NY 10467, USA. sneragi@yahoo.comFAU - Goldstein, DanielAU  - Goldstein DFAU - Bello, RicardoAU  - Bello RFAU - Michler, RobertAU  - Michler RFAU - D\\Alessandro, DavidAU  - D\\Alessandro DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120627PL  - EnglandTA  - J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - Journal of cardiothoracic surgeryJID - 101265113SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*instrumentation/methodsMH  - Cardiomyopathies/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart Septum/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/physiopathology/*surgeryPMC - PMC3403957OID - NLM: PMC3403957EDAT- 2012/06/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/31 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/29 06:00PHST- 2011/11/19 [received]PHST- 2012/06/27 [accepted]PHST- 2012/06/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 1749-8090-7-60 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jun 27;7:60. doi: 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60.- 22738144own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120725dcom- 20130130lr  - 20141016is  - 1749-8090 (electronic)is  - 1749-8090 (linking)vi  - 7dp  - 2012ti  - right ventricular dysfunction following continuous flow left ventricular assist      device placement in 51 patients: predicators and outcomes.pg  - 60lid - 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60 [doi]ab  - background: right ventricular (rv) dysfunction following implantation of a left      ventricular assist device (lvad) is a serious condition and is associated with      increased mortality. methods: the aim of the study is to investigate the      significance of pre-existing rv dysfunction, tricuspid valve (tv) insufficiency,       and the severity of septal deviation following lvad implantation on rv      dysfunction, as well as the outcome and short-term complications in 51 patients      from june 2006 to august 2010. student t test was used to compare the data and      estimate the p value. results: mean age was 55.1 +/- 13, with a male to female      ratio of 3.25. the 30-day mortality was 13.7\\\% (7/51 patients), and the overall      mortality was 23.5\\\% (12/51 patients). meanwhile, 21 patients (21/51; 41.2\\\%) have       undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. the mean time of support was      314.5+/-235 days with a median of 240 days at the time of closing this study.      echocardiographic evaluation of rv function pre- and post-implantation of an lvad      demonstrated septal deviation towards the left ventricle in immediate      postoperative phase, which correlated with acute rv dysfunction (p = 0.002).      preoperative rv dysfunction was a significant predictor of postoperative right      heart dysfunction following implantation of an lvad (p = 0.001). conclusion:      preoperative rv dysfunction is a predictor of rv failure in lvad patients. the      adjustment of septal deviation through gradual increase of the lvad flow can      prevent the acute rv dysfunction following lvad placement.fau - neragi-miandoab, siyamekau  - neragi-miandoab sad  - department of cardiothoracic surgery, albert einstein college of medicine, new      york, ny 10467, usa. sneragi@yahoo.comfau - goldstein, danielau  - goldstein dfau - bello, ricardoau  - bello rfau - michler, robertau  - michler rfau - d\\alessandro, davidau  - d\\alessandro dla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20120627pl  - englandta  - j cardiothorac surgjt  - journal of cardiothoracic surgeryjid - 101265113sb  - immh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - cardiac surgical procedures/*instrumentation/methodsmh  - cardiomyopathies/physiopathology/surgerymh  - femalemh  - heart failure/physiopathology/surgerymh  - heart septum/physiopathology/surgerymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - retrospective studiesmh  - treatment outcomemh  - tricuspid valve insufficiency/physiopathology/surgerymh  - ventricular dysfunction, right/physiopathology/*surgerypmc - pmc3403957oid - nlm: pmc3403957edat- 2012/06/29 06:00mhda- 2013/01/31 06:00crdt- 2012/06/29 06:00phst- 2011/11/19 [received]phst- 2012/06/27 [accepted]phst- 2012/06/27 [aheadofprint]aid - 1749-8090-7-60 [pii]aid - 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60 [doi]pst - epublishso  - j cardiothorac surg. 2012 jun 27;7:60. doi: 10.1186/1749-8090-7-60.',medicine

However, many Japanese candidates have not received its benefits      due to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. The heart transplant waiting period       in Japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the Organ      Transplantation Law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900      days because of the increase in candidates. According to the Japanese Transplant       Registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (BTT)      with a ventricular assist device (VAD), and the average duration of BTT is around      800 to 900 days. The excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in Japan even       with such a prolonged BTT duration with VADs is confirmation of the excellent      clinical results of VAD support. Until April 2011, only the paracorporeal Nipro      VAD for BTT was covered by Japanese national health insurance. Analysis of the      clinical outcome of 303 patients who received a Nipro VAD (for left ventricular      [LV] drainage) as BTT showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days      (average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68      patients (22\\\%) required ongoing VAD support. Thus the Nipro VAD is an excellent      paracorporeal device. The 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials       of four types of implantable rotary blood pump LVADs (Evaheart, DuraHeart, Jarvik      200, HeartMate II) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of BTT using      implantable LVADs. Only 36 patients in seven Japanese heart centers have received      implantable LVADs, and this small number corresponds to the initial learning      curve. Therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use of      commercially available implantable LVADs becomes more widespread. The long      waiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellent      clinical outcomes of VAD therapy in Japan.FAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SAD  - Department of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, The University of Tokyo      Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.LA  - jpnPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - JapanTA  - Nihon Geka Gakkai ZasshiJT  - Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshiJID - 0405405SB  - IMMH  - EuropeMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*utilizationMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2012/06/20 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/22 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/20 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 2012 May;113(3):292-6.- 22708386own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120619dcom- 20120821is  - 0301-4894 (print)is  - 0301-4894 (linking)vi  - 113ip  - 3dp  - 2012 mayti  - [end-stage heart failure].pg  - 292-6ab  - the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure patients is cardiac      transplantation. however, many japanese candidates have not received its benefits      due to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. the heart transplant waiting period       in japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the organ      transplantation law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900      days because of the increase in candidates. according to the japanese transplant       registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (btt)      with a ventricular assist device (vad), and the average duration of btt is around      800 to 900 days. the excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in japan even       with such a prolonged btt duration with vads is confirmation of the excellent      clinical results of vad support. until april 2011, only the paracorporeal nipro      vad for btt was covered by japanese national health insurance. analysis of the      clinical outcome of 303 patients who received a nipro vad (for left ventricular      [lv] drainage) as btt showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days      (average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68      patients (22\\\%) required ongoing vad support. thus the nipro vad is an excellent      paracorporeal device. the 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials       of four types of implantable rotary blood pump lvads (evaheart, duraheart, jarvik      200, heartmate ii) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of btt using      implantable lvads. only 36 patients in seven japanese heart centers have received      implantable lvads, and this small number corresponds to the initial learning      curve. therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use of      commercially available implantable lvads becomes more widespread. the long      waiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellent      clinical outcomes of vad therapy in japan.fau - kyo, shuneiau  - kyo sad  - department of therapeutic strategy for heart failure, the university of tokyo      hospital, tokyo, japan.la  - jpnpt  - english abstractpt  - journal articlepl  - japanta  - nihon geka gakkai zasshijt  - nihon geka gakkai zasshijid - 0405405sb  - immh  - europemh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart-assist devices/*utilizationmh  - humansmh  - japanmh  - united statesedat- 2012/06/20 06:00mhda- 2012/08/22 06:00crdt- 2012/06/20 06:00pst - ppublishso  - nihon geka gakkai zasshi. 2012 may;113(3):292-6.',medicine

With the      shortage of donor hearts available for the treatment of end-stage heart failure,       VADs have been used to provide temporary treatment until a heart becomes      available. VADs provide external sources of power for mechanical circulatory      support and are capable of sustaining life over weeks and months. This study      provides preliminary details about the psychiatric symptoms and disorders of the       first eight children equipped with a VAD in Turkey. METHODS: Eight pediatric      patients who recently underwent VAD implantation, aged 1 to 16 years, were      evaluated using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia,      Child Behavior Checklist, Children\\s Depression Inventory, Beck Depression      Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and followed up for 6      months. RESULTS: In the first evaluation, five participants had a psychiatric      disorder diagnosis. Two patients had adjustment disorder with depressive and      anxiety symptoms; one had anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; and two had       major depressive disorder. The anxiety and depressive symptom levels in      questionnaires were consistent with psychiatric diagnoses. Two patients had heart      transplantation during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: To determine and treat       psychiatric symptoms and disorders at an earlier stage, it is important for      children and adolescents with a VAD and those who have undergone heart      transplantation to be evaluated by a multidisciplinary consultation liaison team       including psychiatrists, psychologists, consultant nurses, and counselors.FAU - Ozbaran, BurcuAU  - Ozbaran BAD  - Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Ege      University, Bornova Izmir, Turkey. drbbeker@yahoo.comFAU - Kose, SezenAU  - Kose SFAU - Yagdi, TahirAU  - Yagdi TFAU - Engin, CagatayAU  - Engin CFAU - Erermis, SerpilAU  - Erermis SFAU - Uysal, TaciserAU  - Uysal TFAU - Ayik, FatihAU  - Ayik FFAU - Karakula, SultanAU  - Karakula SFAU - Ulger, ZulalAU  - Ulger ZFAU - Atay, YukselAU  - Atay YFAU - Ozbaran, MustafaAU  - Ozbaran MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Psychosom MedJT  - Psychosomatic medicineJID - 0376505SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - Child, Hospitalized/*psychologyMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/complications/psychology/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/psychologyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/complications/*diagnosisMH  - *Patient Care TeamMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/methodsMH  - Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - TurkeyEDAT- 2012/06/12 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/04 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/12 06:00AID - PSY.0b013e318258853a [pii]AID - 10.1097/PSY.0b013e318258853a [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Psychosom Med. 2012 Jun;74(5):554-8. doi: 10.1097/PSY.0b013e318258853a.- 22685244own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120611dcom- 20121002is  - 1534-7796 (electronic)is  - 0033-3174 (linking)vi  - 74ip  - 5dp  - 2012 junti  - psychiatric evaluation of children and adolescents with left ventricular assist      devices.pg  - 554-8lid - 10.1097/psy.0b013e318258853a [doi]ab  - objectives: to evaluate the psychiatric symptoms of children equipped with a      ventricular assist device (vad) and follow them up for 6 months. with the      shortage of donor hearts available for the treatment of end-stage heart failure,       vads have been used to provide temporary treatment until a heart becomes      available. vads provide external sources of power for mechanical circulatory      support and are capable of sustaining life over weeks and months. this study      provides preliminary details about the psychiatric symptoms and disorders of the       first eight children equipped with a vad in turkey. methods: eight pediatric      patients who recently underwent vad implantation, aged 1 to 16 years, were      evaluated using the kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia,      child behavior checklist, children\\s depression inventory, beck depression      inventory, and state-trait anxiety inventory for children and followed up for 6      months. results: in the first evaluation, five participants had a psychiatric      disorder diagnosis. two patients had adjustment disorder with depressive and      anxiety symptoms;

We review our       experience with emergent peripheral cardiopulmonary support as a bridge to      decision in these patients. METHODS: A retrospective review from January 2009      through December 2010 was conducted of 26 consecutive adult patients at a single       institution with acute refractory cardiogenic shock who underwent salvage      peripheral cardiopulmonary support. RESULTS: There were 18 men and 8 women with a      mean age of 54 years (range 18 to 76). Indications for support: acute myocardial       infarction (n = 16), decompensated chronic heart failure (n = 2), refractory      arrhythmic arrest (n = 3), acute valvular pathology (n = 4), and unknown (n = 1).      Patients with primary postcardiotomy shock were excluded. Median duration of      support was 3 days (range 1 to 14). Decisions included: withdraw of support (n =       4), recovery (n = 5), and bridge to a procedure (n = 17). The procedures were      percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 4), left ventricular assist device (n =      9), heart transplantation (n = 1), and miscellaneous cardiac surgery (n = 3).      Overall survival to discharge was 65\\\%. In the recovery and bridge to a procedure       group, 78\\\% were discharged from the hospital and survival at three months was      72\\\%.

Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,      some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We       sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II      (HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure       and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD. METHODS:      This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patients transplanted during       2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were divided into two groups      according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) or required      additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were compared for      early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major early      post-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival. RESULTS: Early graft      loss was 10.7\\\% in isolated HMII and 25\\\% in HMII + RVAD patients (P = 0.26). There      were no observed differences in the rates of primary graft dysfunction (7.3 vs      0\\\%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5\\\%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25\\\%, P =      0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary artery resistance (odds ratio: 3.286,      95\\\% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant      predictor for adverse outcome of mechanically-bridged heart transplant      recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 +/- 5\\\% in isolated HMII and 75       +/- 15\\\% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate      that heart transplant recipients who required unplanned RV mechanical support      after LVAD implantation achieved comparable rates of early graft loss,      post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged      with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-year graft survival was      equivalent between those two groups. Given the small sample size, further studies      involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.

We present our      experiment of HTx using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with Thoratec       pneumatic ventricular assist device (TpVAD). METHODS: From May 1996 to June 2011,      among 410 patients who underwent HTx 23 required mechanical circulatory support      (MCS) with implantation of the TpVAD and 15 (65\\\%) of them received grafts.      RESULTS: The 23 patients included 4 female and 19 male patients of age range 10      to 80 years. Eighteen (78\\\%) of them needed ECMO before TpVAD implantation. Twelve      (67\\\%) were implanted with a TpVAD double bridge to HTx. The demand for MCS among       patients with acute hemodynamic collapse has led to major improvements in the      existing systems such as ECMO with double bridge to TpVAD. CONCLUSION: We used      ECMO as a rescue procedure for acute hemodynamic deterioration. However, during      ECMO support, left ventricular afterload increased. If prolonged support is      required, TpVAD might be required: 15 (65\\\%) of patients supported by ECMO with      TpVAD needed to a wait a suitable donor. We recommend the application of ECMO for      short-term support (within 1 week), and TpVAD as a bridge for medium- or      long-term support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Most can be managed with corrective or palliative surgery but a small group will       develop severe heart failure, leaving cardiac transplantation as the ultimate      treatment option. Unfortunately, due to the inadequate number of available donor       organs, only a small number of patients can benefit from this therapy, and      mortality remains high for pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation,      especially compared to adults. The purpose of this review is to describe the      potential role of mechanical circulatory support in this context and to review      current experience. For patients with congenital heart disease, ventricular      assist devices are most commonly used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation, an       application which has been shown to have several important advantages over      medical therapy alone or support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,      including improved survival to transplant, less exposure to blood products with      less immune sensitization, and improved organ function. While these devices may      improve wait list mortality, the chronic shortage of donor organs for children is      likely to remain a problem into the foreseeable future. Therefore, there is great      interest in the development of mechanical ventricular assist devices as potential      destination therapy for congenital heart disease patients with end-stage heart      failure. This review first discusses the experience with the currently available       ventricular assist devices in children with congenital heart disease, and then      follows to discuss what devices are under development and may reach the bedside      soon.FAU - Clark, Joseph BAU  - Clark JBAD  - Penn State Hershey Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center, Departments of      Pediatrics, Penn State Hershey Childrens Hospital, Penn State Hershey College of       Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.FAU - Pauliks, Linda BAU  - Pauliks LBFAU - Myers, John LAU  - Myers JLFAU - Undar, AkifAU  - Undar ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United Arab EmiratesTA  - Curr Cardiol RevJT  - Current cardiology reviewsJID - 101261935SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Defects, Congenital/surgeryMH  - Heart Diseases/*congenital/surgeryMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Palliative CareMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Tissue Donors/supply & distributionPMC - PMC3197085OID - NLM: PMC3197085OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Congenital heart diseaseOT  - Mechanical circulatory supportOT  - end-stage heart failureOT  - extracorporeal life support.OT  - pediatric heart transplantationOT  - pediatricsEDAT- 2012/05/02 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/25 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/02 06:00PHST- 2011/01/26 [received]PHST- 2011/06/13 [revised]PHST- 2011/06/30 [accepted]AID - 10.2174/157340311797484222 [doi]AID - CCR-7-102 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Cardiol Rev. 2011 May;7(2):102-9. doi: 10.2174/157340311797484222.- 22548033own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120501dcom- 20130124lr  - 20141016is  - 1875-6557 (electronic)is  - 1573-403x (linking)vi  - 7ip  - 2dp  - 2011 mayti  - mechanical circulatory support for end-stage heart failure in repaired and      palliated congenital heart disease.pg  - 102-9lid - 10.2174/157340311797484222 [doi]ab  - approximately one in one hundred children is born with congenital heart disease.       most can be managed with corrective or palliative surgery but a small group will       develop severe heart failure, leaving cardiac transplantation as the ultimate      treatment option. unfortunately, due to the inadequate number of available donor       organs, only a small number of patients can benefit from this therapy, and      mortality remains high for pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation,      especially compared to adults. the purpose of this review is to describe the      potential role of mechanical circulatory support in this context and to review      current experience. for patients with congenital heart disease, ventricular      assist devices are most commonly used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation, an       application which has been shown to have several important advantages over      medical therapy alone or support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,      including improved survival to transplant, less exposure to blood products with      less immune sensitization, and improved organ function. while these devices may      improve wait list mortality, the chronic shortage of donor organs for children is      likely to remain a problem into the foreseeable future. therefore, there is great      interest in the development of mechanical ventricular assist devices as potential      destination therapy for congenital heart disease patients with end-stage heart      failure. this review first discusses the experience with the currently available       ventricular assist devices in children with congenital heart disease, and then      follows to discuss what devices are under development and may reach the bedside      soon.fau - clark, joseph bau  - clark jbad  - penn state hershey pediatric cardiovascular research center, departments of      pediatrics, penn state hershey childrens hospital, penn state hershey college of       medicine, hershey, pa 17033, usa.fau - pauliks, linda bau  - pauliks lbfau - myers, john lau  - myers jlfau - undar, akifau  - undar ala  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united arab emiratesta  - curr cardiol revjt  - current cardiology reviewsjid - 101261935sb  - immh  - equipment designmh  - heart defects, congenital/surgerymh  - heart diseases/*congenital/surgerymh  - heart failure/*surgerymh  - heart transplantationmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - infantmh  - palliative caremh  - risk factorsmh  - tissue donors/supply & distributionpmc - pmc3197085oid - nlm: pmc3197085oto - notnlmot  - congenital heart diseaseot  - mechanical circulatory supportot  - end-stage heart failureot  - extracorporeal life support.ot  - pediatric heart transplantationot  - pediatricsedat- 2012/05/02 06:00mhda- 2013/01/25 06:00crdt- 2012/05/02 06:00phst- 2011/01/26 [received]phst- 2011/06/13 [revised]phst- 2011/06/30 [accepted]aid - 10.2174/157340311797484222 [doi]aid - ccr-7-102 [pii]pst - ppublishso  - curr cardiol rev. 2011 may;7(2):102-9. doi: 10.2174/157340311797484222.',medicine

VADs may serve as a bridge to heart transplantation or as permanent      circulatory assistance, also referred to as destination therapy. There is a      paucity of information regarding the nutrition complications in VAD patients, and      as such, little is presently known of the optimal means of nutrition assessment      and management of these complex and often critically ill patients. In this      review, a general overview of the VAD, comparisons of nutrition assessment      measures, and strategies to meet the nutrition needs of these patients are      provided using evidence-based information wherever possible. Because there is a      lack of nutrition studies and assessment guidelines specifically for VAD      patients, many of the guidelines for care of these patients are currently based      on the information available for the care of patients with heart failure.      Although the optimal measure to assess nutrition status remains poorly studied, a      systematic, thorough nutrition assessment of patients with heart failure and      heart transplant candidates prior to VAD placement appears to be important to      identify those at nutrition risk and, with appropriate nutrition therapy,      decrease their risk for morbidity and mortality. VAD patients with inadequate      oral intake may require nutrition support to meet their nutrition needs; however,      feeding the hemodynamically compromised patient provides additional challenges.FAU - Montgomery, Tricia DAU  - Montgomery TDAD  - Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, AZ 85054, USA. montgomery.triciadawn@mayo.eduFAU - Cohen, Ashley EAU  - Cohen AEFAU - Garnick, JamesAU  - Garnick JFAU - Spadafore, JeniferAU  - Spadafore JFAU - Boldea, EvaAU  - Boldea ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20120420PL  - United StatesTA  - Nutr Clin PractJT  - Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for      Parenteral and Enteral NutritionJID - 8606733SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - Heart Failure/complications/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Ventricles/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Malnutrition/diagnosis/prevention & controlMH  - *Nutrition AssessmentMH  - *Nutritional SupportEDAT- 2012/04/24 06:00MHDA- 2012/09/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/24 06:00PHST- 2012/04/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 0884533612444537 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0884533612444537 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Nutr Clin Pract. 2012 Jun;27(3):352-62. doi: 10.1177/0884533612444537.

AIMS: To explore the experiences      and coping strategies of LVAD patients\\ close relatives during bridge to      transplantation and to generate theory. METHODS: The study had a qualitative      design using grounded theory and NVivo version 9 to analyse one paired interview       (n=2) and one group interview (n=5) with LVAD patients\\ close relatives. RESULTS:      The main finding was the importance of supporting the close relatives who support      the LVAD patient. The core category was support and self-preservation in close      relatives. We constructed the support cascade model illustrating support from      close relatives to the patient (main obligation) and to other family members      (other obligations), and support from personal and professional relations to the       close relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Support from close relatives potentially benefits      patients, family, healthcare providers, and society in general.

The transverse (t)-tubule system guarantees the proximity of the       triggers for Ca(2+) release [L-type Ca(2+) channel, dihydropyridine receptors      (DHPRs)] and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channels [ryanodine      receptors (RyRs)]. Transverse tubule disruption occurs early in heart failure      (HF). Clinical studies of left ventricular assist devices in HF indicate that      mechanical unloading induces reverse remodelling. We hypothesize that unloading      of failing hearts normalizes t-tubule structure and improves CICR. METHODS AND      RESULTS: Heart failure was induced in Lewis rats by left coronary artery ligation      for 12 weeks; sham-operated animals were used as controls. Failing hearts were      mechanically unloaded for 4 weeks by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation       (HF-UN). HF reduced the t-tubule density measured by di-8-ANEPPS staining in      isolated left ventricular myocytes, and this was reversed by unloading. The      deterioration in the regularity of the t-tubule system in HF was also reversed in      HF-UN. Scanning ion conductance microscopy showed the reappearance of normal      surface striations in HF-UN. Electron microscopy revealed recovery of normal      t-tubule microarchitecture in HF-UN. L-type Ca(2+) current density, measured      using whole-cell patch clamping, was reduced in HF but unaffected by unloading.      The variance of the time-to-peak of the Ca(2+) transient, an index of CICR      dyssynchrony, was increased in HF and normalized by unloading. The increased      Ca(2+) spark frequency observed in HF was reduced in HF-UN. These results could      be explained by the recoupling of orphaned RyRs in HF, as indicated by      immunofluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that mechanical unloading of the      failing heart reverses the pathological remodelling of the t-tubule system and      improves CICR.FAU - Ibrahim, MichaelAU  - Ibrahim MAD  - Laboratory of Cell Electrophysiology, Harefield Heart Science Centre, Imperial      College London, London, UK.FAU - Navaratnarajah, ManorajAU  - Navaratnarajah MFAU - Siedlecka, UrszulaAU  - Siedlecka UFAU - Rao, ChristopherAU  - Rao CFAU - Dias, PriyanthiAU  - Dias PFAU - Moshkov, Alexey VAU  - Moshkov AVFAU - Gorelik, JuliaAU  - Gorelik JFAU - Yacoub, Magdi HAU  - Yacoub MHFAU - Terracciano, Cesare MAU  - Terracciano CMLA  - engGR  - FS/09/025/27468/British Heart Foundation/United KingdomPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20120401PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595RN  - 0 (Calcium Channels, T-Type)SB  - IMMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - AnimalsMH  - *Calcium Channels, T-TypeMH  - Disease Models, AnimalMH  - Disease ProgressionMH  - Heart Failure/*pathologyMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - MaleMH  - Myocardial Contraction/*physiologyMH  - Myocytes, Cardiac/*pathologyMH  - RatsMH  - Rats, Inbred LewMH  - Stroke VolumeMH  - Ventricular Function, LeftMH  - Ventricular RemodelingPMC - PMC3359860OID - NLM: PMC3359860EDAT- 2012/04/03 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/06 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/03 06:00PHST- 2012/04/01 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2012/04/18 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2012/04/18 [aheadofprint]AID - hfs038 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs038 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2012 Jun;14(6):571-80. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs038.

VADs decrease the symptoms of HF and improve quality of life by      replacing some of the work of a failing heart. They unload the ventricle to      provide improved cardiac output and end-organ perfusion, resulting in improvement      in cardiorenal syndromes and New York Heart Association functional class rating.       VADs are currently used asa bridge to heart transplantation, a bridge to recovery      of cardiac function, or as destination therapy. Complications of VAD include      bleeding, infections, arrhythmias, multiple organ failure, right ventricular      failure, and neurological dysfunction. Patients with VAD have unique      pharmacotherapeutic requirements in terms of anticoagulation, appropriate      antibiotic selection, and continuation of HF medications.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-eight consecutive New      York Heart Association class III and IV CRT patients with QRS >/=120 ms and      ejection fraction </=35\\\% were studied. The pre-specified primary endpoint was      death, heart transplant, or left ventricular assist device over 4 years.      Dyssynchrony assessed before CRT included interventricular mechanical delay      (IVMD) and speckle-tracking radial strain using pre-specified cut-offs for each.       Of 254 with baseline quantitative echocardiographic data available, 128 had LBBB,      81 had intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), and 45 had right bundle branch      block (RBBB). Radial dyssynchrony was observed in 85\\\% of the patients with LBBB,       59\\\% with IVCD*, and 40\\\% with RBBB* (*P < 0.01 vs. LBBB). Of 248 (98\\\%) with      follow-up, LBBB patients had a significantly more favourable long-term survival      than non-LBBB patients. However, non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a more      favourable event-free survival than those without dyssynchrony: radial      dyssynchrony hazard ratio 2.6, 95\\\% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-4.53 (P =      0.0008) and IVMD hazard ratio 4.9, 95\\\% CI 2.60-9.16 (P = 0.0007). Right bundle      branch block patients who lacked dyssynchrony had the least favourable outcome.      CONCLUSION: Non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a more favourable long-term      survival than non-LBBB patients who lacked dyssynchrony.

Nowadays, mechanical      circulatory support devices (MSCD) are an established therapeutic option for      terminal heart failure after exhaustion of medical and conventional surgical      treatment, and are becoming a realistic alternative to heart transplantation      (HTX). There are a number of different treatment options for these patients, such      as bridge to transplantation (BTT), bridge to candidacy (BTC), bridge to recovery      (BTR) and the destination therapy (DT) option. The latter option has become more       frequent throughout the last years, due to a donor organ shortage and an      increasing number of older patients with terminal heart failure who are not      eligible for HTX. These factors have led to a rapidly increasing number of LVAD      implantations as well as centers which perform these procedures. This has also      been due to improved LVAD survival rates and quality of life following the      introduction of smaller, intrapericardial and more durable continuous flow left      ventricular devices. The most common complications for these patients are      device-related problems, such as coagulation disorders, gastrointestinal      bleeding, device related infection, pump thrombosis or cerebrovascular accidents.      However, some questions still remain unanswered or under debate, such as the      exact time-point for LVAD implantation. In addition, aspects such as better      biocompatibility for LVADs remain a major challenge. This review will concentrate      on DT for terminal heart failure and provide an overview of the current evidence       for LVAD implantation in this patient group, with particular emphasis on      indication and time-point of implantation, choice of LVADs, and long term      outcomes and quality of life.FAU -

It is      characterized by maladaptive remodeling of cardiomyocytes, extracellular collagen      matrix (ECCM) and left ventricular (LV) geometry which contributes to further      dysfunction. LV assist devices (LVADs) can reverse adverse remodeling in      end-stage DCM. However, there is a disconnect between the benefits of prolonged      unloading with LVAD at molecular and cellular levels and the low rate of bridge      to recovery (BTR). Potential explanations for this paradox include insufficient      reverse ECCM remodeling and/or excessive reverse cardiomyocyte remodeling with      atrophy. LVAD therapy is associated with decreased collagen turnover and      cross-linking and increased tissue angiotensin II (AngII), whereas LVAD combined       with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition results in decreased tissue AngII      and collagen cross-linking, normalizes LV end-diastolic pressure volume      relationships and is associated with modestly higher rates of BTR. Much remains      to be learned about ventricular reverse remodeling after LVAD. This can be      facilitated through systematic collection and comparison of recovered and      unrecovered myocardium. Importantly, vigilant monitoring for ventricular recovery      among LVAD patients is needed, particularly in older patients receiving LVAD for       destination therapy. In addition, prospective multicenter trials are needed to      clarify the potential benefit of concomitant heart failure therapy with selective      beta2 agonism on ventricular recovery.FAU - Butler, Craig RAU  - Butler CRAD  - Division of Cardiology, Walter C.

However, expansion of this technology is still limited by      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential to      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor       may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditional      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may       also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.      Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to       outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base to      support these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potential      predictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely a      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive      techniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,      recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements and      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting of      CF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) consider      potential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTN      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new      reliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research and      management possible.

However, the importance of this newer      technique for chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still       open to discussion. To date, there are few studies that extensively explore the      psychological and cognitive profiles of patient with ventricular assist devices      (VADs). METHODS: We studied the psychological aspects, quality of life (QOL) and       cognitive profiles of 19 patients with HF before VAD implantation and then at      two, five and 16 months post-implantation. RESULTS: Our results showed that after      VAD implantation, patients did not show any psychopathological problems such as      anxiety and/or depression. More interestingly, despite the constant risk of      neurological events determined by the continuous-blood-flow pump (CBFP),      patients\\ cognitive functioning did not worsen. In fact, significant enhancements      were observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and cognitive deficits are      common in advanced HF and often worsen over time. Appropriately designed and      randomized studies are needed to demonstrate whether earlier VAD implantation is       warranted to arrest cognitive decline and encourage better post-implantation      adaptation.FAU -

This study aims to describe our      center\\s multidisciplinary team management of single-ventricle patients supported      long term with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric VAD. Patient #1 was a 4-year-old       with double-outlet right ventricle with aortic atresia, L-looped ventricles, and       heart block who developed heart failure 1 year after Fontan. She initially      required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and was transitioned to      Berlin Heart systemic VAD. She was supported for 363 days (cardiac intensive care      unit [CICU] 335 days, floor 28 days). The postoperative course was complicated by      intermittent infection including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,      intermittent hepatic and renal insufficiencies, and transient antithrombin,      protein C, and protein S deficiencies resulting in multiple thrombi. She had a      total of five pump changes over 10 months. Long-term medical management included       anticoagulation with enoxaparin, platelet inhibition with aspirin and      dipyridamole, and antibiotic prophylaxis using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. She      developed sepsis of unknown etiology and subsequently died from multiorgan      failure. Patient #2 was a 4-year-old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who      developed heart failure 2 years after bidirectional Glenn shunt. At systemic VAD       implantation, he was intubated with renal insufficiency. Post-VAD implantation,      his renal insufficiency resolved, and he was successfully extubated to daytime      nasal cannula and biphasic positive airway pressure at night. He was supported      for 270 days (CICU 143 days, floor 127 days). The pump was upsized to a 50-mL      pump in May 2011 for increased central venous pressures (29 mm Hg). Long-term      medical management included anticoagulation with warfarin and single-agent      platelet inhibition using dipyridamole due to aspirin resistance. He developed      increased work of breathing requiring intubation, significant anasarca, and      bleeding from the endotracheal tube. The family elected to withdraw support.      Although both patients died prior to heart transplantation, a consistent      specialized multidisciplinary team approach to the medical care of our VAD      patients, consisting of cardiothoracic surgeons, heart transplant team,      hematologists, pharmacists, infectious disease physicians, psychiatrists,      specialty trained bedside nursing, and nurse practitioners, allowed us to manage       these patients long term while awaiting heart transplantation.CI  - (c) 2012, Copyright the Authors.

Listing for transplant may trigger psychosocial adjustment to the transplantation      as an upcoming critical life-event. We hypothesized that patients could profit      from this adaptation when implantation of a VAD becomes necessary. METHODS: We      arbitrarily chose a cut-off at 30 days after being put on the heart      transplantation (HTX) waiting list. Eighteen patients were listed for HTX for >30      days (referred to as \\listed\\) and 26 for shorter periods or not at all      (\\non-listed\\). Survival, the occurrence of mental disorders, the number of      contacts of the patient with the psychologist and times spent on      psychotherapeutic support for both patient groups and for their families were      analysed. RESULTS: Survival after VAD implantation (observation time) and mental       disorders were comparable for listed and non-listed patients. Mental disorders      were developed in 80\\\% of all patients irrespective of the listing group. The      utilization of supportive psychotherapy did not differ between the listed and the      non-listed group with regard to the number of contacts and to the time needed for      individual therapy. Moreover, the number of families who requested support did      not differ between the groups nor did the time spent on family therapy. However,       the number of contacts and the time for individual psychotherapeutic support      correlated with the observation time, whereas the time spent on family therapy      did not. In contrast, family therapy correlated inversely with age. In addition,       we compared bridge-to-transplantation patients with destination therapy patients.      There were no differences in the occurrence of mental disorders, the number of      contacts or in the time expenses for individual and for family therapy, neither      for all patients nor after stratification for listing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data      indicate that listing for HTX for >30 days before VAD implantation does not      reduce the utilization of psychotherapeutic support by VAD patients. We assume      that structured emotional and psychosocial support by the interdisciplinary VAD      team, including professional supportive psychotherapy, is indispensable for      successful coping of VAD patients and their families.FAU - Heilmann, ClaudiaAU  - Heilmann CAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery Freiburg, University Heart Center      Freiburg-Bad Krozingen, Freiburg, Germany. claudia.heilmann@uniklinik-freiburg.deFAU - Kuijpers, NicolaAU  - Kuijpers NFAU - Beyersdorf, FriedhelmAU  - Beyersdorf FFAU - Trummer, GeorgAU  - Trummer GFAU - Berchtold-Herz, MichaelAU  - Berchtold-Herz MFAU - Zeh, WolfgangAU  - Zeh WFAU - Stroh, Anna LenaAU  - Stroh ALFAU - Fritzsche, KurtAU  - Fritzsche KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20120104PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Family Therapy/statistics & numerical dataMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/psychology/surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/*psychologyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/*etiology/therapyMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Psychotherapy/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Waiting ListsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/01/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/29 06:00CRDT- 2012/01/06 06:00PHST- 2012/01/04 [aheadofprint]AID - ezr233 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezr233 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jun;41(6):1371-6; discussion 1376. doi:      10.1093/ejcts/ezr233.

The Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatrics is utilized at our center as a      bridge to transplantation or bridge to recovery. This retrospective study reviews      our results regarding the safety of long-term support and outcome. Methods.      Between January 2008 and December 2010, 12 patients (6 females and 6 males)      underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device. The median weight was 14.2      kg (range 4.2-51.6 kg) and the median age was 4.12 years (range 0.25-11.83      years). All patients were on inotropes, five patients required mechanical      ventilation and three patients experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation.      Results. Eight patients received a left ventricular assist device and four      patients received a biventricular assist device. Of the 12 patients, 8 were      bridge to heart transplantation, in 2 patients explantation was possible, and 1      patient died on support. The median support time for these 11 patients was 151      days (range 4-488 days), with 2124 days of cardiac support. One patient is on      support. Survival rate was 91.6\\\%. Seven patients had a blood pump change once.      Four patients had local signs of infection. There was no mediastinitis and      thromboembolism. One patient had intracerebral hemorrhage. There was no death      after heart transplantation or after explantation of the device. Conclusions. The      Berlin Heart EXCOR is effective in bridging children of almost all ages and sizes      to cardiac transplantation or myocardial recovery.

METHODS AND      RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, we used implantable (n=12) and paracorporeal      (n=91) LVADs in 103 consecutive cardiomyopathy patients as a bridge to      transplantation. Prior to LVAD implantation, all patients received inotropes, and      25 patients (24\\\%) received PCPS because of cardiogenic shock. Postoperatively,      there were no early mortalities within 30 days after surgery, and patients      survived on LVAD for 560+/-391 days, of whom 9 patients recovered and 32      underwent heart transplantation after 711+/-360 days of LVAD support. More      patients with preoperative PCPS required nitric oxide inhalation and prolonged      inotropic support to maintain adequate LVAD flow. In addition, bilirubin level at      1 month after LVAD implantation was significantly higher in patients with      preoperative PCPS. Cox regression analysis identified preoperative PCPS support      as the only significant predictor for death after LVAD implantation and overall      survival was significantly better in patients without preoperative PCPS.      CONCLUSIONS: Despite adequate hemodynamic support after LVAD implantation,      patients with preoperative PCPS had significantly worse survival. LVAD should be       used for patients with end-stage heart failure, before PCPS is required for      hemodynamic support.FAU - Toda, KoichiAU  - Toda KAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular      Center, Suita, Japan. ktoda2002@yahoo.co.jpFAU - Fujita, TomoyukiAU  - Fujita TFAU - Kobayashi, JunjiroAU  - Kobayashi JFAU - Shimahara, YusukeAU  - Shimahara YFAU - Kitamura, SoichiroAU  - Kitamura SFAU - Seguchi, OsamuAU  - Seguchi OFAU - Murata, YoshihiroAU  - Murata YFAU - Yanase, MasanobuAU  - Yanase MFAU - Nakatani, TakeshiAU  - Nakatani TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20111203PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)RN  - RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)SB  - IMMH  - Bilirubin/bloodMH  - Cardiomyopathies/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/*therapeutic useMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Oxygenators, Membrane/adverse effectsMH  - *Preoperative PeriodMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/*prevention & controlMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/12/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/07/04 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/06 06:00PHST- 2011/12/03 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-11-0339 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2012;76(1):88-95.

We reviewed our institutional experience with noncardiac surgical      procedures (NCPs) in patients supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs, n =       198) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 165) between July 1998 and      June 2010. In total, 64 NCPs were performed in 55 VAD patients and 14 NCPs in 14       ECMO patients. Thirty-day mortality was higher for the VAD compared with the ECMO      group (25 vs 86\\\%; P < 0.001) and was greater for emergent compared with      nonemergent procedures (58 vs 19\\\%; P < 0.001). Excluding tracheostomy, no      patients died within 30 days of a nonemergent procedure. Kaplan-Meier survival      showed a trend toward worse survival after NCP in ECMO patients, but NCP did not       alter survival in VAD patients. Fewer VAD patients were bridged to heart      transplantation when NCP was required, and time from device implantation to      transplant was significantly longer than for patients without NCP. In summary,      this is the largest series of NCPs on VAD support and the only series on ECMO.      Mortality is substantial for ECMO patients.

However, thromboembolic      events, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. We      retrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)      in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in a      pediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March      31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),      median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a left      VAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwent      heart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient is      still on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days of      assistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of nine      patients (56\\\%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When compared      with noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median      131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care       unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and a      longer length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR      34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced for      thromboembolic issues, most of them (67\\\%) in patients with VAD-related      infections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BH      endocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,      12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venous      catheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinary      catheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanical      ventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Of      the 17 isolated pathogens, 53\\\% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence of      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3\\\%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25\\\%),      three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50\\\% of all isolated pseudomonads),      and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiac      transplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients with      infected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospital      with increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.

We sought to evaluate the relationship between      serial measurements of functional MR and reverse remodeling and outcomes in      patients undergoing CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 266 consecutive patients      undergoing CRT with available baseline echocardiograms and subsequent clinical      and echocardiographic follow-up were included in the analysis. Long-term      follow-up included all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, and implantation      of a left ventricular (LV) assist device. Temporal changes in MR severity and LV       end-systolic volume index (LVESVi) were evaluated by linear mixed-model analysis.      CRT led to an immediate sustained decrease in MR (P<0.0001), with no significant       subsequent change. The amount of MR decrease correlated with a greater decrease      in LVESVi late (P</=0.0001), but not early (P=0.14), after CRT began. Patients      with severe MR before CRT experienced a larger LVESVi decrease (P=0.005).      Although baseline MR severity was not associated with adverse events (P=0.13), a       larger MR decrease (P=0.001) and a smaller residual MR after the initial 6 months      of CRT (P=0.03) were predictive of better outcome in a multivariable model.      CONCLUSIONS: Early reversal of functional MR was associated with reverse cardiac       remodeling and improved outcomes. Patients with moderately severe to severe MR      before CRT experienced relatively more reverse remodeling than patients with      lesser degrees of MR.FAU - Verhaert, DavidAU  - Verhaert DAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195,      USA.FAU - Popovic, Zoran BAU  - Popovic ZBFAU - De, SabeAU  - De SFAU - Puntawangkoon, ChirapaAU  - Puntawangkoon CFAU - Wolski, KathyAU  - Wolski KFAU - Wilkoff, Bruce LAU  - Wilkoff BLFAU - Starling, Randall CAU  - Starling RCFAU - Tang, W H WilsonAU  - Tang WHFAU - Thomas, James DAU  - Thomas JDFAU - Griffin, Brian PAU  - Griffin BPFAU - Grimm, Richard AAU  - Grimm RALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20111102PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Cardiovasc ImagingJT  - Circulation.

We report on our experience using a different technique of RVAD implantation that      does not necessitate resternotomy at the time of RVAD removal. METHODS: Patients       with perioperative RVF who underwent temporary RVAD implantation between January       2010 and February 2014 were reviewed. A dacron graft was attached to the      pulmonary artery and passed through a subxiphoid exit, where the RVAD outflow      cannula was inserted. The inflow cannula was percutaneously cannulated in the      femoral vein, and the sternum was primarily closed. On the day of RVAD      explantation, the outflow graft of the RVAD was pulled and ligated, and the      insertion site was secondarily closed. The RVAD inflow cannula was removed, and      direct pressure was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (age 58 +/- 14 years)      were supported. Seventeen patients (81\\\%) had RVF after left ventricular assist      device implantation, and 4 patients developed postcardiotomy RVF. The median      duration of RVAD support was 9 days (range: 2-88 days). Eleven patients (52\\\%)      were successfully weaned from the RVAD. Two patients were bridged to      transplantation. Eight patients died on left ventricular assist device and/or      RVAD support. The survival rates to discharge or heart transplantation, and to      1-year, were 62\\\% and 52\\\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No technical issues were      encountered in this large series of RVAD implantations using the described      technique for various forms of postoperative RVF. Extended support duration and      reduction of resternotomy risks may be the main advantages of this technique      compared with conventional RVAD implantation methods.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Case study.PG  - 537-40LID - 10.12659/AOT.891266 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern Polish medicine offers patients various treatments for      end-stage treatment-resistant heart failure. Methods applied at the right time      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function       of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular      afterload.

However, the model has not been externally validated,      and its suitability as a selection tool for heart transplantation (HT) and left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated      the UCLA risk score (based on B-type natriuretic peptide, peak VO2, New York      Heart Association class, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or      angiotensin receptor blocker) in 180 patients referred for HT. The outcome was      survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival      was compared to Kaplan-Meier\\s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model      discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1      years, 37 (21\\\%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival      was 88\\\%, 81\\\%, and 75\\\%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97,      respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses      demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year,      0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was      poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to      +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results       were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate      imputation of missing data. CONCLUSIONS: The UCLA 4-variable risk model      calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external      validation cohort.

All patients on the Eurotransplant      high-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be      relisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated with      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospective      analysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated with      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 117      consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure       unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 \\\%) were stabilized and      delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\\s specific characteristics.       After initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as      possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 \\\%      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary      due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 \\\%) needed a left- or      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 \\\%) died while waiting and 87 (84 \\\%)       received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. Cumulative 3 and 12 months      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 \\\%, respectively. CONCLUSION:      Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low.

The apoptotic cell is not inevitably committed      to death, and appropriate therapy like left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      support could offer a rescue of cellular functions. Literature data regarding the      modulation of the apoptotic process during LVAD support are still controversial.       METHODS: To assess whether LVAD implantation modifies the apoptotic profile in      the heart, cardiac tissue was collected from end-stage HF patients before LVAD      implant (pre-LVAD, n=22) and at LVAD removal (post-LVAD, n=6) and from stable HF       patients on medical therapy without prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at heart      transplantation as control. Caspase (Casp)-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and Hsp72 cardiac mRNA       and protein expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and       Western blotting (WB) in the three groups of patients. Immunohistochemical      analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling      assay, and DNA laddering analysis were performed; cellular size and interstitial       fibrosis content were also determined. RESULTS: All the apoptotic indices were      increased in the post-LVAD group compared to pre-LVAD, specially antiapoptotic      Hsp72 and proapoptotic Bax (Hsp72: 3.27+/-0.41 vs. 0.76+/-0.14, P<.001; Bax:      2.15+/-0.38 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.29, P=.035; post-LVAD vs. pre-LVAD, respectively). The      significant increase in Hsp72 was confirmed by WB and immunohistochemical      analysis. CONCLUSION: LVAD appears to induce an activation of apoptotic      mediators, mainly at the mitochondrial level, while the following activation of      Casp-3 is reduced by the significant increase of Hsp72, whose enhancement could      be an important factor in cardiac remodeling associated with LVAD support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Between January 2006 and December 2012, 228 consecutive adult patients were      supported on RotaFlow (n=213) or CentriMag (n=15) ECMO, at our institutions (155       men; age 58.3+/-10.5 years, range: 19-84 years). Indications for support were:      failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy      (n=118) and primary donor graft failure (n=37); postacute myocardial infarction      CS (n=27); acute myocarditis (n=6); and CS on chronic heart failure (n=40). A      peripheral ECMO setting was established in 126 (55.2\\\%) patients while it was      established centrally in 102 (44.7\\\%). Overall mean support time was 10.9+/-9.7      days (range: 1-43 days). Eighty-four (36.8\\\%) patients died on ECMO. Overall      success rate, in terms of survival on ECMO (n=144), weaning from mechanical      support (n=107; 46.9\\\%), bridge to mid-long-term ventricular assist device (n=6;      2.6\\\%), and bridge to heart transplantation (n=31; 13.5\\\%), was 63.1\\\%. One hundred       twenty-two (53.5\\\%) patients were successfully discharged. Stepwise logistic      regression identified blood lactate level and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase      (CK-MB) relative index at 72 h after ECMO initiation, and number of packed red      blood cells (PRBCs) transfused on ECMO as significant predictors of mortality on       ECMO (P=0.010, odds ratio [OR]=2.94; 95\\\% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-3.14;      P=0.010, OR=2.82, 95\\\% CI=1.014-3.721; and P=0.011, OR=2.69; 95\\\% CI=1.06-4.16,      respectively). Central ECMO population had significantly higher rate of      continuous veno-venous hemofiltration need and bleeding requiring surgery events       compared with the peripheral ECMO setting population. No significant differences       were seen by comparing the RotaFlow and CentriMag populations in terms of device       performance. At follow-up, persistent heart failure with left ventricle ejection       fraction (LVEF)</=40\\\% was a risk factor after hospital discharge. Patients with a      poor hemodynamic status may benefit from rapid central or peripheral insertion of      ECMO. The blood lactate level, CK-MB relative index, and PRBCs transfused should       be strictly monitored during ECMO support.

The previous work in cardiac surgery has led      to many excellent surgical techniques for treating cardiac diseases, and these      procedures are now able to prolong the human lifespan. However, surgical      treatment for end-stage heart failure has been under-explored, although left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and heart transplantation are      options to treat the condition. LVAD can provide powerful circulatory support for      end-stage heart failure patients and improve the survival and quality of life      after implantation compared with the existing medical counterparts. Moreover,      LVADs play a crucial role in the \\\"bridge to transplantation\\\", \\\"bridge to      recovery\\\" and recently have served as \\\"destination therapy\\\". The structural and      molecular changes that improve the cardiac function after LVAD implantation are      called \\\"reverse remodeling\\\", which means that patients who have received a LVAD      can be weaned from the LVAD with restoration of their cardiac function. This      strategy is a desirable alternative to heart transplantation in terms of both the      patient quality of life and due to the organ shortage. The mechanism of this      bridge to recovery is interesting, and is different from other treatments for      heart failure. Bridge to recovery therapy is one of the options in regenerative      therapy which only a surgeon can provide.

METHODS AND      RESULTS: We compared metabolomic, gene transcript, and protein data from 6 paired      samples of failing human left ventricular tissue obtained during left ventricular      assist device insertion (heart failure samples) and at heart transplant      (post-left ventricular assist device samples). Nonfailing left ventricular wall      samples procured from explanted hearts of patients with right heart failure      served as novel comparison samples. Metabolomic analyses uncovered a distinct      pattern in heart failure tissue: 2.6-fold increased pyruvate concentrations      coupled with reduced Krebs cycle intermediates and short-chain acylcarnitines,      suggesting a global reduction in substrate oxidation. These findings were      associated with decreased transcript levels for enzymes that catalyze fatty acid       oxidation and pyruvate metabolism and for key transcriptional regulators of      mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated      receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1A, 1.3-fold) and estrogen-related receptor      alpha (ERRA, 1.2-fold) and gamma (ERRG, 2.2-fold). Thus, parallel decreases in      key transcription factors and their target metabolic enzyme genes can explain the      decreases in associated metabolic intermediates. Mechanical support with left      ventricular assist device improved all of these metabolic and transcriptional      defects. CONCLUSIONS: These observations underscore an important pathophysiologic      role for severely defective metabolism in heart failure, while the reversibility       of these defects by left ventricular assist device suggests metabolic resilience       of the human heart.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Gupte, Anisha AAU  - Gupte AAAD  - From the Methodist Diabetes and Metabolism Institute, Houston Methodist Research       Institute, Houston, TX (A.A.G., D.J.H., C.J.L., W.A.H.); Department of Systems      Medicine and Bioengineering, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX      (Z.Y., S.T.C.W.); Center for Biostatistics, Houston Methodist Research Institute,      Houston, TX (L.E.P.); Department of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital,      Houston, TX (D.J.H., W.A.H.), Department of Radiology, Houston Methodist      Hospital, Houston, TX (S.T.C.W.); Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute,      Houston, TX (A.M.C.-R., K.A.Y., J.D.E., M.L., G.T.-A.); Weill Cornell Medical      College, New York, NY (A.A.G., D.J.H., A.M.C.-R., K.A.Y., Z.Y., J.D.E., M.L.,      L.E.P., C.J.L., S.T.C.W., G.T.-A., W.A.H.); Sarah W.

METHODS:      Three groups of patients at one hospital were considered for this cost analysis:       (1) patients included in the BENEMACS study starting May 2009 (n = 6); (2) all      patients from May 2009 till May 2010 undergoing heart transplantation (n = 19);      or (iii) undergoing Heartmate II implantation as a bridge to transplant (n = 13).      Patients undergoing bridging were more sick (lower Intermacs class). DT patients       were older (64+/-8 years). Cost was derived from actual hospital invoices,      device, organ procurement and medical cost, and follow-up care during 1 year from      implantation. Costs are presented in euro, by their mean values and standard      deviation. RESULTS: One-year survivals were 83, 84, and 77\\\%, respectively, for      DT, HTX, and bridging. Costs for initial and re-hospitalizations were not      different between groups. Costs for medical follow-up and medication were      significantly higher for transplanted patients. The 1-year total cost was euro85       531+/-19 823 for HTX, euro125 108+/-32 399 for bridging, and euro137 068+/-29 007      for DT. As 42\\\% of the transplanted patients were bridged, the cost of the medical      pathway HTX was euro138 076+/-19 823. Assuming a 5-year survival and a similar      yearly follow-up cost, the average cost per year is euro42 153 for HTX, euro53      637 for transplantation including the bridging cost, and euro47 487 for DT.      CONCLUSION: Direct transplantation without bridging is the most cost-efficient      treatment. The cost per patient per year for DT is similar to HTX considering its      bridging activity.FAU - Droogne, WAU  - Droogne WFAU - Jacobs, SAU  - Jacobs SFAU - Van den Bossche, KAU  - Van den Bossche KFAU - Verhoeven, JAU  - Verhoeven JFAU - Bostic, R RAU  - Bostic RRFAU - Vanhaecke, JAU  - Vanhaecke JFAU - Van Cleemput, JAU  - Van Cleemput JFAU - Rega, FAU  - Rega FFAU - Meyns, BAU  - Meyns BLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20140320PL  - EnglandTA  - Acta Clin BelgJT  - Acta clinica BelgicaJID - 0370306SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Care CostsMH  - Heart Failure/*economics/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*economicsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*economicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cost,OT  - Destination therapy,OT  - Heart transplantationOT  - VAD,EDAT- 2014/05/14 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/05/14 06:00PHST- 2014/03/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1179/2295333714Y.0000000017 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Acta Clin Belg. 2014 Jun;69(3):165-70. doi: 10.1179/2295333714Y.0000000017.

However, the specific effects of combined Cl+beta1 blockade      during MU are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the chronic effects (4      weeks) of beta2-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation via Cl (2 mg/kg/day) alone, and in       combination with beta1-AR blockade using metoprolol ((Met), 250 mg/kg/day), on      whole heart/cell structure, function and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in       failing (induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation), and unloaded (induced      by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)) failing rat hearts.      Combined Cl+Met therapy displayed favourable effects in HF: Met enhanced Cl\\s      improvement in ejection fraction (EF) whilst preventing Cl-induced hypertrophy      and tachycardia. During MU combined therapy was less beneficial than either      mono-therapy. Met, not Cl, prevented MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with      increased atrophy occurring during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+       transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+      content was enhanced equally by Cl or Met mono-therapy, but these benefits,      together with Cl\\s enhancement of sarcomeric contraction speed, and MU-induced      recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency, disappeared during combined therapy.      CONCLUSIONS: Combined Cl+Met therapy shows superior functional effects to      mono-therapy in rodent HF, but appears inferior to either mono-therapy in      enhancing MU-induced recovery of EC coupling. These results suggest that combined      beta2-AR simulation +beta1-AR blockade therapy is likely to be a safe and      beneficial therapeutic HF strategy, but is not as effective as mono-therapy in      enhancing myocardial recovery during LVAD support.FAU -

Thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,      refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricular      assist device (VAD) therapy. The program, supported and funded by the national      healthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical Center for      the operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.      Regional VAD coordinators are educated by the National Center. They are in charge      of regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription,       and continuing patients\\ and caregivers\\ education, mainly regarding driveline      exit site dressing and driveline stabilization. From November 2011 to November      2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support      (LVAD): HeartMate II, n=70, HeartWare, n=25. Mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37\\\%       of the patients were males. Most patients had INTERMACS profile 4 (55\\\%), followed      by 3 and 2 (17\\\% each). Symptomatic and functional improvement are testified by      changes from baseline to month 3 of NYHA functional class (from III-IV to I-II),       results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and NT-proBNP levels (from      6997 to 1126 pg/ml). Overall 1-year survival was 69\\\%, with a trend for outcome      improvement over time and a relationship with preoperative INTERMACS profile      (1-year survival of 60\\\% in patients with INTERMACS profile 1-2 vs 75\\\% in those      with INTERMACS profile 3-4). In summary, where and when a heart transplant      program cannot be implemented, LVAD represents a realistic therapeutic      alternative. The key points for a successful VAD program are a dedicated, highly       specialized multidisciplinary team at the Cardiac Surgery Center, an      infrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,      adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.FAU - Bekbossynov, SerikAU  - Bekbossynov SFAU - Medressova, AsselAU  - Medressova AFAU - Murzagaliyev, MuradymAU  - Murzagaliyev MFAU - Salov, RomanAU  - Salov RFAU - Dzhetybayeva, SaltanatAU  - Dzhetybayeva SFAU - Andossova, SaltanatAU  - Andossova SFAU - Bekbossynova, MakhabbatAU  - Bekbossynova MFAU - Pya, YuriyAU  - Pya YLA  - itaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Programma chirurgico per il trattamento dell\\insufficienza cardiaca -      l\\esperienza del Kazakhstan.PL  - ItalyTA  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome)JT  - Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)JID - 101263411SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - KazakhstanMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/04/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/03 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/29 06:00AID - 10.1714/1463.16161 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - G Ital Cardiol (Rome). 2014 Mar;15(3):144-8. doi: 10.1714/1463.16161.- 24770427own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140428dcom- 20140902is  - 1827-6806 (print)is  - 1827-6806 (linking)vi  - 15ip  - 3dp  - 2014 marti  - [surgical heart failure treatment program - the experience of kazakhstan].pg  - 144-8lid - 10.1714/1463.16161 [doi]ab  - in kazakhstan, geographical and cultural reasons do not favor the development of       heart transplant activity. thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,      refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricular      assist device (vad) therapy. the program, supported and funded by the national      healthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical center for      the operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.      regional vad coordinators are educated by the national center. they are in charge      of regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription,       and continuing patients\\ and caregivers\\ education, mainly regarding driveline      exit site dressing and driveline stabilization. from november 2011 to november      2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support      (lvad): heartmate ii, n=70, heartware, n=25. mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37\\\%       of the patients were males. most patients had intermacs profile 4 (55\\\%), followed      by 3 and 2 (17\\\% each). symptomatic and functional improvement are testified by      changes from baseline to month 3 of nyha functional class (from iii-iv to i-ii),       results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and nt-probnp levels (from      6997 to 1126 pg/ml). overall 1-year survival was 69\\\%, with a trend for outcome      improvement over time and a relationship with preoperative intermacs profile      (1-year survival of 60\\\% in patients with intermacs profile 1-2 vs 75\\\% in those      with intermacs profile 3-4). in summary, where and when a heart transplant      program cannot be implemented, lvad represents a realistic therapeutic      alternative. the key points for a successful vad program are a dedicated, highly       specialized multidisciplinary team at the cardiac surgery center, an      infrastructure throughout the country for coordinated outpatient follow-up,      adequate reimbursement for this activity, and support by the healthcare system.fau - bekbossynov, serikau  - bekbossynov sfau - medressova, asselau  - medressova afau - murzagaliyev, muradymau  - murzagaliyev mfau - salov, romanau  - salov rfau - dzhetybayeva, saltanatau  - dzhetybayeva sfau - andossova, saltanatau  - andossova sfau - bekbossynova, makhabbatau  - bekbossynova mfau - pya, yuriyau  - pya yla  - itapt  - english abstractpt  - journal articlett  - programma chirurgico per il trattamento dell\\insufficienza cardiaca -      l\\esperienza del kazakhstan.pl  - italyta  - g ital cardiol (rome)jt  - giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)jid - 101263411sb  - immh  - adolescentmh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - childmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/*surgerymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - kazakhstanmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - young adultedat- 2014/04/29 06:00mhda- 2014/09/03 06:00crdt- 2014/04/29 06:00aid - 10.1714/1463.16161 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - g ital cardiol (rome). 2014 mar;15(3):144-8. doi: 10.1714/1463.16161.',medicine

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained      from 183 consecutive patients assigned to stage D heart failure (HF) who were      evaluated by the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo Hospital      and then listed for heart transplantation as status 1 or 2 of the Japan Organ      Transplant Network. Patients with status 2 (n=38) had a prognosis as poor as      those dependent on inotropes (n=54) or MCS (n=91; P=0.615, log-rank test), and      only 4 of them had eventual ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation (10.5\\\%).      Patients who eventually received VAD (n=92) had better 4-year survival than those      without MCS among status 1 and 2 (P=0.030, log-rank test). On Cox regression      analysis plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >740pg/ml was the only      significant predictor for 4-year survival among the status 2 group (P=0.014;      hazard ratio, 8.267). Ten patients with status 2 died: 6 due to acute hemodynamic      compromise and 4 due to ventricular fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis in      status 2 patients was as poor as that of those dependent on inotrope infusion or       VAD, mostly because of out-of-hospital sudden death without MCS. Status 2      patients with considerably high plasma BNP may be good candidates for continuous       flow VAD therapy.FAU - Imamura, TeruhikoAU  - Imamura TAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of      Tokyo.FAU - Kinugawa, KoichiroAU  - Kinugawa KFAU - Hatano, MasaruAU  - Hatano MFAU - Fujino, TakeoAU  - Fujino TFAU - Inaba, ToshiroAU  - Inaba TFAU - Maki, HisatakaAU  - Maki HFAU - Kinoshita, OsamuAU  - Kinoshita OFAU - Amiya, EisukeAU  - Amiya EFAU - Nawata, KanAU  - Nawata KFAU - Yao, AtsushiAU  - Yao AFAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SFAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MFAU - Komuro, IsseiAU  - Komuro ILA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20140403PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/*administration & dosageMH  - Disease-Free SurvivalMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/blood/*mortality/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Survival RateMH  - Ventricular Fibrillation/blood/*mortality/*therapyEDAT- 2014/04/04 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/13 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/04 06:00PHST- 2014/04/03 [aheadofprint]AID - DN/JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-14-0077 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2014;78(6):1396-404.

The purpose of this review is to discuss four      sub-classifications of cardiogenic shock patients (acute myocardial infarction,      acute decompensated heart failure, biventricular failure, and myocarditis), and      explore management considerations for these groups, with particular emphasis on      strategies for device placement. RECENT FINDINGS: In single-center studies, the      use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, percutaneous ventricular assist      devices, and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has allowed      approximately half of cardiogenic shock patients to receive an implantable left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant, or experience myocardial      recovery. Primary implantation of a durable LVAD in well-selected myocardial      infarction shock patients was associated with a 1-year survival of 86\\\% in one      small case series. Analysis of a multi-institutional database suggests patients      older than 65 years have a lower post-implantation survival compared with younger      recipients. SUMMARY: Device selection strategies for INTERMACS I patients are      predicated on a patient\\s prognosis, hemodynamic stability, end organ, and      neurologic status. Percutaneous assist devices may be preferred for patients with      favorable prognoses, ECMO for patients with hemodynamic compromise, and durable      mechanical support for patients failing to recover sustainable myocardial      function after short-term device use.FAU - Dutt, Debleena PainAU  - Dutt DPAD  - Zena and Michael A.

On the other hand, left ventricular      assist devices (LVADs) have proven to be effective in improving survival and      quality of life in patients with refractory HF. The challenge encountered by      multidisciplinary teams in dealing with advanced HF lies in identifying patients       who could benefit more from HTx as compared to LVAD implantation and the      appropriate timing. The decision-making is based on clinical parameters,      imaging-based data and risk scores. Current outcome of HF patients supported by      LVAD (2-year survival around 70\\\%) is rapidly improving and leads the way to a new      therapeutic strategy. Patients who have a low likelihood to gain access to the      heart graft pool could benefit more from LVAD implantation (defined as bridge to       transplantation indication) than from remaining on HTx waiting list with the      likely risk of clinical deterioration or removal from the list because patients      are no longer suitable for transplantation. LVAD has also demonstrated to be      effective in patients who are not considered eligible candidates for HTx with a      destination therapy indication. HTx should be reserved to those patients for whom      the maximum clinical benefit can be expected, such as young patients with no      comorbidities. Here we discuss the current listing criteria for HTx and      indications to implant of LVAD for patients with refractory acute and chronic HF       based on the guidelines and the practical experience of our center.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

In May 2012 the      opening of a new heart failure and transplant unit with 9 beds together with the       procurement of necessary devices at Semmelweis University accomplished this need.      AIM: The aim of the authors was to report their initial experience obtained in      this new cardiac assist device program. METHOD: Since May, 2012, mechanical      circulatory support system was applied in 89 cases in 72 patients. Indication for      support were end stage heart failure refractory to medical treatment and acute      left or right heart failure. RESULTS: Treatment was initiated for acute graft      failure after heart transplantation in 27 cases, for end stage heart failure in      24 cases, for acute myocardial infarction in 21 cases, for acute postcardiotomy      heart failure in 14 cases, for severe respiratory insufficiency in 2 cases and      for drug intoxication in one case. Among the 30 survivor of the whole program 13       patients were successfully transplanted. CONCLUSIONS: The available devices can      cover all modalities of current bridge therapy from short term support through      medium support to heart transplantation or long term support and destination      therapy. These conditions made possible the successful start of a new cardiac      assist device program.FAU - Fazekas, LeventeAU  - Fazekas LAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.FAU -

Due to shortage of      donor organs in paediatric group, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is now      routinely applied as bridging strategy to increase survival on the waiting list      for OTHx. We sought to assess the impact of MCS as intention to bridge to OHTx in      patients with CHD less than 16 years of age. METHODS: From 1998 to 2013, 106      patients received 113 episodes of MCS with paracorporeal devices as intention to       bridge to OHTx. Twenty-nine had CHD, 15 (52\\\%) with two-ventricle (Group A) and 14      (48\\\%) with single-ventricle physiology (Group B). In Group A, 5 children had      venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), 6 left ventricular      assist device (LVAD), 2 biventricular assist device (BIVAD), 1 VA ECMO followed      by BIVAD and 1 BIVAD followed by VA ECMO. In Group B, VA ECMO was used in 7      children, univentricular assist device (UVAD) changed to VA ECMO in 4, UVAD in 2       and surgical conversion to two-ventricles physiology with BIVAD support changed      to VA ECMO in 1. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 29 (72\\\%) children survived to      recovery/OHTx. Seven of 29 (59\\\%) survived to discharge. In Group A, 11/15 (73\\\%)      survived to recovery/OHTx and 9/15 (60\\\%) survived to discharge. Four of 15 (27\\\%)       died awaiting OHTx. One child had graft failure requiring VA ECMO and was bridged      successfully to retransplantation. One child dying after OHTx had acute      rejection, was supported with VA ECMO and then BIVAD but did not recover. One      patient had an unsuccessful second run on BIVAD 1 year after recovery from VA      ECMO. In Group B, 10/14 (71\\\%) survived to recovery/OHTx and 8/14 (57\\\%) survived      to discharge. Four of 14 (29\\\%) died awaiting OHTx. Of deaths after OHTx, 1      occurred intraoperatively and 1 was consequent to graft failure and had an      unsuccessful second run with VA ECMO. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CHD can be      successfully bridged with MCS to heart transplantation. Single-ventricle      circulation compared with biventricular physiology does not increase the risk of       death before transplant or before hospital discharge.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.

In addition, females have been underrepresented in most      multicenter randomized controlled trials for mechanical circulatory support      (MCS). The objective of our study was to analyze our experience implanting 130      continuous-flow LVADs and to determine the impact of sex on survival. We      identified 130 patients who underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD at      our institution. Patients were stratified into two groups based on sex. Variables      were compared using two-sided t-tests, chi(2) tests, Cox proportional hazards      models, and log-rank tests to determine whether there was a difference between      the two groups and if sex was a significant independent predictor of outcome. Of       the 130 patients, 35 were females and 95 were males. Female patients had worse      pre-LVAD cardiac output and cardiac index and were more likely to be on MCS at      the time of implantation. Male patients had worse renal function. Survival was      analogous for both cohorts with 30 day, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year survivals of       97\\\%, 90.8\\\%, 90.8\\\%, and 84.3\\\%, respectively, for female patients versus 94.7\\\%,      87.9\\\%, 78.4\\\%, and 72.8\\\%, respectively, for male patients.

Despite significant advancements in drug therapy,      mortality of the disease remains excessively high, as heart transplant remains      the gold standard treatment for end-stage HF when no contraindications subsist.      Traditionally, implanted Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) have been employed in       order to provide circulatory support to patients who cannot survive the waiting      time to transplantation, reducing the workload imposed on the heart. In many      cases that process could recover its contractility performance. OBJECTIVES: The      SensorART platform focuses on the management and remote treatment of patients      suffering from HF. It provides an interoperable, extendable and VAD-independent      solution, which incorporates various hardware and software components in a      holistic approach, in order to improve the quality of the patients\\ treatment and      the workflow of the specialists. This paper focuses on the description and      analysis of Specialist\\s Decision Support System (SDSS), an innovative component       of the SensorART platform. METHODS: The SDSS is a Web-based tool that assists      specialists on designing the therapy plan for their patients before and after VAD      implantation, analyzing patients\\ data, extracting new knowledge, and making      informative decisions. RESULTS: SDSS offers support to medical and VAD experts      through the different phases of VAD therapy, incorporating several tools covering      all related fields; Statistics, Association Rules, Monitoring, Treatment,      Weaning, Speed and Suction Detection. CONCLUSIONS: SDSS and its modules have been      tested in a number of patients and the results are encouraging.FAU - Karvounis, E CAU  - Karvounis ECFAU - Tsipouras, M GAU  - Tsipouras MGFAU - Tzallas, A TAU  - Tzallas ATFAU - Katertsidis, N SAU  - Katertsidis NSFAU - Stefanou, KAU  - Stefanou KFAU - Goletsis, YAU  - Goletsis YFAU - Frigerio, MAU  - Frigerio MFAU - Verde, AAU  - Verde AFAU - Caruso, RAU  - Caruso RFAU - Meyns, BAU  - Meyns BFAU - Terrovitis, JAU  - Terrovitis JFAU - Trivella, M GAU  - Trivella MGFAU - Fotiadis, D IAU  - Fotiadis DIAD  - Dimitrios I.

Novel cardiac support      strategies such as pharmacologic agents, mechanical circulatory support (MCS),      and cell- or matrix-based therapies are promising for these patients. The      indications, types, and timing of MCS implantation depend to a large extent on      the presentation, clinical status of the patient, underlying etiology, and      long-term prospects. The presence or absence of end-organ damage has a      significant impact on prognosis following MCS initiation. Although many patients       with acute AHF may have end-organ damage, their prospect of recovery, once      appropriate therapy is instituted, is better than for patients who had AHF for      longer periods of time. We consider the multidisciplinary approaches used for the      management of AHF and the novel cardiac support strategies (eg, MCS).

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly      used as bridge to transplant and permanent long-term therapy in the population      with end-stage heart failure. Even though better clinical outcomes have been      achieved with the newer-generation continuous-flow devices, infection      complications are still a major risk for patients with continuous-flow LVAD      implantation in long-term follow-up [Ann Thorac Surg 90:1270-1277, 2010].

METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a state-transition model to simulate 4      treatment options and associated morbidity and mortality. Transition      probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from published sources.      Calculated outcomes included survival, quality-adjusted life-years, and      incremental cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed on model      parameters to test robustness. Average life expectancy for OHT-eligible patients       is estimated at 1.1 years, with 39\\\% surviving to 1 year. OHT with a median wait      time of 5.6 months is estimated to increase life expectancy to 8.5 years, and      costs <$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent      medical therapy. Bridge to transplant-LVAD followed by OHT further is estimated      to increase life expectancy to 12.3 years, for $226,000/quality-adjusted      life-year gained versus OHT. Among OHT-ineligible patients, mean life expectancy       with inotrope-dependent medical therapy is estimated at 9.4 months, with 26\\\%      surviving to 1 year. Patients who instead received destination therapy-LVAD are      estimated to live 4.4 years on average from extrapolation of recent constant      hazard rates beyond the first year. This strategy costs $202,000/quality-adjusted      life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent medical therapy. Patient\\s age,       time on wait list, and costs associated with care influence outcomes.      CONCLUSIONS: Under most scenarios, OHT prolongs life and is cost effective in      eligible patients. Bridge to transplant-LVAD is estimated to offer >3.8      additional life-years for patients waiting >/=6 months, but does not meet      conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. Destination therapy-LVAD      significantly improves life expectancy in OHT-ineligible patients. However,      further reductions in adverse events or improved quality of life are needed for      destination therapy-LVAD to be cost effective.CI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.FAU - Long, Elisa FAU  - Long EFAD  - From Decisions, Operations & Technology Management, UCLA Anderson School of      Management, Los Angeles, CA (E.F.L.); Department of Surgery, Icahn School of      Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (G.W.S.); and Section of Cardiac Surgery,      Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT (A.A.M.).FAU - Swain, Gary WAU  - Swain GWAD  - From Decisions, Operations & Technology Management, UCLA Anderson School of      Management, Los Angeles, CA (E.F.L.); Department of Surgery, Icahn School of      Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (G.W.S.); and Section of Cardiac Surgery,      Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT (A.A.M.).FAU - Mangi, Abeel AAU  - Mangi AAAD  - From Decisions, Operations & Technology Management, UCLA Anderson School of      Management, Los Angeles, CA (E.F.L.); Department of Surgery, Icahn School of      Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (G.W.S.); and Section of Cardiac Surgery,      Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT (A.A.M.).      abeel.mangi@yale.edu.LA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140221PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.

We sought      to analyze outcomes in such patients in the United States (U.S.) in the current      era. METHODS: All patients aged >/= 18 years old listed for a primary HT in the      U.S. between July 2004 and September 2010 were identified. Outcomes in those      removed from the list by March 2011 (survival, relisting, HT) were examined using      time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: Of 15,061 patients listed for primary HT, 10,168      (68\\\%) received a HT, 1,393 (9\\\%) died on the waiting list, and 1,871(12\\\%) were      removed before receiving HT. Of patients removed from the list, 560 (30\\\%) were      removed due to clinical improvement, 692 (37\\\%) due to deterioration, and 619      (33\\\%) due to other reasons. After removal, 30-day and 1-year survival were 99.6\\\%       and 94\\\%, respectively, in patients removed due to improvement and 44\\\% and 26\\\%,      respectively, in patients removed due to deterioration. Multivariable predictors       of death after removal were removal due to clinical deterioration, hypertrophic      or restrictive cardiomyopathy, United Network of Organ Sharing status 1A/1B at      listing, and renal dysfunction. Only 27 patients (4.8\\\%) among those removed due      to improvement, 21 (3.0\\\%) removed due to deterioration, and 46 (7.4\\\%) removed due      to other reasons were relisted. CONCLUSIONS: One in 8 patients listed for HT in      the U.S. are removed from the waiting list before receiving HT. The indication      for removal (clinical deterioration vs improvement) is the strongest independent       predictor of survival after removal from the list.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

There has been interest in understanding whether pre-operative frailty      is associated with worse outcomes after implantation of a left ventricular assist      device (LVAD) as destination therapy. METHODS: Patients undergoing LVAD      implantation as destination therapy at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota,      from February 2007 to June 2012, were included in this study. Frailty was      assessed using the deficit index (31 impairments, disabilities and comorbidities)      and defined as the proportion of deficits present. We divided patients based on      tertiles of the deficit index (>0.32 = frail, 0.23 to 0.32 = intermediate frail,       <0.23 = not frail). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to      examine the association between frailty and death. Patients were censored at      death or last follow-up through October 2013. RESULTS: Among 99 patients (mean      age 65 years, 18\\\% female, 55\\\% with ischemic heart failure), the deficit index      ranged from 0.10 to 0.65 (mean 0.29). After a mean follow-up of 1.9 +/- 1.6      years, 79\\\% of the patients had been rehospitalized (range 0 to 17      hospitalizations, median 1 per person) and 45\\\% had died. Compared with those who       were not frail, patients who were intermediate frail (adjusted HR 1.70, 95\\\% CI      0.71 to 4.31) and frail (HR 3.08, 95\\\% CI 1.40 to 7.48) were at increased risk for      death (p for trend = 0.004). The mean (SD) number of days alive out of hospital      the first year after LVAD was 293 (107) for not frail, 266 (134) for intermediate      frail and 250 (132) for frail patients. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty before destination      LVAD implantation is associated with increased risk of death and may represent a       significant patient selection consideration.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

As more children are placed on       mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to transplant, the risk factors       for development of sensitization warrant further study. A single-center      retrospective review of 36 children who received MCS identified 22 patients      supported with either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (n = 15) or      ECMO-ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 7) with paired (pre-MCS/post-MCS) panel      reactive antibodies (PRA) or only negative post-MCS PRAs. Four patients (18\\\%)      became sensitized post-MCS (one ECMO-only patient, three ECMO-VAD patients). No      difference was found between sensitized and nonsensitized patients in terms of      congenital heart disease versus primary cardiomyopathy (p = 0.096), duration of      MCS (38 days vs. 14 days, p = 0.233), or volume of blood product transfusions      (358.6 ml/kg vs. 612.7 ml/kg, p = not significant). By multivariable analysis,      the association of sensitization with older age at MCS (p = 0.076) and history of      homograft (p = 0.064) approached significance. Pediatric patients supported with       MCS are at low risk of developing HLA sensitization. Diagnosis, MCS duration, and      volume of transfused blood products do not appear to be associated with HLA      sensitization, but there is a suggestion of an association with older age at MCS       and history of a homograft.FAU - Hong, Borah JAU  - Hong BJAD  - From the *Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Texas Children\\s Hospital, Baylor      College of Medicine, Houston, Texas;

Little is known      about the incidence and clinical significance of late RHF during LVAD support.      METHODS: Between May 2004 and December 2013, 336 patients underwent      continuous-flow LVAD implantation. Of these, 293 patients (87\\\%) discharged with      isolated LVAD support were included in this study. Late RHF was defined as HF      requiring re-admission and medical or surgical intervention after initial      surgery. RESULTS: Late RHF occurred in 33 patients (11\\\%) at a median of 99 days      after discharge (range 19 to 1,357 days). Freedom from late RHF rates were 87\\\%,      84\\\% and 79\\\% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. RHF recurred in 15 patients. Three      patients required right ventricular assist device insertion. Univariable Cox      proportional hazards regression model showed diabetes mellitus (HR 2.05, 95\\\% CI      1.03 to 4.06, p = 0.04), body mass index >29 (HR 2.47, 95\\\% CI 1.24 to 4.94, p =      0.01) and blood urea nitrogen level >41 mg/dl (HR 2.19; 95\\\% CI 1.10 to 4.36; p =       0.025) as significant predictors for late RHF. Estimated on-device survival rates      at 2 years were 73\\\% in the RHF group and 82\\\% in the non-RHF group (p = 0.20).      However, overall survival at 2 years was significantly worse in patients who      developed late RHF (60\\\% vs 85\\\%, p = 0.016). This reduction was mostly attributed       to worse overall outcomes in the bridge-to-transplant (BTT) population.      CONCLUSIONS: Late RHF is common after continuous-flow LVAD implantation, but does      not affect survival during LVAD support. However, it is associated with worse      overall outcomes in the BTT population.CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Takeda, KojiAU  - Takeda KAD  - Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery Columbia University      Medical Center, New York, New York.

Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and third      generation LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimate      comparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flow      LVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A      semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHS costs data and patient      data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database (BTDB). Quality-adjusted      life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY were calculated for patients      receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotrope supported medical      management. LVADs cost pound80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices and delivered      greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilistic incremental       cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95\\\%CI:      pound31,802- pound94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates       were sensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of      receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the      device cost by 15\\\% decreased the ICER to pound50,106 ($79,533)/QALY. CONCLUSIONS:      Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefits at higher      costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK threshold of      pound20,000 to pound30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now      begins to approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently      recommended by the British NHS. Cost-effectiveness estimates are hampered by the       lack of randomized trials.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..

Recognizing that organ allocation in the highest      status patients remains controversial, we sought to compare outcomes of patients       with VADs and those receiving advanced medical therapy. METHODS: The United      Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to compare survival on the      waiting list and posttransplantation survival in status 1A heart transplantation       patients receiving VADs or high-dose/dual inotropic therapy or an intraaortic      balloon pump( IABP), or both. Adjusted survival was calculated using Cox\\s      proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Adjusted 1-year posttransplantation mortality      was higher among patients with VADs compared with patients receiving inotropic      agents alone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; p<0.05). Survival remained better for      patients receiving inotropic agents alone in the post-2008 era (HR, 1.36; p=0.03)      and among those with isolated left-sided support (HR, 1.33; p=0.008). When      patients who received IABPs were added and analyzed after 2008, the left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) group had similar survival (HR, 1.2; p=0.3).      Survival on the waiting list, however, was superior among patients with LVADs      (HR, 0.56; p<0.05). In a therapy transition analysis, failure of inotropic agents      and the need for LVAD support was a consistent marker for significantly worse      mortality (HR, 1.7; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although posttransplantation survival      is better for patients who are bridged to transplantation with inotropic      treatment only, the cost of failure of inotropic agents is significant, with a      nearly doubled mortality for those who later require VAD support. Survival on the      waiting list appears to be improved among patients receiving VAD support. Careful      selection of the appropriate bridging strategy continues to be a significant      clinical challenge.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

Anti-coagulation strategies      used to treat this complication are empiric and without firm data for guidance.      The addition of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to intravenous      anti-coagulation has been suggested by several case series and recent guidelines.      The aim of this study was to evaluate our use of eptifibatide for the treatment      of suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center      cohort study was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The medical informatics      system was queried to identify all LVAD patients who received eptifibatide for      suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis from January 1, 2011, through April 30, 2013.       RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (16 HeartMate II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], 1      HeartWare [HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA]) with 22 separate      administration attempts received eptifibatide (dose range, 0.1-2 mug/kg/min) for       suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis presenting as one or more of the following      findings: elevated lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, elevated plasma       free hemoglobin, LVAD dysfunction, or new, persistently high LVAD power. The mean      time from device implantation to eptifibatide therapy was 47.34 days (range,      3.88-397.67 days). Of the 22 attempts, 5 (22.7\\\%) resulted in resolution of 1 or      more patient-specific indicators of LVAD thrombus/thrombosis. Three patients      (17.6\\\%) had resolution of an indicator while also remaining free from continued      hemolysis, death, pump exchange, or emergent heart transplant. Bleeding events      were common, with 11 patients (64.7\\\%) experiencing bleeding during the infusion.       Seven patients (41.2\\\%) died, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage as the cause of      death in 2 patients. Pump exchange was performed in 3 patients.

Therefore, the balance between anti-coagulant and pro-coagulant factors needs to       be tightly controlled. The principle hypothesis of this study is that different      pump designs may have an effect on hemolysis and activation of the coagulation      system. Referring to this, the HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA)      and the HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) were      investigated. METHODS: For 20 patients with LVAD support (n = 10 each), plasma      coagulation, full blood count, and clinical chemistry parameters were measured.      Platelet function was monitored using platelet aggregometry, platelet function      analyzer-100 system ( Siemens, Marburg, Germany), vasodilator-stimulated      phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay, immature platelet fraction,      platelet-derived microparticles, and von Willebrand diagnostic. RESULTS: Acquired      von Willebrand syndrome could be detected in all patients. Signs of hemolysis, as      measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean, 470 U/liter HMII, 250 U/liter      HVAD; p < 0.001), were more pronounced in the HMII patients. In contrast, D-dimer      analysis indicated a significantly higher activation of the coagulation system in      HVAD patients (mean, 0.94 mg/liter HMII, 2.01 mg/liter HVAD; p < 0.01). The      efficacy of anti-platelet therapy using clopidogrel was not sufficient in more      than 50\\\% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the finding that all      patients with rotary blood pumps suffered from von Willebrand syndrome. In      addition, a distinct footprint of effects on hemolysis and the coagulation system      can be attributed to different devices. As a consequence, the individual status      of the coagulation system needs to be controlled in long-term patients.CI  - (c) 2013 Published by International Society for the Heart and Lung      Transplantation on behalf of International Society for Heart and Lung      Transplantation.FAU - Birschmann, IngvildAU  - Birschmann IAD  - Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation,      Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

Data regarding risk factors,      prevalence, and outcomes are limited. To better define the characteristics and      prognosis of hemolysis, we present a retrospective case-control study of LVAD      patients in our institution. METHODS: A detailed record review was conducted of      18 patients supported with the HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA)      who were diagnosed with hemolysis, and their data were compared with 82 patients       who received an LVAD implant during the same period who did not develop      hemolysis. Patients were excluded if they did not survive hospitalization at the       time of LVAD implantation. The primary end points of this analysis were time to      death and time to first hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 100 total patients, 18 HMII       patients (18\\\%) were diagnosed with hemolysis. Those with hemolysis were younger,       had significantly higher lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels, lower      international normalized ratio, and no difference in cannula velocities by      transthoracic echocardiography. Patient survival in the hemolysis group was      markedly decreased at 1 year (38.9\\\% vs 89.3\\\%, p < 0.001), but no differences in      hospitalization (p = 0.57) were observed. Partial to complete thrombosis was      noted in all of the pumps at explant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate      that hemolysis is associated with high mortality, likely serving as a marker of      pump thrombosis. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels are      important indicators for hemolysis, and lower international normalized ratio may       pre-dispose for this worrisome condition. Diagnosis should prompt clinicians to      consider pump exchange or explant, listing for transplantation, or intensifying      anti-coagulation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were      implanted with a CF-LVAD between January 2008 and June 2014. Eighty-five patients      were implanted with the device as a bridge to transplant (BTT); the remaining (n       = 43) were on destination therapy (DT). Each group was divided into patients <65       years old and >/=65 years old at device implantation. Patients were followed up      for at least 24 months or until transplant or death. RESULTS: Eighty-five      patients (66\\\%) received a CF-LVAD as BTT. Patients >/=65 years old (n = 8) had a       lower preoperative cardiac index and prothrombin time-international normalized      ratio (P = 0.009), and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (P = 0.008).      Adverse events including infections, re-exploration for bleeding, ischaemic and      haemorrhagic stroke, renal failure and right heart failure were comparable in      both age groups. Eighty-two percent (n = 63) of the young patients and 75\\\% (n =      6) of the older patients, who were on LVAD as BTT, underwent heart transplant      within the first 24 months of LVAD implantation. Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and      24 months were 95, 95, 77 and 70\\\%, respectively, post-CF-LVAD implantation as BTT      for the younger group and 73\\\% for the older group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P =      0.35). Forty-three patients (34\\\%) received a CF-LVAD as DT. Patients >/=65 years       old (n = 14) on DT had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular disease (P =      0.048), higher serum sodium (P = 0.004) and serum creatinine values (P = 0.002),       preoperatively. There were more strokes in the older patients post-LAVD      implantation (14 vs 0\\\%; P = 0.048). Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months      were 85, 79, 75 and 62\\\%, respectively, for the younger group and 93, 77, 67 and      34\\\% for the older group, respectively (P = 0.26). CONCLUSION: This study      demonstrates that LVAD therapy can be used in the older patients with acceptable       mortality and morbidity, and age alone should not be used as the sole criterion      for exclusion from LVAD implantation.CI  - (c) The Author 2015.

METHODS: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum free hemoglobin (sfHg) values were      tallied monthly in 182 patients on HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD      support. Peak values for each marker were identified, and 2 hemolysis definitions      were applied to the cohort: Hemolysis according to Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) criteria (sfHg > 40 mg/dl      with signs/symptoms) and/or hemolysis defined by an LDH >/= 600 IU/liter      (2.5-times the upper limit of laboratory normal). Kaplan-Meier survival free from      death, urgent United Network of Organ Sharing 1A transplant for thrombosis,      device exchange for thrombosis, and stroke/peripheral embolism was estimated, and      Cox hazard ratios (HR) with the 95\\\% confidence interval (95\\\% CI) were calculated.      Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for predicting      1-year event-free survival were calculated. RESULTS: Hemolysis occurred in 32      patients (18\\\%) by INTERMACS criteria and in 68 (37\\\%) patients by LDH criteria.      Over a median (25(th), 75(th)) support of 427 days (245, 793 days), there were 78      events. One year event-free survival after the onset of INTERMACS-defined      hemolysis was 16\\\% +/- 8.3\\\% compared with 85\\\% +/- 3.2\\\% in non-hemolyzers (HR,      14.7; 95\\\% CI, 7.9-27; AUC 0.70 +/- 0.05; p < 0.001; ). One year event-free      survival after the onset of LDH-defined hemolysis was 32\\\% +/- 7.2\\\% compared with       89\\\% +/- 3.2\\\% in those with persistent LDH values < 600 IU/liter (HR, 8.0; 95\\\% CI,      4.4-14; AUC 0.87 +/- 0.04; p < 0.001). Patients who met the LDH hemolysis      definition had longer times from hemolysis onset to clinical events and larger      magnitudes of risk for embolism and device exchange for thrombosis than those      with INTERMACS hemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Serum hemolysis marker elevations are      associated with increased events in LVAD patients. LDH monitoring provides an      earlier diagnosis of adverse events than sfHg, supporting need for a new      INTERMACS definition of VAD-associated hemolysis.CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Cowger, Jennifer AAU  - Cowger JAAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann      Arbor, Michigan.

95\\\% ci,      4.4-14; auc 0.87 +/- 0.04; p < 0.001). patients who met the ldh hemolysis      definition had longer times from hemolysis onset to clinical events and larger      magnitudes of risk for embolism and device exchange for thrombosis than those      with intermacs hemolysis. conclusions: serum hemolysis marker elevations are      associated with increased events in lvad patients. ldh monitoring provides an      earlier diagnosis of adverse events than sfhg, supporting need for a new      intermacs definition of vad-associated hemolysis.ci  - (c) 2014 international society for heart and lung transplantation published by      international society for the heart and lung transplantation all rights reserved.fau - cowger, jennifer aau  - cowger jaad  - division of cardiovascular medicine, university of michigan health system, ann      arbor, michigan. electronic address: jennifercowger@gmail.com.fau - romano, matthew aau  - romano maad  - department of cardiac surgery, university of michigan health system, ann arbor,      michigan.fau - shah, palakau  - shah pad  - division of cardiovascular medicine, university of michigan health system, ann      arbor, michigan.fau - shah, nehaau  - shah nad  - division of cardiovascular medicine, university of michigan health system, ann      arbor, michigan.fau - mehta, vivekau  - mehta vad  - department of cardiac surgery, university of michigan health system, ann arbor,      michigan.fau - haft, jonathan wau  - haft jwad  - department of cardiac surgery, university of michigan health system, ann arbor,      michigan.fau - aaronson, keith dau  - aaronson kdad  - division of cardiovascular medicine, university of michigan health system, ann      arbor, michigan.fau - pagani, francis dau  - pagani fdad  - department of cardiac surgery, university of michigan health system, ann arbor,      michigan.la  - engpt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\\tdep - 20131128pl  - united statesta  - j heart lung transplantjt  - the journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the      international society for heart transplantationjid - 9102703rn  - 0 (biological markers)rn  - 0 (hemoglobins)rn  - ec 1.1.1.27 (l-lactate dehydrogenase)sb  - immh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - biological markers/bloodmh  - cohort studiesmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/physiopathology/*therapymh  - heart-assist devices/*adverse effectsmh  - hemoglobins/metabolismmh  - hemolysis/*physiologymh  - humansmh  - incidencemh  - kaplan-meier estimatemh  - l-lactate dehydrogenase/bloodmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - registriesmh  - retrospective studiesmh  - risk factorsmh  - survival ratemh  - thrombosis/*epidemiology/mortalitymh  - ventricular dysfunction, left/physiopathology/*therapyoto - notnlmot  - hemolysisot  - lactate dehydrogenaseot  - left ventricular assist deviceot  - serum free hemoglobinedat- 2014/01/15 06:00mhda- 2014/10/31 06:00crdt- 2014/01/15 06:00phst- 2013/03/19 [received]phst- 2013/08/20 [revised]phst- 2013/08/20 [accepted]phst- 2013/11/28 [aheadofprint]aid - s1053-2498(13)01528-3 [pii]aid - 10.1016/j.healun.2013.08.021 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - j heart lung transplant. 2014 jan;33(1):35-43. doi: 10.1016/j.healun.2013.08.021.      epub 2013 nov 28.',surgery

An infrequent but serious      adverse event of LVAD support is thrombus ingestion or formation in the pump. In       this study, we analyze the incidence of pump thrombus, evaluate the comparative      effectiveness of various treatment strategies, and examine factors pre-disposing       to the development of pump thrombus. METHODS: The analysis included 382 patients       who underwent implantation of the HVAD as part of the HeartWare Bridge to      Transplant (BTT) and subsequent Continued Access Protocol (CAP) trial.      Descriptive statistics and group comparisons were generated to analyze baseline      characteristics, incidence of pump thrombus, and treatment outcomes. A      multivariate analysis was performed to assess significant risk factors for      developing pump thrombus. RESULTS: There were 34 pump thrombus events observed in      31 patients (8.1\\\% of the cohort) for a rate of 0.08 events per patient-year. The       incidence of pump thrombus did not differ between BTT and CAP. Medical management      of pump thrombus was attempted in 30 cases, and was successful in 15 (50\\\%). A      total of 16 patients underwent pump exchange, and 2 underwent urgent      transplantation. Five patients with a pump thrombus died after medical therapy      failed, 4 of whom also underwent a pump exchange. Survival at 1 year in patients       with and without a pump thrombus was 69.4\\\% and 85.5\\\%, respectively (p = 0.21). A       multivariable analysis revealed that significant risk factors for pump thrombus      included a mean arterial pressure > 90 mm Hg, aspirin dose </= 81 mg,      international normalized ratio </= 2, and Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile level of >/= 3 at implant.      CONCLUSIONS: Pump thrombus is a clinically important adverse event in patients      receiving an HVAD, occurring at a rate of 0.08 events per patient-year.      Significant risk factors for pump thrombosis include elevated blood pressure and       sub-optimal anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapies. This suggests that pump      thrombus event rates could be reduced through careful adherence to patient      management guidelines.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Najjar, Samer SAU  - Najjar SSAD  - Departments of Internal Medicine and Cardiac Surgery, MedStar Heart Institute,      Washington, DC.

A      perceived increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis in the HeartMate II (HMII)      LVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) by clinicians prompted this analysis of the      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)      database. METHODS: Between 2006 and June 2013, 8,988 United States patients aged       older than 18 years received a durable LVAD. Of these, 6,910 adult patients from       132 institutions who received a HMII LVAD were entered in the INTERMACS database       and constitute the study group for this analysis. RESULTS: Overall survival (with      censoring at transplant or explant for recovery) with the HMII LVAD was 80\\\% at 1       year and 69\\\% at 2 years and was not significantly different when stratified by      era of implant. Freedom from device exchange or death due to thrombosis decreased      from 99\\\% at 6 months in 2009 to 94\\\% in 2012 (p < 0.0001). Multivariable hazard      function analysis showed risk factors for pump thrombosis included later implant       year (p < 0.0001), younger age (p < 0.0001), higher creatinine (p = 0.002),      larger body mass index (p = 0.004), white race (p = 0.0004), left ventricular      ejection fraction above 20\\\% (p = 0.02), and higher lactate dehydrogenase level at      1 month (p < 0.0001). Survival (p < 0.0001) and freedom from infection (p =      0.008) and cerebrovascular accident (p < 0.0001) were lower after pump exchange      than after primary implant. CONCLUSIONS: Pump exchange or death due to pump      thrombosis increased during 2011 and 2012, but the magnitude of the increase      remained relatively small. Survival remains high (80\\\% at 1 year) with the HMII      LVAD. Risk factor analysis suggests that a number of patient-related factors      contribute to the risk of thrombosis.

Problems with device-related infection, bleeding, neurologic events,      right-sided heart failure, and device malfunction have dominated the clinical      care of patients living on mechanical support. Even as adoption of durable LVADs       accelerated globally, we began to encounter a growing dilemma of pump malfunction      caused by thrombosis.

By 2012, the problem of thrombosis in LVADs began to consume most of      the scientific direction as centers and collaborative groups began to dissect      this nascent phenomenon. In this perspective, we describe the magnitude and      implications of pump thrombosis, discuss secular and management trends in this      unique population, attempt to dissect the problem at its root, offer guidance on       surveillance and therapeutic principles, and outline issues that deserve our      immediate and collaborative attention.CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Mehra, Mandeep RAU  - Mehra MRAD  - The Brigham and Women\\s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and Harvard Medical      School, Boston, Massachusetts.

The      indications and subsequent benefits of performing valvular procedures in these      patients are unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of       performing concurrent surgical valve procedures in a large cohort of patients      receiving LVADs. METHODS: One thousand one hundred six patients received the      HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD in the bridge to transplant (n = 470) and destination      therapy (n = 636) clinical trials. Of these, 374 patients (34\\\%) had concurrent      cardiac surgery procedures as follows: 242 patients (21\\\%) with 281 concurrent      valve procedures (VP) (aortic 80, mitral 45, and tricuspid 156), and 641 patients      had only HMII LVAD. The focus of this study was to determine the clinical      outcomes of patients undergoing HMII + VP compared with those who received HMII      alone. RESULTS: Patients undergoing HMII + VP were significantly older, had      higher blood urea nitrogen levels and central venous pressure, and decreased      right ventricular stroke work index; intraoperatively, the median cardiopulmonary      bypass times were also longer. The unadjusted 30-day mortality was significantly       higher in patients undergoing HMII + VP (10.3\\\% vs 4.8\\\% for LVAD alone, P = .005).      Subgroup analysis of individual VPs showed that higher mortality occurred in      patients with HMII plus 2 or more VPs (13.5\\\%, P = .04) followed by trends for      increased mortality with HMII plus mitral alone (11.5\\\%, P = NS), HMII plus aortic      alone (10.9\\\%, P = NS), and HMII plus tricuspid (8.9\\\%, P = NS) procedures. Of      these various groups, only patients undergoing HMII + isolated aortic VP (P =      .001) and HMII + multiple VPs (P = .046) had significantly worse long-term      survival compared with patients undergoing HMII alone. Right heart failure and      right ventricular assist device use was increased in patients undergoing VPs, but      there was no difference in the incidence of bleeding or stroke. CONCLUSIONS:      Patients frequently require concurrent VPs at the time of LVAD placement; these      patients are sicker and have higher early mortality. Furthermore, right      ventricular dysfunction is increased in these patients. Further studies to      develop selection criteria for concurrent valve interventions are important to      further improve clinical outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

these      patients are sicker and have higher early mortality. furthermore, right      ventricular dysfunction is increased in these patients. further studies to      develop selection criteria for concurrent valve interventions are important to      further improve clinical outcomes.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 the american association for thoracic surgery. published by      mosby, inc. all rights reserved.fau - john, ranjitau  - john rad  - cardiothoracic surgery, university of minnesota, minneapolis, minn. electronic      address: johnx008@umn.edu.fau - naka, yoshifumiau  - naka yad  - cardiothoracic surgery, columbia presbyterian hospital, new york, ny.fau - park, soon jau  - park sjad  - cardiothoracic surgery, mayo clinic, rochester, minn.fau - sai-sudhakar, chittoorau  - sai-sudhakar cad  - cardiothoracic surgery, ohio state university, columbus, ohio.fau - salerno, christopherau  - salerno cad  - cardiac surgery, st vincent\\s heart center, indianapolis, ind.fau - sundareswaran, kartik sau  - sundareswaran ksad  - research and scientific affairs, thoratec corporation, pleasanton, calif.fau - farrar, david jau  - farrar djad  - research and scientific affairs, thoratec corporation, pleasanton, calif.fau - milano, carmelo aau  - milano caad  - cardiothoracic surgery, duke university, durham, nc.la  - engpt  - comparative studypt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\\tpl  - united statesta  - j thorac cardiovasc surgjt  - the journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgeryjid - 0376343sb  - aimsb  - immh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - *cardiac surgical procedures/adverse effects/mortalitymh  - clinical trials as topicmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/complications/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/*therapymh  - heart valve diseases/complications/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/*surgerymh  - *heart valve prosthesismh  - humansmh  - incidencemh  - kaplan-meier estimatemh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - multivariate analysismh  - postoperative complications/mortality/therapymh  - proportional hazards modelsmh  - prosthesis designmh  - retrospective studiesmh  - risk factorsmh  - time factorsmh  - treatment outcomemh  - *ventricular function, leftmh  - ventricular function, rightoto - notnlmot  - 22ot  - 27ot  - 35ot  - aiot  - bttot  - bunot  - cvpot  - dtot  - hmiiot  - heartmate iiot  - lvot  - lvadot  - raot  - rvot  - rvadot  - rvswiot  - trot  - vpot  - aortic insufficiencyot  - blood urea nitrogenot  - bridge to heart transplantot  - central venous pressureot  - destination therapyot  - left ventricularot  - left ventricular assist deviceot  - right atrialot  - right ventricularot  - right ventricular assist deviceot  - right ventricular stroke work indexot  - tricuspid regurgitationot  - valve procedureedat- 2014/01/15 06:00mhda- 2014/03/07 06:00crdt- 2014/01/15 06:00phst- 2013/05/06 [received]phst- 2013/09/16 [revised]phst- 2013/10/12 [accepted]aid - s0022-5223(13)01245-2 [pii]aid - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.10.024 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - j thorac cardiovasc surg. 2014 feb;147(2):581-9;

This       study investigated whether LVADs can be implanted in selected patients over the      age of 65 years with acceptable survival compared with published outcomes.      METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted in 64      consecutive patients >/=65 years of age implanted with a continuous-flow left      ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) as either bridge to transplantation or      destination therapy from August 2005 to January 2012. Baseline laboratory and      hemodynamic characteristics and follow-up data were obtained. Median survival was      1,090 days. Survival was 85\\\%, 74\\\%, 55\\\%, and 45\\\% at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3      years, respectively. Our cohort had a baseline mean Seattle Heart Failure Model      (SHFM) score of 2.6 +/- 0.9. Observed survival was significantly better than      SHFM-predicted medical survival. Stratification by age subsets, renal function,      SHFM, implantation intention, or etiology did not reveal significant differences       in survival. The most common cause of death was sepsis and nonlethalcomplication       was bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with patients over the age of 65      receiving CF-LVADs suggests that this group demonstrates excellent survival.      Further research is needed to discern the specific criteria for risk      stratification for LVAD support in the elderly.CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Rosenbaum, Andrew NAU  - Rosenbaum ANAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - John, RanjitAU  - John RAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of      Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Liao, Kenneth KAU  - Liao KKAD  - Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of      Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Adatya, SirtazAU  - Adatya SAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Colvin-Adams, Monica MAU  - Colvin-Adams MMAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Pritzker, MarcAU  - Pritzker MAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.FAU - Eckman, Peter MAU  - Eckman PMAD  - Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Muscle injury and subsequent activation of myogenic progenitor cells is      associated with oxidative stress. Cytoglobin is a hemoprotein expressed in      response to oxidative stress in a variety of tissues, including striated muscle.       In this study, we demonstrate that cytoglobin is up-regulated in activated      myogenic progenitor cells, where it localizes to the nucleus and contributes to      cell viability. siRNA-mediated depletion of cytoglobin from C2C12 myoblasts      increased levels of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death both at      baseline and in response to stress stimuli. Conversely, overexpression of      cytoglobin reduced reactive oxygen species levels, caspase activity, and cell      death. Mice in which cytoglobin was knocked out specifically in skeletal muscle      were generated to examine the role of cytoglobin in vivo. Myogenic progenitor      cells isolated from these mice were severely deficient in their ability to form      myotubes as compared with myogenic progenitor cells from wild-type littermates.      Consistent with this finding, the capacity for muscle regeneration was severely      impaired in mice deficient for skeletal-muscle cytoglobin.

The purpose of our      study was to examine differences in HRQOL from before mechanical circulatory      support (MCS) through 1 year after surgery by Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) patient profiles. METHODS:       Data from 1,559 adults with advanced heart failure who received primary      continuous-flow pumps between June 23, 2006, and March 31, 2010, and were      enrolled in INTERMACS were analyzed. HRQOL data were collected using the EQ-5D-3L      survey before implantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation.      Statistical analyses included chi-square and t-tests, using all available data      for each time period. Paired t-tests and sensitivity analyses were also      conducted. RESULTS: HRQOL was poor before MCS implantation among patients with      INTERMACS profiles 1 to 7 and significantly improved after MCS implantation for      all profiles. Stratified by INTERMACS profile, problems within each of the 5      dimensions of HRQOL (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and      anxiety/depression) generally decreased from before to after implantation. By 6      months after implantation, patients with all INTERMACS profiles reported similar       frequencies of problems for all HRQOL dimensions. Paired t-tests and sensitivity       analyses supported almost all of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is poor among      advanced heart failure patients with INTERMACS profiles 1 to 7 before MCS      implantation and improves to similar levels for patients who remained on MCS 1      year after surgery. Patients have problems in HRQOL dimensions before and after      MCS; however, the frequency of reporting problems decreases for all dimensions      within most profiles across time.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Grady, Kathleen LAU  - Grady KLAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, Northwestern University,      Chicago, Illinois.

METHODS: Children bridged to transplantation from 2004 to 2011 were      included. RVD was defined as the use of a left VAD (LVAD) with an elevated      central venous pressure of >16 mm Hg with inotropic therapy and/or inhaled nitric      oxide for >96 hours or biventricular assist (BiVAD). RESULTS: A total of 57      children (median age, 2.97 years; range 35 days to 15.8 years) were supported. Of      the 57, 43 (75\\\%) had an LVAD, and of those, 10 developed RVD. The remaining 14      (25\\\%) required BiVAD. Thus, RVD occurred in 24 of 57 patients (42\\\%). Preoperative      variables such as younger age (P = .01), use of extracorporeal mechanical support      (P = .006), and elevated urea (P = .03), creatinine (P = .02), and bilirubin (P =      .001) were associated with RVD. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated      that elevated urea and extracorporeal mechanical support (odds ratio, 26.4; 95\\\%      confidence interval, 2.3-307.3; and odds ratio, 27.8; 95\\\% confidence interval,      2.5-312.3, respectively) were risk factors for BiVAD. The patients who developed       RVD on LVAD had a complicated postoperative course but excellent survival (100\\\%),      comparable to those with preserved right ventricular function (91\\\%). The survival      for those requiring BiVAD was reduced (71\\\%). CONCLUSIONS: RVD occurred in      approximately 40\\\% of pediatric VAD recipients and affects their peri-implantation      morbidity and bridging outcomes. Preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation      and elevated urea were risk factors for BiVAD.

range 35 days to 15.8 years) were supported. of      the 57, 43 (75\\\%) had an lvad, and of those, 10 developed rvd. the remaining 14      (25\\\%) required bivad. thus, rvd occurred in 24 of 57 patients (42\\\%). preoperative      variables such as younger age (p = .01), use of extracorporeal mechanical support      (p = .006), and elevated urea (p = .03), creatinine (p = .02), and bilirubin (p =      .001) were associated with rvd. multiple logistic regression analysis indicated      that elevated urea and extracorporeal mechanical support (odds ratio, 26.4; 95\\\%      confidence interval, 2.3-307.3; and odds ratio, 27.8; 95\\\% confidence interval,      2.5-312.3, respectively) were risk factors for bivad. the patients who developed       rvd on lvad had a complicated postoperative course but excellent survival (100\\\%),      comparable to those with preserved right ventricular function (91\\\%). the survival      for those requiring bivad was reduced (71\\\%). conclusions: rvd occurred in      approximately 40\\\% of pediatric vad recipients and affects their peri-implantation      morbidity and bridging outcomes. preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation      and elevated urea were risk factors for bivad. additional studies of the      management of rvd in children after vad implantation are warranted.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 the american association for thoracic surgery. published by      mosby, inc. all rights reserved.fau - karimova, annau  - karimova aad  - cardiothoracic unit, great ormond street hospital for children, london, united      kingdom. electronic address: ann.karimova@gosh.nhs.uk.fau - pockett, charissa rau  - pockett crad  - department of pediatric cardiology, stollery children\\s hospital, edmonton,      alberta, canada.fau - lasuen, nagoreau  - lasuen nad  - cardiothoracic unit, great ormond street hospital for children, london, united      kingdom.fau - dedieu, nathalieau  - dedieu nad  - cardiothoracic unit, great ormond street hospital for children, london, united      kingdom.fau - rutledge, jenniferau  - rutledge jad  - department of pediatric cardiology, stollery children\\s hospital, edmonton,      alberta, canada.fau - fenton, mathewau  - fenton mad  - cardiothoracic unit, great ormond street hospital for children, london, united      kingdom.fau - vanderpluym, christinaau  - vanderpluym cad  - department of cardiology, boston children\\s hospital, boston, mass.fau - rebeyka, ivan mau  - rebeyka imad  - department of pediatric cardiology, stollery children\\s hospital, edmonton,      alberta, canada.fau - dominguez, troy eau  - dominguez tead  - cardiothoracic unit, great ormond street hospital for children, london, united      kingdom.fau - buchholz, holgerau  - buchholz had  - department of pediatric cardiology, stollery children\\s hospital, edmonton,      alberta, canada.la  - enggr  - pg/12/5/29350/british heart foundation/united kingdompt  - journal articlept  - multicenter studypt  - observational studydep - 20131215pl  - united statesta  - j thorac cardiovasc surgjt  - the journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgeryjid - 0376343sb  - aimsb  - immh  - adolescentmh  - chi-square distributionmh  - childmh  - child, preschoolmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/*therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - *heart-assist devices/adverse effectsmh  - humansmh  - incidencemh  - infantmh  - infant, newbornmh  - logistic modelsmh  - malemh  - multivariate analysismh  - odds ratiomh  - prosthesis designmh  - *pulsatile flowmh  - retrospective studiesmh  - risk factorsmh  - severity of illness indexmh  - time factorsmh  - treatment outcomemh  - ventricular dysfunction, left/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/*therapymh  - ventricular dysfunction, right/diagnosis/mortality/*physiopathology/therapymh  - *ventricular function, leftmh  - *ventricular function, rightmh  - waiting listsedat- 2013/12/18 06:00mhda- 2014/06/28 06:00crdt- 2013/12/18 06:00phst- 2013/05/15 [received]phst- 2013/10/29 [revised]phst- 2013/11/08 [accepted]phst- 2013/12/15 [aheadofprint]aid - s0022-5223(13)01327-5 [pii]aid - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.11.012 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - j thorac cardiovasc surg. 2014 may;147(5):1691-1697.e1. doi:      10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.11.012. epub 2013 dec 15.',surgery

Device      thrombosis is a serious complication of CF-LVADs, but its precise prevalence and       etiology remains uncertain. METHODS: Root-cause analysis was performed in all      cases with device thrombosis confirmed upon explant among patients implanted with      a HeartMate II (HM II) from January 1, 2009 to November 15, 2012. Cannula      position and bend relief integrity were assessed and charts were reviewed with      particular attention to anti-coagulation and infection profiles. RESULTS:      Nineteen of 177 patients (11\\\%) were found to have device thrombosis of various      etiologies after a mean of 351 +/- 311 days, representing 0.12      event/patient-year. Of the 5 mechanically induced thromboses, proximate etiology       was severely abnormal inflow cannula position in 3 patients and bend relief      disconnect with deformed outflow graft in 2 patients. One patient had a      hypercoagulable disorder with prior arterial embolism. In the remaining 13      patients (age 61 +/- 14 years, 77\\\% male, 69\\\% Caucasian), \\\"non-mechanical\\\" device       thrombosis occurred after 357 +/- 383 days; INR at the time of diagnosis was 1.81      (1.62 to 2.07); and mean device speed was 8,855 +/- 359 rpm. Five of 13 patients       (38\\\%) had an infection during the month leading up to device thrombosis. Of note,      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was already elevated at the time of discharge in      patients who would later develop non-mechanical device thrombosis (423 [354 to      766] vs 352 [272 to 373] U/liter, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Device thrombosis is a       multifactorial phenomenon, and differentiation of mechanical and non-mechanical      causes is an essential step for individual diagnosis and treatment plans. Larger       studies excluding patients with obvious mechanical etiology are needed to      investigate biologic and/or management-related risk factors for device      thrombosis. Our findings suggest that LDH may be an early risk marker. Due to the      difficulty in treating late-stage device thrombosis, we suggest early use of      simple tests to rule out both causes of thrombosis, such as X-rays and closer LDH      monitoring (bi-weekly).CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Uriel, NirAU  - Uriel NAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, New York, New York.

We evaluated the feasibility of low-molecular-weight heparin      (LMWH) for initiation of anti-coagulation and transitioning to oral      anti-coagulation after LVAD implantation. METHODS: This single-center study      included 78 consecutive patients who underwent either Thoratec HeartMate II LVAD       (n = 27) or HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD, n = 51) implantation. The       LMWHs enoxaparin (n = 50) and dalteparin (n = 28) were used. LMWH was started      within 24 hours post-operatively in 79.5\\\% of patients. No anti-coagulation was      given before starting LMWH therapy. LMWH activity was monitored by determination       of anti-factor Xa levels in plasma. RESULTS: The majority of patients (80.7\\\%) had      peak anti-Xa activity within the defined range of efficacy of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/ml by      the second day of treatment. Mean effective peak anti-Xa activity was 0.28 +/-      0.06 IU/ml. Mean duration of anti-coagulation with LMWH was 25.8 +/- 18 days.      Ischemic strokes were observed in 3 patients (3.8\\\%), with a total of 4 events.      Three events occurred while on LMWH, and 1 event occurred during follow-up on      oral anti-coagulation. There was 1 fatal stroke. No pump thrombus was observed.      Major bleeding was observed in 5 patients (6.4\\\%), with a total of 6 events.      Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common complication (n = 3). There were no      fatal bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: LMWH in the setting of LVAD shows rapid and      constant biologic efficacy. Anti-coagulation with LMWH appears feasible after      LVAD implantation. These findings support further evaluation of LMWH as an      alternative to unfractionated heparin in this patient cohort.CI  - (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Sandner, Sigrid EAU  - Sandner SEAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

To assess long-term freedom from DL      infection associated with this technique, a multicenter SSI registry was      initiated. It was hypothesized that the modified tunneling technique is      associated with at least 50\\\% reduction in DL infection at 1 year post-implant      compared with the velour-to-skin method used in the HeartMate II (HMII)      Destination Therapy (DT) trial. METHODS: SSI is a retrospective and prospective      registry of patients who have received the HMII device. Results are reported from      the retrospective cohort, which consists of 200 patients who were implanted      during the period 2009-2012 with the SSI tunneling method and on HMII support for      at least 10 months at the time of enrollment. The prevalence and incidence of DL       infection after left ventricular assist device implantation in the SSI      retrospective cohort were determined and compared with a control group of 201      patients also on HMII support for at least 10 months from the HMII DT clinical      trial who were implanted during the period 2007-2009 using the traditional method      in which a small section of the velour portion of the DL was externalized.      RESULTS: The 1-year and 2-year prevalence rates of DL infection were 9\\\% and 19\\\%      in the SSI patient group compared with 23\\\% and 35\\\% in the control group (hazard      ratio 0.49, 95\\\% confidence interval 0.33-0.73, p < 0.001). The event-per-patient       year was 0.11 and 0.22 for the SSI and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001).       Based on a multivariate analysis, age and DL exit side were the only independent       variables associated with DL infection. Effects of management changes over the      eras were not studied and could have contributed to the findings. CONCLUSIONS:      These results suggest that leaving the entire DL velour portion below the skin is      associated with 50\\\% reduction in DL infection compared with results from the HMII      DT trial.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The MVAD Pump (HeartWare Inc,       Framingham, MA) is a small, axial VAD that uses magnetic and hydrodynamic      impeller technology and incorporates wide helical flow channels to minimize shear      stress. In this study, we implanted the MVAD Pump in an ovine model to evaluate      device hemocomaptiblity, biocompatibility, performance, and safety. METHODS: The       MVAD Pump was implanted in an ovine model (n = 9) for 90 days. The pump was      implanted through a thoracotomy and secured to the LV apex with a gimbaled sewing      ring, which allowed for intraoperative adjustment of the insertion depth and      angle of the inflow cannula. Serum analytes and coagulation parameters were      analyzed at specific intervals throughout the study period. Pump flow, speed, and      power were recorded daily to monitor device performance. Sheep were electively      euthanized at 90 days for pathologic and histologic analysis. RESULTS: In this      study, results demonstrated the safety, reliability, hemocompatability, and      biocompatibility of the MVAD Pump. Nine animals were implanted for 90 +/- 5 days.      No complications occurred during surgical implantation. Seven of the 9 animals      survived until elective sacrifice. Each sheep that survived to the scheduled      explant appeared physically normal, with no signs of cardiovascular or other      organ compromise. The 2 sheep that were euthanized early showed no evidence of      device-related issues. CONCLUSIONS: The MVAD Pump was successfully implanted      through a thoracotomy and demonstrated excellent hemodynamic support with no      device malfunctions throughout the study period.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - McGee, Edwin JrAU  - McGee E JrAD  - Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Northwestern      University School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.

The short- and      long-term impact of these devices on peripheral blood gene expression has not      been characterized, and may provide insight into the molecular pathways mediated       in response to left ventricular remodeling and an improvement in overall systemic      circulation. We performed RNA sequencing to identify genes and pathways      influenced by these devices. METHODS: RNA was extracted from blood of 9 heart      failure patients (8 male) prior to LVAD implantation, and at 7 and 180 days      postoperatively. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 and sequences       mapped to the human Ensembl GRCh37.67 genome assembly. RESULTS: A specific set of      genes involved in regulating cellular immune response, antigen presentation, and       T cell activation and survival were down-regulated 7 days after LVAD placement. 6      months following LVAD placement, the expression levels of these genes were      significantly increased; yet importantly, remained significantly lower than age      and sex-matched samples from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this      genomic analysis identified a significant decrease in the expression of genes      that promote a healthy immune response in patients with heart failure that was      partially restored 6 months following LVAD implant.FAU - Mitchell, AdamAU  - Mitchell AAD  - Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America ;

Our aim was to determine risk factors associated with      the outcomes of delisting, transplant, or death while waiting. METHODS: In this      single-center, retrospective study of patients listed for heart transplants,      competing risk analysis was used to model survival from listing to 4 competing      outcomes (transplant, death, delisting for clinical deterioration, delisting for       clinical improvement or surgical intervention). RESULTS: There were 308 listing      episodes in 280 patients. In competing risk analysis, 11\\\% remained listed at 6      months (transplant 62\\\%, dead 13\\\%, delisted worse 6\\\%, delisted improved 8\\\%).      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices were      associated both with higher probability of transplant (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; P       < .001) and delisting for clinical deterioration (HR, 2.7; P = .06). Younger age       at listing and complex congenital heart disease were shared risk factors for      mortality (HR, 1.07; P = .05; HR, 2.9; P = .003) and delisting because of      clinical deterioration (HR, 1.17; P = .01; HR, 2.8; P = .02). Younger age at      listing and fetal listing were associated with delisting for clinical improvement      or surgical intervention (HR, 1.13; P = .01; HR, 2.9; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS:      Overall survival to transplant depends on risk factors including age at listing,       cardiac diagnosis, and mechanical circulatory support.

We aimed to assess the utility of the SHFM by validation      in patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for heart transplantation. METHODS: We      assessed the SHFM performance in 382 patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for      heart transplantation. Outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or      left ventricular assist device. Model discrimination and calibration were      assessed graphically and by formal tests. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 2.3      years, 195 events occurred. One-, 2-, and 3-year observed event-free survival was      77\\\%, 62\\\%, and 52\\\%, and the observed to predicted event-free survival ratio was      0.89, 0.80, and 0.76. Calibration plots demonstrated results deviating from the      ideal calibration line at 1, 2, and 3 years. The SHFM score adequately assigned      patients in discrete risk strata, according to Kaplan-Meier estimated survival.      Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good      discrimination overall, which was slightly better for 1-year (area under the      curve [AUC] 0.774) compared with 2-year (AUC 0.742) and 3-year (AUC 0.728)      event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The SHFM has good discrimination but      underestimates risk of adverse outcomes in patients with CRT and/or ICD referred       for heart transplantation. The SHFM may be used to assess relative risk and      changes over time, but when assessing absolute percentage of event-free survival,      the overestimation of event-free survival should be accounted for.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Mosby, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage heart failure as a result of CCMP from      anthracyclines are often precluded from heart transplantation because of a      history of cancer. In such patients, durable MCS may offer an important chance      for life prolongation. Yet, there are no data to support the use of MCS in this      increasingly prevalent group of patients. METHODS: We searched 3,812 MCS patients      from June 2006 through March 2011 in the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) database for the diagnosis of CCMP. We      compared characteristics, outcomes, and survival between CCMP patients and      patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS:      Compared with patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ischemic      cardiomyopathy, patients with CCMP were overwhelmingly female (72\\\% vs. 24\\\% vs.      13\\\%, p = 0.001), had MCS more often implanted as destination therapy (33\\\% vs. 14\\\%      vs. 22\\\%, p = 0.03), required more right ventricular assist device support (19\\\%      vs. 11\\\% vs. 6\\\%, p = 0.006), and had a higher risk of bleeding (p = 0001).      Survival of CCMP patients was similar to that of other groups. CONCLUSIONS: CCMP       patients treated with MCS have survival similar to other MCS patients despite      more frequent need for right ventricular assist device support and increased      bleeding risk.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

METHODS: We examined the association of      pre-operative health status, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy      Questionnaire (KCCQ), with survival and hospitalization after LVAD using the KCCQ      score as a continuous variable and stratified by KCCQ score quartile plus missing      KCCQ in 1,125 clinical trial participants who received the HeartMate II (Thoratec      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) as destination therapy (n = 635) or bridge to      transplantation (n = 490). RESULTS: The mean pre-operative KCCQ score was 29.4      +/- 18.7 among survivors (n = 719), and 27.1 +/- 18.3 (n = 406) in those who      died. In time-to-event analysis for all available follow-up using health status      as a continuous variable, the pre-operative KCCQ score did not correlate with      overall mortality after LVAD implantation (p = 0.178). Small absolute differences      were seen between the pre-operative KCCQ quartile and 30-day survival (Q4 95\\\% vs.      Q1 89\\\% vs. missing 87\\\%; p = 0.0009 for trend), 180-day survival (Q4 83\\\% vs. Q1      76\\\% vs missing 79\\\%; p = 0.060 for trend), and days hospitalized at 180 days (Q4      29.8 +/- 25.6 vs. Q1 34.1 +/- 27.1 vs. missing 36.5 +/- 29.9 days; p = 0.009 for       trend). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that pre-operative health status has      limited association with outcomes after LVAD implantation. Although these data      require further study in a diverse population, mechanical circulatory support may      represent a relatively unique clinical situation, distinct from heart failure and      other cardiac surgeries, in which heart failure-specific health status measures      may be largely reversed.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Flint, Kelsey MAU  - Flint KMAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, Stanford University Hospital, Palo Alto,      California.FAU - Matlock, Daniel DAU  - Matlock DDFAU - Sundareswaran, Kartik SAU  - Sundareswaran KSFAU - Lindenfeld, JoannAU  - Lindenfeld JFAU - Spertus, John AAU  - Spertus JAFAU - Farrar, David JAU  - Farrar DJFAU - Allen, Larry AAU  - Allen LALA  - engGR  - K23 HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131008PL  - United StatesTA  - J Heart Lung TransplantJT  - The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the      International Society for Heart TransplantationJID - 9102703SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - *Health Status IndicatorsMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Preoperative PeriodMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/mortality/*therapyPMC - PMC3838487MID - NIHMS525985OID - NLM: NIHMS525985OID - NLM: PMC3838487OTO - NOTNLMOT  - health statusOT  - health-related quality of lifeOT  - heart failureOT  - mechanical circulatory supportOT  - risk predictionEDAT- 2013/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/15 06:00PHST- 2013/05/06 [received]PHST- 2013/09/12 [revised]PHST- 2013/09/12 [accepted]PHST- 2013/10/08 [aheadofprint]AID - S1053-2498(13)01434-4 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.healun.2013.09.005 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Heart Lung Transplant. 2013 Dec;32(12):1249-54. doi:      10.1016/j.healun.2013.09.005.

Coexistent cardiac and renal       dysfunction (so-called cardiorenal syndrome) increases the risk of death, both      with advanced heart failure and after LVAD implantation. We analyzed patients      from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assist Circulatory Support to      better estimate postimplant mortality according to the severity of renal      dysfunction. METHODS: Patients with a continuous-flow LVAD were grouped according      to their pre-implant level of renal dysfunction: severe was defined as dialysis      and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min; moderate if eGFR       was 30 to 59 ml/min or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was > 60 mg/dl; and mild or no      renal dysfunction if eGFR was >/= 60 ml/min and BUN was < 60 mg/dl. RESULTS: Of      the 4,917 patients with a continuous-flow LVAD implanted between June 2006 and      March 2012, 3,160 (64\\\%) were identified with mild or no renal dysfunction, 1,475       (30\\\%) with moderate dysfunction, and 282 (6\\\%) with severe dysfunction. Worsening       renal dysfunction correlated with decreased survival, with nearly a 20\\\% reduction      in the 2-year survival going from low to severe dysfunction. The major negative      survival effect occurred during the first 3 months. Combination of severe renal      dysfunction and cardiogenic shock predicted the highest early mortality.      CONCLUSIONS: Pre-implant renal dysfunction predicts higher mortality after LVAD      implant. The progressive reduction in survival with higher grades of renal      dysfunction supports consideration of LVAD implant before cardiorenal syndrome is      advanced. For patients with severe renal dysfunction and other major      comorbidities, initial support with a temporary device while awaiting organ      recovery before implanting a durable pump could be considered.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published by      International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.FAU - Kirklin, James KAU  - Kirklin JKAD  - Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.

At the time of      LVAD implant, a large proportion of patients have pulmonary hypertension, right      ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). RV dysfunction      and TR can exacerbate renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy,      edema, and even prohibit isolated LVAD implant. Repairing TR mandates increased      cardiopulmonary bypass time and bicaval cannulation, which should be reserved for      the time of orthotopic heart transplantation. We hypothesized that CF LVAD      implant would improve pulmonary artery pressures, enhance RV function, and      minimize TR, obviating need for surgical tricuspid repair. METHODS: One hundred      fourteen continuous flow LVADs implanted from 2005 through 2011 at a single      center, with medical management of functional TR, were retrospectively analyzed.       Pulmonary artery pressures were measured immediately prior to and following LVAD       implant. RV function and TR were graded according to standard echocardiographic      criteria, prior to, immediately following, and long-term following LVAD. RESULTS:      There was a significant improvement in post-VAD mean pulmonary arterial pressures      (26.6 +/- 4.9 vs. 30.2 +/- 7.4 mmHg, p = 0.008) with equivalent loading pressures      (CVP = 12.0 +/- 4.0 vs. 12.1 +/- 5.1 p = NS). RV function significantly improved,      as noted by right ventricular stroke work index (7.04 +/- 2.60 vs. 6.05 +/- 2.54,      p = 0.02). There was an immediate improvement in TR grade and RV function      following LVAD implant, which was sustained long term.

However, outcomes depending on the preoperative       level of stability can substantially differ, resulting in a limited analysis of      potentialities and drawbacks of a given device. In the present study we sought to      compare in our single-center experience the survival results of this      third-generation device with previous left ventricular systems taking into      account the different preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) levels. Between February 1993 and March 2012, 287      patients underwent assist device implantation in our university hospital      (INTERMACS Level 1-2 = 158 patients; INTERMACS Level 3-4-5 = 129 patients).      Assist devices implanted were: Group A (HVAD HeartWare, n = 52), group B      (previous continuous-flow ventricular assist device [VAD], InCor [Berlin Heart,      Berlin, Germany], n = 37; VentrAssist [VentraCor, Inc., Chatswood, NSW,      Australia], n = 7; DeBakey [MicroMed Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA], n =      32), and group C (pulsatile systems, n = 159). After cumulative support duration       of 54 436 days and a mean follow-up of 6.21 +/- 7.46 months (range 0-45.21      months), log-rank analysis revealed a survival for group A of 82.0\\\%, 70.4\\\%, and      70.4\\\%; for group B of 84.0\\\%, 48.2\\\%, 33.7\\\%; and for group C of 71.6\\\%, 46.1\\\%,      33.8\\\%, at 1, 12, and 24 months respectively, with a significantly (P = 0.013)      better outcome for group A. When stratifying the survival on the basis of      INTERMACS level, no significant survival improvement was observed among all      patients who underwent VAD implantation in INTERMACS 1-2 (P = 0.47). However,      among patients who underwent elective VAD implantation (INTERMACS 3-4-5), group A      had a significantly better outcome (P = 0.005) compared with the other      INTERMACS-matched groups (B,C) with a survival rate of 88.8\\\% in group A versus      34.2\\\% in group B and 45.6\\\% in group C at 24 months, respectively.

METHODS: This was a retrospective      cohort study of 7 years\\ experience with the Berlin Heart (BH) EXCOR (Berlin      Heart AG, Berlin Germany) paracorporeal ventricular assist device (VAD) in 2      United Kingdom (UK) pediatric heart transplant centers and the effect of this      program on the UK pediatric heart transplant service. RESULTS: Of 102 children      who received BH support, 84\\\% survived to transplant or BH explant and 81\\\%      survived to discharge. Neither age nor duration of support influenced outcome.      Stroke, ongoing requirement for ventilation while on BH, and diagnosis other than      dilated cardiomyopathy were the only independent mortality risk factors. Children      who weighed < 20 kg had significantly (p = 0.03) longer support times than bigger      children. The number of children treated with a BH increased over time (p =      0.01). Currently > 50\\\% of pediatric heart transplants are bridged with a BH;      however, pediatric transplants per year have not increased significantly (p =      0.07) CONCLUSIONS: BH use in the UK has allowed significant increases in the      number of children with end-stage heart failure who can be successfully bridged      to transplant and the length of time they can be supported.

Understanding the hemostatic defects contributing to NSB      after CF-LVAD implantation is crucial for prevention of this adverse event. The      aim of this study was to examine the link between platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha      (GPIbalpha) ectodomain shedding and NSB in CF-LVAD recipients and to identify a      potential biomarker of NSB. METHODS: Serial blood samples were collected from 35       HF patients supported with CF-LVADs. Platelet function was evaluated by a      platelet function analysis device and thromboelastography (TEG). Platelet      GPIbalpha shedding, von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen and vWF collagen binding       capacity were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The      structural analysis of vWF was performed by gel electrophoresis. These platelet      function measures with vWF parameters of the patients who had NSB between 4 and      32 days after CF-LVAD implantation (bleeder) were analyzed against those without       NSB (non-bleeder). Blood samples from 7 healthy individuals were collected to      obtain healthy reference values for the laboratory assays. RESULTS: Elevated      GPIbalpha shedding was found to be a pre-existing condition in all HF patients      prior to CF-LVAD implantation. Post-operative level of GPIbalpha shedding      increased and remained elevated in the bleeder group, whereas a consistent      decrease was found in the non-bleeder group. A receiver operating characteristic       (ROC) analysis indicated that the level of GPIbalpha shedding had a predictive      power of NSB in patients on CF-LVAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet GPIbalpha      ectodomain shedding which attenuates platelet reactivity is associated with NSB.       Plasma GPIbalpha level may potentially be used to refine bleeding risk      stratification in CF-LVAD patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We      evaluated the association between serial measurements of CPCs and functional      capacity and outcomes in heart failure (HF). METHODS: We included 156 consecutive      consenting ambulatory HF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40\\\%). We       evaluated CPCs and functional capacity (peak VO2) every 6 months for up to 2      years. CPCs were measured as early-outgrowth colony-forming units (EO-CFUs) and      circulating CD34+, VEGFR2+ and/or CD133+ cells. We recorded mortality, HF      hospital admissions, transplant, and ventricular assist device. RESULTS: The mean      age was 55 +/- 15 years. A decrease in CD34+VEGFR2+ cells was independently      associated with increased functional capacity; a 10-cell decrease in CD34+VEGFR2+      cells was associated with an increase of 0.2 mL/kg/min in peak VO2 (P < 0.05). We      found an interaction effect (P = 0.02) between EO-CFUs and diabetes: in patients       without diabetes, a 10-EO-CFU increase was independently associated with      increased peak VO2 of 0.28 mL/kg/min (P = 0.01), and in patients with diabetes, a      decrease in EO-CFUs was associated with an increased peak VO2 (P < 0.05). Higher       EO-CFUs were associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95\\\%      confidence interval, 0.09-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: We noted differential relations      between CPCs and outcomes in patients with vs without diabetes. Higher EO-CFUs      and lower CD34+VEGFR2+ cells were associated with improved functional capacity      and reduced mortality in nondiabetic patients. In patients with diabetes, lower      EO-CFUs were associated with improved functional capacity. The basis for these      differences requires further examination.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) is a      significant adverse event in these patients and treatment typically requires      reduction or elimination of AC or anti-platelet therapy. It is not known whether       alterations in AC to treat GI bleeding influence subsequent risk of      thromboembolic (TE) events during LVAD support. METHODS: Between July 2003 and      September 2011, 389 patients (308 male) underwent implantation of a      continuous-flow LVAD at the University of Michigan Health System and the Mayo      Clinic. Median age at implant was 60 years (range 18 to 79 years). Outcomes were       analyzed for the association of GI bleeding events and subsequent TE events,      defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, hemolysis or suspected or confirmed      pump thrombosis. RESULTS: Median survival was 10 months (maximum 7.2 years, total      439 patient-years). TE events occurring within the first 30 days were not      counted. Overall survival and freedom from an outcome event were assessed using      the Kaplan-Meier method. Associations between GI bleeding and subsequent TE      events and survival impact were analyzed as time-dependent covariates. One      hundred ninety-nine GI bleeding episodes occurred in 116 of 389 patients (30\\\%)      for an event rate of 0.45 GI bleed/patient-year of support. One hundred      thirty-eight TE events occurred in 97 of 389 patients (25\\\%) for an event rate of       0.31 TE event/patient-year of support. Median time from LVAD implant to first GI       bleed was 5 months (range 1 to 116 months) and to first TE event was 6 months      (range 1 to 29 months). For patients who had a TE event after GI bleed, the      median interval was 5 months (range 0.5 to 25 months). TE events were 7.4-fold      more likely in patients who had a prior GI bleed (range 4.9- to 11.1-fold) (p <      0.001); however, neither the presence of GI bleeding (0.7 to 1.2) nor a TE event       (0.8 to 2.0) portended a lower overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had GI      bleeding were at significantly higher risk for a subsequent TE event. Although      the exact cause of this relationship is unknown, it suggests that a reduction in       anti-coagulation and anti-platelet management to treat GI bleeds may contribute      to this risk.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The objective of this study was to evaluate      outcomes of pediatric patients supported by the HMII LVAD. METHODS: This was a      retrospective review of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) of patients supported with a HMII from April 2008      to September 2011. The primary cohort comprised pediatric patients aged 11 to 18       years. Outcomes were compared with a group of young adults aged 19 to 39 years      who underwent HMII implant during the same period. Ischemic etiologies for heart       failure were excluded. RESULTS: There were 28 pediatric patients, of whom 19      (68\\\%) were males, 14 (46\\\%) were African American, and 7 (25\\\%) underwent device      placement in a pediatric hospital. Competing outcomes analysis showed that at 6      months of follow-up, the composite of survival to transplantation, ongoing      support, or recovery was 96\\\% for the pediatric group, which was not significantly      different from the young adult group (96\\\%, p = 0.330). The 2 groups had similar      INTERMACS profiles but differed in diagnosis, weight, and morbidities. Bleeding      complications requiring surgical intervention were more common in the pediatric      group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric outcomes with a HMII LVAD are comparable to that of      young adults. As we continue to monitor this growing group, more sophisticated      characterization and comparisons will be possible. Also, as technology progress      and second- and third-generation devices are introduced, the number of children      who will benefit from mechanical support will continue to grow.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The Synergy Pocket Micro-pump      (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, Mass), the smallest surgically implanted long-term      LVAD, provides partial flow up to 4.25 L/min and was primarily designed for \\\"less      sick\\\" patients with severe heart failure. This device is implanted minimally      invasively without sternotomy or cardiopulmonary bypass. Early implantation in      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support       class 4 and higher was shown to be feasible and associated with significantly      improved hemodynamics and quality of life. The aim of this study was to present      our experience with implementation of long-term partial circulatory support as a       bridge to transplantation in patients with more advanced heart failure who were      dependent preoperatively on inotropic support or intra-aortic balloon pump.      METHODS: In this observational study, only inotropic or intra-aortic balloon      pump-dependent patients with end-stage heart failure were included (n = 12).      These patients underwent Synergy device implantation between February 2012 and      August 2013. RESULTS: The mean preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support class was 2.17 +/- 0.84 (class 1, 25\\\%; class 2, 33\\\%;      class 3, 42\\\%). The mean age was 46 +/- 15 years, and 33\\\% were female.      Preoperatively, 4 patients (33\\\%) had at least 1 previous sternotomy, 3 patients      (25\\\%) were supported with a balloon pump, 1 patient (8\\\%) had a previous      full-support LVAD, and 4 patients (33\\\%) had cerebrovascular events in the past.      After device implantation, there were no right ventricular failures,      device-related infections, hemorrhagic strokes, arterial or venous      thromboembolisms, or worsenings of aortic and mitral regurgitation observed over       the follow-up. The mean follow up was 174 +/- 171 days (range, 5-764 days;      cumulative, 3199 days). One patient (8\\\%) died, 3 patients (25\\\%) successfully      underwent transplantation, 1 device (8\\\%) was explanted after myocardial recovery,      and 5 patients (42\\\%) are still on ongoing support. Two patients (17\\\%) were      upgraded to a full-support LVAD after 65 days of mean support. A total of 11 of      12 patients (92\\\%) were discharged from the hospital and are presently alive. Left      ventricular end-diastolic diameter was significantly reduced 3 months after      device implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Partial LVAD support may be clinically      efficacious in inotropic and intra-aortic balloon pump-dependent patients. On the      basis of our experience and evidence of previous research, such patients may      benefit from minimally invasive access, no need for sternotomy and      cardiopulmonary bypass, a short implantation time, an easy exchange if necessary,      and a lower risk of subsequent heart transplantation. Because the implantation is      performed without sternotomy, device upgrade is feasible with a comparatively low      operative risk and good clinical outcome. Our preliminary results show that      partial-support devices may have the potential to replace full-support LVADs in      the near future.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

However,      clinical presentation and outcome of CIED infection in the setting of LVAD has      not been previously described. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 247 patients       who underwent LVAD implantation at Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Arizona,      and Florida, from January 2005 to December 2011. Demographic and clinical data of      patients who met criteria for CIED infection were extracted. RESULTS: Of 247      patients with LVADs, 215 (87\\\%) had CIED at the time of LVAD implantation and six       (2.8\\\%) subsequently developed CIED infections. Three patients developed CIED      lead-related endocarditis and the other three had pocket infection. All three      instances of CIED pocket infection were preceded by device generator exchange,      whereas all three patients with CIED lead-related endocarditis had prior      LVAD-related infections. Causative pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginos (1),       coagulase-negative staphylococci (2), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus      (1), a gram-positive bacillus (1), and culture negative (2). All patients      underwent complete CIED removal along with antimicrobial therapy. The three      patients with CIED lead-related endocarditis and prior LVAD infections received      chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy, and one patient had LVAD exchange. All      but one remained alive at the last follow-up with a median duration of 15 months       (7-46 months) from the time of CIED infection. CONCLUSION: Patients who are      receiving LVAD therapy and develop CIED infection should be managed with complete      CIED removal.

However, VA      ECMO can be limited by insufficient ventricular unloading, resulting in thrombus       formation and pulmonary edema. Impella 2.5 has been used to unload the left      ventricle and provide hemodynamic support during acute heart failure. We present       our experience of the Impella 2.5 as an adjunct for left ventricular unloading      during peripheral VA ECMO support and as a bridge for the HeartMate II left      ventricular assist device (LVAD). An Impella 2.5 was placed in patients who were       on peripheral VA ECMO with evidence of left ventricular distension. Patients who       were candidates for heart transplant were transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD.       Five patients on VA ECMO with ventricular distension underwent Impella 2.5      implantation, resulting in a decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter as      measured by echocardiography (7.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.8 cm, p = 0.001). Four      patients were subsequently transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD after      restoration of end-organ function.

Because very few data exist examining the influence of significant      pre-operative MR on outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      implantation, we evaluate our experience. METHODS: Between October 1996 and      August 2013, 756 patients underwent primary LVAD implantation at our      institutions. Of these, 508 patients received a continuous-flow LVAD and      represent the contemporary cohort for this analysis. Devices implanted included      the HeartMate II in 410 patients (81\\\%) and HeartWare HVAD in 98 patients (19\\\%).      Based on availability of pre-operative echocardiography, 491 patients were      divided into 2 study groups according to degree of pre-operative MR; 189 patients      (39\\\%) had moderate to severe or greater MR (MR group), and 302 (61\\\%) had less      than moderate to severe MR (less MR group). Median age at operation (60 years in       MR group vs 58 years in less MR group, p = 0.19), male sex (78\\\% in MR group vs      81\\\% in less MR group, p = 0.42), and ischemic etiology (46\\\% in MR group vs 51\\\% in      less MR group, p = 0.35) were similar between groups. RESULTS: There were 40      early deaths (7.9\\\%), and follow-up was available in all 468 early survivors for      641 patient-years of support. Patients in the MR group had higher late survival      (2 years, 75\\\%; 4 years, 65\\\%) compared with patients in the less MR group (2      years, 66\\\%; 4 years, 48\\\%; p < 0.04). Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the      independent interaction between MR and late survival (hazard ratio 0.62, p =      0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was improved survival in patients with severe      pre-operative MR after continuous-flow LVAD implantation in our cohort. These      findings may lend insight into the possible lack of value of addressing      significant MR at the time of LVAD implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

However, the biologic      effects of continuous flow are not completely known. Therefore, we examined      aortic wall morphology in patients with heart failure before and after prolonged       circulatory support with a continuous-flow LVAD. METHODS: After applying a      partial aortic occlusion vascular clamp in the lower half of the ascending aorta,      we removed samples of aortic wall tissue and then attached the outflow graft of      the pump. Samples were obtained from 11 patients (9 men and 2 women, mean age 65       +/- 7 years) with severe heart failure at the time of LVAD implantation. We      obtained matched specimens at explantation after heart transplantation (n = 5) or      autopsy (n = 6). These specimens were removed from the distal ascending aorta,      remote from the aortic anastomotic site. Tissue sections were stained with      hematoxylin and eosin, Movat\\s pentachrome and Masson\\s trichrome. Smooth muscle       actin immunohistochemistry was performed on all sections. To evaluate the      morphology of the aortic wall media, we quantitatively graded tissue sections for      medial thickness, medial degenerative changes, smooth muscle cell (SMC)      disorientation and depletion, elastic fiber fragmentation and depletion, medial      fibrosis and atherosclerotic changes. RESULTS: The mean duration of support was      140 +/- 136 days (range 87 to 580 days). The histologic evaluation and comparison      of specimens obtained before and after LVAD support showed significantly      increased foci of medial degeneration, SMC depletion, elastic fiber      fragmentation, medial fibrosis and atherosclerotic changes after LVAD support.      Mean medial thickness was not significantly different after LVAD support. We      observed similar changes between samples obtained at transplantation and those      obtained at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: After continuous-flow LVAD support, the      morphology of the aortic wall media was altered in all of our patients.

This study evaluates the safety and      efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a means to transplant      candidacy in such patients. METHODS: Morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart      failure, who were ineligible for cardiac transplantation and underwent LSG      between 2008 and 2013, were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic      characteristics, perioperative details, percentage of excess weight loss (\\\%EWL),       and status of transplant candidacy were analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients (3 men)      with end-stage heart failure and morbid obesity underwent LSG. Three patients      (50\\\%) had a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in place at the time of      surgery. Median age was 34 (31-66) years and mean preoperative body mass index      (BMI) was 47.6+/-3.0 kg/m2. Median operative time was 90 (66-141) minutes, with a      median length of stay of 7 (4-16) days. There were no perioperative deaths. One      patient suffered a spontaneous flank hematoma. The same patient also had      thrombosis of the LVAD pump at 3 weeks postoperatively, requiring an uneventful      device exchange. At median follow-up of 22 (12-70) months, the mean \\\%EWL was      51.4+/-10.3\\\% with a decrease in BMI to 34.3+/-2.4 kg/m2 (P<.05). All patients had      lost sufficient weight to become transplant eligible within 12 months of surgery.      Two patients had undergone successful transplantation and another 2 were on the      transplant list. CONCLUSION: LSG appears to be a safe, technically feasible, and       effective method for obtaining adequate weight loss in morbidly obese patients      with end-stage heart failure and mechanical circulatory support, subsequently      improving their access to cardiac transplantation. This is the largest case      series to date of this high-risk group of patients undergoing LSG.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015.

Patients (pts) may need to be bridged with a continuous       flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) while on the transplant list as      logistic factors like organ availability are unknown. Cardiac transplantation      post-LVAD can be a surgically challenging procedure and outcome in these pts is      perceived to be poorer based on experience with earlier generation pulsatile flow      pumps. Data from a single institution comparing these pts with those undergoing      direct transplantation in the present era of continuous flow device therapy are      limited. AIM: Evaluate results of cardiac transplantation in pts bridged with a      CF-LVAD (BTx) and compare outcomes with pts undergoing direct transplantation      (Tx) in a single institution. RESULTS: From June 2007 till January 2012, 106 pts       underwent cardiac transplantation. Among these, 37 (35\\\%) pts (51+/-11 years; 85\\\%       male) were bridged with a CF-LVAD (BTx), while 70 (65\\\%) comprised the Tx group      (53+/-12 years; 72\\\% males). The median duration of LVAD support was 227 (153,327)      days. During the period of LVAD support, 10/37 (27\\\%) pts were upgraded to status       1A and all were successfully transplanted. Median hospital stay in the BTx (14      days) was slightly longer than the Tx group (12 days) but not statistically      significant (p=0.21). In-hospital mortality in the BTx (5\\\%) and Tx (1\\\%) were      comparable (p=0.25). Estimated late survival in the BTx cohort was 94+/-7,      90+/-10 and 83+/-16\\\% at the end of one, two and three years, respectively which      was comparable to 97+/-4\\\%, 93+/-6\\\% and 89+/-9\\\% for the Tx group (p=0.50).      CONCLUSION: Cardiac transplantation after LVAD implant can be performed with      excellent results. Patients can be supported on the left ventricular assist      device even for periods close to a year with good outcome after cardiac      transplantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic      Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ).

Although this is an important clinical entity, there are      only a handful of relevant studies on this topic in the literature. METHODS: From      2004 to 2012, 30 device exchanges (HeartMate II to HeartMate II) were performed.       Since June 2011, we have employed the subcostal approach for device exchange if      indicated. Sixteen patients underwent device exchange through a subcostal      approach (S group), whereas 14 patients had devices exchanged through a full      sternotomy (F group). Pre- and post-operative data were retrospectively reviewed.      RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline patient characteristics between the       two groups. Overall, mean duration between primary surgery and device exchange      was 425 +/- 407 days. Surgical indications included device thrombus/hemolysis (N       = 19), device malfunction (N = 9) and infection (N = 2). Cardiopulmonary bypass      time was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 40 +/- 23 minutes, F: 105 +/-      84 minutes; p < 0.05), and post-operative bleeding within 24 hours after surgery       was less in the S group (S: 362 +/- 367 ml, F: 1,286 +/- 971 ml; p < 0.05).      Length of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 4.6 +/- 1.8 days,      F: 8.2 +/- 4.9 days; p < 0.05). There was no difference in post-operative      complications, except for prolonged intubation (F: N = 6 [43\\\%], S: N = 1 [6.3\\\%];       p < 0.05). There were 3 deaths in the F group and 0 in the S group, with no      statistical difference (p = 0.09). Also, there was no significant difference in      other outcomes, including transplantation, device explantation and ongoing LVAD      support. CONCLUSIONS: A subcostal approach may be preferred for HeartMate II      device exchange if indicated.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Although temporary support could lead to successful RVAD      weaning in certain patients, the data remain scarce. METHODS: We retrospectively       reviewed 398 patients who underwent implantable LVAD insertion between January      2000 and December 2012. Of these patients, 44 (11\\\%) required unplanned RVAD      support due to severe RV failure after LVAD insertion. For comparison, 37      patients who underwent planned biventricular assist device (BiVAD) insertion were      identified during the same study period. We analyzed the early and late outcomes       in these patients. RESULTS: The mean duration of RVAD support was 21 +/- 23 days.      Of the 44 patients, 21 (49\\\%) were weaned from the RVAD (weaning group), whereas      23 (51\\\%) required continued biventricular support (failure group). The failure      group had ongoing end-organ dysfunction after RVAD insertion. Hospital mortality       was significantly lower in the weaning group (24\\\%) and in the planned BiVAD group      (30\\\%) as compared to the failure group (74\\\%, p = 0.0009). The 6-month actuarial      survival rate was 75\\\% in the weaning group, 62\\\% in the planned BiVAD group and      13\\\% in the failure group (p < 0.0001). Successful bridge to transplant was      achieved in 14 patients (67\\\%) in the weaning group as compared with 8 patients      (35\\\%) in the failure group (p = 0.03). On multivariate logistic regression      analyses, pre-operative white blood cell (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95\\\% confidence      interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.50, p = 0.016) and creatinine (OR 0.26, 95\\\% CI 0.079 to      0.88, p = 0.03) levels were significant predictors for RVAD removal. CONCLUSIONS:      Among patients who developed acute RV failure after LVAD insertion, only half      could be weaned from the temporary RVAD support.

This      may be a disadvantage to their priority for organ allocation. We sought to      determine the relationship between VAD implantation and successful      transplantation among patients listed for heart transplant. METHODS: Adults with       CHD patients (N = 1,250) were identified from the United Network for Organ      Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2010 and compared to patients without      congenital etiology for heart failure (N = 59,606). VAD use at listing, listing      status, status upgrades and reasons for upgrade prior to transplant were trended       at 5-year intervals and appropriate statistical comparisons were made between      groups. RESULTS: Since 1985, VAD use prior to transplant has increased      significantly in patients without CHD, but not in CHD patients (17\\\% vs 3\\\% in 2006      to 2010, p < 0.0001). CHD patients were more likely to be listed as Status 2,      compared to those without (66\\\% vs 40\\\%, p < 0.001 for 2006 to 2010), and less      likely to be upgraded to Status 1 after listing (43\\\% vs 55\\\%, p = 0.03). Among      those upgraded to Status 1, CHD patients were less likely to have a VAD at      transplant than those without (3\\\% vs 18\\\%, p = 0.005). VAD use was more likely to       result in death in CHD patients. CONCLUSIONS: VAD use is less common in CHD      patients than in patients without CHD, both at the time of listing and      transplantation. Reduced VAD use appears to contribute to lower listing status      and organ allocation. These differences have grown more disparate over time.

The outcomes       of these patients after LVAD implantation are unknown. METHODS: Baseline      predictors and outcomes were collected and analyzed from patients with active      substance abuse and a cohort of patients without active substance abuse matched      for age, INTERMACS profile and year of implantation. The primary outcome was      all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included rates of listing for cardiac      transplantation, transplantation and chronic drive-line infection. RESULTS: The      cohort consisted of 20 consecutive LVAD recipients with active substance abuse      and 40 recipients without active substance abuse. During a median follow-up      period of 2.3 years (IQR 1.4 to 3.6), the substance abuse group had 3.2 times the      rate (hazard) of death compared with a matched cohort (HR 3.2, 95\\\% CI 1.2 to 8.0,      p < 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of listing for transplant was 69\\\% lower (rate      ratio 0.31, p < 0.0005), rate of cardiac transplant was 89\\\% lower (rate ratio      0.11, p < 0.0005), and risk of chronic drive-line infection was 5.4 times higher       (rate ratio 5.4, p < 0.0005) in the substance abuse group. CONCLUSIONS: Active      substance abuse in patients who received an LVAD was associated with increased      mortality and overall poor outcomes. Larger scale data will be needed to confirm       these findings and to inform decision-making in this population.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The focus of this study was to analyze our institution\\s       entire experience with primary CF-VAD implants, evaluate the baseline variables,       determine which factors predict the need for exchange, and evaluate the impact of      exchange on survival and event-free survival. METHODS: We retrospectively      reviewed the data of all patients in a single center who received a primary      CF-VAD implant between December 1999 and December 2013. All CF-VAD exchanges were      reviewed; demographics, indications, preoperative and operative data, and      clinical outcomes were summarized. Univariate and multivariable regression      analyses were performed to ascertain predictors for exchange. Time-to-event and      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: We identified 469 patients who      underwent 546 CF-VAD implantations. Of these patients, 66 (14\\\%) underwent 77      exchanges from one CF-VAD to another. The primary indications included hemolysis       or thrombosis (n = 49; 63.6\\\%), infection (n = 9; 11.7\\\%), or other causes (n = 19;      24.7\\\%). Survival was not significantly different between the exchange and      nonexchange groups. Multivariable regression analysis identified a history of      cerebrovascular events as a significant predictor for exchange. Among exchange      patients, 11 underwent heart transplantation, 3 had their CF-VADs explanted, 26      had ongoing support, and 26 died during device support. CONCLUSIONS: In our      series of contemporary CF-VAD exchanges, a history of previous cerebrovascular      events was a significant predictor for exchange. Exchange did not affect early or      late survival. Our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment of      pump-related complications with exchange is safe and justified.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Consequently, more patients with advanced heart failure require a      ventricular assist device (VAD). We report U.K. activity, trends, and outcome for      long-term VAD support as a bridging therapy to HTx. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients      were grouped into three eras: E1, February 2004-March 2006; E2, April 2006-March       2009; and E3, April 2009-March 2011. Exclusions were patients who received      isolated short-term support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation without prior       or subsequent long-term VAD support. A total of 247 patients received VAD      support; 202 left ventricular (LVAD) support alone and 45 both left and right      ventricular support. Activity increased over time, from 36 patients implanted in       E1 to 123 in E3. Overall, 46 patients received a first-generation device, 80 a      second-generation device, and 121 a third-generation device. Use of      third-generation devices increased from <6\\\% in E1 to 78\\\% in E3. Median duration      of LVAD support increased from 141 days in E1 to 578 days in E3 (P < 0.001).      Overall survival to 1 year after LVAD implant rose from 58.3\\\% [95\\\% confidence      interval (CI) 40.7-72.4\\\%] in E1 to 72.5\\\% (95\\\% CI 63.3-79.8\\\%) in E3 (P = 0.21),      and improved significantly with device generation; at 1 year, 50\\\% of patients      with first-generation devices were alive compared with 68.1\\\% and 76.9\\\% of      patients with second- and third-generation devices, respectively (P = 0.002).      These differences remained after risk adjustment. HTx following LVAD implant      reduced over time (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: VAD activity and duration of support      have increased.

The Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t)       (SynCardia Systems Inc., Tuscon, AZ) has been approved for compassionate use by      the Food and Drug Administration for patients with end-stage biventricular heart       failure as a bridge to heart transplantation since 1985 and has had FDA approval       since 2004. However, of the 1,061 patients placed on the TAH-t, only 21 (2\\\%) were      under the age 18. SynCardia Systems, Inc. recommends a minimum patient body      surface area (BSA) of 1.7 m(2), thus, limiting pediatric application of this      device. This unique case report shares this pediatric institution\\s first      experience with the TAH-t. A 14-year-old male was admitted with dilated      cardiomyopathy and severe biventricular heart failure. The patient rapidly      decompensated, requiring extracorporeal life support. An echocardiogram revealed       severe biventricular dysfunction and diffuse clot formation in the left ventricle      and outflow tract. The decision was made to transition to biventricular assist      device. The biventricular failure and clot formation helped guide the team to the      TAH-t, in spite of a BSA (1.5 m(2)) below the recommendation of 1.7 m(2). A      computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, in conjunction with a novel      three-dimensional (3D) modeling system and team, assisted in determining      appropriate fit. Chest CT and 3D modeling following implantation were utilized to      determine all major vascular structures were unobstructed and the bronchi were      open.

In this study we       describe the partial unloading effects in ischemic CHF. METHODS: Six weeks after       myocardial infarction, sheep were randomized to partial support (\\\"pump,\\\" n = 5),       as provided by the CircuLite Synergy micro-pump, or to no therapy (\\\"sham,\\\" n = 6)      for an additional 6 weeks. At baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks after infarction,      pressure-volume (PV) recordings were made. Systolic and diastolic functions were       characterized by the end-systolic volume (ESV) where LV end-systolic pressure      reached 90 mm Hg (V90), and the end-diastolic volume (EDV) where LV end-diastolic      pressure reached 15 mm Hg (V15), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)      was performed 6 and 12 weeks after infarction. During autopsy at 12 weeks,      isolated LVs were weighed. Histologically, the degree of fibrosis in the      non-infarcted area was assessed using systematic randomized sampling, and myocyte      hypertrophy was measured by the mean linear intercept method. RESULTS: At 6      weeks, PV measurements showed a V90 and V15 increase (p = NS between groups). Six      weeks later, V90 and V15 increased in the sham group. In the pump group, V90      decreased but V15 did not change significantly. At 6 weeks, MRI indicated no      significant difference between groups. Six weeks later, in the sham group, EDV      and ESV increased significantly. In the pump group, EDV decreased significantly      and ESV trended to decrease. Sphericity index increased in the sham group and      decreased in the pump group, although not significantly. Explanted LV masses were      significantly higher in the sham group than in the pump group. The pump group had      a decrease in fibrosis and less myocyte hypertrophy.

We evaluated echocardiographic parameters      associated with adverse outcomes in this population. METHODS: Transthoracic      echocardiograms (TTEs) before continuous-flow LVAD implantation were analyzed in       109 patients. Twenty-six 2-dimensional and Doppler parameters were assessed for      their association with the primary outcome of 30-day RVF, defined as a      requirement of an RV assist device or >/= 14 consecutive days of inotropic      support, and the secondary composite outcome of 30-day death or RVF. Multivariate      analysis adjusted for known clinical risk prediction models was performed.      RESULTS: Overall, 25 (22.9\\\%) and 27 (24.8\\\%) patients reached the primary and      secondary end-points, respectively. An increased RV/LV diameter ratio was the      only TTE variable independently associated with both the primary (odds ratio [OR]      = 5.40; 95\\\% confidence interval [CI] 2.40 to 12.40; p = 0.012) and secondary (OR       = 2.70; 95\\\% CI 1.06 to 6.22; p = 0.03) outcomes after multivariate analysis.      Scatterplot analysis with regression determined the optimal cut-off value for      RV/LV diameter to be 0.75. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, an       increased RV/LV diameter ratio provided an additional predictive value to      clinical risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: A TTE-measured RV/LV diameter ratio of >/=0.75      is independently associated with a higher risk for RVF in patients with      continuous-flow LVAD. When used alone, this simple, easily derived, practical      echocardiographic measurement has a predictive value equivalent to known clinical      risk scores, whereas their combination provides stronger risk prediction for      adverse outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of      etiology on outcomes. METHODS: Between January 2009 and March 2013, we implanted       a total of 249 patients with ECLS; we focused on 64 patients for whom peripheral       ECLS was the treatment for PCS. Of these, 37 cases (58\\\%) were \\\"acute\\\" (mostly      acute myocardial infarction: 39\\\%); 27 (42\\\%) had an exacerbation of \\\"chronic\\\"      heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy: 30\\\%; post-ischemic cardiomyopathy: 9\\\%; and      congenital: 3\\\%). RESULTS: In the group with chronic etiology, 23 patients were      bridged to a left ventricular assist device (52\\\%) or heart transplantation (33\\\%).      In the group with acute etiology, ECLS was used as a bridge-to-transplantation in      3 patients (8\\\%), a bridge-to-bridge in 9 (24\\\%), and a bridge-to-recovery in 18      (49\\\%). One patient in each group was bridged to conventional surgery. Recovery of      cardiac function was achieved in only the group with acute primary cardiogenic      shock (18 vs 0 patients, P = .0001). A mean flow during support of </=60\\\% of the       theoretic flow (body surface area x 2.4) was a predictor of successful weaning (P      = .02). Median duration of ECLS support was 7 days (range: 2-11.5 days). Nine      patients (14\\\%) died during support; 30-day overall survival was 80\\\% (51 of 64      patients); and 59\\\% of patients were discharged, in whom survival at 48 months was      90\\\%. Thirty-day survival was correlated with duration of ECLS support.      CONCLUSIONS: In \\\"chronic\\\" heart failure, ECLS represents a bridge to a      ventricular assist device or heart transplantation, whereas in \\\"acute\\\" settings,       it offers a considerable chance of recovery, and is often the only required      therapy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

However, a certain number of patients continue to have      significant mitral regurgitation (MR) under LVAD support. We investigated      pre-operative echocardiographic features associated with persistent MR after LVAD      implantation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 82 consecutive patients      undergoing continuous-flow LVAD implantation between 2007 and 2010. We obtained      echocardiograms performed within 2 weeks before and 1 week after surgery. We      investigated the pre-operative echocardiographic findings associated with      significant MR post-LVAD and compared 1-year mortality after LVAD surgery between      patients with and without significant MR post-LVAD. RESULTS: MR was significant      in 43 patients (52.4\\\%) before LVAD surgery. Among those, 5 underwent concomitant       mitral valve repair (MVr) at the time of LVAD implantation. Of the remaining 38      patients, 25 (65.8\\\%) showed improvement of MR, whereas 13 patients (34.2\\\%)      continued to have significant MR post-LVAD. Multivariate analysis revealed that      posterior displacement of the coaptation point of mitral leaflets was      significantly associated with significant MR post-LVAD (hazard ratio, 1.335; 95\\\%       confidence interval, 1.035-1.721; p = 0.026) even after adjusting for the amount       of pre-operative MR flow. Post-LVAD 1-year survival of patients with and without       significant MR post-LVAD was not significantly different (92.3\\\% vs 89.1\\\%, p =      0.826). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-LVAD posterior displacement of mitral leaflets may be      indicative of post-operative significant MR, which would help identify      echocardiographic features of functional MR refractory to simple volume reduction      of the ventricle.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We aimed to identify      factors associated with HLA antibodies during continuous flow (CF)-VAD support      and assess the effect on transplant probability and outcomes. METHODS: We      included 143 consecutive heart failure patients who received a CF-VAD as a      bridge-to-transplant at 3 institutions. Factors associated with post-VAD peak      panel reactive antibodies (PRA) among several measurements were identified using       multivariable linear regression. A parametric survival model was used to assess      transplant waiting time and probability, risk of rejection, and a composite      outcome of rejection, graft failure, and death. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients      (25\\\%) were female; mean age was 47 +/- 13 years. Eighty-one patients (57\\\%) had a       pre-VAD PRA of 0\\\%, and 16 were highly sensitized (PRA > 80\\\%). Age, female sex,      and pre-VAD PRA were independently associated with post-VAD PRA. A 10-year      increase in age was associated with a 5\\\% decrease in post-VAD PRA (p = 0.03).      Post-VAD PRA was 19\\\% higher in women vs men (p < 0.01). A 10\\\%-increase in pre-VAD      PRA was associated with a 4.7\\\% higher post-VAD PRA (p < 0.01). During a mean      follow-up of 12 +/- 11 months, 90 patients underwent cardiac transplantation. A      20\\\% increase in post-VAD PRA was associated with 13\\\% lower probability of      transplant (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\\\% confidence interval, 0.76-0.99). A high PRA      was not associated with adverse post-transplant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Younger      age, female sex, and pre-VAD PRA were independent predictors of elevated PRA      post-VAD. Higher PRA was significantly associated with lower transplant      probability but not increased rejection, graft failure, or death after      transplant.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The HeartWare       HVAD system is unique compared with other VAD systems in that it has a thin,      flexible drive-line and is implanted directly into the pericardial space without       the need for a pump pocket. We reviewed 332 patients receiving the HVAD in the      pivotal ADVANCE Bridge to Transplant (BTT) trial and Continued Access Protocol      (CAP) to determine the incidence of drive-line infections and sepsis. METHODS:      Summary statistics of outcomes and Kaplan-Meier freedom-from-event analyses were       performed. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for homogeneity was used to determine      whether there was any site effect on rates of either drive-line exit-site or      sepsis infections. RESULTS: Drive-line exit-site infections occurred in 16.9\\\% (56      of 332) of patients (0.25 event per patient-year [EPPY]). These infections were      primarily treated with antibiotics and most occurred >30 days post-implant (88\\\%,       or 66 of 75 drive-line infections). Sepsis occurred in 17.2\\\% (57 of 332) of      patients (0.23 EPPY), and sepsis events occurred more frequently >30 days      post-implant (86\\\%, or 60 of 70 sepsis events). Of patients with sepsis, 17.5\\\% (10      of 57) died due to sepsis-related neurologic events (7 of 10) and multisystem      organ failure (2 of 10) and cardiopulmonary failure (1 of 10), whereas there were      no deaths related to drive-line infections. In addition, 17.5\\\% (10 of 57) of      patients had a stroke event while under treatment for sepsis (7 hemorrhagic and 3      ischemic strokes), and 3.5\\\% (2 of 57 patients with sepsis) had a device exchange       for VAD thrombus (4 days before and 1 day after sepsis diagnosis). Patients with       drive-line infections or sepsis had a larger body mass index compared to those      without infection (29.4 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), p = 0.015), and were more frequently      diabetic (43.7\\\% vs 31.2\\\%, p = 0.034). Although there was no negative impact on      survival in patients with drive-line exit-site infections, there was a trend for       reduced survival in patients with sepsis events when compared to those patients      without sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of drive-line infection and sepsis was      low in patients receiving the HVAD pump. Despite a trend toward reduced survival       in patients with sepsis events, the overall survival of patients with either      drive-line infections or sepsis was excellent.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocols trials have      enrolled patients with advanced heart failure in a bridge-to-transplant      indication. METHODS: The primary outcome, success, was defined as survival on the      originally implanted device, transplant, or explant for ventricular recovery at      180 days. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of survival, functional and      quality of life outcomes, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 332 patients in      the pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocols trial have      completed their 180-day primary end-point assessment. Survival in patients      receiving the HeartWare pump was 91\\\% at 180 days and 84\\\% at 360 days. Quality of       life scores improved significantly, and adverse event rates remain low.      CONCLUSIONS: The use of the HeartWare pump as a bridge to transplant continues to      demonstrate a high 180-day survival rate despite a low rate of transplant.      Adverse event rates are similar or better than those observed in historical      bridge-to-transplant trials, despite longer exposure times due to longer survival      and lower transplant rates.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

In Japan, CFVAD is limited for BTT use. The      waiting period for heart transplantation (HT) is long owing to donor shortage. We      examined the results of CFVAD for BTT indication. METHODS: Eighty-nine VAD      treatments were performed among subjects whose preimplantation condition was      profile 1 (n = 49) or profile 2 or 3 (n = 40). The device was the paracorporeal      pulsatile Nipro VAD (n = 67) or CFVAD (n = 22). All CFVAD patients were profile 2      or 3. RESULTS: The median assist period was 529 days (Nipro VAD, 530; CFVAD,      528). Twenty-six patients were on the device for >2 years. Actuarial survival was      81.6\\\%, 69.5\\\%, and 61.1\\\% at 1, 3, and 5 years. Survival in profile 1 was      significantly worse than in profile 2 or 3. Survival of CFVAD patients was      superior to that of paracorporeal VAD. Six-month mortality rate of 20\\\% in cases      before 2009 (n = 60) was dramatically improved to 3\\\% among those after 2010 (n =       29). All patients with CFVAD were alive and discharged home. 26 patients were      transplanted, 7 had been weaned from VAD and 27 were on a device. The rate of      events requiring hospital admission was 0.98 per patient-year in CFVAD patients.       CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary CFVADs have enabled advanced heart failure patients to       await HT safely with an improved quality of life.

We sought to characterize neurological events in children supported      with the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device. METHODS AND RESULTS: The multicenter      prospective cohort consisted of all 204 children implanted with the Berlin Heart       EXCOR((R)) device at 47 centers in North America between May 2007 and December      2010. There were 73 neurological events in 59 patients, with 29\\\% of the cohort      experiencing >/=1 neurological event. Events included 52 strokes in 43 patients      (21\\\% of the cohort). The neurological event rate was 0.51 events per 100      patient-days. Many of the neurological events occurred early in the course of      support, with 30 events recorded during the first 14 days of support. The      mortality rate in participants with at least 1 neurological event was 42\\\% (25 of       59), significantly higher than the 18\\\% mortality rate (26 of 145) for those who      did not have a neurological event (P=0.0006). Risk-factor analysis did not      identify significant preimplantation predictors of neurological injury.      CONCLUSIONS: Of children treated with the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device as a      bridge to transplant, 29\\\% experienced at least 1 neurological event. The majority      of neurological events were ischemic strokes, and many of those occurred early in      the course of support. Neurological injury was the leading cause of death after      implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) device. Risk stratification for      stroke or neurological injury is not possible based on baseline preimplantation      characteristics. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.

We evaluated the association of renal function and      inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on posttransplant graft survival in status 1B      patients. METHODS: The Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients database was      analyzed for posttransplant survival in status 1B patients bridged with inotropes      or CF-LVAD who underwent transplantation between 2003 and 2012. Pretransplant      renal function was measured by estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and      was stratified as less than 45 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2), 45 to 59, and 60 or      greater. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used      to evaluate the main effects of GFR strata and inotropes versus CF-LVAD, and the       interaction effect of GFR strata by CF-LVAD, on graft survival. RESULTS: This      study included 4,158 status 1B patients (74\\\% male, aged 53 +/- 12 years). Of      those, 659 patients had a CF-LVAD (HeartMate-II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], n =      638; HVAD [HeartWare, Framingham, MA], n = 21), and 3,530 were receiving      inotropes (31 CF-LVAD patients were also receiving inotropes). Kaplan-Meier      analyses demonstrated reduced graft survival (p = 0.022) in patients with      pretransplant GFR less than 45 versus GFR 45 to 59 (p = 0.062) and versus GFR 60       or greater (p = 0.007), and no effect of inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on graft      survival (p = 0.402). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, after adjusting      for the main effects of GFR stratum, CF-LVAD, and inotropes, status 1B patients      bridged with a CF-LVAD and GFR in the lowest stratum had reduced graft survival      (interaction effect p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant renal insufficiency      was associated with reduced posttransplant graft survival in status 1B patients.       This risk is increased for patients bridged with a CF-LVAD (versus inotropes) who      have GFR in the lowest stratum.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

The first patient had a patch closure      of the aortic valve. In four patients, the prosthesis was left in place.      Anticoagulants included aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel. RESULTS: The average       and accumulated treatment times were 150 and 752 days, respectively. Three of the      five patients showed early signs of valve thrombosis on echo with concomitant      valve dysfunction. Four patients were transplanted without thromboembolic events       during pump treatment. One patient died from a hemorrhagic stroke after 90 days      on the LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of leaving a mechanical heart valve in      place at the time of LVAD implantation in five patients led to valvular      thrombosis in three but did not provoke embolic events. It increased the      complexity of postoperative anticoagulation.FAU - Ahn, HenrikAU  - Ahn HAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine and Health Sciences,       Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Department of Cardiovascular      Surgery, County Council of Ostergotland, Linkoping, Sweden.

Framingham, MA)      ventricular assist device (HVAD) is approved for implantation through a      sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. We report on our initial experience with       this device implanted off-pump via thoracotomy. METHODS: A total of 26 patients      were included in this review. All patients were Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support categories 2 or 3 and underwent      implantation of an HVAD as an elective procedure via thoracotomy and mini      sternotomy approach. Three-dimensional echocardiography was used to assess the      ventricle and was also used to facilitate proper pump positioning. Patients were       managed during follow-up using anti-coagulants at a target international      normalized ratio 2.0 to 2.5 as well as anti-platelet agents. RESULTS:      Implantation was performed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, but 1      patient did require conversion to on-pump surgery. There were no perioperative      deaths or right heart failure events. The mean intensive care unit stay was 1.5      days. Transfusions of 1 to 3 units of packed red blood cells were required in 16       patients, whereas 10 patients maintained a stable perioperative hematocrit of at       least 30\\\% and did not require transfusion. Survival through 90 days was 100\\\%, and      survival through 180 days was 87\\\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience was favorable in      respect to outcome, safety, and use of blood products.

To reduce mortality, the      introduction of post-transplant survival in an allocation model based on the      concept of survival benefit might be more appropriate. The aim of this study was       to assess the prognostic accuracy of the heart failure survival score (HFSS), the      Seattle heart failure model (SHFM), the Interagency Registry for Mechanically      Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) model, and the index for mortality      prediction after cardiac transplantation (IMPACT) score for predicting mortality.      METHODS: The HFSS, SHFM, the adapted SHFM, and the INTERMACS model were evaluated      for predicting waiting list mortality among heart transplant candidates, and the       IMPACT score was tested for predicting post-transplant mortality in separate Cox       regression models. Included were the 448 adult heart transplant candidates listed      for an urgent status between October 2010 and June 2011 in Eurotransplant. A      cardiac allocation score (CAS) was calculated based on the estimated survival      times as predicted by the scores. All analyses were performed for the total      cohort and separately for ventricular assist device (VAD) and non-VAD patients.      RESULTS: Mortality on the waiting list could significantly be predicted in the      non-VAD cohort by HFSS (p = 0.005) and SHFM (p < 0.0001) and after transplant by       IMPACT (p < 0.0001). None of the tested scores could predict mortality among      VAD-supported patients. CONCLUSIONS: In non-VAD patients, the HFSS, SHFM, and      IMPACT provide accurate risk stratification.

METHODS: Between      February 2011 and August 2012, implantation of a VAD was performed in 10 children      of mean age 8.6 years. This retrospective review analyzed their perioperative      anesthetic care. RESULTS: All patients had end-stage heart failure due to dilated      cardiomyopathy. We used invasive arterial and central venous pressure monitoring       and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in conjunction with      intravenous administration of either ketamine (1 mg/kg) and midazolam (n = 3) or       thiopental (3-5 mg/kg; n = 7). The mean intraoperative fentanyl dose was 434 +/-       264.27 mug. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. Dopamine, dobutamine, and      epinephrine were infused in 8, 10, and 5 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric      oxide was administered to all patients. The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh      frozen plasma, and thrombocyte suspension transfusions were be 2.3 +/- 0.82      (range, 1-4), 1.6 +/- 0.69 (range, 1-3), and 2.4 +/- 1.42 (range, 0-4) units,      respectively. On average, patients were extubated 23 hours after arrival in the      intensive care unit and exited there on day 6. Six patients were successfully      bridged to heart transplantation, 2 died during the follow-up, and 2 patients      remain on VAD support.

In this report, we have presented our institution\\s clinical      experience in the anesthetic management of ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation. METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, VAD implantation was      performed in 84 adult patients with end-stage heart failure. The group included      75 male and 9 female patients of overall mean age, 47.6 +/- 13.4 years. Our      retrospective review analyzed elements of perioperative anesthetic care,      including preoperative characteristics, general anesthetic care, and blood      product usage. RESULTS: The indications for VAD implantation were dilated (n =      59; 70\\\%) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 25; 30\\\%). An intra-aortic balloon pump      had been placed in 16 patients. We monitored invasive arterial and central venous      pressures as well as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Etomidate      was used as the induction agent in 79 of 84 patients (average dose, 18.75 +/-      1.40 mg). Intraoperative fentanyl dose was 939.69 +/- 212.44 mug. Anesthesia was       maintained with sevoflurane (n = 55) or desflurane (n = 29). Dopamine,      dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and levosimendan were used in 74, 79,      60, 14, and 32 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered to      38 subjects (45\\\%). The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh frozen plasma, and      thrombocyte suspension transfusions were 3.96 +/- 2.78, 1.91 +/- 1.21, 1.80 +/-      2.48 u, respectively. On average, patients were extubated 13 hours after arrival       in the intensive care unit and discharged therefrom on day 8. Thirty-one patients      were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. While 27 patients (32\\\%) died       during the follow-up period, 26 are still living on VAD support. CONCLUSION:      Among patients undergoing VAD implantation, the anesthesiologist should become      familiar with the device and consider the severity of cardiac and other end-organ      dysfunction.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) modulates ECM production during      inflammatory tissue injury, but available data on CTGF gene expression in failing      human heart and its response to mechanical unloading are limited. METHODS AND      RESULTS: Left ventricle (LV) tissue from patients undergoing cardiac      transplantation for ischemic (ICM; n = 20) and dilated (DCM; n = 20)      cardiomyopathies and from nonfailing (NF; n = 20) donor hearts were examined.      Paired samples (n = 15) from patients undergoing LV assist device (LVAD)      implantation as \\\"bridge to transplant\\\" (34-1,145 days) also were analyzed. There       was more interstitial fibrosis in both ICM and DCM compared with NF hearts.      Hydroxyproline concentration was also significantly increased in DCM compared      with NF samples. The expression of CTGF, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1,       collagen (COL) 1-alpha1, COL3-alpha1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, and MMP9       mRNA in ICM and DCM were also significantly elevated compared with NF samples.      Although TGF-beta1, CTGF, COL1-alpha1, and COL3-alpha1 mRNA levels were reduced      by unloading, there was only a modest reduction in tissue fibrosis and no      difference in protein-bound hydroxyproline concentration between pre- and      post-LVAD tissue samples. The persistent fibrosis may be related to a concomitant      reduction in MMP9 mRNA and protein levels following unloading. CONCLUSIONS: CTGF       may be a key regulator of fibrosis during maladaptive remodeling and progression       to HF.

Little is known      about post-transplant outcomes in patients complicated by late RHF during LVAD      support. METHODS: Between May 2004 and December 2013, 141 patients underwent      cardiac transplantation after isolated LVAD bridging at our center. Late RHF was       defined as heart failure requiring medical intervention >4 weeks after LVAD      implantation. RESULTS: The patients\\ mean age was 53 +/- 13 years, 82\\\% were men,       and 36\\\% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of LVAD support before      transplantation was 0.75 years. Late RHF developed in 21 patients (15\\\%) during      LVAD support. Of these patients, 11 were supported with inotropic agents at the      time of transplantation. Patients with RHF had higher creatinine (1.6 +/- 0.88      mg/dL vs 1.3 +/- 0.67 mg/dL, p = 0.07), higher blood urea nitrogen (32 +/- 17      mg/dL vs 24 +/- 10 mg/dL, p = 0.0013), higher total bilirubin (0.96 +/- 0.46      mg/dL vs 0.78 +/- 0.42 mg/dL, p = 0.07), and lower albumin (3.8 +/- 0.60 g/dL vs       4.1 +/- 0.46 g/dL, p = 0.0019) at the time of transplantation compared with      patients who did not develop RHF. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher       in patients with late RHF during LVAD support (29\\\% vs 6.7\\\%, p = 0.002). Overall      post-transplant survival rates were 87\\\% at 1 year, 83\\\% at 3 years, and 77\\\% at 5      years. The 5-year post-transplant survival was significantly worse in patients      who developed late RHF during LVAD support compared with survival in patients who      did not develop RHF (26\\\% vs 87\\\%, p < 0.0001).

Previous retrospective studies      demonstrated that bleeding events in patients with the HeartMate II (Thoratec      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) were attributed to acquired von Willebrand syndrome. We      sought to analyze the von Willebrand factor (VWF) profile in patients receiving a      HeartMate II or a CircuLite (Saddle Brook, NJ,) device (Synergy Pocket      Micro-pump) prospectively. METHODS: Prospectively analyzed were 34 patients      supported with left ventricular assist device (LVAD; 26 with HeartMate II and 8      with CircuLite). The control group comprised 20 patients who underwent heart      transplantation (HTx). Blood samples were taken pre-operatively and at 14 days      and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-operatively. RESULTS: Patients with LVADs had a      high incidence of bleeding complications. From the immediate post-operative phase      throughout the entire observation, the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity      (Rco)/antigen (Ag) ratio of patients with HeartMate II and CircuLite devices was       consistently lower compared with HTx patients. No correlation was found between      the individual VWF:Rco/Ag ratio and bleeding events or transfusion requirements.       The VWF:Rco/Ag ratio normalized immediately in patients who received HTx.      CONCLUSIONS: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome was confirmed to occur immediately       after the implantation of both types of LVAD and persisted up to 12 months. A      lower VWF:Rco/Ag ratio was associated with larger transfusion requirements.

Forty-six patients (38 men; median age 54.5 years, range:      25-70 years) underwent LVAD placement combined with temporary RVAD support (group      A); in 31 patients (25 men; median age 56.7 years, range: 28-68 years), a      permanent BVAD or TAH implantation (group B) was performed. Within 30 days, 12      patients from group A (26.08\\\%) and 14 patients from group B (45.1\\\%) died on      mechanical support (P = 0.02). Thirty patients (65.2\\\%) in group A were weaned      from temporary RVAD support and three (6.5\\\%) underwent permanent RVAD (HeartWare,      Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) placement.

Axial and centrifugal CVADs have been successfully used as bridge-to-transplant      and destination therapy. CVADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than       the first-generation pulsatile-flow ventricular assist devices.

Total cardiac output       in CF-LVAD patients during exercise is predominantly determined by pump speed,      the pressure difference across the pump, and in some cases ejection through the      aortic valve. Fixed pump speed utilized in CF-LVADs may provide insufficient      support, resulting in a moderate cardiac output increase during increased      physical strain. Ongoing studies are evaluating whether pump speed changes in      response to varied loading conditions may enable LVADs to provide sufficient      support even during strenuous exercise. In the currently used devices, evidence      suggests that focus on optimizing non-cardiac peripheral parameters is vital.      Extra-cardiac potentially reversible factors are anemia with low oxygen-carrying       capacity, obesity and general deconditioning with low muscle mass. In addition,      exercise training in CF-LVAD patients can improve peak VO2. To design      interventions to improve functional capacity in patients treated with modern      durable LVADs, a detailed understanding of exercise physiology in a      continuous-flow circulatory system is necessary. In this review we address the      different components of exercise physiology in LVAD patients and point out      potential solutions or areas of future research.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We evaluated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C      compared with established markers of renal function in patients with heart      failure (HF) because they might improve prognostic assessment of patients with      HF. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 40 patients with stable HF (age:      58 +/- 8 years, body mass index [BMI]: 28.4 +/- 6.4 kg/m(2)), 40 HF patients      undergoing ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation (age: 53 +/- 11 years,      BMI: 26.8 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2)), 40 patients undergoing VAD removal at cardiac      transplantation, and 24 controls (age: 48 +/- 7 years, BMI: 29.4 +/- 4.2      kg/m(2)). Clinical data were collected from institutional medical records. NGAL      and cystatin C levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the Modification of       Diet in Renal Disease formula. RESULTS: Patients with stable HF showed elevated      NGAL and cystatin C levels compared with controls (NGAL: 114.9 +/- 48.3 ng/mL vs       72.0 +/- 36.6 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; cystatin C: 1490.4 +/- 576.1 ng/mL vs 954.7 +/-       414.2 ng/mL, p = 0.0026). Unlike cystatin C, NGAL increased in advanced HF      patients requiring VAD implantation (158.7 +/- 74.8 ng/mL, p < 0.001). On VAD      support, NGAL levels decreased (127.1 +/- 80.4 ng/mL, p = 0.034). NGAL was higher      in patients who developed right ventricular failure (187.8 +/- 66.0 vs 130.9 +/-       67.0 ng/mL, p = 0.03) and irreversible renal dysfunction (190.0 +/- 73.8 ng/mL vs      133.8 +/- 54.2 ng/mL, p < 0.05), whereas cystatin C, creatinine, and eGFR were      not different. NGAL correlated with eGFR (r = -0.2188, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:      NGAL levels correlate with HF severity and hemodynamic improvement after VAD      placement. Our findings suggest a role of this novel biomarker as a marker of      severity and prognosis in patients with HF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

cystatin c: 1490.4 +/- 576.1 ng/ml vs 954.7 +/-       414.2 ng/ml, p = 0.0026). unlike cystatin c, ngal increased in advanced hf      patients requiring vad implantation (158.7 +/- 74.8 ng/ml, p < 0.001). on vad      support, ngal levels decreased (127.1 +/- 80.4 ng/ml, p = 0.034). ngal was higher      in patients who developed right ventricular failure (187.8 +/- 66.0 vs 130.9 +/-       67.0 ng/ml, p = 0.03) and irreversible renal dysfunction (190.0 +/- 73.8 ng/ml vs      133.8 +/- 54.2 ng/ml, p < 0.05), whereas cystatin c, creatinine, and egfr were      not different. ngal correlated with egfr (r = -0.2188, p = 0.01). conclusions:      ngal levels correlate with hf severity and hemodynamic improvement after vad      placement. our findings suggest a role of this novel biomarker as a marker of      severity and prognosis in patients with hf.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 international society for heart and lung transplantation.      published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.fau - pronschinske, katherine bau  - pronschinske kbad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - qiu, sylviaau  - qiu sad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - wu, christinaau  - wu cad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - kato, tomoko sau  - kato tsad  - department of cardiovascular medicine and organ transplantation, national      cerebral and cardiovascular center, osaka, japan.fau - khawaja, tubaau  - khawaja tad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - takayama, hirooau  - takayama had  - department of surgery, division of cardiothoracic surgery, columbia university      medical center, new york, new york.fau - naka, yoshifumiau  - naka yad  - department of surgery, division of cardiothoracic surgery, columbia university      medical center, new york, new york.fau - templeton, danielle lau  - templeton dlad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - george, isaacau  - george iad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - farr, maryjane aau  - farr maad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - mancini, donna mau  - mancini dmad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york.fau - schulze, p christianau  - schulze pcad  - department of medicine, division of cardiology, columbia university medical      center, new york, new york. electronic address: pcs2121@cumc.columbia.edu.la  - enggr  - hl-073029/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - k23 hl095742/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - k23-hl-095742-01/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - p30-hl-101272-01/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - r01 hl114813/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - t32 hl007343/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - ul1-rr-024156/rr/ncrr nih hhs/united statespt  - journal articlept  - research support, n.i.h., extramuralpt  - research support, non-u.s. gov\\tdep - 20140623pl  - united statesta  - j heart lung transplantjt  - the journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the      international society for heart transplantationjid - 9102703sb  - imcin - j heart lung transplant. 2014 dec;33(12):1213-4.

RV deformation      analysis by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) has recently allowed a deeper      analysis of RV longitudinal function. The aim of the study was to observe RV      function by STE in patients with advanced heart failure before and after LVAD      implantation. METHODS: Transthoracic echo Doppler was performed in 10 patients      referred for LVAD therapy at baseline and with serial echocardiograms after LVAD       implantation. In a sub-group of 4 patients, an echocardiographic evaluation was      also made after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support was initiated and before      LVAD implantation. All echocardiographic images were analyzed off-line to      calculate the free wall RV longitudinal strain (RVLS). RESULTS: Three patients      who presented the lowest free wall RVLS values at baseline, showed a progressive       decline of RVLS after LVAD implant, presenting finally RV failure; however,      patients with higher values of RVLS at baseline presented a further and overt      increase of strain values in the course of follow-up. The overall performance for      the prediction of RV failure after LVAD implant was greatest for free wall RVLS      (area under the curve, 0.93). For the sub-group receiving the IABP as an      intermediate step, only 2 patients with an increase of RVLS after IABP      implantation also showed an increase of RVLS levels, after subsequent LVAD      implantation. The 2 patients without an increase of RVLS after IABP implantation       also presented with RV failure after LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study of 10       patients indicates that the new parameter of RVLS, representing RV myocardial      deformation, may have important clinical implications for the selection and      management of LVAD patients. A large multicenter study is required to confirm      these observations and to quantify the clinical significance of changes in RVLS      value.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

This study investigates whether these therapeutic advances      have translated into improvement in outcomes for patients with advanced HF      referred to a heart transplant center. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HF      (n=2507) referred to a single university center were analyzed in three 6-year      eras during which medical and device therapies were evolving: 1993 to 1998 (era      1), 1999 to 2004 (era 2), and 2005 to 2010 (era 3). Impaired hemodynamics and      comorbidities were more frequent at time of referral in later eras, whereas other      HF severity parameters where similar or improved. Successive eras had greater      usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers,       beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, implantable cardioverter defibrillators,       and cardiac resynchronization therapy, consistent with evolving evidence and      guideline recommendations over the study period. All-cause mortality and sudden      death were significantly lower in era 2 and 3 compared with era 1. After      multivariable risk adjustment, era 3 had significantly decreased 2- and 3-year      all-cause mortality risk and significantly decreased 1- and 3-year sudden death      risk compared with era 1.

We undertook this study to characterize the outcomes of      septuagenarians bridged to transplantation (BTT) in the modern era. METHODS: We      conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult OHT in the United Network for      Organ Sharing database from 2005 to 2011. Primary stratification was by age 70      years or older. Subgroup analysis evaluated patients who received BTT. The      primary outcome was survival as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS:      From January 2005 to December 2011, 12,274 adults underwent OHT, including 3,243       (26.4\\\%) who received BTT. In the entire cohort, 11,996 (97.7\\\%) recipients were      aged 18 to 70 years, and 277 (2.3\\\%) were 70 years of age or older. Overall,      patients 70 years or older who underwent OHT had decreased 90-day survival (93.6\\\%      versus 88.8\\\%; p<0.01), 1-year survival (89.0\\\% versus 81.6\\\%; p<0.01), and 2-year      survival (85.4\\\% versus 79.9\\\%; p<0.01) compared with recipients of other ages.      However in the BTT subgroup, recipients 70 years and older (n=43) had similar      90-day (91.2\\\% versus 84.7\\\%; p=0.2), 1-year (86.1\\\% versus 81.7\\\%; p=0.4), and      2-year (82.8\\\% versus 81.7\\\%; p=0.6) survival compared with recipients of other      ages (n=3,200). After adjusting for multiple recipient and donor factors, age      greater than or equal to 70 years was still not associated with an increased      hazard of mortality at 90 days, 1 year, or 2 years. These results were verified      by analysis of a propensity-matched cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients older       than the age of 70 years undergoing OHT have decreased survival, among patients      who received BTT, septuagenarians have outcomes similar to those of younger      recipients. In carefully selected patients dependent on left ventricular assist      devices (LVADs), recipient age greater than or equal to 70 years should not be      viewed as a contraindication to OHT.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

We report our experience with the       paracorporal Berlin Heart EXCOR System (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) used as      a biventricuclar assist device (BVAD). Nine patients with a BVAD EXCOR system      were treated between 2006 and 2012; out of these patients, four were less than 18      years old (6, 14, 14, and 17 years old). Their diagnoses were postcardotomy      failure (n = 1), dilatative cardiomyopathy (n = 2), and terminal heart failure (n      = 1). Overall survival, waiting time for heart transplantation (HTx) and      complication profile for the BVAD were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty days\\      mortality was 25\\\% (n = 1). One child died after 84 days on support due to      cerebral bleeding. Mean support time was 218.75 days (4, 84, 262, and 525 days).       Pump chamber exchange was necessary three times due to pump chamber thrombosis (n      = 2) and partial pump chamber membrane rupture (n = 1). Complications included:      sepsis (n = 1), drive line infection requiring intravenous antibiotics (n = 2),      and recurrent epistaxis (n = 3). Two children were successfully transplanted      after 262/525 days on BVAD; they are currently at home (follow-up: 1.9 and 2.3      years).

We investigated whether additional clinical      variables might further specify risk of death, ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation (INTERMACS <4) or heart transplantation (HTx, Status 1A or 1B)      within 1 year after HTx evaluation. We hypothesized that right ventricular stroke      work index (RVSWI), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and the model for      end-stage liver disease-albumin score (MELD-A) would be additive prognostic      predictors. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on 151 ambulatory patients      undergoing HTx evaluation. Primary outcomes were defined as HTx, LVAD or death      within 1 year after evaluation. RESULTS: Average age in our cohort was 55 +/-      11.1 years, 79.1\\\% were male and 39\\\% had an ischemic etiology (LVEF 21 +/- 10.5\\\%      and peak VO(2) 12.6 +/- 3.5 ml/kg/min). Fifty outcomes (33.1\\\%) were observed (27       HTxs, 15 VADs and 8 deaths). Univariate logistic regression showed a significant       association of RVSWI (OR 0.47, p = 0.036), PCWP (OR 2.65, p = 0.007) and MELD-A      (OR 2.73, p = 0.006) with 1-year events. Stepwise regression showed an      independent correlation of RVSWI<5gm-m(2)/beat (OR 6.70, p < 0.01), PCWP>20 mm Hg      (OR 5.48, p < 0.01), MELD-A>14 (OR 3.72, p< 0.01) and peak VO(2)<14 ml/kg/min (OR      3.36, p = 0.024) with 1-year events. A scoring system was developed: MELD-A>14      and peak VO(2)<14-1 point each; and PCWP>20 and RVSWI<5-2 points each. A cut-off       at>/=4 demonstrated a 54\\\% sensitivity and 88\\\% specificity for 1-year events.      CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory HF patients have significant 1-year event rates.

METHODS: We implemented a       clinical protocol to achieve maximal neurohormonal blockade after placement of a       CF-LVAD and assessed its utility in an LVAD weaning (6,200 rpm) study.      Thirty-four subjects were enrolled after CF-LVAD and were managed with      aggressive, bi-weekly up-titration of HFMED. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (8 with      coronary artery disease, 13 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) were included      in this LVAD weaning investigation. Overall, combined CF-LVAD and HFMED resulted       in significant reverse remodeling with a decrease in left atrial volume index      (44.7+/-16.0 to 31.6+/-12.1 ml/m(2), p < 0.001) and LV internal diastolic      diameter (6.7+/-1.5 to 6.0+/-1.6 cm, p = 0.003) and an increase in LV ejection      fraction (17.4+/-6.5 to 33.1+/-16.2\\\%, p < 0.001) during LVAD weaning (6,200 rpm).      Five of 21 (24\\\%) subjects demonstrated recovery of biventricular function.      Exploratory analysis showed that recovered subjects had shorter duration HF, less      myocardial fibrosis and less myocyte hypertrophy, and were supported at higher      LVAD speeds. CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support in combination with HFMED leads to      significant reverse remodeling in patients with advanced HF. Using this approach,      one quarter of patients demonstrated complete recovery of cardiac function. Our      results suggest that bridge to recovery in the current device era is a clinically      meaningful phenomenon and merits further investigation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

However, their ability to      unload the right ventricle (RV) and improve RV function has not been as clearly      defined. We evaluated the short- and mid-term effects of CF-LVADs on central      venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), pulmonary capillary      wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac index (CI), RV ejection fraction (RVEF), RV      end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD), RV stroke work index (RVSWI), tricuspid annular       plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR).      METHODS: From March 2006 through June 2012, 130 patients with chronic heart      failure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD (122 HeartMate II and 8 HeartWare      devices) as a bridge to transplant (n = 76) or as destination therapy (n = 54).      Patients with pre-operative long-term LVADs (n = 4) and patients who underwent      concomitant tricuspid valve repairs during their LVAD implant (n = 21) were      excluded from the analysis. Echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations of      the remaining 105 patients were reviewed pre-operatively and at 1 and 6 months      post-LVAD implantation. RESULTS: At 1 month post-LVAD implantation, CVP decreased      from 12.4 +/- 5.9 mm Hg to 8.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001), systolic PAP decreased       from 52.3 +/- 14.1 mm Hg to 36.8 +/- 11.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001), PCWP decreased from       23.0 +/- 9.4 mm Hg to 12.9 +/- 8.0 mm Hg (p < 0.001), CI index increased from 1.8      +/- 0.5 liters/min m2 to 2.4 +/- 0.5 liters/min m2 (p < 0.001), RVEF increased      from 33.1 +/- 4.9\\\% to 40.4 +/- 6.2\\\% (p < 0.001), RVEDD decreased from 36 mm to 31      mm (p = 0.020), RVSWI improved from 408.6 +/- 144.6 mm Hg ml m2 to 614.4 +/-      196.2 mm Hg ml m2 (p < 0.001), and mean TAPSE increased from 1.1 +/- 0.4 cm to      1.9 +/- 0.4 cm (p = 0.004). Similarly, qualitative RV function on      echocardiography improved from 57.1\\\% moderately or severely reduced      pre-operatively to 38.1\\\% at 1 month (p = 0.008). Severity of TR decreased from      11.4\\\% moderate or severe pre-operatively to 4.8\\\% at 1 month (p < 0.001). These      improvements were maintained at 6 months post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support       significantly decreased CVP and RVEDD, with concomitant improvement in RV      function, as measured by increases in RVEF, RVSWI and TAPSE, as well as      improvements in the qualitative echocardiographic appearance of RV contractility       and a reduction in TR.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Therefore, we analyzed the predictive value of plasma Gal-3      in the context of other potential clinical risk factors for death on device (DOD)      in a cohort of 175 VAD patients. METHODS: We analyzed numerous clinical factors      and plasma Gal-3 levels of 175 VAD patients before device implantation. Eighty      VAD patients were successfully bridged to HTx (BTT, 45.7\\\%), 80 (45.7\\\%) died on      VAD, 2 recovered on device (BTR, 1.1\\\%) and 13 (7.4\\\%) were still on device. Uni-      and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the importance of Gal-3 with      respect to other clinical factors. Myocardial gene expression of Gal-3 was      investigated in apex samples by RT-PCR (n = 30) and Western blotting (n = 45).      RESULTS: Plasma Gal-3 levels were higher in VAD patients than in controls (16.6      +/- 9.3 vs 9.5 +/- 3.9 ng/ml, p < 0.0001). Cox regression showed several clinical      factors and type of VAD as independent outcome predictors, but Gal-3 was not      among them. Using the regression equation we grouped patients according to their       factor constellation for prediction of survival on VAD. We propose a calculation       method for VAD survival prediction. Gal-3 mRNA and protein were detectable in      failing myocardium, but did not correlate with its plasma concentration.      CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 levels are associated with severe heart failure but do      not provide sufficient discrimination for prediction of outcomes after VAD      implantation. Importantly, we were unable to confirm myocardial tissue as a      primary source for the observed plasma elevations of Gal-3.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Unloading of the left ventricle with an      implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonary      vascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in a      cohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy. METHODS: Pulmonary      haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit      between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:      Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eight HeartWare      ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21      VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplant      by virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon       pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.      Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4\\\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\\\%      (24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortality      was 7.7\\\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\\\% (10 of 11). Baseline and post-VAD       pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic PAP (mmHg), mean      PAP, TPG (mmHg) of 57 +/- 9.5, 42 +/- 4.4 and 14 +/- 3.9 reduced to 32 +/- 7.5,      18 +/- 5.5 and 9 +/- 3.3, respectively.

This protocol permitted the rendering of safe and effective dental      care in this setting and did not result in near-term (1-30 days) excessive      hemorrhage, local and systemic infection, or contamination of the VAD. STUDY      DESIGN: This descriptive cross-sectional study by the University of California,      Los Angeles, Hospital Dental Service examined the dental care of 9 patients (mean      age, 50 +/- 12.9 years) with class IV stage D heart failure. RESULTS: Nine      patients, 22 days (mean) after VAD placement, received dental treatment after      intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and maintenance of prior anticoagulation,      antiplatelet, or antithrombin regimen. Eight patients had extractions (mean, 4;      range, 1-12), and one of them also required scaling and root planing (SRP) of the      remaining teeth. A ninth individual only required SRP of 4 quadrants. No adverse       outcomes developed.

However, data on long-term post-transplant      survival for these patients are limited. We evaluated the effect of      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices on postcardiac transplant      survival in the current era. METHODS: All patients who received a continuous-flow      left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant at a single center from       June 2005 to September 2011 were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 167 patients who      received a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device as a bridge to      transplant, 77 (46\\\%) underwent cardiac transplantation, 27 died before      transplantation (16\\\%), and 63 (38\\\%) remain listed for transplantation and      continued with left ventricular assist device support. The mean age of the      transplanted patients was 54.5 +/- 11.9 years, 57\\\% had an ischemic etiology, and       20\\\% were women. The overall mean duration of left ventricular assist device      support before transplantation was 310 +/- 227 days (range, 67-1230 days). The      mean duration of left ventricular assist device support did not change in      patients who had received a left ventricular assist device in the early period of      the study (2005-2008, n = 62) compared with those who had received a left      ventricular assist device later (2009-2011, n = 78, 373 vs 392 days, P = NS). In       addition, no difference was seen in survival between those patients supported      with a left ventricular assist device for fewer than 180 days or longer than 180       days before transplantation (P = NS). The actuarial survival after      transplantation at 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis was      98.7\\\%, 93.0\\\%, 91.1\\\%, and 88.0\\\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The short- and      long-term post-transplant survival for patients bridged with a continuous-flow      left ventricular assist device in the current era has been excellent.      Furthermore, the duration of left ventricular assist device support did not      affect post-transplant survival. The hemodynamic benefits of ventricular      unloading with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices, in addition to      their durability and reduced patient morbidity, have contributed to improved      post-transplant survival.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether electrocardiograms of VT with LV apical exit      sites would identify patients with larger scars extending a greater distance from      the base toward the apex and decreased heart transplant/left ventricular assist      device (LVAD)-free survival. METHODS: Consecutive patients with LV NICM      undergoing VT ablation between May 2008 and April 2011 were studied. All      electrocardiograms of spontaneous and induced VT were analyzed. Apical VT was      defined as left bundle branch morphology with precordial transition >/= V5 or      right bundle branch morphology with precordial transition </= V3. Scar percentage      was defined as the area of low voltage divided by the total surface area.      RESULTS: Thirty-two of 76 patients had 1 or more apical VTs. Those with apical      VTs had larger percentage of endocardial and epicardial bipolar scars (14.9\\\% vs      8.1\\\%, P = .01, and 15.5\\\% vs 5.5\\\%, P = .03, respectively), scar that, although      originating from the periannular region (94.7\\\% of the patients), was more likely       to extend apically beyond the basal half (48.3\\\% vs 24.4\\\%, P = .05 endocardial,      and 85.7\\\% vs 25.9\\\%, P = .07 epicardial), and worse transplant/LVAD-free survival       during a mean follow-up of 332 days (P = .006).

We examined the differences in risk of adverse outcomes between      LVAD-supported and medically managed candidates on the heart transplant waiting      list. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed mortality and morbidity in 33,073 heart      transplant candidates registered on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)      waiting list between 1999 and 2011. Five groups were selected: patients without      LVADs in urgency status 1A, 1B, and 2; patients with pulsatile-flow LVADs; and      patients with continuous-flow LVADs. Outcomes in patients requiring biventricular      assist devices, total artificial heart, and temporary VADs were also analyzed.      Two eras were defined on the basis of the approval date of the first      continuous-flow LVAD for bridge to transplantation in the United States (2008).      Mortality was lower in the current compared with the first era (2.1\\\%/mo versus      2.9\\\%/mo; P<0.0001). In the first era, mortality of pulsatile-flow LVAD patients      was higher than in status 2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15; P<0.0001) and similar to      that in status 1B patients (HR, 1.04; P=0.61). In the current era, patients with       continuous-flow LVADs had mortality similar to that of status 2 (HR, 0.80;      P=0.12) and lower mortality compared with status 1A and 1B patients (HR, 0.24 and      0.47; P<0.0001 for both comparisons). However, status upgrade for LVAD-related      complications occurred frequently (28\\\%) and increased the mortality risk (HR,      1.75; P=0.001). Mortality was highest in patients with biventricular assist      devices (HR, 5.00; P<0.0001) and temporary VADs (HR, 7.72; P<0.0001).      CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and morbidity on the heart transplant waiting list have      decreased. Candidates supported with contemporary continuous-flow LVADs have      favorable waiting list outcomes; however, they worsen significantly once a      serious LVAD-related complication occurs. Transplant candidates requiring      temporary and biventricular support have the highest risk of adverse outcomes.      These results may help to guide optimal allocation of donor hearts.FAU - Wever-Pinzon, OmarAU  - Wever-Pinzon OAD  - U.T.A.H.

However, with improving mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) technology,       the treatment options for RCS patients are expanding. We report on a recent      5-year single-center experience with MCSD for treatment of RCS. METHODS: This      study was a retrospective review of adult patients who required an MCSD due to      RCS in the past 5 years. We excluded those patients with post-cardiotomy shock      and post-transplant cardiac graft dysfunction. In the setting of RCS, a      short-term ventricular assist device (VAD) was inserted as a bridge-to-decision      device. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) was chosen in      cases of unknown neurologic status, complete hemodynamic collapse or severe      coagulopathy. RESULTS: From January 2007 through January 2012, 90 patients      received an MCSD for RCS, 21 (23\\\%) of whom had active cardiopulmonary      resuscitation (CPR). The etiology of RCS included acute myocardial infarction in       49\\\% and acute decompensated heart failure in 27\\\%. Mean age was 53+/-14 years, 71\\\%      were male, and 60\\\% had an intra-aortic balloon pump. The initial approach      utilized was short-term VAD in 49\\\% and VA ECMO in 51\\\%. Median length of support      was 8 days (IQR 4 to 18 days). Exchange to implantable VAD was performed in 26\\\%      of patients. Other destinations included myocardial recovery in 18\\\% and heart      transplantation in 11\\\%. Survival to hospital discharge was 49\\\%. Multivariate      analysis showed ongoing CPR to be an independent risk factor for mortality (OR =       5.79, 95\\\% CI 1.285 to 26.08, p = 0.022).

Left ventricular assist device implantation offers an      alternative treatment approach. Left ventricular assist device practice has      changed dramatically since the 2008 Food and Drug Administration approval of the       HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif), but at what societal cost? The      present study examined the cost and efficacy of both treatments over time.      METHODS: All patients who underwent either orthotopic heart transplantation (n =       9369) or placement of an implantable left ventricular assist device (n = 6414)      from 2005 to 2009 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were selected. The trends in      treatment use, mortality, and cost were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of      orthotopic heart transplantation increased marginally within a 5-year period. In       contrast, the annual left ventricular assist device implantation rates nearly      tripled. In-hospital mortality from left ventricular assist device implantation      decreased precipitously, from 42\\\% to 17\\\%. In-hospital mortality for orthotopic      heart transplantation remained relatively stable (range, 3.8\\\%-6.5\\\%). The mean      cost per patient increased for both orthotopic heart transplantation and left      ventricular assist device placement (40\\\% and 17\\\%, respectively). With the      observed increase in both device usage and cost per patient, the cumulative Left       ventricular assist device cost increased 232\\\% within 5 years (from $143 million      to $479 million). By 2009, Medicare and Medicaid were the primary payers for      nearly one half of all patients (orthotopic heart transplantation, 45\\\%; left      ventricular assist device, 51\\\%). CONCLUSIONS: Since Food and Drug Administration       approval of the HeartMate II, mortality after left ventricular assist device      implantation has decreased rapidly, yet has remained greater than that after      orthotopic heart transplantation. The left ventricular assist device costs have      continued to increase and have been significantly greater than those for      orthotopic heart transplantation. Because of the evolving healthcare economics      climate, with increasing emphasis on the costs and comparative effectiveness, a      concerted effort at LVAD cost containment and judicious usage is essential to      preserve the viability of this invaluable treatment.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

We sought to describe the detailed effects of DLIs over      time in patients with continuous-flow VADs, including the onset, risk factors,      organisms involved, association with invasive infections, and outcomes. METHODS:       We reviewed data for patients with HeartMate II VADs (HMII) who were implanted at      the Cleveland Clinic from October 2004 to September 2011 and followed through      December 2011. DLIs were defined according to published criteria. RESULTS: DLIs      developed in 45 of 194 HMII VADs over a median period of 232 days (range 22 to      883 days). Hazard for DLI was 2.0\\\%/month, but transiently peaked at 11\\\%/month at       7.5 months after implant. Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 31\\\%, 42\\\% and 55\\\%      of initial, final and deep DLIs, respectively. Of the 40 superficial DLIs, 13      (32.5\\\%) became deep. DLI-associated bacteremia and hospitalization occurred in 14      of 45 (31\\\%) and 30 of 45 (67\\\%), respectively. All patients received antibiotics      (median 171 days), but only 3 of 44 (6.8\\\%) developed an antibiotic complication.       DLIs increased the risk for death while on VAD support (HR 2.20, 95\\\% CI 1.20 to      4.05; p = 0.01). Six and 12 months after DLI, mortality was 9.8\\\% and 31\\\%, but the      competing event of transplantation occurred successfully in 20\\\% and 28\\\%,      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most DLIs begin superficially with peak hazard at 7.5       months after implant. Depth of infection and infecting organism may evolve over      months on support, with Pseudomonas becoming more prominent. Although effectively      managed for prolonged periods, DLIs are associated with reduced survival on VAD      support.

At the present time, there are      only limited means of quantifying disease severity or the concomitant morbidity      for this population. This study describes the development of a novel pediatric      treatment intensity score (TIS), designed to quantify the burden of illness and      clinical trajectory in children on VAD support. METHODS: There were 5 clinical      domains assessed: nutrition, respiratory support, activity level, cardiovascular       medications, and care environment. A scale was developed through expert      consensus. Higher scores indicate greater morbidity as reflected by intensity of       medical management. To evaluate feasibility and face validity, the TIS was      applied retrospectively to a subset of pediatric inpatients with VADs. The      Bland-Altman method was used to assess limits of agreement. RESULTS: The study      comprised 39 patients with 42 implantations. Bland-Altman interobserver and      intraobserver comparisons showed good agreement (mean differences in scores of      0.02, limits of agreement +/-0.12). Trends in TIS were concordant with the      overall clinical impression of improvement. Scores remained >/=0.6 preceding VAD       implantation and peaked at 0.71 3 days after VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: We      describe a pediatric VAD scoring tool, to assess global patient morbidity and      clinical recovery. We demonstrate feasibility of using this TIS in a test      population of inpatients on VAD support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

However, the prognosis of patients      with advanced heart failure and peak VO(2) of 10 to 14 mL/min per kg in the era      of modern medical therapy for heart failure is not fully elucidated. B-type      natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a useful prognostic marker in patients with heart      failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 424 patients undergoing HTx evaluation      were classified according to peak VO(2) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing      (>14, 10-14, and <10 mL/min per kg). Survival after cardiopulmonary exercise      testing without HTx or ventricular assist device (VAD) support was compared with       survival of 743 de novo HTx recipients. Multivariable analysis revealed that high      BNP and low peak VO(2) were independently associated with death, HTx, or VAD      requirements (hazard ratio, 3.5 and 0.6; 95\\\% CI, 1.24-9.23 and 0.03-0.71; P=0.02       and <0.0001, respectively). VAD-free or HTx-free survival of patients with peak      VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg was identical to post-HTx survival. When patients      with peak VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg were dichotomized by a cutoff value of BNP      of 506 pg/mL, those with BNP<506 pg/mL was equivalent to post-HTx survival (1      year: 90.8\\\% versus 87.2\\\%; P=0.61), whereas those with BNP>/=506 showed worse      VAD-free or HTx-free survival (1 year: 79.7\\\%; P<0.001 versus post-HTx). Patients       with peak VO(2) <10 mL/min per kg showed worse survival compared with post-HTx      survival, and there was a survival difference between those with BNP>/=506 and      <506 pg/mL (1 year: 77.2\\\% versus 56.1\\\%; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with peak       VO(2) 10 to 14 mL/min per kg and low BNP levels have a VAD-free or HTx-free      survival similar to post-HTx survival in heart recipients, whereas high BNP      levels indicate worse outcome in this group of patients.FAU - Kato, Tomoko SAU  - Kato TSAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical      Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.FAU - Collado, EliasAU  - Collado EFAU - Khawaja, TubaAU  - Khawaja TFAU - Kawano, YumekoAU  - Kawano YFAU - Kim, MargaretAU  - Kim MFAU - Farr, MaryjaneAU  - Farr MFAU - Mancini, Donna MAU  - Mancini DMFAU - Schulze, P ChristianAU  - Schulze PCLA  - engGR  - HL073029/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL095742-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - P30 HL101272-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - UL1 RR024156/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20121130PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.

It is       unknown whether the use of short-term VAD support in patients with cardiogenic      shock affects HTx outcome. We sought to investigate long-term outcomes of HU      transplanted patients with VAD compared with HU transplanted patients without      device support. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all HTx patients      transplanted between 1999 and 2011 in our institution. Patients were categorized       by urgency: elective HTx, HU-HTx with VAD (status 0), and HU-HTx without VAD      (status 1). Actuarial survival rates were compared. RESULTS: Of 237 transplanted       patients, 55 (23\\\%) were HU-HTx, including 16 on VAD support and 39 without VAD.      Mean time in the HU waiting list was 6.5 +/- 6 days and mean VAD support was 8.4       +/- 8 days (range, 1 to 31 days). Assist devices used were Levitronix Centrimag      (6), Abiomed (9), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (1). After a      mean follow-up of 4.6 +/- 4.1 years (range 0 to 13 years), 22 patients had died:       5 VAD and 17 non-VAD. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 73\\\% and 61\\\% for the      VAD and 74\\\% and 62\\\% for the non-VAD group, respectively (P = ns). Kaplan-Meier      and Cox regression analyses did not show survival differences, HR 1.11 (95\\\% CI      0.41-3.02), P = 0.84. The presence of renal failure was associated with increased      mortality risk, HR 1.9 (95\\\% CI 1.1-3.2), P = 0.02. The presence of renal failure       was associated with increased mortality risk [HR 1.9 (95\\\% CI 1.1-3.2), P = .02.).      CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the long-term outcome of patients receiving      HU-HTx under short-term VAD support is comparable to that of patients undergoing       HU-HTx without VAD support. Patients with renal failure had an increased risk for      overall mortality in this set of patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The prolonged time for patients awaiting HTx       on the high-urgency (HU) status leads mostly to serious medical complications.      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the trend of changes in the      frequency of ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation in patients on the HU      status. METHODS: A total of 22 adult patients awaiting transplantation on the HU       status at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2011 were analyzed,      assessing risk profile, blood group, and complication rates in terms of VAD      implantation or death. Results were compared with 16 consecutive patients who      were on transplant list with the HU status between January 2010 and December 2010      at our institution. RESULTS: Mean age was 49.5 +/- 12.1 (2010 group) years and      51.4 +/- 10.7 years (2011 group; p = 0.62). Mean logEuroSCORES raised not      significantly from 9.1 +/- 6.3\\\% (2010 group) to 10.7 +/- 14.7\\\% (2011 group; p =      0.68). Six patients died on the HU status and seven patients had to be supplied      with a VAD in 2011. In comparison with the preceding year, only two patients died      in 2010 and none of our patients on the HU status had to be provided with      mechanical circulatory support. CONCLUSION: Because of the prolonged waiting time      on the HU list, the earlier-mentioned data demonstrate a negative trend in      transplant medicine. Especially when taking into consideration that five of seven      patients who needed a VAD implantation during the HU waiting period had blood      group O. Furthermore, the data derived from Eurotransplant show that the waiting       period for patients with blood group O was considerably longer when compared with      patients of the same average body height and weight but with other blood groups.CI  - Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

However, the effect       of long-term CF with lack of peripheral arterial wall motions on blood pressure      regulation and end-organ arterial wall sclerosis, especially in the case of      long-term support (> 3 years), remains unclear. METHODS: Tissue samples obtained       at autopsy from liver, kidney, coronary arteries, and brain from 27 VAD      recipients supported for > 180 days between 2000 and 2010 were histologically      examined to assess vascular alterations, including perivascular infiltrate,      intravascular infiltrate, wall thickness, thrombosis, endothelial cell swelling,       vessel wall necrosis, and peri-vascular fibrosis. Pulsatile-flow (PF) devices had      been inserted in 9 patients and CF devices had been inserted in 16. The      pathologist was blinded to the group distribution. Demographic, pharmacologic,      and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed before surgery and during the      follow-up period of up to 24 months. RESULTS: Median duration of support was 467       days (range, 235-1,588 days) in the PF group and 263 days (range, 182-942 days)      in the CF group. Demographic and clinical data before and after surgery were      similar. Amiodarone was more often used during follow-up in CF group than in the       PF group (61\\\% vs 10\\\%, p = 0.009). Throughout the follow-up period, mean arterial       pressure did not differ between recipients of the 2 pump types, nor did systolic       and diastolic pressure, except at 2 weeks after VAD implantation, when systolic      blood pressure was higher (p = 0.05) and diastolic lower (p = 0.03) in the PF      group. Histologic studies did not identify any relevant differences in arterial      wall characteristics between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Long-term mechanical      circulatory support with CF devices does not adversely influence arterial wall      properties of the end-organ vasculature.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Improved myocardial responsiveness to catecholamines after ventricular assist      device (VAD) support is associated with upregulation of beta1-adrenergic      receptors (beta1-ARs). Little is known about the regulation of AC and beta2-AR      coupling after VAD; moreover beta2-AR stimulation during VAD was claimed to      induce myocardial recovery. METHODS: We analyzed in VAD-supported human      myocardium the regulation of AC activity upon beta1-AR and selective beta2-AR      stimulation in 8 non-failing hearts (NF) and 17 paired samples of VAD patients.      AC messenger RNA was measured by TaqMan. AC was stimulated via beta2-AR using      clenbuterol (beta2-AR agonist) and bisoprolol (beta1-AR blocker). Organ bath      experiments were done with trabeculae from both ventricles. Samples were      stratified according to chronic or acute heart failure history. RESULTS:      Isoprenaline-induced AC activity was downregulated (p < 0.001) pre-VAD and      increased significantly (p < 0.05) after unloading (mean +/- standard deviation      pmole/mg/min) in NF (47.9 +/- 14.9), pre-VAD (24.35 +/- 13.3), and post-VAD      (50.04 +/- 50.25). Forskolin stimulation revealed significant (p < 0.05)      upregulation of AC activity during VAD, especially in acutely failing hearts (NF,      192.1 +/- 68.7; pre-VAD, 191.1 +/- 60.4; post-VAD, 281.5 +/- 133). However,      forskolin stimulation relative to isoprenaline-induced inotropy remained reduced       before and after VAD compared with NF. The selective stimulation of beta2-AR did       not reveal influence of VAD support on beta2-AR-AC coupling. Stimulation of      ventricular trabeculae by > 100 mumole/liter clenbuterol revealed negative      inotropic responses. CONCLUSIONS: VAD does not influence beta2-AR coupling to AC       stimulation. Elevated response to catecholamines after VAD support is influenced       by beta1-AR upregulation and modulation of AC activity. Restoration of      beta-adrenergic responsiveness was restricted to acutely failing hearts.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

moreover beta2-ar stimulation during vad was claimed to      induce myocardial recovery. methods: we analyzed in vad-supported human      myocardium the regulation of ac activity upon beta1-ar and selective beta2-ar      stimulation in 8 non-failing hearts (nf) and 17 paired samples of vad patients.      ac messenger rna was measured by taqman. ac was stimulated via beta2-ar using      clenbuterol (beta2-ar agonist) and bisoprolol (beta1-ar blocker). organ bath      experiments were done with trabeculae from both ventricles. samples were      stratified according to chronic or acute heart failure history. results:      isoprenaline-induced ac activity was downregulated (p < 0.001) pre-vad and      increased significantly (p < 0.05) after unloading (mean +/- standard deviation      pmole/mg/min) in nf (47.9 +/- 14.9), pre-vad (24.35 +/- 13.3), and post-vad      (50.04 +/- 50.25). forskolin stimulation revealed significant (p < 0.05)      upregulation of ac activity during vad, especially in acutely failing hearts (nf,      192.1 +/- 68.7; pre-vad, 191.1 +/- 60.4; post-vad, 281.5 +/- 133). however,      forskolin stimulation relative to isoprenaline-induced inotropy remained reduced       before and after vad compared with nf. the selective stimulation of beta2-ar did       not reveal influence of vad support on beta2-ar-ac coupling. stimulation of      ventricular trabeculae by > 100 mumole/liter clenbuterol revealed negative      inotropic responses. conclusions: vad does not influence beta2-ar coupling to ac       stimulation. elevated response to catecholamines after vad support is influenced       by beta1-ar upregulation and modulation of ac activity. restoration of      beta-adrenergic responsiveness was restricted to acutely failing hearts.ci  - copyright (c) 2012 international society for heart and lung transplantation.      published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.fau - kassner, astridau  - kassner aad  - herz- und diabeteszentrum nrw, klinik f. thorax- und kardiovaskularchirurgie, e.       & h. klessmann-institut f. kardiovaskulare forschung und entwicklung, bad      oeynhausen, germany.fau - toischer, karlau  - toischer kfau - bohms, birteau  - bohms bfau - kolkhof, peterau  - kolkhof pfau - abraham, getuau  - abraham gfau - hasenfubeta, gerdau  - hasenfubeta gfau - morshuis, michielau  - morshuis mfau - schulte eistrup, sebastianau  - schulte eistrup sfau - el-banayosy, alyau  - el-banayosy afau - gummert, janau  - gummert jfau - milting, hendrikau  - milting hla  - engpt  - comparative studypt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\\tpl  - united statesta  - j heart lung transplantjt  - the journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the      international society for heart transplantationjid - 9102703rn  - 0 (adrenergic beta-agonists)rn  - 0 (adrenergic beta-antagonists)rn  - 0 (catecholamines)rn  - 0 (receptors, adrenergic, beta-1)rn  - 0 (receptors, adrenergic, beta-2)rn  - 1f7a44v6ou (colforsin)rn  - e0399ozs9n (cyclic amp)rn  - ec 4.6.1.1 (adenylate cyclase)rn  - l628tt009w (isoproterenol)rn  - xtz6axu7kn (clenbuterol)rn  - y41js2nl6u (bisoprolol)sb  - immh  - adenylate cyclase/metabolismmh  - adolescentmh  - adrenergic beta-agonists/pharmacologymh  - adrenergic beta-antagonists/pharmacologymh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - bisoprolol/pharmacologymh  - catecholamines/pharmacologymh  - childmh  - clenbuterol/pharmacologymh  - colforsin/pharmacologymh  - cyclic amp/*metabolismmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/*metabolism/*therapymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - isoproterenol/pharmacologymh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - myocardium/*metabolismmh  - receptors, adrenergic, beta-1/drug effects/metabolismmh  - receptors, adrenergic, beta-2/drug effects/*metabolismmh  - young adultedat- 2012/09/15 06:00mhda- 2013/04/05 06:00crdt- 2012/09/15 06:00phst- 2011/12/28 [received]phst- 2012/03/30 [revised]phst- 2012/07/18 [accepted]aid - s1053-2498(12)01177-1 [pii]aid - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.07.005 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - j heart lung transplant. 2012 oct;31(10):1127-35. doi:      10.1016/j.healun.2012.07.005.',surgery

There are no data specifically examining its late effects on      patients undergoing implantation with a ventricular assist device (VAD). METHODS:      Between October 1996 and October 2010, 364 patients underwent primary VAD implant      and DSC was utilized in 184 (51\\\%) patients for coagulopathy (n = 155; 84\\\%),      hemodynamic instability (n = 103; 56\\\%), isolated right ventricular dysfunction (n      = 15; 8\\\%) or unspecified reasons (n = 17; 9\\\%). RESULTS: Median duration of DSC      was 1 day (range 1 to 7 days). Patients with DSC were older (54.5 vs. 50.3 years,      p = 0.002), had a higher incidence of previous sternotomy (42\\\% vs. 28\\\%, p =      0.005), pre-operative intra-aortic balloon pump (50\\\% vs. 30\\\%, p < 0.001),      pre-operative temporary extracorporeal mechanical circulatory support (23\\\% vs      10\\\%, p < 0.001), lower platelet counts (171,000 vs. 209,000, p < 0.001) and lower      hematocrit levels (32\\\% vs. 36\\\%, p < 0.001). Operative (11\\\% vs. 9\\\%, p = 0.65) or      late (2 years; 66 +/- 7\\\% vs 66 +/- 7\\\%, p = 0.720) mortality; composite incidence       of mediastinitis, percutaneous drive-line infection, pocket infection and      VAD-related endocarditis (15\\\% vs. 16\\\%, p = 0.79); re-exploration for bleeding      (18\\\% vs. 18\\\%, p = 0.99); urgent transplantation for infection (4\\\% vs. 3\\\%, p =      0.99); or need for device exchange (9\\\% vs. 10\\\%, p = 0.16) was not increased after      DSC when compared with immediate sternal closure. DSC increased ICU stay (10 vs.       5 days, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DSC was performed most commonly for coagulopathy      and/or hemodynamic instability, and patients were older with a greater severity      of illness as shown by the higher incidence of right-sided circulatory failure      and history of prior sternotomy. Although DSC was associated with longer ICU      stay, DSC was not associated with a significantly increased risk of death or      infection.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We undertook this study to examine the incidence and      impact of repeat sternotomies on OHT outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a      retrospective review of all adult OHT from 2 institutions. Primary stratification      was by the number of prior sternotomies. The primary outcome was survival.      Secondary outcomes included blood product utilization and commonly encountered      postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression      models examined mortality while linear regression models examined blood      utilization. RESULTS: From January 1995 to October 2011, 631 OHT were performed.       Of these, 25 (4.0\\\%) were redo OHT and 182 (28.8\\\%) were bridged to transplant with      a ventricular assist device; 356 (56.4\\\%) had undergone at least 1 prior      sternotomy. On unadjusted analysis, reoperative sternotomy was associated with      decreased 90-day (98.5\\\% vs 90.2\\\%, p<0.001), 1-year (93.1\\\% vs 79.6\\\%, p<0.001), and      5-year (80.4\\\% vs 70.1\\\%, p=0.002) survival. This difference persisted on      multivariable analysis at 90 days (hazard ratio [HR] 2.99, p=0.01), 1 year (HR      2.98, p=0.002), and 5 years (HR 1.62, p=0.049). The impact of an increasing      number of prior sternotomies was negligible. On multivariable analysis, an      increasing number of prior sternotomies was associated with increased      intraoperative blood product utilization. Increasing blood utilization was      associated with decreased 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year survival. CONCLUSIONS:      Reoperative sternotomy is associated with increased mortality and blood      utilization after OHT. Patients with more than 1 prior sternotomy do not      experience additional increased mortality.

One common strategy to address AI during CF-LVAD support      is central oversewing of the aortic valve, which allows some opening between the       valve leaflets laterally. However, the long-term durability of this technique has      not been extensively described. METHODS: All patients who underwent central      oversewing of the aortic valve during CF-LVAD support between January 2006 and      March 2013 were included in this analysis. Pre- and post-procedure      intra-operative transesophageal echocardiograms (TEEs) were reviewed to determine      the efficacy of the surgical technique, whereas all subsequent transthoracic      echocardiograms (TTEs) were reviewed to assess durability. AI severity was graded      using the vena contracta (VC) width and the ratio between the VC and left      ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with      central aortic valve oversewing were identified. Median follow-up was 560 days      (range 46 to 954 days). All but 1 patient had their aortic insufficiency reduced       to \\\"none/trace\\\" on post-operative TEE. There was no statistically significant      increase in the VC width and VC/LVOT ratio between the first and last follow-up      echocardiograms, and only 2 patients developed more than mild aortic      insufficiency after central oversewing. Central oversewing of the aortic valve      did not adversely affect outcomes after LVAD implantation. CONCLUSION: Central      oversewing of the aortic valve is an effective and durable means of addressing      greater than mild AI in patients with CF-LVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to      analyze outcomes of patients successfully bridged with MCS to cardiac ReTx.      METHODS: Of 1,690 cardiac ReTx identified in the UNOS database from October 1987       to July 2011, 149 (8.8\\\%) were bridged to ReTx with MCS. RESULTS: Patients bridged      to ReTx with MCS had a poorer survival than patients not bridged (p < 0.0001).      ReTx after ventricular assist device (VAD) support had better survival than ReTx       after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; half-life, 3.9 years vs 61 days,      p = 0.026). For patients bridged to ReTx, graft survival was 40\\\% for ReTx within       1 year of primary Tx vs 64\\\% (p = 0.003). When ReTx was performed 1 year after      cardiac Tx, survival was similar in patients bridged with a VAD and those not      bridged (mean, 7.5 vs 8.7 years; p = 0.8). Survival for patients bridged to ReTx       with ECMO was consistently worse (p </= 0.05) in all analyses. The 1-year      survival of ReTx after VAD performed in 2003 to 2011 (67\\\%) was better than in the      earlier era of 1987 to 2002 (37\\\%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Bridging patients to      ReTx with ECMO at any time is not advisable. Bridging patients with MCS to ReTx      within 1 year of primary cardiac Tx is not advisable. Survival after ReTx for      patients bridged by VAD has improved considerably over time. Patients who survive      the first year after cardiac Tx can be bridged by VAD to ReTx with an expectation      that outcomes can be similar to ReTx patients who did not require MCS.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

METHODS: We      conducted a prospective, single-group trial of a ventricular assist device      designed specifically for children as a bridge to heart transplantation. Patients      16 years of age or younger were divided into two cohorts according to      body-surface area (cohort 1, <0.7 m(2); cohort 2, 0.7 to <1.5 m(2)), with 24      patients in each group. Survival in the two cohorts receiving mechanical support       (with data censored at the time of transplantation or weaning from the device      owing to recovery) was compared with survival in two propensity-score-matched      historical control groups (one for each cohort) undergoing extracorporeal      membrane oxygenation (ECMO). RESULTS: For participants in cohort 1, the median      survival time had not been reached at 174 days, whereas in the matched ECMO      group, the median survival was 13 days (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). For      participants in cohort 2 and the matched ECMO group, the median survival was 144       days and 10 days, respectively (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). Serious adverse      events in cohort 1 and cohort 2 included major bleeding (in 42\\\% and 50\\\% of      patients, respectively), infection (in 63\\\% and 50\\\%), and stroke (in 29\\\% and 29\\\%).      CONCLUSIONS: Our trial showed that survival rates were significantly higher with       the ventricular assist device than with ECMO. Serious adverse events, including      infection, stroke, and bleeding, occurred in a majority of study participants.

We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwent      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile      (HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and the      effect on body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) who      underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for      weight change. In the 30-day survivors, end points of the study were continued      LVAD support, heart transplant, or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass      surgery and was excluded. RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria,      BMI was 35.6 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 +/- 5.5      kg/m(2) (mean BMI change -2.5 kg/m(2); P = .063), with a mean follow-up time of      301.6 +/- 255.5 days. The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9      kg/m(2) (P = .016 vs baseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1 kg/m(2)      increase in BMI. BMI <30 kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\\\%), 5      of 19 (26\\\%) in XVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\\\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12       XVE, 2 HMII) or 50\\\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was      4.6 kg/m(2) (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30      kg/m(2) provided significant weight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in      recipients of the continuous flow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a      heart transplant after LVAD insertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6 kg/m(2) (P =      .003). LVAD implantation provides a period of hemodynamic support for obese      patients with advanced heart failure, during which time opportunity may be      available for weight loss. Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater      weight loss than nonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may      be necessary to achieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous      flow LVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

There is no clearly      proven policy to manage end-stage heart failure patients with valvular      pathologies. The aim of this report was to analysis our experience with combined       approach of VAD implantation and valvular procedures among patients with valvular      heart disease and end-stage heart failure. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical      records of 67 patients who underwent MCS from April 2007 to September 2011. We      identified 12 patients (17.9\\\%) who received concomitant valvular procedures, four      of whom had significant aortic insufficiency and received a simple coaptation      stitch at the center to approximate the fibrous nodules of Arantius. The      mechanical aortic valve was replaced with a stentless bioprosthesis in three      patients. Mitral valve commissurotomy was performed in one patient with mitral      stenosis and seven patients underwent tricuspit valve repair using an      annuloplasty ring. RESULTS: All 12 patients were males, of mean age 50.3 +/- 11.5      years (range = 25-66). Eleven of them (91.6\\\%) survived the early and late      postoperative periods. Ten subjects (83.3\\\%) continue to be supported with VAD; 1       (8.3\\\%) was successfully bridged to transplantation.

Although heart transplantation is the best therapy for end-stage heart failure,      most candidates die in the waiting period due to the lack of donor organs. This      condition represent a new era of heart failure surgery. METHODS: We      retrospectively investigated 159 patients from 1998 to 2011 with a mean age of      40.0 years (range = 5-65), who were mostly diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy (n      = 113). After April 2007, 67 patients underwent vascular assist device (VAD)      implantation surgery for acute or chronic end-stage heart failure. We performed      69 heart transplantation with 27 on VAD systems before transplantation. RESULTS:       Early mortality was 13.3\\\% with 21 patients after the heart transplantation. The      67 patients supported with VAD did not experience an intraoperative death. The      mean support time was 214 days (range = 3-1035). Twenty-four patients (35.8\\\%) are      still on pump support. The overall survival until transplantation or weaning was       77.6\\\% at mean of 250.7 days survival reached 90\\\% with Heartware (Hartware Inc,      Miramar, Fla, USA) continuous flow pumps. CONCLUSION: After the introduction of      VAD in 2007, the overall picture has been restructured radically for heart      failure surgery, reducing patient loss on the waiting list. Especially, since      2009 nearly 80\\\% of donor hearts were used for patients on mechanical circulatory       support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are      questions about posttransplantation effects of VADs. METHODS: Seventy-four      patients with end-stage heart failure who underwent HTx in our clinic between      February 2007 and July 2011 were divided into two groups; a bridge cohort (n =      28) and a nonbridge group comprising 46 who underwent HTx without mechanical      circulatory support. There mean ages were 39.89 +/- 15.66 and 38.33 +/- 16.23      years respectively. Significantly more patients in the bridge group, were man      displayed anemia, were treated with anticoagulation therapy, and underwent a      resternotomy. In the nonbridge group, more patients needed preoperative inotropic      support. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative      renal failure (P = .007, odds ratio [OR] 27) and inotropic support (P = .006, OR:      10,222) as well as longer cardiopulmonary bypasses (>/= 130 minutes, P = .001,      OR: 11,24) to be risk factors for in-hospital mortality, which was 15.2\\\% in      nonbridge and 10.7\\\% in bridge subjects, P = .733). Major adverse events, such as       renal failure, pulmonary failure, right ventricular failure, neurological event,       and reoperation due to bleeding, shown similar incidences between the groups. The      amount of blood transfusion was significantly higher in the bridge group (2.34 U       versus 3.56 U, P = .037). The preoperative incidence of human leukocyte antigen      sensitization (panel reactive antibody >/= 10\\\%) and grade 2R were rejection      episodes in the early period were similar. CONCLUSION: Early posttransplant      results were not adversely or beneficially influenced by the use of VADs. Similar      to other types of cardiac surgery, a patients preoperative condition seemed to be      the major factor affecting mortality.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study      was to examine the correlation between hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA)      and BSI after implantation of LVAD for advanced heart failure (HF). This was a      retrospective descriptive review of 87 patients with end-stage HF, who underwent       implantation of HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD over a 4 year period. Blood      stream infections were diagnosed by serial blood cultures, and suspected      neurological complications including CVAs were confirmed by neuroimaging.      Extensive patient chart review was performed, and descriptive characteristics      were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The mean age of our study      population was 62.3 +/- 12.8 years, and the majority of our patients were males      (n = 75, 86.2\\\%). The baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients      with and without CVAs. Patients with BSI had a much greater incidence of CVA      compared to patients without BSI (n = 13, 43.3\\\% vs. n = 5, 10.0\\\%; p < 0.0001).      There was an increased mortality in patients with BSI than those without (n = 57,      65.5\\\% vs. n = 30, 34.5\\\%; p = 0.003).

The evolution and subsequent approval of larger pulsatile and,      more recently, continuous flow mechanical circulatory support (MCS) technology      for destination therapy (DT) offers the potential for triage of some patients      awaiting cardiac transplantation to DT. METHODS: The National Heart, Lung, and      Blood Institute Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory      Support (INTERMACS) is a national multi-institutional study of long-term MCS.      Between June 2006 and December 2011, 127 pulsatile and 1160 continuous flow pumps      (24\\\% of total primary left ventricular assist devices [LVADs]) carried an initial      strategy of DT therapy. RESULTS: By multivariable analysis, risk factors (P <      .05) for mortality after DT included older age, larger body mass index, history      of cancer, history of cardiac surgery, INTERMACS level I (cardiogenic shock),      dialysis, increased blood urea nitrogen, use of a pulsatile flow device, and use       of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD). Among patients with a continuous      flow LVAD who were not in cardiogenic shock, a particularly favorable survival      was associated with no cancer, patients not in cardiogenic shock, and blood urea       nitrogen less than 50 mg/dL, resulting in 1- and 2-year survivals of 88\\\% and 80\\\%.      CONCLUSIONS: (1) Evolution from pulsatile to continuous flow technology has      dramatically improved 1- and 2-year survivals; (2) DT is not appropriate for      patients with rapid hemodynamic deterioration or severe right ventricular      failure; (3) important subsets of patients with continuous flow DT now enjoy      survival that is competitive with heart transplantation out to about 2 years.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

The natural long-term trajectory of survival      free of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant in patients      with ambulatory class IV symptoms who underwent CRT has not been established. We       extracted clinical data on 723 consecutive patients with NYHA class III or      ambulatory class IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction </=35\\\%, and      a QRS duration >/=120 ms who underwent CRT from September 30, 2003, to August 6,       2007. Chart notes immediately before CRT were reviewed to confirm NYHA class      status before CRT. Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox proportional      hazards model were constructed to determine long-term survival free of heart      transplant and LVAD based on NYHA class status. Of the 723 patients, 52 had      ambulatory class IV symptoms. Over a mean follow-up of 5.0 +/- 2.5 years      controlling for many possible confounders, ambulatory NYHA class IV status was      independently associated with poor long-term outcomes. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and      5-year survival free of LVAD or heart transplant for class III versus ambulatory       class IV patients was 92.0\\\%, 84.0\\\%, 75.0\\\%, 68.1\\\%, and 63.2\\\% versus 75.0\\\%, 61.5\\\%,       52.0\\\%, 45\\\%, and 40.4\\\%, respectively. Although patients with ambulatory class IV      heart failure receiving CRT have inferior long-term outcomes compared with those       with class III symptoms, survival in class IV patients continues to parallel      class III patients over an extended follow-up. At 5 years, survival free of LVAD       or heart transplant in ambulatory class IV patients receiving CRT is 40\\\%.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, patients with biventricular HF may represent a unique cohort.      METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 113 adult,      end-stage HF patients at University of California Los Angeles Medical Center who       required BIVAD support between 2000 and 2009. RESULTS: Survival to transplant was      66.4\\\%, with 1-year actuarial survival of 62.8\\\%. All patients were Interagency      Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Level 1 or 2      and received Thoratec (Pleasanton, CA) paracorporeal BIVAD as a bridge to      transplant. Univariate analyses showed dialysis use, ventilator use,      extracorporal membrane oxygenation use, low cardiac output, preserved LV ejection      fraction (restrictive physiology), normal-to-high sodium, low platelet count, low      total cholesterol, low high-density and high-density lipoprotein, low albumin,      and elevated aspartate aminotransferase were associated with increased risk of      death. We generated a scoring system for survival to transplant. Our final model,      with age, sex, dialysis, cholesterol, ventilator, and albumin, gave a C-statistic      of 0.870. A simplified system preserved a C-statistic of 0.844. Patients were      divided into high-risk or highest-risk groups (median respective survival, 367      and 17 days), with strong discrimination between groups for death. CONCLUSIONS:      We have generated a scoring system that offers high prognostic ability for      patients requiring BIVAD support and hope that it may assist in clinical decision      making. Further studies are needed to prospectively validate our scoring system.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.

The SHFM is a validated multivariate risk model that uses NYHA      classification to assess functional capacity rather than peak oxygen consumption       (VO(2)). METHODS: Outpatients (n = 1,240) evaluated for transplant at three      centers had their SHFM score calculated and peak VO(2) measured. The outcomes      assessed were death/LVAD/urgent transplant with censoring at the time of elective      transplant. RESULTS: Over the course of 4.0 (mean) years of observation, there      were 571 events. Both the SHFM score (chi(2) = 227) and peak VO(2) (chi(2) = 88,       both p < 0.0001) were highly predictive of outcomes. The SHFM and peak VO(2) were      modestly correlated (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate Cox model, peak      VO(2) added to the SHFM with a hazard ratio of 0.949 (p < 0.0001) for each      1-ml/kg/min increase. Peak VO(2) improved both the net reclassification      improvement and integrated discrimination index (both p </= 0.0002). Peak VO(2)      provided additive prognostic information within each SHFM score (p < 0.05). The      1-year areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were obtained for       peak VO(2) (0.645, 95\\\% CI 0.606 to 0.684), SHFM (0.758, 95\\\% CI 0.721 to 0.795)      and SHFM with peak VO(2) (0.766, 95\\\% CI 0.731 to 0.802). The SHFM-predicted vs      actual survival free of LVAD/UNOS Status 1 transplant at 1 year (86\\\% vs 83\\\%) and       4 years (63\\\% vs 63\\\%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate SHFM is a      powerful predictor of death/LVAD/urgent transplant. Peak VO(2) adds prognostic      information across the spectrum of the SHFM, but changes in decision regarding      transplant listing occur mainly in moderate-risk patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have been      increasingly used as a bridge support to heart transplantation in children. We      aimed to examine the profiles of CRP in children receiving VAD support. METHODS:       Charts of 13 children receiving Berlin Heart EXCOR((R)) from 2005 to 2009 were      reviewed. The data obtained prior to and during VAD support included: CRP, white       blood cells, inotropes and steroid use, VAD mode and duration of VAD support. Ten      patients received left VAD (LVAD) and 3 biventricular VAD (BiVAD). RESULTS: The      median duration of VAD support was 59 days (ranged 3-678 days). Pre-VAD CRP was      35 +/- 51 mg/l and increased to 109 +/- 59 mg/l on days 1-3 after the VAD      implantation (P = 0.01), then gradually decreased to 28 +/- 28 mg/l by 4 months      and normalized by 5 months (P < 0.0001). CRP was higher in BiVAD than in LVAD      patients throughout the study period (P = 0.003). CRP positively correlated with       the doses of the epinephrine and norepinephrine and the monocyte counts, and      negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count. The lymphocyte count was 2.5 +/-      0.4 x 10(9)/l prior to implantation, and decreased to 2.1 +/- 1.3 x 10(9)/l on      days 1-3 (P = 0.5) and then to 0.6 +/- 0.1 x 10(9)/l by 6 months (P = 0.08). It      tended to be lower in BiVAD patients (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: SIR exists in      children prior to VAD support. VAD implantation is associated with a significant       and prolonged increase in CRP and a decrease in lymphocyte count, indicating a      suppressed immune function, being more pronounced in BiVAD patients.FAU - Yu, XiaoyangAU  - Yu XAD  - Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Stollery Children\\s      Hospital, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.FAU - Larsen, BodilAU  - Larsen BFAU - Rutledge, JenniferAU  - Rutledge JFAU - West, LoriAU  - West LFAU - Ross, David BAU  - Ross DBFAU - Rebeyka, Ivan MAU  - Rebeyka IMFAU - Buchholz, HolgerAU  - Buchholz HFAU - Li, JiaAU  - Li JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20120522PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399RN  - 9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - C-Reactive Protein/*metabolismMH  - Cardiopulmonary Bypass/*adverse effectsMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/*surgeryMH  - Heart VentriclesMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Infant, NewbornMH  - Lymphocyte CountMH  - MaleMH  - PrognosisMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*blood/etiologyPMC - PMC3422931OID - NLM: PMC3422931EDAT- 2012/05/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/24 06:00PHST- 2012/05/22 [aheadofprint]AID - ivs206 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivs206 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2012 Sep;15(3):426-31. doi:      10.1093/icvts/ivs206.

This study evaluated our strategy for right heart failure using a      temporary right VAD (RVAD) with an extracorporeal centrifugal pump. METHODS: From      January 2001 to December 2010, 108 patients underwent LVAD implantation at our      institution and their clinical outcomes were studied. RESULTS: A temporary      centrifugal RVAD was implanted in 26 patients. Multivariate logistic regression      revealed pre-operative extracorporeal life support (odds ratio [OR], 37.0),      central venous pressure (OR, 1.2), mean pulmonary artery pressure (OR, 0.9), and       serum total bilirubin (OR, 1.4) were the risk factors for RVAD requirement.      RVAD-off test was conducted, and 11 of the 26 patients showed significant      recovery of right heart function and were eventually removed from RVAD support.      The survival of patients with isolated LVAD was significantly better than those      with a paracorporeal pulsatile BiVAD (80\\\% vs 11\\\% at 1 year, p < 0.001). However,       there was no significant difference between the survival of patients who      underwent isolated LVAD support and those who were initially implanted with      temporary BiVAD but underwent the RVAD removal (80\\\% vs 73\\\% at 1 year, p = 0.827).      CONCLUSION: Our strategy with temporary RVAD for severe acute right heart failure      was effective in selecting the patients who could be weaned from RVAD support.      Patient survival was improved by avoiding the long-term support with a      paracorporeal pulsatile BiVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We have used the CentriMag VAD as a bridge to decision device. We      describe our experience with device placement, use and outcomes. METHODS: This is      a retrospective study of all patients who underwent CentriMag placement at our      institution from January 2007 to August 2009. Sixty-three patients had placement       of a CentriMag device, with 43\\\% (n = 27) of these being placed due to failure of       medical management. These cases were the focus of our study. RESULTS: Primary      diagnoses were ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 17), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 7)      or other (n = 3). Mean age was 47.1 (range 7 to 72) years. Prior to implant, 85\\\%       of patients were on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, 70\\\% were on      vasopressors, and 44\\\% were on more than one inotrope. INTERMACS score was 1 in      67\\\% of patients and 2 in 33\\\% of patients. Six patients were bridged to a      long-term device, 8 to transplantation and 10 to recovery. Eighty-nine percent      (24 of 27) of patients survived to explant and 74\\\% (20 of 27) survived to      hospital discharge, with a 1-year survival of 68\\\%. Thromboembolic complications      occurred in 10 patients, including 6 strokes. Compared with patients who survived      to discharge, those who died had a significantly higher body mass index (30.8 vs       24.1 kg/m(2), p = 0.003). Survivors to discharge demonstrated significant      improvements in hepatic and renal function over the course of device support      while non-survivors did not.

Once haemodynamic stability has been established       with a ventricular assist device (VAD), the decision to wait for myocardial      recovery as opposed to listing for an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can be      difficult. We have undertaken this study to establish the criteria for      determining the need for heart transplantation following VAD implant for      fulminant myocarditis. METHODS: A total of 442 VADs were implanted between 1993      and 2011. Twenty-four VADs were implanted for fulminant myocarditis with      refractory cardiogenic shock. We retrospectively analysed the variables and the      pathology for this cohort. Patients who had a full recovery of myocardial      function and subsequent VAD explant (Explant) were compared with those bridged to      OHT. There was one acute death. RESULTS: There was no difference in the past      medical history between the groups. Explant patients had a more acute onset of      heart failure with a median of 7 days between the onset of symptoms and VAD      implant, when compared with 22 days for OHT (P = 0.01). A rapid recovery in      myocardial function was seen in the Explant group, with recovery of myocardial      function (ejection fraction = 53 +/- 24\\\%) in 14 +/- 7 days. Myocardial function      was sustained for 5 years following the VAD explant. The female gender favoured      myocardial recovery and VAD explantability. Two patients had giant cell      myocarditis, neither of whom had a recovery of function, and they were bridged to      heart transplant with a VAD. CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant myocarditis is a fatal      condition without mechanical support. The rapid onset of symptoms is associated      with a complete recovery of myocardial function and VAD explant. The absence of      rapid recovery of myocardial function should prompt listing for a heart      transplant.FAU - Atluri, PavanAU  - Atluri PAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Perelman School of      Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.FAU - Ullery, Brant WAU  - Ullery BWFAU - MacArthur, John WAU  - MacArthur JWFAU - Goldstone, Andrew BAU  - Goldstone ABFAU - Fairman, Alex SAU  - Fairman ASFAU - Hiesinger, WilliamAU  - Hiesinger WFAU - Acker, Michael AAU  - Acker MAFAU - Woo, Y JosephAU  - Woo YJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120507PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocarditis/complications/*therapyMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/methodsMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/complications/*therapyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/05/09 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/19 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/09 06:00PHST- 2012/05/07 [aheadofprint]AID - ezs242 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs242 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Feb;43(2):379-82. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs242.

Although extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation is commonly used in infants and children, ventricular assist devices       (VAD) provide a longer duration of support with fewer complications before      recovery or as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx), as described herein.      METHODS: This retrospective chart review of eight patients transplanted from      April 2008 to December 2011, after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      implantation due to end-stage heart failure. Their mean age was 12 years (9-15 y)      and mean body weight, 48 kg (20-78). All were New York Heart Association      functional class IV with mean left ventricular ejection fractions less than 15\\\%.       RESULTS: The six patients (75\\\%) received HTx after a mean LVAD support duration      of 43.2 days; 2 (25\\\%) died before a suitable heart became available. Their mean      duration of LVAD support was 30 days. There were 4 (50\\\%) who experienced      clinically evident thromboembolic events: 3 (37.5\\\%) cerebrovascular with 1      mortality and 1 (12.5\\\%) as acute limb ischemia. Transient hemodialysis was      performed in 4 (50\\\%). Bloodstream infection identified in 6 (75\\\%) was controlled       with intravenous antibiotics. Driveline infection identified in 4 (50\\\%) was      treated successfully with local wound dressing changes and intravenous      antibiotics. One 9-year-old boy died of rejection at 16 months after      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the organ shortage, pediatric patients      have a low chance to undergo HTx. VAD provides long-term support for children      with end-stage heart failure before a suitable heart becomes available. A      thromboembolic event remains a major complication influencing their survival.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012.

We investigated the trends and outcomes      for cardiac transplantation in recipients aged 70 years and older in the United      States. METHODS: De-identified data were provided by United Network of Organ      Sharing. Transplant recipients were grouped by age 60-69 years and 70 years and      older. Univariate comparisons were performed using Student\\s t-test or the      Pearson chi-square test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique       and compared with the log-rank test. Cox regression was used to determine      predictors of death after transplant. Statistical significance was assigned to p       < 0.05. RESULTS: Between January 1, 1998, and June 15, 2010, 5,807 sexagenarians       and 332 septuagenarians received allografts. The septuagenarian cohort had more      men, less diabetes, was less likely to have a ventricular assist device, and more      likely to be status II. Donors for septuagenarians were older and died more      frequently from intracranial hemorrhage. Median unadjusted survival was 9.8 years      for sexagenarians vs 8.5 years for septuagenarians (p = 0.003). There was no      difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular accident, length of stay, or      pacemaker need between groups. Septuagenarians were less likely to be treated for      rejection the first year (p = 0.001). Age was a multivariate predictor of death      (hazard ratio, 1.289; 95\\\% confidence interval, 1.039-1.6; p = 0.021).      CONCLUSIONS: Selected septuagenarians with advanced heart failure can derive      great benefit from cardiac transplantation, although survival is inferior to that      of an immediately younger sexagenarian cohort. Most of the mortality risk is seen      in the first year after transplantation. A reduced incidence of rejection was      observed and warrants further study.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: Patients with left ventricular      assist devices (LVADs) are given 30 days of elective status 1A time. This      allowance may create competition for organs between stable LVAD-supported      registrants and less stable registrants listed status 1A or 1B. METHODS: The      Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for all status      1A and 1B listings between 2005 and 2010. Cox models were used to estimate the      relative and absolute risk of adverse events (death or delisting as too ill)      during status 1A or 1B listing. RESULTS: Status 1A registrants supported with      dual inotropes and right heart monitoring had a higher risk of adverse events      compared to those supported with implanted LVADs using elective 1A time (hazard      ratio: 3.2; 95\\\% confidence interval: 1.8 to 5.7). The 30-day risk of events was      1\\\% (95\\\% confidence interval: 0.1\\\% to 3\\\%) for implanted LVADs using elective 1A      time and 6\\\% (95\\\% confidence interval: 4\\\% to 8\\\%) for dual inotrope support.      Registrants listed with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices had a higher      risk of adverse events (hazard ratio: 9.1; p < 0.0001) compared with registrants       with implanted LVADs using elective 1A time. The odds of transplant were higher      for implanted LVADs (odds ratio: 1.5; p < 0.0001) compared with dual-inotrope and      intra-aortic balloon pump support. CONCLUSIONS: The historic allowance for 30      days of elective status 1A time for implanted LVADs creates disparities in risk      among status 1A registrants. The allowance of 30 days of elective status 1A time       should not be allocated to stable registrants with implanted LVADs. Registrants      supported with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices should be listed status      1A indefinitely.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Gastrointestinal (GI)      bleeding has been frequently reported within this population. METHODS: A      retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from      January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and      management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was      conducted to identify related risk factors. RESULTS: A significant incidence of      GI bleeding (22.8\\\%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93\\\%)       population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from       the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54\\\% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37\\\% from      ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35\\\% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI)      tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95\\\% CI, 2.2-228.6;      p=0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9;      p=0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were      independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in      older patients (mean, 70 years; p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60\\\%) rebled      from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding      anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide       did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates,      length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct       consequence of GI bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors account for GI bleeding      in patients on CF-VADs.

We used alternate approaches of       intra-aortic balloon pump insertion to provide temporary and minimally invasive      support for patients with decompensating, end-stage heart failure. The present      study describes the outcomes with closed-chest, transthoracic intra-aortic      balloon pumps by way of the subclavian artery. METHODS: During a 3-year period,      20 patients underwent subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump in the setting       of end-stage heart failure. The balloon was inserted through a      polytetrafluoroethylene graft sutured to the right subclavian artery in 19      patients (95\\\%) and to the left subclavian artery in 1 patient (5\\\%). The goal of      support was to bridge to transplantation in 17 patients (85\\\%) and bridge to      recovery in 3 patients (15\\\%). The primary outcome measure was death during      subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump support. The secondary outcomes      included survival to the intended endpoint of bridge to transplantation/bridge to      recovery, complications during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump      support (eg, stroke, limb ischemia, brachial plexus injury, dissection, bleeding       requiring reoperation, and device-related infection), emergent surgery for      worsening heart failure, and ambulation during intra-aortic balloon pump support.      RESULTS: The duration of balloon support ranged from 3 to 48 days (mean, 17.3 +/-      13.1 days). No patients died during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump      support. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70\\\%) were successfully bridged to transplant or       left ventricular-assist device. Two patients (10\\\%) required emergent left      ventricular-assist device for worsening heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: An      intra-aortic balloon pump inserted through the subclavian artery is a simple,      minimally invasive approach to mechanical support and is associated with limited       morbidity and facilitates ambulation in patients with end-stage heart failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed PICC      adverse events (AEs) and associated cost in 129 status 1B patients from 2005 to      2012. End points were HT, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and death.      Regression analysis was used to identify AE risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty-three      PICC AEs occurred in 35 patients (27\\\%), consisting of 48 infections, 4      thromboses, and 1 bleeding event. Median duration of PICC support was 63      (interquartile range [IQR] 34-131) days, and median time to first PICC infection       was 44 (IQR 14-76) days. Among PICC infections, 9\\\% required defibrillator removal      and 30\\\% were inactivated on the HT list for a mean of 23 +/- 17 days. Rate of HT,      LVAD, or death was similar between groups (P > .05). Regression analysis found      that a double lumen PICC was associated with a shorter time to first PICC      infection (hazard ratio 7.59, 95\\\% CI 1.97-29.23; P = .003). Median cost per PICC       infection was $10,704 (IQR $7,401-$26,083). CONCLUSIONS: PICC infections were the      most frequent AEs. PICCs with >1 lumen were associated with increased risk of      infection. PICC AEs accounted for increased intensive care unit admissions, HT      list inactivations, and overall cost.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) estimates liver function but can be      inaccurate in patients receiving oral anti-coagulation. We evaluated the effect      of liver dysfunction on outcomes after ventricular assist device (VAD)      implantation and the dynamic changes in liver dysfunction that occur during VAD      support. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 255 patients (147 with pulsatile      devices and 108 with continuous-flow devices) who received a long-term VAD      between 2000 and 2010. Liver dysfunction was estimated by MELD and MELD-eXcluding      INR (MELD-XI), with patients grouped by a score of >/= 17 or < 17. Primary      outcomes were on-VAD, after transplant, and overall survival. RESULTS: MELD and      MELD-XI correlated highly (R >/= 0.901, p < 0.0001) in patients not on oral      anti-coagulation. Patients with MELD or MELD-XI < 17 had improved on-VAD and      overall survival (p < 0.05) with a higher predictive power for MELD-XI. During      VAD support, cholestasis initially worsened but eventually improved. Patients      with pre-VAD liver dysfunction who survived to transplant had lower      post-transplant survival (p = 0.0193). However, if MELD-XI normalized during VAD       support, post-transplant survival improved and was similar to that of patients      with low MELD-XI scores. CONCLUSIONS: MELD-XI is a viable alternative for      assessing liver dysfunction in heart failure patients on oral anti-coagulation.      Liver dysfunction is associated with worse survival. However, if MELD-XI improves      during VAD support, post-transplant survival is similar to those without prior      liver dysfunction, suggesting an important prognostic role.

However, data on risk factors for early death in BTT      patients are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the United Network for      Organ Sharing database of all patients bridged to OHT with a HeartMate II from      January 2005 to December 2010. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day      mortality. Additional postoperative outcomes were cerebrovascular accident and      need for renal replacement therapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival.      Preoperative variables associated with 90-day death on univariate analysis      (p<0.2) were included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.      RESULTS: A HeartMate II was used to bridge 1,312 patients (average age, 52+/-12      years) to OHT, most commonly for idiopathic cardiomyopathy (50.7\\\%). During the      study, 171 patients (13.0\\\%) died. The unadjusted 90-day survival was 92.3\\\%. The      highest annual average center volume in this cohort, examining for BTT recipients      only, was 28 BTT procedures yearly. Postoperative cerebrovascular accident      occurred in 29 patients (2.2\\\%), and 106 (8.3\\\%) required renal replacement      therapy. Cox regression revealed age, glomerular filtration rate, African      American race, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, serum bilirubin, need for      mechanical ventilation, donor age, and prolonged ischemia time were associated      with 90-day death. Early survival was improved for patients who underwent OHT at       high-volume centers (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study examining risk factors for       early death in patients bridged to OHT using HeartMate II mechanical assistance      will aid in identifying patients best suited to benefit from this technology.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

Previous research has      demonstrated that insertion of the LVAD alone improves exercise capacity and      quality of life (QOL). This study investigated whether supervised exercise      training results in a further improvement. METHODS: This prospective, randomized       controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and      intention-to-treat analysis investigated the effect of exercise training on      exercise capacity and QOL in 14 patients who underwent LVAD insertion as a bridge      to heart transplantation. Exercise training consisted of 8 weeks of gym-based      aerobic and strengthening exercises 3 times a week, with a progressive      mobilization program, compared with the control group that completed mobilization      alone. Exercise capacity was measured before and after the intervention using      maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). QOL      was measured using the Short Form 36-item assessment. RESULTS: No adverse events       were reported. There was a trend toward greater improvement in peak oxygen      consumption (Vo(2)), 6MWD, and QOL in the exercise group (n = 7) compared with      the control group (n = 7); however, no significant between-group difference was      detected for improvements in peak Vo(2) [mean difference (exercise--control)] of       2.96 ml/kg/min (95\\\% confidence interval, -1.04 to 6.97), 6MWD at 54 meters (-51      to 159 meters), and QOL scores over time (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise      training is feasible and safe in patients with a LVAD. Trends toward greater      improvement in exercise capacity and QOL after exercise training warrant further       investigation in a larger trial.CI  - Crown Copyright (c) 2012.

We reviewed      our experience with the management of patients on continuous flow (CF) LVAD      support undergoing NCS. METHODS: From March 2006 through March 2011, 86 patients       with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of a HeartMate II (Thoratec      Corp, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD. Clinical records of these patients were reviewed to      identify patients who underwent NCS while on LVAD support, with a focus on      peri-operative death, bleeding, thrombosis, and device malfunction, as well as      management of pre-operative anti-coagulation. RESULTS: While on CF-LVAD support,       20 patients underwent 25 NCSs, comprising 13 major and 12 minor procedures.      Operations were performed electively in 22 and as emergencies in 3. No      peri-operative deaths, thromboembolic complications, or device malfunctions      occurred. The incidence of bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood      cells was 36.0\\\%, including 25\\\% of patients undergoing minor NCSs and 46.2\\\%      undergoing major NCSs (p = 0.004). All bleeding complications occurred in      patients on both warfarin and aspirin pre-operatively. The only significant      differences between patients who did and did not require transfusion were      pre-operative warfarin use and significantly higher pre-operative international      normalized ratio in the transfused group (1.9 +/- 0.4 vs 1.4 +/- 0.3; p = 0.008).      CONCLUSIONS: Non-cardiac operations can be performed safely in patients with      CF-LVADs. It may possible to reduce peri-operative bleeding by lowering      pre-operative anti-coagulation goals, especially before major surgery. However,      additional analysis is required to determine if this can be performed safely.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

However, significant rates of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)       have been observed during CF-LVAD support. METHODS: From March 2006 through March      2011, 86 patients with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD       (HeartMate II; Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Records were reviewed to      determine the prevalence of post-implant GIB, location of the bleeding site and      associated morbidity and mortality. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted      to identify independent predictors of GIB. RESULTS: GIB occurred in 19 patients      (22.1\\\%) with a duration of support that ranged from 5 to 456 days. Sources of GIB      included small bowel and rectum in 6 patients each, large bowel in 2 patients and      stomach in 1 patient. No definite source was identified in 4 patients. There were      no deaths referable to GIB. Recurrent GIB occurred in 4 patients. History of a      GIB prior to LVAD implant was the only variable significantly different between      patients with and without post-implant GIB (21.1\\\% vs 10.4\\\%, p = 0.016), and was      the only independent predictor of GIB (OR = 2.24, 95\\\% CI 2.121 to 2.435, p =      0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent source of morbidity       for patients on HeartMate II LVAD support but does not significantly impact      survival. As implantation of CF-LVADs with non-pulsatile flow gains popularity      for both bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy, a better understanding of       the pathophysiology of GIB in these patients will be needed for minimizing this      complication.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

BACKGROUND: PH is common in patients      with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) receiving CRT. The impact of PH      subtype on clinical outcome in CRT is unknown. METHODS: The study population      consisted of 101 patients (average age 66 +/- 13 years, left ventricular ejection      fraction 0.23 +/- 0.07, and New York Heart Association functional class 3.2 +/-      0.4) who underwent right heart catheterization in the 6 months before CRT. PH was      defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure >/=25 mm Hg; a significant      pre-capillary contribution to elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure was defined      as a transpulmonary gradient (TPG) >/=12 mm Hg. Clinical endpoints were assessed       at 2 years and included all-cause mortality and a composite of death, left      ventricular assist device, or cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with TPG      >/=12 mm Hg were more likely to experience all-cause mortality (hazard ratio      [HR]: 3.2; 95\\\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 7.4; p = 0.009) and the composite      outcome (HR: 3.0; 95\\\% CI: 1.4 to 6.3; p = 0.004) compared with patients with TPG       <12 mm Hg. After multivariate adjustment for hemodynamic, clinical, and      echocardiographic variables, only TPG >/=12 mm Hg and baseline right ventricular       (RV) dilation (RV end-diastolic dimension >42 mm) were associated with the      composite clinical outcome (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:      High TPG PH and RV dilation are independent predictors of adverse outcomes in      patients with LVSD who are receiving CRT. RV pulmonary vascular dysfunction may      be a therapeutic target in select patients receiving CRT.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by      Elsevier Inc.

Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory      Support (INTERMACS) profiles describe patient condition at pre-implant and      outcome. This study assessed the relationship among inflammation patterns and      INTERMACS profiles in LVAD recipients. METHOD: Thirty ESHF patients undergoing      LVAD implantation as bridge to transplant were enrolled. Blood and urine samples       were collected pre-operatively and serially up to 2 weeks post-operatively for      assessment of inflammatory markers (plasma levels of interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8,      IL-10, and osteopontin, a cardiac inflammatory-remodeling marker; and the urine      neopterin/creatinine ratio, a monocyte activation marker). Multiorgan function      was evaluated by the total sequential organ failure assessment (tSOFA) score.      Outcomes of interest were early survival, post-LVAD tSOFA score, and intensive      care unit (ICU) length of stay. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had INTERMACS profiles       1 or 2 (Group A), and 15 had profiles 3 or 4 (Group B). At pre-implant, only IL-6      levels and the IL-6/IL-10 ratio were higher in Group A vs B. After LVAD      implantation, neopterin/creatinine ratio and IL-8 levels increased more in Group       A vs B. Osteopontin levels increased significantly only in Group B. The tSOFA      score at 2 weeks post-LVAD and ICU duration were related with pre-implant IL-6      levels. CONCLUSIONS: The INTERMACS profiles reflect the severity of the      pre-operative inflammatory activation and the post-implant inflammatory response,      affecting post-operative tSOFA score and ICU stay. Therefore, inflammation may      contribute to poor outcome in patients with severe INTERMACS profile.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Outcomes of patients who underwent short-term ventricular assist device (STVAD)      implantation in a community hospital (CH) as a bridge to a long-term VAD (LTVAD)       were compared with those who received both implants at the same tertiary hospital      (TH). METHODS: Data were retrospectively reviewed for patients with a STVAD who      were bridged to a LTVAD in a TH from 1997 to 2010. We studied outcomes and      survival censored for cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients      (73\\\% male) were identified. Mean age was 52 +/- 16 years, 30\\\% were diabetic, and       65\\\% had intra-aortic balloon pump support. Reasons for STVAD implantation were an      acute myocardial infarction, 38\\\%; post-cardiotomy, 38\\\%, decompensated chronic      heart failure, 19\\\%; and others, 5\\\%. A STVAD was implanted in a CH in 20 patients       (54\\\%), and they had fewer cardiovascular risk factors than those whose STVAD was       implanted at the TH. All patients at the CH were at Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 1 compared with 71\\\% at the TH (p =      0.014). Patients from the CH tended to die sooner after LTVAD implant, although      long-term survival was similar. At the 1-year follow-up, 65\\\% from the CH were      alive or had received a transplant vs 60\\\% from the TH. CONCLUSION: Patients with       cardiogenic shock in whom a STVAD was implanted in a CH and then were bridged to       a LTVAD in a TH had similar long-term survival as those bridged to LTVAD at the      TH.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

In patients requiring a ventricular assist device (VAD), the       benefit from ICD therapy is not well established. The aim of this study was to      define the impact of ICD on outcomes in VAD-supported patients. METHODS AND      RESULTS: We reviewed data for consecutive adult HF patients receiving VAD as a      bridge to transplantation from 1996 to 2003. The primary outcome was survival to       transplantation. A total of 144 VADs were implanted [85 left ventricular (LVAD),       59 biventricular (BIVAD), mean age 50 +/- 12 years, 77\\\% male, left ventricular      ejection fraction 18 +/- 9\\\%, 54\\\% ischemic]. Mean length of support was 119 days      (range 1-670); 103 patients (72\\\%) survived to transplantation. Forty-five      patients had an ICD (33 LVAD, 12 BIVAD). More LVAD patients had an appropriate      ICD shock before implantation than after (16 vs 7; P = .02). There was a trend      toward higher shock frequency before LVAD implant than after (3.3 +/- 5.2 vs 1.1       +/- 3.8 shocks/y; P = .06). Mean time to first shock after VAD implant was 129      +/- 109 days. LVAD-supported patients with an ICD were significantly more likely       to survive to transplantation [1-y actuarial survival to transplantation: LVAD:      91\\\% with ICD vs 57\\\% without ICD (log-rank P = .01); BIVAD: 54\\\% vs 47\\\% (log-rank P      = NS)]. An ICD was associated with significantly increased survival in a      multivariate model controlling for confounding variables (odds ratio 2.54, 95\\\%      confidence interval 1.04-6.21; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Shock frequency decreases      after VAD implantation, likely owing to ventricular unloading, but appropriate      ICD shocks still occur in 21\\\% of patients. An ICD is associated with improved      survival in LVAD-supported HF patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Despite a      thorough search in that study, no mitoses explaining a potential net increase of       cardiomyocytes has been observed. The heart harbors several stem cell      populations, including c-kit (CD117)(+) stem cells and side population cells      (SPC), which may proliferate after unloading and thus contribute to the      generation of diploid cardiomyocytes. In this study we sought to determine,      whether there is an increase of ABCG2(+) SPC and CD117(+) stem cells after      unloading. METHODS: In paired myocardial samples (prior to and after LVAD), the      number of cells with immunoexpression of ABCG2, c-kit/CD117 and MEF-2 was      assessed by immunohistochemistry. Their number was morphometrically determined      and these data were correlated with the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. RESULTS:       A significant increase of SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2      after unloading was observed from 0.00013\\\% in CHF to 0.0011\\\%, and 0.013\\\% to      0.035\\\%, respectively after unloading (p = 0.001). A significant positive      correlation between both SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2      expression was observed (p = 0.007 and 0.01). No correlation was found between      the number of SPC and the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. CONCLUSIONS: SPC are      increased significantly in the myocardium after ventricular unloading, suggesting      a role for stem cell proliferation during \\\"reverse cardiac remodeling.\\\" These      cells might proliferate and commit to different cell lineages, such as      cardiomyocytes or endothelium, and thus ameliorate cardiac function.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We report our single-center experience with      mechanical circulatory support therapy. METHODS: From March 2002 to December      2012, 107 adult patients (mean age, 56.8 +/- 9.9 y; range, 31-76 y) were primarly      supported on temporary or long-term VAD or TAH support as treatment for      refractory heart failure at our institution. Temporary extracorporeal radial VAD       support (group A) was established in 49 patients (45.7\\\%), and long-term      paracorporeal and intracorporeal VAD or TAH (group B) in 58 patients (54.2\\\%).      Left ventricular (LVAD) support was established in 55 patients (51.4\\\%; n = 33,      Heartmate II; n = 6, Heartmate I XVE; n = 4, Heartware HVAD; and n = 12,      Centrimag) and biventricular (BVAD/TAH) support (group B) in 28 patients (26.1\\\%;       n = 10, Thoratec paracorporeal; n = 2, Heartware HVAD, n = 1, Thoratec      implantable; n = 1, Syncardia TAH; and n = 14, Centrimag). The temporary      Centrimag was the only device adopted as isolated right ventricular (RVAD)      support, and it was inserted in 24 patients (22.4\\\%). RESULTS: In group A, overall      mean support time was 10.2 +/- 6.6 days (range, 3-43 d). In group B, LVAD mean      support time was 357 +/- 352.3 days (range, 1-902 d) and BVAD/TAH support time      was 98 +/- 82.6 days (range, 8-832 d). In group A, the overall success rate was      55.1\\\% (27 patients). In group B, LVAD overall success rate was 74.4\\\% (32      patients) and BVAD/TAH success rate was 50\\\% (7 patients). Overall heart      transplantation rate for both groups was 27.1\\\% (n = 2, group A; n = 27, group B).      Overall 1-year and 5-year survivals after heart transplantation were 72.4\\\% (n =      21) and 58.6\\\% (n = 17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical circulatory support      is an effective strategy even in cases of end-stage heart failure according to      our experience. Further improvement of VAD and TAH technologies may support their      adoption as an encouraging alternative to heart transplantation in the near      future.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Mechanical circulatory support is a promising therapy as both a bridge       to transplantation and destination therapy. Elderly patients are frequently      ineligible for heart transplantation because of their age and comorbidities, and       the application of mechanical circulatory support for destination therapy in this      population is not well defined. A review of the literature was undertaken to      better characterize our experience to date with mechanical circulatory support in      older heart failure populations. Mechanical circulatory support is being employed      increasingly for destination therapy indications in older patients. The newer      continuous flow devices appear to have disproportionate advantage in elderly      patients, which has translated into marked improvement in 1- and 2-year survival.      The rational implementation of MCS devices in elderly heart failure patients      needs to focus on (1) continuous flow devices that appear to have particular      benefit in this population, (2) extensive pre-MCS assessment including variables       relating to frailty, and (3) intervening before these patients develop      cardiogenic shock.

Quality of life (QoL) has      not been systematically evaluated in children bridged to heart transplant.      METHODS: All children transplanted for cardiomyopathy during 2001 to 2008 and      currently being followed at our center (n = 84) had QoL assessed during 2006 to      2009, at a median of 3 years post-transplant, using a validated generic measure      (PedsQL4.0). RESULTS: Twenty-six children, aged 2.7 to 18 (median 7.4) years who       were bridged to transplant, were compared with 58 children, aged 2.0 to 18.0      (median 13.0) years, who were transplanted in the same era without bridging.      There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any domains of QoL       assessed by children or parents, although the small number of bridged patients      increases the likelihood of a Type II error. Bridged children who were younger (r      = 0.48, p = 0.02) or more recently transplanted (r = 0.42, p = 0.04) were scored       by their parents as having poorer emotional QoL. Regression analysis indicated      that age at transplant was the only medical or demographic variable associated      with parent-reported total QoL scores (beta = 0.27, p = 0.01). With few links      between QoL scores and medical or demographic factors, other subjective      psychologic factors may be of greater salience in determining QoL. CONCLUSIONS:      Despite greater severity of illness, children who required mechanical bridging to      transplantation report a QoL comparable to that of other children undergoing      heart transplantation. Younger children may require greater psychologic support      to reach their full potential in terms of QoL.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

In this study, pump speed modulation algorithms      for generating pulsatility and variation in ventricular end-systolic and      end-diastolic volumes were investigated in an ischemic heart failure (IHF) bovine      model (n = 10) using a clinically implanted centrifugal-flow left ventricular      assist device (LVAD). METHODS: Hemodynamic and hematologic measurements were      recorded during IHF baseline, constant pumps speeds, and asynchronous (19-60      cycles/min) and synchronous (copulse and counterpulse) pump speed modulation      profiles using low relative pulse speed (+/-25\\\%) of 3,200 +/- 800 rpm and high      relative pulse speed (+/-38\\\%) of 2,900 +/- 1,100 rpm. End-organ perfusion,      hemodynamics, and pump parameters were measured to characterize pulsatility,      myocardial workload, and LVAD performance for each speed modulation profile.      RESULTS: Speed modulation profiles augmented aortic pulse pressure, surplus      hemodynamic energy, and end-organ perfusion (p < 0.01) compared with operation at      constant speed. Left ventricular external work and myocardial oxygen consumption       were significantly reduced compared with IHF baseline (p < 0.01) but at the      expense of higher LVAD power consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Pump speed modulation      increases pulsatility and improves cardiac function and end-organ perfusion, but       the asynchronous mode provides the technologic advantage of sensorless control.      Investigation of asynchronous pump speed modulation during long-term support is      warranted to test the hypothesis that operating an LVAD with speed modulation      will minimize adverse events in patients supported by an LVAD that may be      associated with long-term operation at a constant pump speed.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We present data comparing results after      implantation of HeartMate II (HM II) versus HVAD (HW) left ventricular assist      devices (LVADs) for the past 7 years at our institution. METHODS: From July 2006       to August 2012, 121 consecutive patients underwent LVAD implantation: 70 (57.9\\\%)       received HM II and 51 (42.1\\\%) HW. Patient demographics, perioperative      characteristics, and laboratory parameters as well as postoperative outcome were       compared retrospectively. RESULTS: Patients in the HM II group were significantly      younger (P < .01), with more deranged liver function (higher bilirubin [P = .02]       and alanine aminotransferase [P = .01] levels), and had a significantly higher      rate of preoperative infections requiring antibiotic treatment (P = .02) and a      higher body core temperature (P < .01). Other demographic and preoperative      parameters did not show statistical differences. Most postoperative      characteristics were also similar between the two groups. HM II patients had a      significantly higher transfusion rate, but there were no differences in incidence      of resternotomy (P = .156). Recovery and VAD explantation were more likely in the      HM II group (P = .02). Although there was no significant difference in survival      (log rank test: P = .986; Breslow test: P = .827), HM II patients were more      likely to develop a percutaneous site infection (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both HM      II and HW provide similar early postoperative outcome and good long-term      survival. The differences observed between the groups may be related to      demographic and preoperative factors rather than the type of the device used.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is therefore      important to identify patients at risk a priori. However, prognostic models      derived from multivariate analyses have had limited predictive power. METHODS:      This study retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 LVAD recipients between      May 1996 and October 2009; of these, 27 later required a RVAD (RVAD(+)) and 156      remained on LVAD only (RVAD(-)) until transplant or death. A decision tree model       was constructed to represent combinatorial non-linear relationships of the      pre-operative data that are predictive of the need for RVAD support. RESULTS: An       optimal set of 8 pre-operative variables were identified: transpulmonary      gradient, age, right atrial pressure, international normalized ratio, heart rate,      white blood cell count, alanine aminotransferase, and the number of inotropic      agents. The resultant decision tree, which consisted of 28 branches and 15      leaves, identified RVAD(+) patients with 85\\\% sensitivity, RVAD(-) patients with      83\\\% specificity, and exhibited an area under the receiver operating      characteristic curve of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: The decision tree model developed in      this study exhibited several advantages compared with existing risk scores.      Quantitatively, it provided improved prognosis of RV support by encoding the      non-linear, synergic interactions among pre-operative variables. Because of its      intuitive structure, it more closely mimics clinical reasoning and therefore can       be more readily interpreted. Further development with additional multicenter,      longitudinal data may provide a valuable prognostic tool for triage of LVAD      therapy and, potentially, improve outcomes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

This study      documented changes in cognitive performance in DT patients from that trial to      determine if there were differences between continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow      support. METHODS: Data were collected in a sub-study from 96 HeartMate II      continuous-flow and 30 HeartMate XVE pulsatile-flow LVAD patients from 12 of the       35 trial sites that followed the same serial neurocognitive (NC) testing protocol      at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after LVAD implantation. Spatial perception,      memory, language, executive functions, and processing speed were the domains      assessed with 10 standard cognitive measures. Differences over time and between      LVAD type were evaluated with linear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: From 1 to      24 months after LVAD implantation, changes in NC functions were stable or showed       improvement in all domains, and there were no differences between the      continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow groups. Data at 24 months were only available       from patients with the continuous-flow LVAD due to the limited durability of the       HeartMate XVE device. There was no decline in any NC domain over the time of LVAD      support. Missing data not collected from patients who died could have resulted in      a bias toward inflated study results. CONCLUSIONS: The NC performance of advanced      heart failure patients supported with continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow LVADs      shows stabilization or improvement during support for up to 24 months.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

METHODS: Thirty of 657 patients with end-stage heart failure supported with      continuous-flow LVADs were assessed for device explantation. Each patient      underwent an individualized process of weaning focused on principles of      ventricular unloading, gradual reconditioning, and transition to medical therapy.      RESULTS: After varying reconditioning periods, 27 patients (16 men, 11 women;      age, 39 +/- 12 years) underwent LVAD explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman;      age, 22 +/- 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. The      duration of LVAD support was 533 +/- 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for the      explant cohort and 1,097 +/- 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explant      cohort. The LV end-diastolic dimension, LV ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary       artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort were      significantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). Two late deaths occurred       after LVAD explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1      patient required resumption of LVAD support 2.7 years after device removal. The      remaining explant patients remain in New York Heart Association classes I to II      with medical management alone (mean survival post-explant, 1,172 +/- 948 days).      The 3 candidates who could not be weaned ultimately underwent transplantation.      CONCLUSIONS: The potential for recovery of native LV function after long-term      continuous-flow LVAD support should encourage a more aggressive approach to      ventricular reconditioning with the goal of device explantation and a return to      medical management, particularly in young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

     age, 39 +/- 12 years) underwent lvad explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman;      age, 22 +/- 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. the      duration of lvad support was 533 +/- 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for the      explant cohort and 1,097 +/- 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explant      cohort. the lv end-diastolic dimension, lv ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary       artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort were      significantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). two late deaths occurred       after lvad explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1      patient required resumption of lvad support 2.7 years after device removal. the      remaining explant patients remain in new york heart association classes i to ii      with medical management alone (mean survival post-explant, 1,172 +/- 948 days).      the 3 candidates who could not be weaned ultimately underwent transplantation.      conclusions: the potential for recovery of native lv function after long-term      continuous-flow lvad support should encourage a more aggressive approach to      ventricular reconditioning with the goal of device explantation and a return to      medical management, particularly in young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 international society for heart and lung transplantation.      published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.fau - frazier, o hau  - frazier ohad  - department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac support,      texas heart institute, houston, texas. electronic address:      ischwenke@texasheart.org.fau - baldwin, andrew c wau  - baldwin acad  - department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac support,      texas heart institute, houston, texas.fau - demirozu, zumrut tau  - demirozu ztad  - department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac support,      texas heart institute, houston, texas.fau - segura, ana mariaau  - segura amad  - department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac support,      texas heart institute, houston, texas.fau - hernandez, rubenau  - hernandez rad  - department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac support,      texas heart institute, houston, texas.fau - taegtmeyer, heinrichau  - taegtmeyer had  - department of internal medicine, division of cardiology, the university of texas       medical school at houston, houston, texas.fau - mallidi, hariau  - mallidi had  - department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac support,      texas heart institute, houston, texas.fau - cohn, william eau  - cohn wead  - department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac support,      texas heart institute, houston, texas.la  - enggr  - r01 hl061483/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statespt  - journal articledep - 20140928ta  - j heart lung transplantjt  - the journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the      international society for heart transplantationjid - 9102703pmc - pmc4388806mid - nihms674763oto - notnlmot  - heart failureot  - left ventricular assist device (lvad)ot  - ventricular reconditioningot  - ventricular recoveryot  - ventricular unloadingedat- 2014/12/03 06:00mhda- 2014/12/03 06:00crdt- 2014/12/03 06:00pmcr- 2016/03/28 00:00phst- 2012/06/20 [received]phst- 2014/08/05 [revised]phst- 2014/09/19 [accepted]aid - s1053-2498(14)01350-3 [pii]aid - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.09.015 [doi]pst - aheadofprintso  - j heart lung transplant. 2014 sep 28. pii: s1053-2498(14)01350-3. doi:      10.1016/j.healun.2014.09.015.',surgery

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight patients (4 male, 4 female) with Toyobo paracorporeal       LVAD underwent conversion to the third-generation centrifugal (DuraHeart) LVAD.      The apical cuff of the Toyobo was not exchanged because the size was the same as       that of the DuraHeart. All conversion operations were performed safely, but 3      patients who had infection of the Toyobo LVAD cannulation site prior to      conversion suffered later pocket infections and 1 patient died because of sepsis.      One patient underwent heart transplantation and 6 of 8 patients were awaiting      heart transplantation at home. CONCLUSIONS: Conversions from the Toyobo LVAD to      the DuraHeart LVAD were performed safely. Considering that implantable LVADs      provide superior long-term survival and quality of life, conversion is a      reasonable decision for Toyobo LVAD users in whom there are no infections.FAU - Yoshioka, DaisukeAU  - Yoshioka DAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Osaka University      Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.FAU - Sakaguchi, TaichiAU  - Sakaguchi TFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Miyagawa, ShigeruAU  - Miyagawa SFAU - Nishi, HiroyukiAU  - Nishi HFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Fukushima, SatsukiAU  - Fukushima SFAU - Ueno, TakayoshiAU  - Ueno TFAU - Kuratani, ToruAU  - Kuratani TFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20111127PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/microbiology/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureusMH  - *Prosthesis DesignMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/microbiology/*mortalityMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sepsis/mortalityMH  - Staphylococcal Infections/mortalityMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - *Waiting ListsEDAT- 2011/11/30 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/30 06:00CRDT- 2011/11/30 06:00PHST- 2011/11/27 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-11-0833 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2012;76(2):372-6.

METHODS: Between April 2004 and September 2013,       192 patients underwent HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) CF-LVAD placement       as a bridge to transplant at our center. Of these, 122 (63\\\%) successfully bridged      patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups      according to their waiting time with CF-LVAD support of <1 year or >/=1 year.      RESULTS: The study cohort was a mean age of 54 +/- 13 years, 79\\\% were male, and      35\\\% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of CF-LVAD support before      transplantation was 296 days (range, 27-1,413 days). The overall 30-day mortality      was 4.1\\\%. Overall post-transplant survival was 88\\\%, 84\\\%, 78\\\% at 1, 3, and 5      years, respectively. The 32 patients (26\\\%) with >/=1 year of CF-LVAD support      (mean, 635 days) were more likely to have blood type O, a larger body size, and      to have been readmitted due to recurrent heart failure and device failure      requiring exchange than those with <1 year of CF-LVAD support. Patients who      required prolonged support time also had worse in-hospital mortality (16\\\% vs      6.7\\\%, p = 0.12) and significantly lower survival at 3 years after transplantation      (68\\\% vs 88\\\%, p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: The overall short-term and long-term      cardiac transplant outcomes of patients supported with CF-LVAD are satisfactory.       However, patients who require prolonged CF-LVAD support may have diminished      post-transplant survival due to adverse events occurring during device support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015.

The association      between ECM turnover and right ventricular failure (RVF) development after left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in patients with advanced heart      failure (HF) was investigated. METHODS: Circulating levels of osteopontin,      metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MPP-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and      TIMP-4 were measured in 61 patients at LVAD implantation and explantation and in       10 control subjects. RVF was defined as the need for RVAD, nitric oxide      inhalation > 48 hours and/or inotropic support > 14 days. RESULTS: All ECM      markers were elevated in patients with HF compared with controls (all p < 0.05).       RVF developed in 23 patients (37.7\\\%) on LVAD support. All ECM markers decreased      on LVAD support in patients without RVF (all p < 0.05), but serum MMP-2, TIMP-1,       TIMP-4, and osteopontin remained elevated in RVF patients. Multivariate analysis       identified that right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI), circulating B-type      natriuretic peptide, and osteopontin were associated with RVF (all p < 0.05).      Osteopontin correlated inversely with RVSWI (r = -0.44, p < 0.001). Osteopontin      levels > 260 ng/ml discriminate patients who develop RVF from those without RVF      (sensitivity, 83\\\%; specificity, 82\\\%). CONCLUSIONS: Marked elevation of      osteopontin levels before LVAD placement is associated with RVF development.      Persistent elevation of circulating ECM markers after LVAD implantation      characterizes patients who develop RVF. These novel biomarkers would have a      potential role in the prediction of RVF development in patients undergoing LVAD      implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The aim of this study is to report the outcomes in patients receiving      the HeartMate II LVAD at a single center and review the lessons learned from this      experience. METHODS: From June 2005 to June 2010, 130 consecutive patients      received the HeartMate II LVAD. Of these, 102 were bridge-to-transplant (BTT), 17      destination therapy, and 11 exchanges for failed HeartMate XVE. This study      focuses on the 102 BTT patients. The HeartMate II was approved by the US Food and      Drug Administration (FDA) as BTT in April 2008 and 64 patients received this      device as BTT since that date. We review our experience with the device as BTT      and report on patient survival and adverse events as well as the impact of FDA      approval on outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, mean age was 52.6 +/- 12.8 years; 26      (25.5\\\%) were female. Disease etiology was ischemic in 58, nonischemic in 36, and       other in 8. Overall, 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year survival for the BTT patients      was 95.1\\\%, 83.5\\\%, and 78.8\\\%, respectively. The 6-month survival in 38 patients in      the clinical trial (pre-FDA) was 88.8\\\% and was not statistically significant      compared with the 76.2\\\% 6-month survival in the 64 patients in the post-FDA      approval period (p value = 0.1). Major adverse events among the 102 BTT patients       included right ventricular failure in 5 (4.9\\\%), LVAD driveline infections in 25      (24.5\\\%), neurologic events in 10 (9.8\\\%), and gastrointestinal bleeding in 18      (17.6\\\%) patients. In addition, 1 patient (0.98\\\%) had pump thrombus requiring      device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant morbidity, use of the      HeartMate II LVAD as BTT provides excellent hemodynamic support and is associated      with excellent survival and low mortality. In addition, there needs to be      improvement and focused strategies in the areas of gastrointestinal bleeding,      driveline infections, and adverse neurologic events for these devices to be able       to provide a real long-term alternative to heart transplantation.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

We evaluated renal function and      intrarenal blood flow in five advanced heart failure patients who had been      supported with a Toyobo LVAS for bridge to heart transplantation. Renal function       expressed as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the      modified formula of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease. Mean blood velocities       in the bilateral segmental arteries during systolic and diastolic perfusion were       measured using duplex Doppler sonography, and renal vascular resistance      (resistive index [RI]) of the segmental arteries was defined as (peak systolic      velocity [PSV]-end-diastolic velocity [EDV])/PSV. All studies were performed      before and after implantation (mean duration of support, 15.6+/-10.9 months).      LVAS implantation significantly improved eGFR (42.7+/-7.9 to 64.1+/-16.3mL/min,      P<0.05). Beat-by-beat measurements of heart rate did not change significantly.      Mean PSV decreased significantly (38.2+/-8.9 to 28.3+/-2.2cm/s, P<0.05), and mean      EDV increased significantly (8.3+/-3.2 to 11.3+/-1.3cm/s, P<0.05), and thus, mean      RI was significantly improved (0.79+/-0.06 to 0.60+/-0.04, P<0.01). In      conclusion, in advanced heart failure patients, pulsatile LVAS implantation is      associated with improved renal function, and this improvement may be mediated in       part through an improvement of intrarenal hemodynamics.CI  - (c) 2011, Copyright the Authors.

Pre-operative and post-operative      factors associated with NCs in patients with LVADs were investigated. METHODS: We      reviewed 307 consecutive patients undergoing LVAD surgery (167 HeartMate I and      140 HeartMate II devices) at Columbia University Medical Center between November       2000 and December 2010. Clinical characteristics and hemodynamic and laboratory      indexes were analyzed. NC was defined according to the Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support definition of neurologic dysfunction,      including transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic or hemorrhagic      cerebrovascular accident (CVA). RESULTS: NCs developed in 43 patients (14.0\\\%) at       91.8 +/- 116.3 days post-operatively. The frequency of NC development was similar      in HeartMate I and II patients. Patients with NC showed a higher frequency of      pre-LVAD CVA history (27.9\\\% vs 15.5\\\%, p = 0.046), lower pre-operative sodium      (129.0 +/- 7.0 vs 132.1 +/- 8.1 mg/dl, p = 0.018) and albumin concentrations (3.5      +/- 0.7 vs 3.7 +/- 0.6 mg/dl, p = 0.049), lower post-operative hematocrit (34.9\\\%       +/- 5.1\\\% vs 37.8\\\% +/- 6.1\\\%, p = 0.0034), sodium (131.6 +/- 7.7 vs 134.4 +/- 6.4      mg/dl, p = 0.010) and albumin concentrations (3.7 +/- 0.5 vs 3.9 +/- 0.5 mg/dl, p      = 0.0016), and higher frequency of post-operative infection (39.5\\\% vs 19.3\\\%, p =       0.003) than those without NC. Multiple regression analysis revealed that CVA      history (odds ratio, 2.37, 95\\\% confidence interval, 1.24-5.29; p = 0.011) and      post-operative infection (odds ratio, 2.99, 95\\\% confidence interval, 1.16-10.49;       p = 0.011) were highly associated with NC development. The combination of CVA      history, pre-operative and post-operative sodium and albumin, and post-operative       hematocrit and infection could discriminate patients developing NCs with a      probability of 76.6\\\%. CONCLUSIONS: Previous stroke, persistent malnutrition and      inflammation, severity of heart failure, and post-LVAD infections are key factors      associated with development of NCs after LVAD implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

At      baseline, LVAD, HT, and HF patients demonstrated low physical activity, reaching       only 15\\\%, 28\\\%, and 51\\\% of that of healthy subjects (1,603 +/- 302 vs 3,036 +/-      439 vs 5,490 +/- 1,058 vs 10,756 +/- 568 steps/day, respectively, p <0.01). This       was associated with reduced energy expenditure and increased sedentary time (p      <0.01). Baseline QoL was not different among LVAD, HT, and HF groups (p = 0.44).       LVAD implantation and HT significantly increased daily physical activity by 60\\\%      and 52\\\%, respectively, from baseline to 3 months (p <0.05), but the level of      activity remained unchanged at 3, 6, and 12 months. The QoL improved from      baseline to 3 months in LVAD implantation and HT groups (p <0.01) but remained      unchanged afterward. At any time point, HT demonstrated higher activity level      than LVAD implantation (p <0.05), and this was associated with better QoL. In      contrast, physical activity and QoL decreased at 12 months in patients with HF (p      <0.05). In conclusion, patients in LVAD and HT patients demonstrate improved      physical activity and QoL within the first 3 months after surgery, but physical      activity and QoL remain unchanged afterward and well below that of healthy      subjects. Strategies targeting low levels of physical activity should now be      explored to improve recovery of these patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The two main reasons for this       development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTX). Furthermore, the      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term      patient outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist      device (LVAD) implantation at our Erlangen Heart Center during January 2000-July       2013. The main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. From all patients, we created a      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and      described the overall outcome. RESULTS: VAD implantation was performed in 266      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2\\\% of the total of 12254 cardiac      surgical operations in that period). From these patients, 223 underwent LVAD or      biventricular (BVAD) implantation; the remaining received a right (RVAD)      implantation. The most frequent underlying clinical diagnoses were dilated (n =      84, 37.7\\\%, DCM) or ischemic (n = 61, 27.4\\\%, ICM) cardiomyopathy. The pathological      findings in the apex biopsy were generally non-specific and showed variable      interstitial myocardial fibrosis with evidence of fibre loss, fatty degeneration       and variable irregular atrophy of muscle fibres, consistent with dilated and      ischemic cardiomyopathies as the most frequent causes of heart failure in these      patients. Only a few cases showed other specific features such as myocarditis and      AL-amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during      LVAD implantation are rather non-specific and they generally reflect the late      stage or consequences of chronic myocardial damage in cases of dilated or      ischemic cardiomyopathies. Variable patchy chronic inflammatory changes may be      observed in cardiomyopathies as a non-specific reaction caused by myocardial      fiber damage and should not lead to misinterpretation as evidence of myocarditis       or revision of original diagnosis.FAU - Strecker, ThomasAU  - Strecker TAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.FAU - Rosch, JohannesAU  - Rosch JAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.FAU - Weyand, MichaelAU  - Weyand MAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.FAU - Agaimy, AbbasAU  - Agaimy AAD  - Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\\tDEP - 20140815PL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Clin Exp PatholJT  - International journal of clinical and experimental pathologyJID - 101480565SB  - IMPMC - PMC4203167OID - NLM: PMC4203167OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)OT  - apex pathologyOT  - dilatative cardiomyopathyOT  - ischemic cardiomyopathyOT  - myocarditisEDAT- 2014/10/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/23 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/23 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/07/10 [received]PHST- 2014/08/21 [accepted]PHST- 2014/08/15 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Aug 15;7(9):5549-56. eCollection 2014.- 25337196own - nlmstat- in-processda  - 20141022is  - 1936-2625 (electronic)is  - 1936-2625 (linking)vi  - 7ip  - 9dp  - 2014ti  - pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during implantation of left      ventricular assist devices (lvad) are non-specific: 13-year-experience at a      german heart center.pg  - 5549-56ab  - background and aim: ventricular assist devices (vad) have become an established      therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. the two main reasons for this       development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (htx). furthermore, the      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term      patient outcomes. methods: we reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist      device (lvad) implantation at our erlangen heart center during january 2000-july       2013. the main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. from all patients, we created a      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and      described the overall outcome. results: vad implantation was performed in 266      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2\\\% of the total of 12254 cardiac      surgical operations in that period). from these patients, 223 underwent lvad or      biventricular (bvad) implantation;

However, little is known about how exercise capacity changes after LVAD and how      changes compare with patients undergoing heart transplantation. METHODS AND      RESULTS: We compared changes in cardiopulmonary exercise testing performed pre-      and postoperatively in patients who underwent HeartMate II LVAD implantation (n =      25) and heart transplantation (n = 74) at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,      Minnesota, between 2007 and 2012. Preoperatively, patients undergoing LVAD and      transplant had markedly reduced exercise time (mean 5.1 minutes [45\\\% predicted]      and 5.0 minutes [44\\\% predicted], respectively), low peak oxygen consumption (VO2;      mean 11.5 mL . kg . min [43\\\% predicted] and 11.9 mL . kg . min [38\\\% predicted]),       and abnormal ventilatory gas exchange (ratio of minute ventilation to carbon      dioxide production [VE/VCO2] nadir 39.4 and 37.4). After LVAD and transplant,      there were similar improvements in exercise time (mean Delta +1.2 vs. 1.7      minutes, respectively, P = .27) and VE/VCO2 nadir (mean Delta -3.7 vs. -4.2, P =       .74). However, peak VO2 increased posttransplant but did not change post-LVAD      (mean Delta +5.4 vs. +0.9 mL . kg . min, respectively, P < .001). Most patients      (72\\\%) had a peak VO2 < 14 mL . kg . min post-LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Although      improvements in exercise capacity and gas exchange are seen after LVAD and heart       transplant, peak VO2 doesn\\t improve post-LVAD and remains markedly abnormal in      most patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, inotropes are considered to be harmful in nonischemic HF.      METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the association of in-hospital inotrope use with      (1) major events (death, ventricular assist device, or heart transplant) and (2)       study days alive and out of hospital during the first 6 months in the Evaluation       Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization      Effectiveness, which excluded patients with immediate need for inotropic therapy.      Predefined subgroups of interest were baseline SBP <100 versus >/= 100 mm Hg,      cardiac index <1.8 vs >/= 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2), and ischemic versus nonischemic HF      etiology. Inotropes were frequently used in both the <100 mm Hg (88/165 [53.3\\\%])       and the >/= 100 mm Hg (106/262 [40.5\\\%]) SBP subgroups and were associated with      higher risk for major events in both subgroups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.85,       95\\\% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-5.12 [P < .001]; and HR 1.86, 95\\\% CI 1.02-3.37       [P = .042]; respectively). Risk with inotropes was more pronounced among those      with cardiac index >/= 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 114; HR 4.65, 95\\\% CI 1.98-10.9; P      < .001) vs <1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 82; HR 1.48, 95\\\% CI 0.61-3.58; P = .39).      Event rates were higher with inotropes in both ischemic (n = 215; HR 2.64, 95\\\% CI      1.49-4.68; P = .001) and nonischemic (n = 216; HR 2.19, 95\\\% CI 1.18-4.07; P =      .012) patients. Across all subgroups, patients who received inotropes spent fewer      study days alive and out of hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of cardiogenic       shock or end-organ hypoperfusion, inotrope use during hospitalization for HF was       associated with unfavorable 6-month outcomes, regardless of admission SBP,      cardiac index, or HF etiology.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the      efficacy of the PACT to assess psychosocial outcomes in LVAD patients. METHODS:      We reviewed patients who received LVAD implants between June 2006 and April 2011       and retrospectively applied the PACT. We determined the accuracy of identifying      social success with the PACT and revised domains to reflect criteria influencing       social success for LVAD patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (72\\\% men, 44\\\%      non-white, 50.4 years old) were divided into high-scoring and low-scoring groups.      Nine patients with low PACT scores were falsely categorized as high-risk, whereas      4 with high scores had poor social outcomes. The score had a high      positive-predictive value (0.86) but low negative-predictive value (0.31). The      PACT was revised (modified [m]PACT) to measure indicators, such as social support      and understanding of care requirements, identified to more closely affect LVAD      outcome. The mPACT exhibited improved accuracy. A reclassification table was      developed, and the net reclassification index was 0.32. The percentage of      patients incorrectly classified for social risk decreased from 27\\\% with the PACT       to 8\\\% with the mPACT. Patients with higher mPACT scores had decreased 30-day      readmission rates (26\\\% vs 67\\\%, p = 0.045) after device implantation. CONCLUSIONS:      By emphasizing social support, psychologic health, lifestyle factors, and device       understanding, the mPACT showed improved performance in risk-stratifying      candidates for LVAD therapy.

The purpose of this study was to      evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD in      end-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in the      Netherlands. METHODS: A third-generation LVAD was implanted in 16 heart failure      patients (age 61 +/- 8; 81 \\\% male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20 +/- 6 \\\%)      as destination therapy. All patients were ineligible for heart transplant. At      baseline, 3 and 6 months, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class,      quality-of-life and exercise capacity were assessed. Clinical adverse events were      registered. RESULTS: Survival at 30 days and 6 months was 88 and 75 \\\%,      respectively. In the postoperative phase, 6 (38 \\\%) patients required continuous      veno-venous haemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13 \\\%) patients required      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure.       During follow-up, NYHA functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7 +/-      0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 57 +/- 5 to 23 +/- 3 at 6 months (P < 0.001),      respectively. The 6 min walking distance improved from 168 +/- 42 m to 291 +/- 29      m at 6 months (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD therapy is a      promising treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for      heart transplant.FAU - Haeck, M L AAU  - Haeck MLAD  - Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Albinusdreef 2, 2333       ZA, Leiden, the Netherlands.FAU - Beeres, S L M AAU  - Beeres SLFAU - Hoke, UAU  - Hoke UFAU - Palmen, MAU  - Palmen MFAU - Couperus, L EAU  - Couperus LEFAU - Delgado, VAU  - Delgado VFAU - Logeman, E AAU  - Logeman EAFAU - Maas, J JAU  - Maas JJFAU - Klautz, R J MAU  - Klautz RJFAU - Schalij, M JAU  - Schalij MJFAU - Verwey, H FAU  - Verwey HFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NetherlandsTA  - Neth Heart JJT  - Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of      Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart FoundationJID - 101095458PMC - PMC4315784OID - NLM: PMC4315784EDAT- 2014/10/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/03 06:01CRDT- 2014/10/03 06:00AID - 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Neth Heart J. 2015 Feb;23(2):102-8. doi: 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4.- 25273921own - nlmstat- pubmed-not-medlineda  - 20150204dcom- 20150204lr  - 20150206is  - 1568-5888 (print)is  - 1568-5888 (linking)vi  - 23ip  - 2dp  - 2015 febti  - left ventricular assist device for end-stage heart failure: results of the first       lvad destination program in the netherlands.pg  - 102-8lid - 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4 [doi]ab  - purpose: mechanical circulatory support with a continuous-flow left ventricular      assist device (lvad) may be a valuable treatment in end-stage heart failure      patients for an extended period of time. the purpose of this study was to      evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow lvad in      end-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in the      netherlands. methods: a third-generation lvad was implanted in 16 heart failure      patients (age 61 +/- 8; 81 \\\% male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20 +/- 6 \\\%)      as destination therapy. all patients were ineligible for heart transplant. at      baseline, 3 and 6 months, new york heart association (nyha) functional class,      quality-of-life and exercise capacity were assessed. clinical adverse events were      registered. results: survival at 30 days and 6 months was 88 and 75 \\\%,      respectively. in the postoperative phase, 6 (38 \\\%) patients required continuous      veno-venous haemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13 \\\%) patients required      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure.       during follow-up, nyha functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7 +/-      0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 57 +/- 5 to 23 +/- 3 at 6 months (p < 0.001),      respectively. the 6 min walking distance improved from 168 +/- 42 m to 291 +/- 29      m at 6 months (p = 0.001). conclusion: continuous-flow lvad therapy is a      promising treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for      heart transplant.fau - haeck, m l aau  - haeck mlad  - department of cardiology, leiden university medical center, albinusdreef 2, 2333       za, leiden, the netherlands.fau - beeres, s l m aau  - beeres slfau - hoke, uau  - hoke ufau - palmen, mau  - palmen mfau - couperus, l eau  - couperus lefau - delgado, vau  - delgado vfau - logeman, e aau  - logeman eafau - maas, j jau  - maas jjfau - klautz, r j mau  - klautz rjfau - schalij, m jau  - schalij mjfau - verwey, h fau  - verwey hfla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - netherlandsta  - neth heart jjt  - netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the netherlands society of      cardiology and the netherlands heart foundationjid - 101095458pmc - pmc4315784oid - nlm: pmc4315784edat- 2014/10/03 06:00mhda- 2014/10/03 06:01crdt- 2014/10/03 06:00aid - 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - neth heart j. 2015 feb;23(2):102-8. doi: 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4.',surgery

Despite the availability of various pump sizes, information on the impact of pump      size on clinical outcome is still lacking. We aimed to evaluate whether pump size      in relation to body surface area (BSA) has an impact on clinical outcome.      METHODS: Children requiring implantation of a BH between 2000 and 2013 were      included in this retrospective study. Primary end-points were events leading to      BH explantation (transplantation, recovery or death) and the secondary end-point       was occurrence of thromboembolic events. Patients were categorized into three      groups according to BH stroke volume per BSA: optimal (30 to 50 ml/m(2)); small      (<30 ml/m(2)); and large (>50 ml/m(2)). RESULTS: Eighty children (median age 2.2       years, median BSA 0.50 m(2)) underwent BH implantation. Fifty-five (69\\\%) children      had an optimally sized pump implanted, whereas 8 children (10\\\%) had small pump      and 17 (21\\\%) large pump implantation. Overall survival rate was 69\\\%. Weaning was       possible in 15 children (19\\\%), and 39 children (49\\\%) were transplanted.      Mortality, myocardial recovery and transplantation were not related to age, BSA      or pump size. Thromboembolic events occurred significantly more frequently in      children treated with large pumps. CONCLUSIONS: The broad range of body sizes in       children from newborns to adolescents requires a wide choice of appropriately      sized devices. Large pump size in relation to BSA is an independent risk factor      for occurrence of thromboembolic events.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome of      end-stage RCM patients after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation      and to determine factors that may be associated with improved survival. METHODS:       This investigation is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data that       include 28 consecutive patients with end-stage RCM who received continuous-flow      LVADs at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Outcome was assessed by survival       with LVAD support until heart transplantation or all-cause mortality. RESULTS:      The mean follow-up time post-LVAD implantation was 448 +/- 425 days. The mean      hospitalization time was 29 +/- 19 days and was complicated mainly by      post-operative right ventricular (RV) failure requiring short-term medical      support. The short-term in-hospital mortality was 14\\\%. Ten patients underwent      heart transplantation with 100\\\% survival post-transplant during the follow-up      period. One-year survival for patients with LVADs without transplantation was      64\\\%, and was not significantly different between amyloidosis and non-amyloidosis       patients. Larger left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions      were significantly associated with improved survival rates (RR = 0.94 and 0.95, p      < 0.05, respectively), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) </=46       mm was associated with increased mortality post-LVAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS:      LVAD is a feasible, life-saving therapy for end-stage heart failure related to      RCM, especially as a bridge to transplant and in patients with larger LV      dimensions.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The purpose of this study was to      determine pre- and peri-operative predictors of hospital LOS after LVAD      implantation. METHODS: We analyzed adult primary continuous-flow LVAD patients      implanted between June 23, 2006 and December 31, 2010 at 105 institutions from      the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support      (INTERMACS). Retrospective analyses included measures of central tendency,      frequencies, correlations and stepwise multivariable regression modeling (p </=      0.05). Independent variables included demographic characteristics, pre-implant      clinical and behavioral variables and concomitant surgery. RESULTS:      Characteristics of the patients (n = 2,200) included: mean age 54.6 +/- 12.6      years; 79\\\% male; 69\\\% white; 57\\\% INTERMACS Profile 1 or 2; 37\\\% diabetic; 21\\\% with       history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG); 7\\\% with history of valve surgery;      and 37\\\% with concomitant surgery. Median hospital LOS (implant to discharge) was       20 days. Significant predictors of an increased hospital LOS included demographic      characteristics (older age and non-white), pre-implant clinical variables      (history of CABG or valve surgery, diabetes, ascites, INTERMACS Profiles 1 and 2,      low albumin, high blood urea nitrogen, high right atrial pressure) and      concomitant surgery, explaining 12\\\% variance (F = 22.65, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:      Demographic characteristics, pre-implant variables and concomitant surgery      partially explained hospital LOS after continuous-flow LVAD implant. These      variables have implications regarding selection of patients for mechanical      circulatory support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

However, its effectiveness has not been evaluated      since approval. In this study we evaluated the EVAHEART device in a commercial      setting in Japan. METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients enrolled in the      Japanese Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (J-MACS), who      were listed for transplant or likely to be listed and who received an EVAHEART      device, were enrolled from 2011 to 2013 at 14 Japanese centers. Patients\\      survival rates, adverse events and quality-of-life data were obtained from the      J-MACS Registry. RESULTS: Patients\\ median age was 43 years (85\\\% male). The      Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profiles      revealed 12 patients in Level 1, 45 in Level 2, 37 in Level 3 and 1 in Level 4.      The mean support duration was 384.7 days, with a cumulative duration of 101.2      years. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate during support was 93.4\\\% at 6 months, 87.4\\\%      at 1 year and 87.4\\\% at 2 years. Seventy-seven patients (80.2\\\%) currently remain      on support, 7 received a transplant and 10 died during support. Major adverse      events included drive-line infection (14.6\\\%) and neurologic events such as      ischemic stroke (17.7\\\%), hemorrhage (13.5\\\%), transient ischemic attack (3.1\\\%),      pump thrombosis (1\\\%) and hemolysis (1\\\%). There was no gastrointestinal (GI)      bleeding or right heart failure requiring right ventricular assist device (RVAD).      There was no pump exchange due to mechanical failure. CONCLUSIONS: The EVAHEART      device provides safe, reliable and long-term circulatory support with improved      survival in commercial settings of BTT in Japan, where the transplant waiting      period is much longer. Incidences of GI bleeding, hemolysis, right ventricular      failure, device thrombosis and mechanical failure were extremely rare in patients      on EVAHEART devices.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate      the effect of right heart unloading and respiratory support with a wearable      integrated artificial pump-lung (APL). METHODS: The APL device was placed      surgically between the right atrium and pulmonary artery in 7 sheep.      Anti-coagulation was performed with heparin infusion. The device\\s ability to      unload the right ventricle (RV) was investigated by echocardiograms and right      heart catheterization at different bypass flow rates. Hemodynamics and      echocardiographic data were evaluated. APL flow and gas transfer rates were also       measured at different device speeds. RESULTS: Hemodynamics remained stable during      APL support. There was no significant change in systemic blood pressure and      cardiac index. Central venous pressure, RV pressure, RV end-diastolic dimension      and RV ejection fraction were significantly decreased when APL device flow rate      approached 2 liters/min. Linear regression showed significant correlative trends       between the hemodynamic and cardiac indices and device speed. The oxygen transfer      rate increased with device speed. The oxygen saturation from the APL outlet was      fully saturated (>95\\\%) during support. The impact of APL support on blood      elements (plasma free hemoglobin and platelet activation) was minimal.      CONCLUSIONS: APL device support significantly unloaded the RV with increasing      device speed. The device also provided stable hemodynamics and respiratory      support in terms of blood flow and oxygen transfer. The right heart unloading      performance of this wearable device needs to be evaluated further in an animal      model of right heart failure with long-term support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Our group developed two transplant programs at Instituto Nacional del      Torax and Clinica Davila. We report our clinical experience based on distinctive       clinical policies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients were      transplanted between November 2008 and April 2013, representing 51\\\% of all      Chilean cases. Distinctive clinical policies include intensive donor management,       generic immunosuppression and VAD (ventricular assist devices) insertion.      RESULTS: Ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy were the main indications (23 (43\\\%)      each), age 48 +/- 13 years and 48 (91\\\%) were male. Transplant listing Status: IA       14 (26\\\%) (VAD or 2 inotropes), IB 14 (26\\\%) (1 inotrope) and II25 (47\\\%) (no      inotrope). Mean waiting time 70 +/- 83 days. Twelve (24\\\%) were transplanted      during VAD support (median support: 36 days). OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: orthotopic      bicaval transplant with ischemia time: 175 +/- 54 min. Operative mortality: 3      (6\\\%), all due to right ventricular failure. Re-exploration for bleeding 2 (4\\\%),      stroke 3 (6\\\%), mediastinitis 0 (0\\\%), pneumonia 4 (8\\\%), and transient dialysis 6      (11\\\%). Mean follow-up was 21 +/- 14 months. Three-year survival was 86 +/- 6\\\%.      One patient died of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and the other died suddenly       (non-compliance). Freedom from rejection requiring specific therapy was 80 +/- 7\\\%      at 3 years of follow-up. Four hundred eighty four endomyocardial biopsies were      done: 11 (2.3\\\%) had 2R rejection. All survivors are in NYHA (New York Heart      Association) functional class I and all but one have normal biventricular      function. CONCLUSION: Mid-term results are similar to those reported by the      registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. This      experience has a higher proportion of VAD support than previous national series.       Rejection rates are low in spite of generic immunosuppression.FAU - Villavicencio, MauricioAU  - Villavicencio MFAU - Rossel, VictorAU  - Rossel VFAU - Larrea, RicardoAU  - Larrea RFAU - Peralta, Juan PabloAU  -

The RV exhibits a greater capacity for rapid recovery than the left ventricle,      making devices designed specifically for temporary RV MCS attractive. We report      our experience with the Impella Right Direct (RD) and Right Peripheral (RP)      temporary ventricular assist devices (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) in patients with      ARVF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the clinical      outcomes of consecutive patients supported with the Impella RD or RP at 2      institutions during a 6-year period. RESULTS: During the study period, 18      patients (67\\\% men; mean age 57 +/- 10 years) received MCS, 15 with the Impella RD      and 3 with the Impella RP. Before RV MCS, all patients required intravenous      inotropes, 7 (39\\\%) required inhaled nitric oxide, 7 (39\\\%) required intra-aortic      balloon counterpulsation, and 2 (11\\\%) had experienced a cardiac arrest. Device      implantation resulted in an improvement in cardiac index (2.1 +/- 0.1      liters/min/m(2) pre-implant vs 2.6 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m(2) post-implant, p =      0.04) and reduced central venous pressure (22 +/- 5 vs 15 +/- 4 mm Hg, p < 0.01).      Fourteen (78\\\%) patients recovered sufficient RV function to facilitate device      explanation after 7 days (range, 2-19 days) of support, and 4 (22\\\%) patients died      on support after 6 days (range 1-11 days). Survival to 30 days was 72\\\% and to 1      year was 50\\\%. At 1-year follow-up, the mean New York Heart Association functional      classification was 1.3 +/- 0.5, and only 1 patient demonstrated severe RV      dysfunction on echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with ARVF rapidly      recover sufficient RV function to facilitate device explantation, highlighting an      expanding role for minimally invasive temporary RV assist devices optimized for      the treatment of recoverable ARVF.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

The HeartMate II risk score (HMRS)      was recently derived and validated to predict 90-day mortality in clinical trial       patients with continuous-flow LVADs. The aim of this study was to test HMRS      validity in predicting survival at our institution. METHODS: We performed a      retrospective analysis of patients implanted with HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec,      Pleasanton, CA) LVADs from March 31, 2004 to September 20, 2012 at the Columbia      University Medical Center (CUMC). Patients were stratified according to HMRS      profiles (HMRS Low < 1.58, 1.58 </= HMRS Medium </= 2.48, HMRS High > 2.48)      calculated using age, albumin, creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR)      and center volume. Outcome was defined as survival at 90 days after device      implantation. RESULTS: HeartMate II LVADs were implanted in 205 patients.      Pre-operative data from 201 patients were categorized into HMRS Low (n = 101;      1.04 [0.64 to 1.31]), HMRS Medium (n = 73; 1.98 [1.78 to 2.25]) and HMRS High (n       = 27, 3.07 [2.70 to 3.43]) (p < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 90      days (HMRS Low 91.0 +/- 2.9\\\%, HMRS Medium 91.7 +/- 3.2\\\%, HMRS High 88.7 +/- 6.1\\\%)      and at 1 year (HMRS Low 85.5 +/- 3.8\\\%, HMRS Medium 79.3 +/- 5.5\\\%, HMRS High 82.4       +/- 8.4\\\%) after LVAD implantation were not statistically different (p = 0.43).      Prediction of 90-day mortality by receiver operating characteristic was poor (AUC      = 0.56). CONCLUSION: HMRS stratification poorly discriminates 90-day mortality      after HMII LVAD implantation at our institution. Its generalizability as a      universal prognostic score may be limited.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.

Improved long-term outcomes may facilitate the use of device therapy as       an alternative to heart transplantation. However, there are scarce data about the      long-term outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. This study      sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients receiving continuous-flow      left ventricular assist devices. METHODS: Between March 2004 and June 2010, 140      patients underwent continuous-flow left ventricular assist device insertion as a       bridge to transplantation or a destination therapy. These patients\\ charts were      retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The initial strategy for continuous-flow left       ventricular assist device therapy was bridge to transplantation in 115 patients      (82\\\%) and destination therapy in 25 patients (18\\\%). Of those, 24 (17\\\%) died on      left ventricular assist device support, 94 (67\\\%) were successfully bridged to      transplantation, and 1 (0.71\\\%) showed native heart recovery. Twenty-four patients      (17\\\%) had been on continuous-flow left ventricular assist device support for more      than 3 years (mean, 3.9 years; range, 3.0-7.5 years). Estimated on-device      survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 83\\\%, 75\\\%, and 61\\\%, respectively.      Rehospitalizations due to bleeding, cardiac events, and device-related issues      were common. The freedom from rehospitalization rates at 1 and 3 years was 31\\\%      and 6.9\\\%, respectively. A total of 14 patients (10\\\%) required device exchange.      CONCLUSIONS: Current continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices can provide       satisfactory long-term survival. However, rehospitalization is frequently      required.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published by      Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: The 2006 UNOS      thoracic organ allocation policy change was implemented to allow for greater      regional sharing of organs for heart transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed 36,789      patients who were listed for heart transplantation from January 1999 through      April 2012. These patients were separated into 2 eras centered on the July 12,      2006 UNOS policy change. Pre- and post-transplantation characteristics were      compared by UNOS regions. RESULTS: Waitlist mortality decreased nationally (up to      180 days: 13.3\\\% vs. 7.9\\\% after the UNOS policy change, p < 0.001) and within each      region. Similarly, 2-year post-transplant mortality decreased nationally (2-year       mortality: 17.3\\\% vs. 14.6\\\%; p < 0.001) as well as regionally. Waitlist time for      UNOS status 1A and 1B candidates increased nationally 17.8 days on average (p <      0.001) with variability between the regions. The greatest increases were in      Region 9 (59.2-day increase, p < 0.001) and Region 4 (41.2-day increase, p <      0.001). Although the use of mechanical circulatory support increased nearly      2.3-fold nationally in Era 2, significant differences were present on a regional       basis. In Regions 6, 7, and 10, nearly 40\\\% of those transplanted required left      ventricular assist device bridging, whereas only 19.6\\\%, 22.3\\\%, and 15.5\\\% required      a left ventricular assist device in regions 3, 4, and 5, respectively.      CONCLUSIONS: The 2006 UNOS policy change has resulted in significant regional      heterogeneity with respect to waitlist time and reliance on mechanical      circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation, although overall both      waitlist mortality and post-transplant survival are improved.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

There are few current      pediatric data assessing the impact of VAD support on post-transplant survival.      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric (</=18 years old, n      = 4,028) transplants performed between 1995 and 2011 and contained within the      United Network for Organ Sharing data set. Transplants were divided into three      eras: early (1995 to 2002, n = 1,450); intermediate (2003 to 2007, n = 1,138);      and recent (2008 to 2011, n = 1,440). VADs were present at transplant in 398      patients (9.8\\\%). Outcomes among patients with and without VADs were assessed and       compared across eras. RESULTS: The use of VADs for bridge to transplant has      increased (early 1.1\\\%, intermediate 10.5\\\%, recent 17.9\\\%; p < 0.0001). Mean weight      among VAD-supported patients (early 63.5 kg, intermediate 42.3 kg, recent 28.8      kg; p < 0.0001) has decreased during this period. VAD patients <10 kg had an      increased risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95\\\% confidence interval [CI] 2.1      to 10.8) compared with non-mechanical support patients. In multivariable      analyses, extracorporeal VADs were the only type of VAD associated with higher      post-transplant mortality (OR = 3.0, 95\\\% CI 0.8 to 10.6). Other types of VAD had       lower mortality (OR = 0.5, 95\\\% CI 0.2 to 1.0). Long-term survival was unaffected       by the use of a VAD pre-transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients bridged to      transplantation with VADs are increasingly younger and smaller. Complication      rates remain high among patients <10 kg. Early post-transplant survival among      intracorporeal and paracorporeal VAD patients is excellent and better when      compared with unsupported patients. The use of short-term support devices is      associated with higher post-transplant mortality. Long-term survival is      unaffected by VAD use.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Between January 2006 and September      2012, 2,196 patients with moderate to severe pre-operative TR from 115      institutions underwent implantation of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist       device (LVAD) as reported by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database.       Of these, 588 (27\\\%) underwent a concomitant TVP. Inverse probability weighting      based on propensity score was used to adjust for differences between the LVAD      alone and LVAD+TVP groups, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Most patients in       the LVAD+TVP group underwent an annuloplasty alone (81.1\\\%). Concomitant TVP did      not affect risk of post-operative right VAD insertion (risk ratio [RR], 0.81; 95\\\%      confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.36; p = 0.4310) or death (RR, 0.95; 95\\\% CI,      0.68-1.33; p = 0.7658). However, TVP was associated with an increased risk for      post-operative renal failure (RR, 1.53; 95\\\% CI, 1.13-2.08; p = 0.0061), dialysis       (RR, 1.49; 95\\\% CI, 1.03-2.15; p = 0.0339), reoperation (RR, 1.24; 95\\\% CI,      1.07-1.45; p = 0.0056), greater total transfusion requirement (RR, 1.03; 95\\\% CI,       1.01-1.05; p = 0.0013), and hospital length of stay > 21 days (RR, 1.29; 95\\\% CI,       1.16-1.43; p < 0.0001). Time on the ventilator and intensive care unit length of       stay were also significantly prolonged for the LVAD+TVP group. CONCLUSIONS:      Performing a concomitant TVP for continuous-flow LVAD patients with moderate to      severe TR did not reduce early death or right VAD requirement and was associated       with worse early post-operative outcomes. These data caution against routine      concomitant TVP based solely on degree of pre-operative TR and suggest that      additional selection criteria are needed to identify those patients in whom      concomitant TVP may prevent post-operative right ventricular failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

We aimed to propose a practical      echocardiographic assessment to diagnose LVAD malfunction secondary to pump      thrombosis. METHODS: Among 52 patients implanted with a CF-LVAD from a single      center who underwent echocardiographic pump speed-change testing, 12 had      suspected pump thrombosis as determined by clinical, laboratory, and/or device      parameters. Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation was performed at baseline       pump speed and at each 1,000-rpm interval from the low setting of 8,000 rpm to      the high setting of 11,000 rpm in 11 of these patients. RESULTS: Receiver      operating characteristic curves and stepwise logistic regression analyses showed       that the best diagnostic parameters included changes in the LV end-diastolic      diameter (<0.6 cm), aortic valve opening time (<80 msec), and deceleration time      of mitral inflow (<70 msec) from lowest to highest pump speed. One parameter was       predictive of pump malfunction, with 100\\\% sensitivity and 89\\\% specificity,      whereas 2 of 3 parameters increased the sensitivity to 100\\\% and specificity to      95\\\%. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 echocardiographic variables of measured changes in LV      end-diastolic diameter, aortic valve opening time, and deceleration time of      mitral inflow between the lowest (8,000 rpm) and highest pump speed settings      (11,000 rpm) during echo-guided pump speed-change testing appear highly accurate       in diagnosing device malfunction in the setting of pump thrombosis among patients      supported with CF-LVAD. Further investigation is warranted to create and validate      a prediction score.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS:      The ReVOLVE is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm registry performed at      seven centers in Europe and two in Australia. Herein we describe a total of 254      commercial HVAD implants according to labeled indications between February 2009      and November 2012. Summary statistics included patients\\ demographics, adverse      events, length of support and outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with the clinical trial      supporting the CE Mark of the HeartWare system, patient selection differed in      that patients were older, and there were higher proportions of females and      patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathies in the ReVOLVE cohort. Duration of      support ranged from 1 to 1,057 days, with a mean of 363 +/- 280 days (median      299.5 days). Transplantation was done in 56 patients (22\\\%), explant for recovery       was performed in 3 patients (1\\\%), 43 died while on support (17\\\%), and 152 (60\\\%)      remain on the device. Success in patients with the HeartWare system was 87\\\% at 6       months, 85\\\% at 1 year, 79\\\% at 2 years and 73\\\% at 3 years. Adverse event rates      were low, comparable or improved when compared to the CE Mark Trial. CONCLUSION:       Real-world use of the HeartWare system continues to demonstrate excellent      clinical outcomes in patients supported with the device.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

HYPOTHESIS: There are      different implications of persistent versus transient improvement in LVEF among      DCM patients receiving contemporary therapy. METHODS: We studied 188 patients      with nonischemic DCM. Persistent improvement in LVEF (PIEF) was defined as LVEF      increase by at least 10\\\% compared to baseline, and found in 2 separate      echo-Doppler exams performed at least 12 months apart. Increased LVEF in echo 2,       which was not sustained in echo 3, was defined as transient improvement in LVEF      (TIEF). RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 6.8 years, PIEF occurred in 61      (33\\\%) patients, predicting a better long-term outcome (P < 0.001) in a combined      end-point comprising death, heart transplantation, or the need for a ventricular       assist device. The TIEF group had an intermediate course and were closer to      nonimprovers (P = 0.003 vs PIEF). Multivariate logistic regression identified the      following independent predictors of PIEF: shorter disease duration,      pregnancy-associated disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baseline LVEF </=      25\\\%. A score to predict PIEF assigned 1 point to each of the following: disease      duration < 3 years and no familial cardiomyopathy; pregnancy-associated      presentation; basal LVEF </= 25\\\%; and left ventricular wall thickness >/= 12. A      score of >/= 3 was present in 44\\\% of the patients, reliably predicting PIEF in      91\\\% (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent improvement in LVEF is associated with      improved long-term prognosis.

METHODS: Between November 1, 2003 and December 1, 2012, we      implanted the HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD in 338 patients, either for      bridging to heart transplantation or for destination therapy. Twenty-three of      these patients (19 men and 4 women; mean age, 47 +/- 16 years) had advanced      hepatic dysfunction, as characterized by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or      aspartate transaminase (AST) levels five times normal; serum total bilirubin      levels three times normal; and/or necessity for a liver biopsy before or during      device implantation. Of this group, 17 patients received the LVAD as a bridge to       transplantation, and six patients received it for destination therapy. RESULTS:      Nine of the 23 patients required either a transjugular or a core liver biopsy      during LVAD implantation. Three patients died within the first postoperative      month; the 20 surviving patients had significant improvements in their hepatic      parameters. The ALT decreased from 238 +/- 296 to 27 +/- 13 U/L (p = 0.022), AST       decreased from 209 +/- 199 to 29 +/- 8 U/L (p = 0.009), and total bilirubin level      decreased from 6.9 +/- 6.0 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/dL (p = 0.044). The serum albumin      level increased from 3.2 +/- 0.6 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 g/dL (p = 0.003), and creatinine       clearance increased from 77.6 +/- 35.2 to 110.2 +/- 35.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p =      0.101). CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD support may significantly improve      hepatic function, allowing patients with poor preimplant liver function to become      better candidates for heart transplantation.CI  - (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Demirozu, Zumrut TAU  - Demirozu ZTAD  - Department of Cardiopulmonary Transplantation, Texas Heart Institute, Houston,      Texas; Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute, Houston, Texas.FAU - Hernandez, RubenAU  - Hernandez RFAU - Mallidi, Hari RAU  - Mallidi HRFAU - Singh, Steve KAU  - Singh SKFAU - Radovancevic, RajkoAU  - Radovancevic RFAU - Segura, Ana MariaAU  - Segura AMFAU - Etheridge, Whitson BAU  - Etheridge WBFAU - Cohn, William EAU  - Cohn WEFAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140319PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)RN  - EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)RN  - RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Alanine Transaminase/bloodMH  - Aspartate Aminotransferases/bloodMH  - Bilirubin/bloodMH  - Biological Markers/bloodMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Liver Diseases/*complications/diagnosis/*therapyMH  - Liver Function TestsMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Prostheses and ImplantsMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/03/20 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/02 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/20 06:00PHST- 2014/03/19 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/jocs.12318 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2014 May;29(3):419-23. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12318.

From March 2006 through      November 2011, one hundred patients with chronic heart failure underwent      implantation of a HeartMate II (HM II) LVAD (Thoratec Corp.) as a bridge to      transplant (BTT; n = 65) or destination therapy (DT; n = 35). Records were      reviewed to determine the prevalence and type of postimplant stroke, anatomic      cerebral location of strokes, and associated morbidity and mortality. Cox      multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent      predictors of postoperative stroke. Strokes occurred in 12 patients (12.0\\\%): four      embolic and eight hemorrhagic. Median duration of support at the time of stroke      was 281.0 days for embolic strokes and 380.5 days for hemorrhagic strokes (p =      0.028). Stroke patients had a significantly higher incidence of diabetes (66.7\\\%      vs. 40.9\\\%; p = 0.024), history of preimplant stroke (16.7\\\% vs. 4.5\\\%; p = 0.046),       and aortic cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest during their LVAD implant      (50.0\\\% vs. 20.2\\\%; p = 0.034) compared with patients without postoperative      strokes. Mean international normalized ratio (INR) at the time of stroke was      subtherapeutic in all four patients with embolic strokes (mean: 1.5 +/- 0.1 IU;      range 1.3-1.6 IU) and supratherapeutic in four of eight patients with hemorrhagic      strokes (mean: 3.2 +/- 2.2 IU, range: 1.4-7.0 IU; p = 0.024). There was a 25.0\\\%      30 day mortality after stroke. Diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 6.36; p = 0.029), aortic      cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest (OR 4.75; p = 0.025), duration of LVAD      support (OR 1.00; p = 0.008), and INR (OR 4.42; p = 0.020) were independent      predictors of stroke in multivariate analysis with a trend toward significance      for history of stroke (OR 6.25; p = 0.075). Stroke represented an important      source of morbidity and mortality for patients on HM II LVAD support. As      long-term device therapy continues to gain popularity for both BTT and DT, a      better understanding of the predictors of stroke, more strict control of      postoperative anticoagulation, and the establishment of a risk stratification      model may aid in minimizing its occurrence.FAU - Morgan, Jeffrey AAU  - Morgan JAAD  - From the *Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery and daggerDivision of Cardiovascular      Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan.FAU - Brewer, Robert JAU  - Brewer RJFAU - Nemeh, Hassan WAU  - Nemeh HWFAU - Gerlach, BrentAU  - Gerlach BFAU - Lanfear, David EAU  - Lanfear DEFAU - Williams, Celeste TAU  - Williams CTFAU - Paone, GaetanoAU  - Paone GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Anticoagulants)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Anticoagulants/chemistry/therapeutic useMH  - Aorta/pathologyMH  - Diabetes Complications/diagnosisMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/surgery/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - International Normalized RatioMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Proportional Hazards ModelsMH  - RiskMH  - Stroke/*complications/*epidemiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2014/03/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/15 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000074 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 May-Jun;60(3):284-9. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000074.- 24625532own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140430dcom- 20141217is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 60ip  - 3dp  - 2014 may-junti  - stroke while on long-term left ventricular assist device support: incidence,      outcome, and predictors.pg  - 284-9lid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000074 [doi]ab  - development of stroke while on left ventricular assist device (lvad) support can       be a source of significant morbidity and mortality. from march 2006 through      november 2011, one hundred patients with chronic heart failure underwent      implantation of a heartmate ii (hm ii) lvad (thoratec corp.) as a bridge to      transplant (btt;

The CUPID 2 (Calcium Up-Regulation by Percutaneous      Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease Phase 2b) trial is designed to       evaluate whether increasing SERCA2a activity via gene therapy improves clinical      outcome in these patients. BACKGROUND: Intracoronary delivery of recombinant      adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1)/SERCA2a improves intracellular Ca(2+)      handling by increasing SERCA2a protein levels and, as a consequence, restores      systolic and diastolic function. In a previous phase 2a trial, this therapy      improved symptoms, functional status, biomarkers, and left ventricular function,       and reduced cardiovascular events in advanced heart failure patients. METHODS:      CUPID 2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational,      multicenter, randomized event-driven study in up to 250 patients with      moderate-to-severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New York      Heart Association functional class II to IV symptoms despite optimal therapy.      Enrolled patients will be at high risk for recurrent heart-failure      hospitalizations by virtue of having elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic      peptide/BNP (>1,200 pg/ml, or >1,600 pg/ml if atrial fibrillation is present)      and/or recent heart failure hospitalization. The primary endpoint of      time-to-recurrent event (heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence      of terminal events [all-cause death, heart transplant, left ventricular assist      device implantation or ambulatory worsening heart failure]) will be assessed      using the joint frailty model. This ongoing trial is expected to complete      recruitment in 2014, with the required number of 186 recurrent events estimated      to occur by mid 2015. RESULTS: Available data indicate that calcium up-regulation      by AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy is safe and of potential benefit in advanced heart      failure patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CUPID 2 trial is designed to study the effects      of this therapy on clinical outcome in these patients.

BACKGROUND: The transfemoral approach to IABP placement is associated with major       disadvantages, including the risk for infection and limitation of patient      mobility in those requiring extended support. METHODS: We developed a      percutaneous technique for placing IABPs in the left axillary artery that permits      upright sitting and ambulation. We performed a retrospective review of data from       patients who had undergone left axillary IABP implantation between 2007 and 2012.      RESULTS: Fifty patients who received a left axillary IABP as a bridge to      transplantation were identified, of whom 42 (84\\\%) underwent heart or      heart-multiorgan transplantation. Cumulative survival on IABP support was 92\\\%,      and post-transplant 90-day survival was 90\\\%. Median duration of support was 18      days. Four of 50 patients (8\\\%) died while on IABP support, and 3 (6\\\%) received      greater mechanical circulatory support. Four patients (8\\\%) had clinically      significant thromboembolic or bleeding events without long-term sequelae. The      most common minor adverse event was IABP malposition, in 22 patients (44\\\%).      Prolonged IABP support in the heart-transplantation cohort was associated with      significant improvements in mean pulmonary artery pressure and in creatinine and       total bilirubin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous insertion of an IABP      through the left axillary artery is a feasible and relatively well-tolerated      strategy to bridge patients with end-stage heart failure to heart      transplantation. This form of mechanical-device treatment permits upright sitting      and ambulation in those requiring extended support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

BACKGROUND: RVF is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Limited      data regarding efficacy of the CF-RVSD for RVF exist. METHODS: We retrospectively      reviewed data from 46 patients receiving a CF-RVSD for RVF from a registry      comprising data from 8 tertiary-care hospitals in the United States. CF-RVSD use       was recorded in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; myocarditis; chronic       left heart failure; after valve surgery, orthotopic heart transplantation, left      ventricular assist device surgery, coronary bypass grafting. Devices were      implanted via the percutaneous (n = 22) or surgical (n = 24) route. RESULTS: No      intraprocedural mortality was observed. Mean time from admission to CF-RVSD      implantation was 5.7 +/- 8.5 days, with a mean of 6,769 +/- 789 rotations/min,      providing 4.2 +/- 1.3 l/min of flow. Mean duration of support was 5.4 +/- 5.1      days. Mean arterial pressure (65 +/- 12 mm Hg vs. 73 +/- 14 mm Hg; p < 0.05),      right atrial pressure (21 +/- 8 mm Hg vs. 16 +/- 7 mm Hg; p = 0.05), pulmonary      artery systolic pressure (43 +/- 15 mm Hg vs. 33 +/- 15 mm Hg; p = 0.01), and      cardiac index (1.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.6; p = 0.01) were improved within 48 h      of CF-RVSD implantation. Total in-hospital mortality was 57\\\% and was lowest in      the setting of left ventricular assist device implantation, chronic left heart      failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Increased age, biventricular failure,      and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-defined major bleeding were associated       with increased in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the CF-RVSD for RVF is       clinically feasible and associated with improved hemodynamic status.

myocarditis; chronic       left heart failure; after valve surgery, orthotopic heart transplantation, left      ventricular assist device surgery, coronary bypass grafting. devices were      implanted via the percutaneous (n = 22) or surgical (n = 24) route. results: no      intraprocedural mortality was observed. mean time from admission to cf-rvsd      implantation was 5.7 +/- 8.5 days, with a mean of 6,769 +/- 789 rotations/min,      providing 4.2 +/- 1.3 l/min of flow. mean duration of support was 5.4 +/- 5.1      days. mean arterial pressure (65 +/- 12 mm hg vs. 73 +/- 14 mm hg; p < 0.05),      right atrial pressure (21 +/- 8 mm hg vs. 16 +/- 7 mm hg; p = 0.05), pulmonary      artery systolic pressure (43 +/- 15 mm hg vs. 33 +/- 15 mm hg; p = 0.01), and      cardiac index (1.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.6; p = 0.01) were improved within 48 h      of cf-rvsd implantation. total in-hospital mortality was 57\\\% and was lowest in      the setting of left ventricular assist device implantation, chronic left heart      failure, and acute myocardial infarction. increased age, biventricular failure,      and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction-defined major bleeding were associated       with increased in-hospital mortality. conclusions: use of the cf-rvsd for rvf is       clinically feasible and associated with improved hemodynamic status. observations      from the registry of patients who have received this device may support the      development of prospective studies that will examine the role of percutaneous      circulatory support for rvf.ci  - copyright (c) 2013 american college of cardiology foundation. published by      elsevier inc. all rights reserved.fau - kapur, navin kau  - kapur nkad  - the cardiovascular center, tufts medical center, boston, massachusetts.      electronic address: nkapur@tuftsmedicalcenter.org.fau - paruchuri, vikramau  - paruchuri vad  - the cardiovascular center, tufts medical center, boston, massachusetts.fau - jagannathan, anandau  - jagannathan aad  - the cardiovascular center, tufts medical center, boston, massachusetts.fau - steinberg, danielau  - steinberg dad  - interventional cardiology, medical university of south carolina, charleston,      south carolina.fau - chakrabarti, anjan kau  - chakrabarti akad  - interventional cardiology, beth israel deaconess medical center, boston,      massachusetts.fau - pinto, duaneau  - pinto dad  - interventional cardiology, beth israel deaconess medical center, boston,      massachusetts.fau - aghili, nimaau  - aghili nad  - division of cardiology, medstar heart institute, washington, dc.fau - najjar, samerau  - najjar sad  - division of cardiology, medstar heart institute, washington, dc.fau - finley, johnau  - finley jad  - interventional cardiology, thomas jefferson university, philadelphia,      pennsylvania.fau - orr, nicole mau  - orr nmad  - cardiology, st. francis hospital, roslyn, new york.fau - tempelhof, michaelau  - tempelhof mad  - interventional cardiology, northwestern university, chicago, illinois.fau - mudd, james oau  - mudd joad  - division of cardiology, oregon health sciences university, portland, oregon.fau - kiernan, michael sau  - kiernan msad  - the cardiovascular center, tufts medical center, boston, massachusetts.fau - pham, duc thinhau  - pham dtad  - the cardiovascular center, tufts medical center, boston, massachusetts.fau - denofrio, davidau  - denofrio dad  - the cardiovascular center, tufts medical center, boston, massachusetts.la  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20130401pl  - united statesta  - jacc heart failjt  - jacc. heart failurejid - 101598241sb  - immh  - femalemh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - retrospective studiesoto - notnlmot  - invasive hemodynamicsot  - mechanical circulatory supportot  - right heart failureedat- 2014/03/14 06:00mhda- 2014/11/18 06:00crdt- 2014/03/14 06:00phst- 2013/01/24 [received]phst- 2013/01/30 [accepted]phst- 2013/04/01 [aheadofprint]aid - s2213-1779(13)00061-9 [pii]aid - 10.1016/j.jchf.2013.01.007 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - jacc heart fail. 2013 apr;1(2):127-34. doi: 10.1016/j.jchf.2013.01.007. epub 2013      apr 1.',surgery

The goal of this study was to measure the impact of this      allosensitization on outcomes. METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed      in BTT patients, with sensitization defined as peak PRAs >/= 10\\\%. Baseline      characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using      descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. RESULTS:      Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21      non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47\\\% vs. 10\\\%, p =       0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular      rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).      Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection      (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier      log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of       infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9\\\% vs. 19.0\\\%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION:      Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. This mortality      appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the      development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.CI  - (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

OBJECTIVES: We      determined whether Doppler and 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography      reliably assess hemodynamics in patients supported with CF-LVADs. METHODS:      Simultaneous echocardiography and right heart catheterization were prospectively       performed in 50 consecutive patients supported by using the HeartMate II CF-LVAD       at baseline pump speeds. The first 40 patients were assessed to determine the      accuracy of Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiography parameters to estimate      hemodynamics and to derive a diagnostic algorithm for discrimination between mean      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure </=15 versus >15 mm Hg. Ten patients served as      a validation cohort. RESULTS: Doppler echocardiographic and invasive measures of       mean right atrial pressure (RAP) (r = 0.863; p < 0.0001), systolic pulmonary      artery pressure (sPAP) (r = 0.880; p < 0.0001), right ventricular outflow tract      stroke volume (r = 0.660; p < 0.0001), and pulmonary vascular resistance (r =      0.643; p = 0.001) correlated significantly. Several parameters, including mitral       ratio of the early to late ventricular filling velocities >2, RAP >10 mm Hg, sPAP      >40 mm Hg, left atrial volume index >33 ml/m(2), ratio of mitral inflow early      diastolic filling peak velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity >14,      and pulmonary vascular resistance >2.5 Wood units, accurately identified patients      with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >15 mm Hg (area under the curve: 0.73 to       0.98). An algorithm integrating mitral inflow velocities, RAP, sPAP, and left      atrial volume index was 90\\\% accurate in distinguishing normal from elevated left       ventricular filling pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler echocardiography accurately      estimated intracardiac hemodynamics in these patients supported with CF-LVAD. Our      algorithm reliably distinguished normal from elevated left ventricular filling      pressures.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

p < 0.0001), systolic pulmonary      artery pressure (spap) (r = 0.880; p < 0.0001), right ventricular outflow tract      stroke volume (r = 0.660; p < 0.0001), and pulmonary vascular resistance (r =      0.643; p = 0.001) correlated significantly. several parameters, including mitral       ratio of the early to late ventricular filling velocities >2, rap >10 mm hg, spap      >40 mm hg, left atrial volume index >33 ml/m(2), ratio of mitral inflow early      diastolic filling peak velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity >14,      and pulmonary vascular resistance >2.5 wood units, accurately identified patients      with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >15 mm hg (area under the curve: 0.73 to       0.98). an algorithm integrating mitral inflow velocities, rap, spap, and left      atrial volume index was 90\\\% accurate in distinguishing normal from elevated left       ventricular filling pressures. conclusions: doppler echocardiography accurately      estimated intracardiac hemodynamics in these patients supported with cf-lvad. our      algorithm reliably distinguished normal from elevated left ventricular filling      pressures.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 american college of cardiology foundation. published by      elsevier inc. all rights reserved.fau - estep, jerry dau  - estep jdad  - houston methodist debakey heart & vascular center, houston methodist hospital,      houston, texas. electronic address: jestep@houstonmethodist.org.fau - vivo, rey pau  - vivo rpad  - houston methodist debakey heart & vascular center, houston methodist hospital,      houston, texas;

The United      Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the       predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton,      CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed to      compare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program.      METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Base      were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomes      were time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences of      HT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistate      economic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was from      the NHS, discount rates were 3.5\\\%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years      (QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB pound) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs       HM II. RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulative      incidence of HT was low for both groups (11\\\% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued      4.99 lifetime QALYs costing pound258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84       QALYs costing pound231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for       HW vs HM II were pound23,530 ($37,349) and pound20,799 ($33,014), respectively.      CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a better      clinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was more      cost-effective. This result needs to be reassessed in a randomized controlled      trial comparing the 2 devices.CI  - Crown Copyright (c) 2014. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the effect of hemodynamic unloading with a LVAD on       myocardial viability and LV function in chronically supported LVAD patients has      not been fully characterized. We aimed to develop a non-invasive imaging protocol      to serially quantify native cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability      while at reduced LVAD support. METHODS: Clinically stable (n = 18) ambulatory      patients (83\\\% men, median age, 61 years) supported by a HeartMate II (Thoratec,      Pleasanton, CA) LVAD (median durations of heart failure 4.6 years and LVAD      support 7 months) were evaluated by echocardiography and technetium-99m      ((99m)Tc)-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging at      baseline and after an interval of 2 to 3 months. Echocardiographic measures of LV      size and function, including speckle tracking-derived circumferential strain,      were compared between ambulatory and reduced LVAD support at baseline and between      baseline and follow-up at reduced LVAD support. The extent of myocardial      viability by SPECT was compared between baseline and follow-up at reduced LVAD      support. RESULTS: With reduction in LVAD speeds (6,600 rpm; interquartile range:       6,200, 7,400 rpm), LV size increased, LV systolic function remained stable, and      filling pressures nominally worsened. After a median 2.1 months, cardiac      structure, function, and the extent of viable myocardium, globally and      regionally, was unchanged on repeat imaging while at reduced LVAD speed.      CONCLUSIONS: In clinically stable chronically supported LVAD patients, intrinsic       cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability did not significantly      change over the pre-specified time frame. Echocardiographic circumferential      strain and (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT myocardial viability imaging may provide      useful non-invasive end points for the assessment of cardiac structure and      function, particularly for phase II studies of novel therapies aimed at promoting      reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery in LVAD patients.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

interquartile range:       6,200, 7,400 rpm), lv size increased, lv systolic function remained stable, and      filling pressures nominally worsened. after a median 2.1 months, cardiac      structure, function, and the extent of viable myocardium, globally and      regionally, was unchanged on repeat imaging while at reduced lvad speed.      conclusions: in clinically stable chronically supported lvad patients, intrinsic       cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability did not significantly      change over the pre-specified time frame. echocardiographic circumferential      strain and (99m)tc-sestamibi spect myocardial viability imaging may provide      useful non-invasive end points for the assessment of cardiac structure and      function, particularly for phase ii studies of novel therapies aimed at promoting      reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery in lvad patients.ci  - copyright (c) 2014 international society for heart and lung transplantation.      published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.fau - gupta, deepak kau  - gupta dkad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - skali, hichamau  - skali had  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - rivero, joseau  - rivero jad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - campbell, patriciaau  - campbell pad  - department of cardiac sciences, university of calgary, calgary, alberta, canada.fau - griffin, leslieau  - griffin lad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - smith, colleenau  - smith cad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - foster, courtneyau  - foster cad  - division of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging, department of radiology,      boston, massachusetts.fau - claggett, brianau  - claggett bad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - glynn, robert jau  - glynn rjad  - department of biostatistics, brigham and women\\s hospital, harvard medical      school, boston, massachusetts.fau - couper, gregoryau  - couper gad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - givertz, michael mau  - givertz mmad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - mehra, mandeep rau  - mehra mrad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts.fau - carli, marcelo diau  - carli mdad  - cardiovascular division, department of medicine, brigham and women\\s hospital,      harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts;
