Thedisease is highly prevalent in the elderly population and often follows a course of progressive disability and deterioration. An estimated 15 000 patients withend-stage heart failure could benefit from heart transplant each year. Yet, as a result of a significant shortage of donor organs, only 2500 hearts are donatedannually, and approximately one-third of patients awaiting heart transplant dieeach year. Mechanical circulatory support, primarily in the form of leftventricular assist devices (LVADs), has come to the forefront of treatment forsevere congestive heart failure by providing a feasible alternative to patientswho might otherwise die awaiting heart transplant. The arrival of LVADs hasresulted in a dramatic shift in the management of heart failure, one that willundoubtedly affect and include a vast proportion of elderly patients. While LVADsrepresent a surgical approach to a disease that has traditionally been managedmedically, the pharmacological application throughout the perioperative periodremains of critical importance. Five primary classes of drugs bear specificapplication to the LVAD population: (i) drugs that provide haemodynamic support; (ii) antimicrobials; (iii) anticoagulants and antiplatelets; (iv) agents thatpromote myocardial recovery; and (v) miscellaneous other medications. Drugs that provide haemodynamic support are subdivided into inotropes, vasopressors andpulmonary vasodilators. Some combination of these medications is usuallyadministered within the perioperative period in order to maintain stable patient haemodynamics and assure proper LVAD function. Antimicrobials are of paramountimportance in the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods to minimise the risk of infection, an unfortunately common complication of LVAD therapy that can havepotentially morbid consequences. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications are necessary for certain types of LVADs and serve to curb the incidence of devicethrombus formation and associated embolic phenomena. Pharmacotherapeutic agentsthat facilitate myocardial recovery are being investigated as adjuncts to LVADsupport so that bridge to recovery can become a realistic outcome for a growingnumber of LVAD patients.

Epub 2004 Mar 1.Left ventricular assist devices: an evidence-based analysis.Health Quality Ontario.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this health technology policy assessment was todetermine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using implantableventricular assist devices in the treatment of end-stage heart failure.HEART FAILURE: Heart failure is a complex syndrome that impairs the ability ofthe heart to maintain adequate blood circulation, resulting in multiorganabnormalities and, eventually, death. In the period of 1994 to 1997, 38,702individuals in Ontario had a first hospital admission for heart failure. Despite reported improvement in survival, the five-year mortality rate for heart failure is about 50\\\%. For patients with end-stage heart failure that does not respond to medical therapy, surgical treatment or traditional circulatory assist devices,heart transplantation (in appropriate patients) is the only treatment thatprovides significant patient benefit. HEART TRANSPLANT IN ONTARIO: With ashortage in the supply of donor hearts, patients are waiting longer for a hearttransplant and may die before a donor heart is available. From 1999 to 2003, 55to 74 people received a heart transplant in Ontario each year. Another 12 to 21people died while waiting for a suitable donor heart. Of these, 1 to 5 deathsoccurred in people under 18 years old. The rate-limiting factor in hearttransplant is the supply of donor hearts. Without an increase in available donor hearts, attempts at prolonging the life of some patients on the transplant waitlist could have a harmful effect on other patients that are being pushed down thewaiting list (knock on effect). LVAD TECHNOLOGY: Ventricular assist devices[VADs] have been developed to provide circulatory assistance to patients withend-stage heart failure. These are small pumps that usually assist the damagedleft ventricle [LVADs] and may be situated within the body (intracorporeal] oroutside the body [extracorporeal). Some of these devices were designed for use inthe right ventricle [RVAD] or both ventricles (bi-ventricular). LVADs have beenmainly used as a \\\"bridge-to-transplant\\\" for patients on a transplant waitinglist. As well, they have been used as a \\\"bridge-to-recovery\\\" in acute heartfailure, but this experience is limited. There has been an increasing interest inusing LVAD as a permanent (destination) therapy. REVIEW OF LVAD BY THE MEDICALADVISORY SECRETARIAT: The Medical Advisory Secretariat\\s review included adescriptive synthesis of findings from five systematic reviews and 60 reportspublished between January 2000 and December 2003. Additional information wasobtained through consultation and by searching the websites of Health Canada, theUnited Network of Organ Sharing, Organ Donation Ontario, and LVAD manufacturers.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS: Previous HTAs and current Level 3 evidence from prospective non-randomized controlled studies showed that whencompared to optimal medical therapy, LVAD support significantly improved thepre-transplant survival rates of heart transplant candidates waiting for asuitable donor heart (71\\\% for LVAD and 36\\\% for medical therapy). Pre-transplantsurvival rates reported ranged from 58\\\% to 90\\\% (median 74\\\%). Improved transplant rates were also reported for people who received pre-transplant LVAD support(e.g. 67\\\% for LVAD vs 33\\\% for medical therapy). Reported transplant rates forLVAD patients ranged from 39\\\% to 90\\\% (median 71\\\%). Patient\\s age greater than 60 years and pre-existing conditions of respiratory failure associated withsepticemia, ventilation, and right heart failure were independent risk factorsfor mortality after the LVAD implantation. LVAD support was shown to improve the New York Heart Association [NYHA)] functional classification and quality of life of patients waiting for heart transplant. LVAD also enabled approximately 41\\\% -49\\\% of patients to be discharged from hospitals and wait for a heart transplantat home. However, over 50\\\% of the discharged patients required re-hospitalizationdue to adverse events. Post-transplant survival rates for LVAD-bridged patientswere similar to or better than the survival rates of patients bridged by medical therapy. LVAD support has been associated with serious adverse events, including infection (median 53\\\%, range 6\\\%-72\\\%), bleeding (8.6\\\%-48\\\%, median 35\\\%),thromboembolism (5\\\%-37\\\%), neurologic disorders (7\\\%-28\\\%), right ventricularfailure (11\\\%-26\\\%), organ dysfunction (5\\\%-50\\\%) and hemolysis (6\\\%-20\\\%). Bleedingtends to occur in the first few post-implant days and is rare thereafter. It isfatal in 2\\\%-7\\\% of patients. Infection and thromboembolism occurred throughout theduration of the implant, though their frequency tended to diminish with time.Device malfunction has been identified as one of the major complications.Fatalities directly attributable to the devices were about 1\\\% in short-term LVAD use. However, mechanical failure was the second most frequent cause of death inpatients on prolonged LVAD support. Malfunctions were mainly associated with the external components, and often could be replaced by backed up components. LVADhas been used as a bridge-to-recovery in patients suffering from acutecardiogenic shock due to cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiotomy. The survival rates were reported to be lower than in bridge-to-transplant (median 26\\\%). Someof the bridge-to-recovery patients (14\\\%-75\\\%) required a heart transplant orremained on prolonged LVAD support. According to an expert in the field,experience with LVAD as a bridge-to-recovery technology has been more favourable in Germany than in North America, where it is not regarded as a major indication since evidence for its effectiveness in this setting is limited. LVAD has alsobeen explored as a destination therapy. A small, randomized, controlled trial(level 2 evidence) showed that LVAD significantly increased the 1-year survivalrate of patients with end-stage heart failure but were not eligible for a hearttransplant (51\\\% LVAD vs 25\\\% for medical therapy). However, improved survival was associated with adverse events 2.35 times higher than medically treated patients and a higher hospital re-admission rate. The 2-year survival rate on LVADdecreased to 23\\\%, although it was still significantly better compared to patientson medical therapy (8\\\%). The leading causes of deaths were sepsis (41\\\%) anddevice failure (17\\\%). The FDA has given conditional approval for the permanentuse of HeartMate SNAP VE LVAS in patients with end-stage heart failure who arenot eligible for heart transplantation, although the long-term effect of thisapplication is not known. In Canada, four LVAD systems have been licensed forbridge-to-transplant only. The use of LVAD support raises ethical issues because of the implications of potential explantation that could be perceived as awithdrawal of life support. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE TRANSPLANT WAITING LIST: Withthe shortage of donor hearts for adults, LVAD support probably would not increasethe number of patients who receive a heart transplant. If LVAD supportedcandidates are prioritized for urgent heart transplant, there will be a knock on effect as other transplant candidates without LVAD support would be pushed down, resulting in longer wait, deterioration in health status and die before asuitable donor heart becomes available. Under the current policy for allocatingdonor hearts in Ontario, patients on LVAD support would be downgraded to Status 3with a lower priority to receive a transplant. This would likely result in anexpansion of the transplant waiting list with an increasing number of patients onprolonged LVAD support, which is not consistent with the indication of LVAD useapproved by Health Canada. There is indication in the United Kingdom that LVADsupport in conjunction with an urgent transplant listing in the pediatricpopulation may decrease the number of deaths on the waiting list without aharmful knock-on effect on other transplant candidates.CONCLUSION: LVAD support as a bridge-to-transplant has been shown to improve the survival rate, functional status and quality of life of patients on the hearttransplant waiting list. However, due to the shortage of donor hearts and thecurrent heart transplant algorithm, LVAD support for transplant candidates of allage groups would likely result in an expansion of the waiting list and prolonged use of LVAD with significant budget implications but without increasing thenumber of heart transplants. Limited level 4 evidence showed that LVAD support inchildren yielded survival rates comparable to those in the adult population. The introduction of LVAD in the pediatric population would be more cost-effective andmight not have a negative effect on the transplant waiting list.PMCID: PMC3387736: 14721801  [pubmed - indexed for

support, which is not consistent with the indication of lvad useapproved by health canada. there is indication in the united kingdom that lvadsupport in conjunction with an urgent transplant listing in the pediatricpopulation may decrease the number of deaths on the waiting list without aharmful knock-on effect on other transplant candidates.conclusion: lvad support as a bridge-to-transplant has been shown to improve the survival rate, functional status and quality of life of patients on the hearttransplant waiting list. however, due to the shortage of donor hearts and thecurrent heart transplant algorithm, lvad support for transplant candidates of allage groups would likely result in an expansion of the waiting list and prolonged use of lvad with significant budget implications but without increasing thenumber of heart transplants. limited level 4 evidence showed that lvad support inchildren yielded survival rates comparable to those in the adult population. the introduction of lvad in the pediatric population would be more cost-effective andmight not have a negative effect on the transplant waiting list.pmcid: pmc3387736',heartDevices

However, expansion of this technology is still limited bycomplications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential toidentify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditionalcardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base tosupport these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did notidentify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potentialpredictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely arelatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasivetechniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements andvalidated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting ofCF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) considerpotential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTNmanagement is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the newreliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research andmanagement possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the CF-LVAD patient population move forward.PMCID: PMC4385742 [Available on 2016-05-01]: 25284807  [pubmed - indexed for medline]104. heart fail rev. 2015 may;20(3):317-22. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3.hypertension: an unstudied potential risk factor for adverse outcomes duringcontinuous flow ventricular assist device support.wasson lt(1), yuzefpolskaya m, wakabayashi m, takayama h, naka y, uriel n, jorde up, demmer rt, colombo pc.author information: (1)newyork-presbyterian, columbia university medical center, 622 west 168thstreet, ph12-134, new york, ny, 10032-3720, usa.in end-stage heart failure, left ventricular assist devices (lvads) represent an exciting new frontier in which post-device implantation survival approaches that of heart transplant. however, expansion of this technology is still limited bycomplications that impact morbidity and mortality. thus, it is essential toidentify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. one such predictor may be hypertension (htn). not only may chronic htn as a traditionalcardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term lvad support, but htn may also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.although current guidelines identify blood pressure (bp) control as important to outpatient continuous flow (cf) lvad management, there is no evidence base tosupport these guidelines. indeed, our comprehensive literature search did notidentify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation htn as a potentialpredictor of adverse cf-lvad outcomes. htn among cf-lvad patients is likely arelatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasivetechniques to measure bp in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. fortunately,recent research has elucidated the meaning of doppler bp measurements andvalidated a slow-cuff deflation system for bp measurements in the setting ofcf-lvad support. therefore, cf-lvad researchers and clinicians may (1) considerpotential mechanisms relating htn to poor outcomes, (2) realize that htnmanagement is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the newreliable and valid methods for outpatient bp measurement that make research andmanagement possible. it is critical and now feasible that research on htn in the cf-lvad patient population move forward.pmcid: pmc4385742 [available on 2016-05-01]',heartDevices

Indications for support were:failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy(n=118) and primary donor graft failure (n=37); postacute myocardial infarctionCS (n=27); acute myocarditis (n=6); and CS on chronic heart failure (n=40). Aperipheral ECMO setting was established in 126 (55.2\\\%) patients while it wasestablished centrally in 102 (44.7\\\%). Overall mean support time was 10.9¬±9.7 days(range: 1-43 days). Eighty-four (36.8\\\%) patients died on ECMO.

However, with dramatic improvements in organ preservation, surgery andimmunosuppressive drug management, short term survival is no longer the pivotalissue for most heart transplant recipients (HTR). Rather, a return to functional lifestyle with good quality of life is now the desired procedural outcome. Toachieve this outcome, aggressive exercise rehabilitation is essential. HTRpresent unique exercise challenges. Preoperatively, most of these patients hadchronic debilitating cardiac illness. Many HTR have had prolongedpretransplantation hospitalisation for inotropic support or a ventricular assist device. Decrements in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and relatedcardiovascular parameters regress approximately 26\\\% within the first 1 to 3 weeksof sustained bed rest. Consequently, extremely poor aerobic capacity and cardiac cachexia are not unusual occurrences in HTR who have required mechanical support or been confined to bed rest. Moreover, HTR must also contend with de novoexercise challenges conferred by chronic cardiac denervation and the multiplesequelae resulting from immunosuppression therapy. There is ample evidence thatboth endurance and resistance training are well tolerated in HTR. Moreover, thereis growing clinical consensus that specific endurance and resistance trainingregimens in HTR can be efficacious adjunctive therapies in the prevention ofimmunosuppression-induced adverse effects and the reversal of pathophysiological consequences associated with cardiac denervation and antecedent heart failure.For example, some HTR who remain compliant during strenuous long term endurancetraining programmes achieve peak heart rate and VO2peak values late aftertransplantation that approach age-matched norms (up to approximately 95\\\% ofpredicted). These benefits are not seen in HTR who do not participate instructured endurance exercise training. Rather, peak heart rate and VO2peakvalues in untrained HTR remain approximately 60 to 70\\\% of predicted indefinitely.However, the mechanisms responsible for improved peak heart rate, VO2peak andtotal exercise time are not completely understood and require furtherinvestigation. Recent studies have also demonstrated that resistance exercisetraining may be an effective countermeasure for corticosteroid-inducedosteoporosis and skeletal muscle myopathy. HTR who participate in specificresistance training programmes successfully restore bone mineral density (BMD) inboth the axial and appendicular skeleton to pretransplantation levels, increaselean mass to levels greater than pretransplantation, and reduce body fat.

Thus, a surgical program for treatment of advanced,refractory heart failure was implemented, focusing the efforts on ventricularassist device (VAD) therapy. The program, supported and funded by the nationalhealthcare system, is based on a single, highly specialized surgical Center forthe operation, and on a regional infrastructure for outpatient follow-up.Regional VAD coordinators are educated by the National Center. They are in chargeof regular patient check, anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment prescription, and continuing patients\\ and caregivers\\ education, mainly regarding drivelineexit site dressing and driveline stabilization. From November 2011 to November2013, 95 patients received 100 devices, mainly for left ventricular support(LVAD): HeartMate II, n=70, HeartWare, n=25. Mean age was 49.5 years, and 87.37\\\% of the patients were males. Most patients had INTERMACS profile 4 (55\\\%), followedby 3 and 2 (17\\\% each). Symptomatic and functional improvement are testified bychanges from baseline to month 3 of NYHA functional class (from III-IV to I-II), results of the 6-min walk test (from 152 to 440 m), and NT-proBNP levels (from6997 to 1126 pg/ml).

However, due to the limitedavailability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patientswith refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with theHeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as abridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was aretrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVADimplantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-hearttransplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 yearsold (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heartdisease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], andchemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwentHMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery(21.7\\\%), mediastinal infection (21.7\\\%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinalcollection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1\\\%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0\\\%), and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3\\\%). All patients were dischargedfrom hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced drivelineinfections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to thefollowing conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0\\\%), gastrointestinalbleeding (13.0\\\%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0\\\%), transient ischemic attack(8.7\\\%), arrhythmia (8.7\\\%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aorticregurgitation (8.7\\\%), right ventricular failure (4.3\\\%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3\\\%),and hematuria (4.3\\\%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally NewYork Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient wassuccessfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were twomortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to beeffective in our Asian population.

The question addressed was: Can the temporary use of right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) bridge patients to recovery who suffer acute rightventricular failure after cardiac surgery? More than 183 papers were found using the reported search, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer theclinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patientgroup studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers aretabulated. Indications for surgical intervention included coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement, post-heart transplant and left ventricular assistdevice insertion. Significant reductions in central venous pressure (P = 0.005)and mean pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.01) were reported during and afterRVAD support. Furthermore, increases in right ventricular cardiac output (P <0.05), right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05), right ventricular strokework (P < 0.05) and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (P < 0.05) were alsoseen. Assessment by one study showed that on Day 7 after RVAD removal, the right ventricular ejection fraction had increased by up to 40\\\%. Dynamicechocardiography studies performed before, during and after RVAD placementdemonstrated that after RVAD implantation, right ventricular end-diastolicdimensions (P < 0.05) and right atrial dimensions decreased (P < 0.05) and right ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) increased. Although several studiessuccessfully weaned patients from an RVAD, there were several complications,including bleeding requiring surgical intervention.

While inhospital, patients with a VAD have traditionally been taught by an educator nursewith VAD expertise in preparation for discharge. In 2004, our centre implemented a successful competency-based patient education program in post-heart transplant patients and thought that a similar program may provide increased confidence for bedside nurses to actively participate in VAD patient education prior todischarge. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to create acompetency-based education program that would provide consistency in patientteaching. A questionnaire was developed and completed by 13 bedside nurses. This pre-test questionnaire indicated the need for a systematic and organized approachto VAD patient teaching. Furthermore, adequate resources, consistency in teachingmethods, and feedback were seen to be essential.

However, many Japanese candidates have not received its benefitsdue to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. The heart transplant waiting period in Japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the OrganTransplantation Law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900days because of the increase in candidates. According to the Japanese Transplant Registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (BTT)with a ventricular assist device (VAD), and the average duration of BTT is around800 to 900 days. The excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in Japan even with such a prolonged BTT duration with VADs is confirmation of the excellentclinical results of VAD support. Until April 2011, only the paracorporeal NiproVAD for BTT was covered by Japanese national health insurance. Analysis of theclinical outcome of 303 patients who received a Nipro VAD (for left ventricular[LV] drainage) as BTT showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days(average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68patients (22\\\%) required ongoing VAD support. Thus the Nipro VAD is an excellentparacorporeal device. The 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials of four types of implantable rotary blood pump LVADs (Evaheart, DuraHeart, Jarvik200, HeartMate II) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of BTT usingimplantable LVADs. Only 36 patients in seven Japanese heart centers have receivedimplantable LVADs, and this small number corresponds to the initial learningcurve. Therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use ofcommercially available implantable LVADs becomes more widespread. The longwaiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellentclinical outcomes of VAD therapy in Japan.: 22723614  [pubmed - indexed for medline]616. nihon geka gakkai zasshi. 2012 may;113(3):292-6.[end-stage heart failure].[article in japanese]kyo s(1).author information: (1)department of therapeutic strategy for heart failure, the university of tokyo hospital, tokyo, japan.the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure patients is cardiactransplantation. however, many japanese candidates have not received its benefitsdue to the extreme scarcity of donor hearts. the heart transplant waiting period in japan is prolonged, particularly after the revision of the organtransplantation law in 2010 which meant that patients must wait more than 900days because of the increase in candidates. according to the japanese transplant registry, almost 90\\\% of candidates require bridge transplantation therapy (btt)with a ventricular assist device (vad), and the average duration of btt is around800 to 900 days. the excellent outcome of heart transplant surgery in japan even with such a prolonged btt duration with vads is confirmation of the excellentclinical results of vad support. until april 2011, only the paracorporeal niprovad for btt was covered by japanese national health insurance. analysis of theclinical outcome of 303 patients who received a nipro vad (for left ventricular[lv] drainage) as btt showed that the longest support duration was 1,673 days(average 427 days), 72 patients (24\\\%) received a heart transplant, and 68patients (22\\\%) required ongoing vad support. thus the nipro vad is an excellentparacorporeal device. the 6-year survival rate of 36 patients in clinical trials of four types of implantable rotary blood pump lvads (evaheart, duraheart, jarvik200, heartmate ii) was about 70\\\%, which is an outstanding result of btt usingimplantable lvads. only 36 patients in seven japanese heart centers have receivedimplantable lvads, and this small number corresponds to the initial learningcurve. therefore, the clinical results will improve greatly after the use ofcommercially available implantable lvads becomes more widespread. the longwaiting period for heart transplantation has contributed to the excellentclinical outcomes of vad therapy in japan.',heartDevices

However, thromboembolicevents, bleeding, and infections may have a considerable impact on outcome. Weretrospectively analyzed the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)in nine patients supported by EXCOR Pediatric (Berlin Heart [BH]) VAD in apediatric cardiosurgical intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and March31, 2011 (27 months). Median age was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-11),median weight 7.5 kg (IQR 4.5-8.5). Seven patients were supported with a leftVAD, two with a biventricular VAD (BiVAD). Six patients with a left VAD underwentheart transplant after 89 days (median, IQR 41-143) of support. One patient isstill on the waiting list. All patients with BiVAD died after 12 days ofassistance due to VAD malfunction. Sixteen HAIs were reported in five out of ninepatients (56\\\%). All infected patients were supported by a left VAD. When comparedwith noninfected patients, they had a longer mechanical support period (median131 days, IQR 75-164, vs. 25 days, IQR 11-61, P = 0.03), a longer intensive care unit stay (median 159 days, IQR 85-188, vs. 48 days, IQR 17-87, P = 0.06) and alonger length of hospital stay (median 186 days, IQR 105-222, vs. 64 days, IQR34-113, P = 0.06). Overall, nine mechanical devices were replaced forthromboembolic issues, most of them (67\\\%) in patients with VAD-relatedinfections. Overall, infection rate was 17.6 per 1000 patients days, 1.3 BHendocarditis per 1000 BH days, 4.0 surgical sites infections per 1000 BH days,12.5 central line-associated blood stream infections per 1000 central venouscatheter days, 5 catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1000 urinarycatheter days, and 13.5 ventilator-associated pneumonia cases per 1000 mechanicalventilation days. Overall, VAD-related infections were 5.4 per 1000 BH days. Ofthe 17 isolated pathogens, 53\\\% were Gram-negative rods, with a prevalence ofPseudomonas aeruginosa (35.3\\\%). Four bacteria were multidrug resistant (25\\\%),three were carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (50\\\% of all isolated pseudomonads),and one was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus. VADs used as a bridge to cardiactransplantation are associated with a large number of HAIs. Patients withinfected VADs were admitted for longer time in intensive care and in hospitalwith increased healthcare costs but with no impact on survival.¬© 2011, Copyright the Authors.

We compared theprevalence of aortic insufficiency (AI) after HeartMate II (HMII) vs HeartMateXVE (HMI) support and assessed the role of aortic root diameter and aortic valve opening in the development of AI.METHOD: Pre-operative and post-operative echocardiograms of 93 HMI and 73 HMIIpatients who received implants at our center between January 2004 and September2009 were retrospectively reviewed. After excluding patients with prior orconcurrent surgical manipulation of the aortic valve, with baseline AI, orwithout baseline echoes, 67 HMI and 63 HMII patients were studied. AI was deemed significant if mild to moderate or greater. Pathology reports were reviewed for77 patients who underwent heart transplant.RESULTS: AI developed in 4 of 67 HMI (6.0\\\%) and in 9 of 63 HMII patients (14.3\\\%).The median times to AI development were 48 days for HMI patients and 90 days for HMII patients. For patients who remained on device support at 6 and 12 months,freedom from AI was 94.5\\\% and 88.9\\\% in HMI patients and 83.6\\\% and 75.2\\\% in HMIIpatients (log rank p = 0.194). Aortic root diameters, as determined byechocardiography for the patients with AI, trended to be larger at baseline (3.43¬± 0.43 vs 3.15 ¬± 0.40; p = 0.067) and follow-up (3.58 ¬± 0.54 vs 3.29 ¬± 0.50; p = 0.130) compared with those who did not have AI. Aortic root circumferences wereassessed directly by a pathologist in those patients who underwent transplant andwere significantly larger in HMII patients who had developed AI compared withthose patients who did not (8.44 ¬± 0.89 vs 7.36 ¬± 1.02 cm; p = 0.034).

VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of ourpediatric patients while supported with a VAD.DESIGN: In this prospective study, pediatric patients who underwent VADplacement, and their parents, were administered a generic Pediatric Quality ofLife Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD implant, when feasible, after the acutepostoperative period, and then periodically until heart transplant or death.Their final scores while on support were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls, outpatients with severe heart disease, and childrenafter heart transplant.RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VADsupport greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was 10.0 ¬± 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months. Eleven(85\\\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\\\%) patient remaining alive onsupport. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was 1.4(0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total andphysical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups. Self-reportedpsychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy controls only.Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all three comparisongroups for all three categories (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: A large deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patientssupported by a VAD compared with outpatient management of severe heart disease orpostheart transplant patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group withmore severe heart failure.

De Gasperis, Niguarda Hospital, Milan,Italy. evitali@ospedaleniguarda.itBACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of death in Westerncountries. Heart transplantation currently is the only accepted therapy forpatients with end-stage heart failure, but the supply of donor hearts isinadequate, and different mechanical circulatory support systems have beeninvestigated as bridges to heart transplant.METHODS: Since April 1992, 53 patients (47 men, 6 women, aged 12 to 61 years)received left ventricle mechanical circulatory support as bridge to hearttransplant. The two principal devices used were: the Novacor LVAS in 31 patients and the DeBakey VAD in 11 patients.RESULTS: All patients survived the operation. Mean duration of LVAD support was2.8 +/- 5.6 months. Thirty-seven patients (71.1\\\%) underwent hearttransplantation. Twelve major bleeding episodes occurred in nine patients(16.9\\\%). Globally, major and minor neurologic events occurred in 13 patients(24.5\\\%).

Conventional implantable systems have inherentlimitations that increase morbidity during support. In contrast, small,efficient, axial-flow pumps, which have been under development for the pastdecade, have the potential to improve the length and quality of life in patients with severe heart failure. Methods and Results- To assess the safety and clinicalutility of the Jarvik 2000, we implanted this device in 10 transplant candidates (mean age 51.3 years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV. Implantationwas achieved through a left thoracotomy during partial cardiopulmonary bypass.The mean support period was 84 days. Within 48 hours postoperatively, the cardiacindex increased 43\\\%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased 52\\\%, systemicvascular resistance decreased significantly, and inotropic support becameunnecessary. Eight patients underwent physical rehabilitation and returned toNYHA class I. Their left ventricular dimensions, cardiothoracic ratios, andpressure-volume loop analyses showed good left ventricular unloading. Sevenpatients underwent transplantation and 3 died during support. No devicethrombosis was observed at explantation.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 functions as a true assist device by partiallyunloading the left ventricle, thereby optimizing the patient\\s hemodynamics.

In this retrospectiveanalysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated withintermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy.METHODS AND RESULTS: 117 consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at ourintensive care heart failure unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients(12¬†\\\%) were stabilized and delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103patients (age 42¬†¬±¬†15¬†years), different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone,adrenaline, noradrenaline, levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\\sspecific characteristics.

Long-term implantable cardiac assist devices for smaller adolescentpatients are not yet available in the United States.METHODS: This study reviews the experience with patients less than 21 years oldthat received HeartMate LVADs (TCI) at our institution. Twelve patients wereimplanted with 13 LVADs. The patients ranged in age from 11 to 20 years (mean 16 years). Body surface area ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 m2 (mean 1.8 m2). Patients were selected for LVAD placement based on eligibility for heart transplant andevidence of end-organ dysfunction. Device placement in small patients wasfacilitated with prosthetic graft abdominal wall closure. No patient receivedsystemic anticoagulation.RESULTS: The duration of LVAD support ranged from 0 to 397 days (mean 123 days). Seven of the 8 patients eligible for discharge from the hospital with avented-electric LVAD were supported at home while awaiting transplantation.Outcomes of LVAD support were: LVAD explantation in 2 cases (15\\\%), expirationwith LVAD in place in 3 cases (23\\\%), and successful transplantation in 8 cases(62\\\%).

Equally important, these centersdo not have easy access to effective cardiac replacement options, includingimplantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and heart transplantation.METHODS: A referral network based upon the use of implantable LVADs as a bridgeto transplantation in patients with postcardiotomy heart failure was established in the New York City region. Cardiac surgery centers were encouraged to contactour center early following any failed cardiotomy.RESULTS: Forty-four patients entered our postcardiotomy network: 12 recoveredwithout an implantable LVAD, 23 received implantable LVADs, and six expiredwithout long-term LVAD support. Of the 44 referrals, 29 (66\\\%) survived tohospital discharge.

De Gasperis Center, NiguardaHospital, Milan, Italy.BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure refractory to optimal oral pharmacologic therapy have a dismal short term prognosis. Heart transplantation is the onlytherapy shown to improve survival in these patients. Unfortunately, due to thecritical shortage of donor organs, approximately 30\\\% of listed patients withend-stage heart failure die before a suitable donor heart becomes available. The principal aim of this study was to determine whether intravenous pharmacologiccirculatory support favorably influences the clinical course of heart transplant candidates or whether mechanical circulatory support should be instituted in thishigh risk patient population.METHODS: Data from 154 consecutive hospitalizations in 125 patients 49+/-12 yearswere retrospectively reviewed. The product limit method was used to estimatesurvival. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the clinicaland hemodynamic variables that independently predict outcome after each admissionin which heart transplantation did not occur.RESULTS: One year survival for the study population was 65\\\%. This survival issignificantly lower than the 91\\\% 1 year survival in similarly ill patientsundergoing heart transplantation. The Cox proportional hazard method identifiedserum bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum sodium levels and right atrial pressure as independent prognostic indices. Serum bilirubin, BUN levels andduration of intravenous pharmacologic circulatory support were associated with a poor outcome. A composite index including serum bilirubin and BUN levelspredicted outcome with a sensitivity and specificity of 79\\\% and 77\\\%,respectively. The addition of pharmacologic support duration increased themodel\\s sensitivity to 95\\\%, but did not significantly alter specificity that was 74\\\%. Of the 125 patients hospitalized due to the need to initiate intravenouspharmacologic support for the first time (index hospitalization), 69 (55\\\%) weredischarged after optimization of medical therapy. Of 21 patients who did notundergo transplantation during the follow-up period, 18 (86\\\%) died within 2 yearsof the index hospitalization. The duration of intravenous pharmacologic supportbeyond which prognosis dramatically worsens without heart transplantation is 21days.CONCLUSION: Heart transplant candidates who require intravenous pharmacologiccirculatory support for more than 21 days and do not receive a suitable donorheart within this period of time have a high mortality.

Initial experience with theimplantable LVAD used as a bridge to heart transplantation provides a clinicalopportunity to study the function of the device and adaptation by the patient.METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen heart transplant candidates (mean age, 50 years; 17males) underwent insertion of the HeartMate LVAD as a bridge to hearttransplantation from December 1991 to November 1993. All patients were incardiogenic shock on inotropes, and 16 (84\\\%) were on an intra-aortic balloonpump. Three patients died because of multiple organ failure; all had rightventricular (RV) dysfunction (2 required RV assist devices). Sixteen patients(84\\\%) improved markedly and were rehabilitated to New York Heart Associationfunctional class I-II. Three patients are still on support. Significantimprovements in hemodynamic function (based on analysis of the percent changefrom pre-LVAD condition to pretransplantation) were observed: cardiac index rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.9 L/min per m2 (P = .0002), left atrial pressurefell from 22.9 +/- 9.5 to 8.0 +/- 5.5 mm Hg (P = .003), RV ejection fractionincreased from 19.8 +/- 11.3\\\% to 40.8 +/- 8.9\\\% (P = .0004), pulmonary vascularresistance decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 Wood units (P = .004).Thirteen patients had successful transplants after a mean duration of 66 days on the LVAD (range, 22 to 101 days). There were no thromboembolic events while thepatients were on the LVAD. Only aspirin with dipyridamole was given foranticoagulation during a total of > 1100 patient days of support.CONCLUSIONS: Bridge to transplant implantable LVAD experience indicates thathemodynamic improvement should be significant after insertion of the devices and that the risk of thromboembolic events with the HeartMate LVAD should beextremely low. Rehabilitation and quality of life should be markedly improved.Limitations of extrapolating this clinical experience to the permanentimplantable LVAD include that these patients were hospitalized (permanentimplants will be outpatients); the \\\"vented-electric\\\" HeartMate LVAD was nottested (it is a portable, battery-powered device), and true \\\"chronic\\\" LVADsupport (> 1 year) was not tested, so questions regarding long-term devicereliability and the chronic risk of infection are unknown.: 7955291  [pubmed - indexed for medline]2008. circulation. 1994 nov;90(5 pt 2):ii83-6.implantable left ventricular assist device. approaching an alternative forend-stage heart failure. implantable lvad study group.mccarthy pm(1), james kb, savage rm, vargo r, kendall k, harasaki h, hobbs re,pashkow fj.author information: (1)department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, cleveland clinicfoundation, ohio 44195.background: the implantable left ventricular assist device (lvad) was designed toprovide circulatory support as an alternative to heart transplantation or tocontinued medical therapy of end-stage heart failure. initial experience with theimplantable lvad used as a bridge to heart transplantation provides a clinicalopportunity to study the function of the device and adaptation by the patient.methods and results: nineteen heart transplant candidates (mean age, 50 years; 17males) underwent insertion of the heartmate lvad as a bridge to hearttransplantation from december 1991 to november 1993. all patients were incardiogenic shock on inotropes, and 16 (84\\\%) were on an intra-aortic balloonpump. three patients died because of multiple organ failure; all had rightventricular (rv) dysfunction (2 required rv assist devices). sixteen patients(84\\\%) improved markedly and were rehabilitated to new york heart associationfunctional class i-ii. three patients are still on support. significantimprovements in hemodynamic function (based on analysis of the percent changefrom pre-lvad condition to pretransplantation) were observed: cardiac index rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.9 l/min per m2 (p = .0002), left atrial pressurefell from 22.9 +/- 9.5 to 8.0 +/- 5.5 mm hg (p = .003), rv ejection fractionincreased from 19.8 +/- 11.3\\\% to 40.8 +/- 8.9\\\% (p = .0004), pulmonary vascularresistance decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 wood units (p = .004).thirteen patients had successful transplants after a mean duration of 66 days on the lvad (range, 22 to 101 days). there were no thromboembolic events while thepatients were on the lvad. only aspirin with dipyridamole was given foranticoagulation during a total of > 1100 patient days of support.conclusions: bridge to transplant implantable lvad experience indicates thathemodynamic improvement should be significant after insertion of the devices and that the risk of thromboembolic events with the heartmate lvad should beextremely low. rehabilitation and quality of life should be markedly improved.limitations of extrapolating this clinical experience to the permanentimplantable lvad include that these patients were hospitalized (permanentimplants will be outpatients); the \\\"vented-electric\\\" heartmate lvad was nottested (it is a portable, battery-powered device), and true \\\"chronic\\\" lvadsupport (> 1 year) was not tested, so questions regarding long-term devicereliability and the chronic risk of infection are unknown.',heartSurgery

Electronicaddress: aileen.clarke@warwick.ac.uk.Comment in    J Heart Lung Transplant. 2014 Apr;33(4):344-6.BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced heart failure may receive a left ventricularassist device (LVAD) as part of a bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy. The UnitedKingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton,CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed tocompare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program.METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Basewere analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomeswere time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences ofHT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistateeconomic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was fromthe NHS, discount rates were 3.5\\\%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years(QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB¬£) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs HMII.RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulativeincidence of HT was low for both groups (11\\\% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued4.99 lifetime QALYs costing ¬£258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84QALYs costing ¬£231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for HWvs HM II were ¬£23,530 ($37,349) and ¬£20,799 ($33,014), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a betterclinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was morecost-effective.

However, there are only limited data on MV support among children after ventricular assist device(VAD) implantation. We report the duration of MV after VAD placement, indicationsfor respiratory support in the postimplantation period, and associated patientfactors.METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 43 consecutive children (aged <18 years) with end-stage heart failure who were supported with a VAD as a bridge to transplantation from January 2005 to December 2011. Multivariableanalysis was performed using the multiple Poisson regression model for theduration of MV.RESULTS: Overall, 33\\\% (n¬†= 14) remained on MV until heart transplant or death. Ofthose requiring pre-VAD extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, 63\\\%(n¬†= 12 of 19) remained on MV until heart transplant or death compared with 8\\\%(n¬†= 2 of 24) among those not on ECMO before VAD (p < 0.001). Patients withmoderate or severe mitral regurgitation while on VAD support had 1.7-times moreMV days compared with those with none or trivial on-VAD mitral regurgitation. In addition, previous support on ECMO, those with moderate or severe tricuspidregurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants had an increased risk ofprolonged MV.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VAD recipients previously supported onECMO, those with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, moderate or severetricuspid regurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants had an increasedrisk of prolonged MV.

However,survival is poorer in HHTx recipients, and with improving results in continuousflow ventricular assist devices (VADs), many patients can be bridged to allownormalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic hearttransplant (OHTx) candidates. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyse thesurvival of our HHTx cohort and compare them with our VAD bridge patients.METHODS: A retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 OHTx and 27HHTx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124bridge-to-transplant VAD patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received an OHTx. Pulmonary artery pressures before and after VAD implant were analysed.Survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: HHTx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older, smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the OHTx cohort. Comparison ofthe VAD types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longertime supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than thepulsatile devices. The continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonaryartery pressures pretransplant. The HHTx cohort had a significantly poorersurvival than the OHTx cohort (P=0.002). Survival on a continuous device and thenOHTx was significantly better than either HHTx or pulsatile device support.CONCLUSIONS: The main indication for HHTx, namely fixed elevated pulmonaryhypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.: 23731606  [pubmed - indexed for medline]432. eur j cardiothorac surg. 2014 feb;45(2):372-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezt281. epub2013 may 31.heterotopic heart transplant: is there an indication in the continuous flowventricular assist device era?marasco sf(1), bell d, lee g, bailey m, bergin p, esmore ds.author information: (1)cardiothoracic surgery unit, the alfred hospital, melbourne, australia.objectives: heterotopic heart transplantation (hhtx) is a therapeutic option inheart failure patients with fixed elevated pulmonary hypertension. however,survival is poorer in hhtx recipients, and with improving results in continuousflow ventricular assist devices (vads), many patients can be bridged to allownormalization of pulmonary artery pressures, making them orthotopic hearttransplant (ohtx) candidates. thus, the aim of this study was to analyse thesurvival of our hhtx cohort and compare them with our vad bridge patients.methods: a retrospective review of 342 heart transplant patients (315 ohtx and 27hhtx) performed at our institution over 15 years was compared with 124bridge-to-transplant vad patients over the same time period, of whom 69 received an ohtx. pulmonary artery pressures before and after vad implant were analysed.survival was analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses.results: hhtx recipients were significantly older, and the donor allografts were older, smaller and had longer ischaemic times than the ohtx cohort. comparison ofthe vad types implanted (pulsatile vs continuous) showed significantly longertime supported on the continuous devices with significantly fewer deaths than thepulsatile devices. the continuous devices were successful in reducing pulmonaryartery pressures pretransplant. the hhtx cohort had a significantly poorersurvival than the ohtx cohort (p=0.002). survival on a continuous device and thenohtx was significantly better than either hhtx or pulsatile device support.conclusions: the main indication for hhtx, namely fixed elevated pulmonaryhypertension in heart failure patients, can be safely and effectively treated by continuous flow bridge to transplant with superior survival.',heartSurgery

To reduce mortality, theintroduction of post-transplant survival in an allocation model based on theconcept of survival benefit might be more appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic accuracy of the heart failure survival score (HFSS), theSeattle heart failure model (SHFM), the Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) model, and the index for mortalityprediction after cardiac transplantation (IMPACT) score for predicting mortality.METHODS: The HFSS, SHFM, the adapted SHFM, and the INTERMACS model were evaluatedfor predicting waiting list mortality among heart transplant candidates, and the IMPACT score was tested for predicting post-transplant mortality in separate Cox regression models. Included were the 448 adult heart transplant candidates listedfor an urgent status between October 2010 and June 2011 in Eurotransplant. Acardiac allocation score (CAS) was calculated based on the estimated survivaltimes as predicted by the scores. All analyses were performed for the totalcohort and separately for ventricular assist device (VAD) and non-VAD patients.RESULTS: Mortality on the waiting list could significantly be predicted in thenon-VAD cohort by HFSS (p = 0.005) and SHFM (p < 0.0001) and after transplant by IMPACT (p < 0.0001).

Unloading of the left ventricle with animplantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonaryvascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in acohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy.METHODS: Pulmonary haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eightHeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplantby virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4\\\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\\\%(24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortalitywas 7.7\\\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\\\% (10 of 11).

Studies have suggested that outcomes after VAD implantation may bedependent on institutional procedural volume, and outcome data fromnon-transplant centres are lacking. This study reviews the outcomes of patientswho received a long-term VAD at our centre to determine if these devices can besafely implanted at tertiary care, low-volume, non-transplant centres.METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study, examining theclinical outcomes of consecutive patients who received a long-term VAD over a42-month period.RESULTS: During the study period 73 patients required MCS, of whom 16 received a long-term VAD. This select group had a mean Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile of 1.6 (0.9) and beforeimplantation 94\\\% required at least 1 inotropic medication, 69\\\% had suffered acardiac arrest, 63\\\% required an intra-aortic balloon pump, 69\\\% requiredmechanical ventilation, and 44\\\% required short-term MCS. The primary outcome ofsurvival to transplant or ongoing MCS at 1 year was achieved in 75\\\% of patients. Operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital survival were 100\\\%, 88\\\%, and81\\\%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term VADs can be implanted at low-volume, nontransplant centreswith survival rates comparable with contemporary clinical trials.

We analyzed the effect on PVR of pretransplantLVAD therapy in patients with PH and compared posttransplant outcome with matchedcontrols. Long-term survival was compared between heart transplant recipientswith mild, moderate or severe PH and patients with no PH.METHODS: Heart transplant recipients 1988-2007 (n=405) were reviewed and divided into two groups with respect to pretransplant PVR: <2.5 WU (n=148) and >2.5 WU(n=158). From the group with PH, patients subjected to pretransplant LVAD therapy(n=11) were analyzed with respect to PVR at implant and at transplant and, withrespect to outcome, compared to matched historical controls (n=22). Patients withPH without LVAD treatment (n=147) were stratified into three subgroups: mild,moderate and severe PH and survival according to Kaplan-Meier was analyzed andcompared to patients with no PH.RESULTS: LVAD therapy reduced PVR from 4.3+/-1.6 to 2.0+/-0.6 WU, p<0.05. Threecases of perioperative heart failure required mechanical support whereas onecontrol patient developed perioperative right heart failure requiring mechanical support. The incidence of other perioperative complications was comparablebetween groups. There was no difference in survival between LVAD patients andcontrols, 30-day survival was 82\\\% and 91\\\%, respectively and 4-year survival was64\\\% and 82\\\%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant LVAD therapy reduces an elevated PVR in hearttransplant recipients, but there was no statistically significant difference inposttransplant survival in patients with PH with, or without LVAD therapy.

We report on our experience in the pediatric population.METHODS: Retrospective review of 27 consecutive children offered mechanicalsupport with Berlin Heart as a bridge to heart transplant, and Jarvik 2000 as adestination therapy from February 2002 to October 2011.RESULTS: The median patient age was 4.8 years (range = 75 days to 20.5 years).The median patient weight was 18.6 kg (range = 2.9-63 kg). We divided thepatients in two groups, including in group I patients assisted for bridging toheart transplantation and in group II patients with Duchenne\\s dystrophy assistedas destination therapy. In the group I, 11 patients required biventricularmechanical support (BVAD), but in all other cases, a single left VAD provedsufficient (56\\\%). The median duration of VAD support was 48 days (1 to 192 days).The median pre-VAD pulmonary vascular resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5to 14.4 WU/m(2)). Twelve patients (48\\\%) were successfully bridged to hearttransplantation after a median duration of mechanical support of 63 days (range =2-168 days). Ten deaths occurred (40\\\%), three for neurological complications, twofor sepsis, two for multiorgan failure, and three other for devicemalfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our patients has increased from 33\\\% to 75\\\%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from 89\\\% to 23\\\%. In the group II,two patients with mean age of 15.3 years were assisted with Jarvik 2000, and bothof them are alive in a follow-up of 10.4 months. In two patients with Rpi > 10WU/m(2), unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilatator therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2 WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of BVAD support, respectively. Six patients (32\\\%) required at least one pump change. Of 12 patients undergoing hearttransplantation, five developed an extremely elevated (>60\\\%) panel-reactiveantibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed by Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of rejection in the first month afterheart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The survival rate after hearttransplantation was 100\\\% with a median follow-up of 34.4 months (45 days to 8.7years).CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in children with end-stage heart failure is aneffective strategy as a bridge to heart transplantation with a reasonablemorbidity and mortality.

These devices have clear advantages over extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and are often used in adults. They are only recently being commonly used in the pediatric age group. As the use of LVADs becomes more mainstream in children, it is important to determine the complication profileassociated with these devices. Furthermore, with the increasing application ofLVADs in children, pediatric neurosurgeons are seeing a correlative increase inassociated neurological complications. In this study, the authors reviewed theincidence of neurological complications due to LVAD use in the pediatric agegroup and the role of neurosurgery in treatment.METHODS: The authors examined data regarding patients with LVADs from the TexasChildren\\s Hospital Heart Center database (July 01, 2007, to June 30, 2011) andrecorded neurological complications requiring neurosurgical consultation. Theyidentified 2 children who underwent craniotomies during LVAD treatment.RESULTS: Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3 (6.5\\\%) of the 46 patients treated with an LVAD at the authors\\ institution. Of these patients, 2 were treated with craniotomies for life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages. The 3 patients in theneurosurgical cohort presented with cerebral infarction, decreased level ofconsciousness, and/or seizure. At the last follow-up (286, 503, and 550 days), 1 patient (case 2) had no decline in neurological status, underwent a successfulheart transplant, and was discharged home; 1 patient (case 1) died of refractory cardiac failure; and 1 patient (case 3) was on an LVAD for destination therapy(that is, the LVAD is not a bridge to transplantation but rather the finaltreatment). This patient was discharged from the hospital, but he died ofoverwhelming fungemia at 286 days while on VAD support.CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious and feared complication of LVADtreatment.

Once haemodynamic stability has been established with a ventricular assist device (VAD), the decision to wait for myocardialrecovery as opposed to listing for an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can bedifficult. We have undertaken this study to establish the criteria fordetermining the need for heart transplantation following VAD implant forfulminant myocarditis.METHODS: A total of 442 VADs were implanted between 1993 and 2011. Twenty-fourVADs were implanted for fulminant myocarditis with refractory cardiogenic shock. We retrospectively analysed the variables and the pathology for this cohort.Patients who had a full recovery of myocardial function and subsequent VADexplant (Explant) were compared with those bridged to OHT. There was one acutedeath.RESULTS: There was no difference in the past medical history between the groups. Explant patients had a more acute onset of heart failure with a median of 7 days between the onset of symptoms and VAD implant, when compared with 22 days for OHT(P = 0.01). A rapid recovery in myocardial function was seen in the Explantgroup, with recovery of myocardial function (ejection fraction = 53 ¬± 24\\\%) in 14 ¬± 7 days. Myocardial function was sustained for 5 years following the VADexplant. The female gender favoured myocardial recovery and VAD explantability.Two patients had giant cell myocarditis, neither of whom had a recovery offunction, and they were bridged to heart transplant with a VAD.CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant myocarditis is a fatal condition without mechanicalsupport.

Recurrent bleeding was more common in older patients (mean, 70 years;p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60\\\%) rebled from the same site. Managementstrategies included temporarily withholding anticoagulation, decreasing the speedof LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide did not impact the amount of packedred blood cells used, rebleeding rates, length of hospital stay, or all-causemortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct consequence of GI bleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors account for GI bleeding in patients on CF-VADs.

We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwentimplantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile(HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and theeffect on body mass index (BMI).METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30¬†kg/m(2) who underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for weight change. In the 30-daysurvivors, end points of the study were continued LVAD support, heart transplant,or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass surgery and was excluded.RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria, BMI was 35.6 ¬±4.4¬†kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 ¬± 5.5¬†kg/m(2) (mean BMIchange¬†-2.5¬†kg/m(2); P¬†= .063), with a mean follow-up time of 301.6 ¬± 255.5 days.The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9¬†kg/m(2) (P¬†= .016 vsbaseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1¬†kg/m(2) increase in BMI.BMI¬†<30¬†kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\\\%), 5 of 19 (26\\\%) inXVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\\\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 XVE, 2 HMII) or50\\\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was 4.6¬†kg/m(2)(P¬†= .003).CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30¬†kg/m(2) provided significantweight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in recipients of the continuousflow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a heart transplant after LVADinsertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6¬†kg/m(2) (P¬†= .003). LVAD implantationprovides a period of hemodynamic support for obese patients with advanced heartfailure, during which time opportunity may be available for weight loss.Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater weight loss thannonpulsatile continuous flow devices.

Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II(HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD.METHODS: This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patientstransplanted during 2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were dividedinto two groups according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) orrequired additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were comparedfor early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major earlypost-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival.RESULTS: Early graft loss was 10.7\\\% in isolated HMII and 25\\\% in HMII + RVADpatients (P = 0.26). There were no observed differences in the rates of primarygraft dysfunction (7.3 vs 0\\\%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5\\\%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25\\\%, P = 0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary arteryresistance (odds ratio: 3.286, 95\\\% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant predictor for adverse outcome ofmechanically-bridged heart transplant recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 ¬± 5\\\% in isolated HMII and 75 ¬± 15\\\% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that heart transplant recipients who requiredunplanned RV mechanical support after LVAD implantation achieved comparable ratesof early graft loss, post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-yeargraft survival was equivalent between those two groups. Given the small samplesize, further studies involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.¬© The Author 2014.

Inrecent years, the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD)has emerged as a potential treatment option. Systematic data on the safety andefficacy of the EXCOR are limited.METHODS: The Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical study is designed toevaluate the safety and probable benefit of the EXCOR to support regulatoryreview of the device under the Humanitarian Device Exemption regulation. Thestudy design and rationale are reviewed in light of the well-described challengesinherent in small population studies.RESULTS: The Berlin Heart EXCOR IDE clinical study is a prospective, multicenter,single-arm, clinical cohort study. Children aged 0 to 16 years with severe heart failure (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Supportprofile 1 or 2) due to 2-ventricle heart disease and actively listed for HTcomprise the primary study cohort. The control population is a propensity-matchedretrospective cohort of children supported with extracorporeal membraneoxygenation, the only bridge device available to smaller children before theEXCOR. The primary efficacy end point is survival to heart transplantation orrecovery. The primary safety end point is the incidence of serious adverse eventsas defined by pediatric Interagency Registry for Mechanically AssistedCirculatory Support criteria. The study will enroll a total of 48 subjects in 2cohorts based on body surface area (cohort 1 <0.7 m(2), cohort 2 0.7-1.5 m(2))and is powered to show safety superiority to a prespecified performance goal of0.25 serious adverse events per day of support. Children ineligible for theprimary cohort will still have access to the device in a third compassionate-use cohort where adverse event data will be collected for additional safetycharacterization of the device.CONCLUSION: The Berlin Heart IDE clinical study will be the first bridge-to-HTVAD study designed exclusively for children. It is anticipated that the studywill provide important information on the safety and efficacy of the Berlin HeartEXCOR Pediatric in children while providing valuable lessons into the design and conduct of future VAD studies in children.Copyright ¬© 2011 Mosby, Inc.

The aim of the present study was toinvestigate the effects of myocardial redox state on the activities of MMP-2 and -9 implicated in cardiac remodeling in end-stage heart failure patients supportedby left ventricular assist device (LVAD).METHODS AND RESULTS: During heart transplant (HT) surgery, myocardial specimens(MS) from right ventricular walls and LV walls were obtained from 7 LVADrecipients (LVAD group, MS n=35) and from 7 stable HT candidates on medicaltherapy (MT group, MS n=35). Myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression,tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and -4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-Œ≤1 and aminothiol concentrations were measured. MMP-2 and -9 activities were evaluatedalso by incubating MS with different amounts of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH). MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression were lower in the LVAD group,whereas myocardial TIMP-1 and -4 concentrations were comparable to those of MTpatients. Higher GSH and TGF-Œ≤1 concentrations were found in LVAD-recipients.Only GSH concentrations were inversely related to MMP-2 and -9 activities. Invitro, GSH had an inhibitory effect on MMP-2 and -9 activities.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD recipients show reduced myocardial MMP-2 and -9 activities and expression when compared to medically treated patients. Changes of myocardialredox state, predominantly GSH-dependent, appear to modulate MMP-2 and -9activities by an inhibitory effect dependent on thiol content.

We analyzed our center\\s resultsfollowing implantation of a biventricular assist device (BVAD).METHODS: We implanted 39 BVADs between September 2001 and January 2009. Allpatients were qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organavailable at time of BVAD implantation. Fifteen patients without a history ofchronic cardiomyopathy suffered from acute BV failure (group 1), whereas theother 24 suffered from severe chronic cardiomyopathy (group 2). The indicationfor BVAD implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degreeof end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was a candidate for bridge to recovery.RESULTS: Both groups were similar regarding their preoperative hemodynamics,intraoperative and early postoperative findings, and adverse events. Patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37¬±17 years) than those in group 2 (51¬±12 years). Mean duration of support in group 1 was 137¬±109 days, and 65¬±61 days in group 2. In group 1, 33\\\% (5/15) were weaned off the device and 53\\\% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24 patients (42\\\%) in the chronic group weretransplanted. Group 1\\s mortality on the device was lower than that of group 2(13\\\% vs 67\\\%). Furthermore, 11 patients of group 1 survived for 1 year comparedwith four in group 2 (73\\\% vs 17\\\%).CONCLUSION: Implantation of a BVAD in patients with chronic heart failure andacute decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate.

The effectiveness of hearttransplantation and medical therapy is limited, resulting in the emergence ofmechanical circulatory support as a primary treatment for end-stage heartdisease. Left ventricular assist devices that use rotary pumps are small anddurable, which might reduce morbidity and mortality during support.METHODS: Fifty heart transplant candidates with New York Heart Associationfunctional class IV symptoms were supported at 5 international centers by theHeartWare System for 180 days, until heart transplant, myocardial recovery anddevice explant, or death. Patients who continue to be supported have beenfollowed for a minimum of 2 years.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 20 (40\\\%) received transplants, 4 (8\\\%) had the pumpexplanted after myocardial recovery, and 17 (34\\\%) continue support at 2 years.Nine (18\\\%) patients died during support from sepsis (n = 3), multiple organfailure (n = 3), or hemorrhagic stroke (n = 3).

For both patient groups, the importance ofscreening for and treatment of psychosocial problems and mental disorders tooptimize compliance and survival has been acknowledged. We compared the use ofpsychotherapeutic support by patients with primary HTX, on VAD support, either ondestination therapy or to be transplanted, and successfully bridged totransplant. In addition, we evaluated the use for supportive psychotherapy forthe families of our patients and present two typical cases.METHODS: Patients with primary HTX (HTX(prim), n=16), with VAD on destinationtherapy (VAD(dest), n=15), with VAD waiting for transplant (VAD(htx), n=9), andpatients who have been successfully bridged on VAD to transplant (HTX(vad), n=11)were analyzed during the preoperative and the in-hospital postoperative period.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10) diagnoses, number of contactswith the psychologist, time expenses for individual interventions, familyinterventions, and concomitant communication were assessed.RESULTS: Adjustment disorders were the most prevalent disturbances. HTX(vad)patients needed more psychotherapeutic interventions and required more time forindividual support than HTX(prim) patients. Partners and families of almostone-half of all patients made use of supportive psychotherapy; there were nodifferences between the groups with regard to the needed time. Further, thegroups did not differ in the time expenses for concomitant communication with thepsychologist. At the latest contact with the psychologist, three VAD(dest)patients did not need further psychotherapy at this time; also, one VAD patientwaiting for transplant and two after primary HTX were psychosocially stable.CONCLUSION: Our data reflect the high emotional distress, especially of HTX(vad) patients. Our data suggest further that patients on VAD support experiencepsychosocial and emotional stress as severe as HTX candidates and recipients do. Patients on destination therapy and those who are waiting for transplantation do not differ in this regard. The high complexity of the psychosocial problems ofVAD and HTX patients warrants professional psychotherapeutic support.Copyright ¬© 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

Together with theirpotential for miniaturization, these pumps seem suitable for long-term support ofpatients with a wide range of body surface areas (BSA). Recently, the novel HVAD pump (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA), a miniaturized centrifugal pump with ahydrodynamic, magnetically levitated rotor, became ready for clinicalapplication.METHODS: In a multi-institutional trial in Europe and Australia, 23 patients(mean age, 47.9 ¬± 12 years) in end-stage heart failure were enrolled in 5centers. The primary end point of the bridge-to-transplant study was survival to heart transplant or survival to 180 days on the device, whichever occurred first.Follow-up data at 1 year are presented. The small size of the device allows forintrapericardial placement of the pump.RESULTS: Implant procedures were generally fast and uneventful. Mean duration of support was 167 ¬± 143 days (range, 13-425 days), and mean blood flow provided by the pump was 6.1 ¬± 1.1 liters/min. At the 180-day end point, 2 patients hadundergone successful transplant at 157 and 175 days, 2 patients died while on thedevice, and 19 patients continued pump support for more than 180 days. Actuarial survival after 6 months was 91\\\% and was 86\\\% at the 1-year follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The design of the HVAD pump enables a quick and less invasiveimplantation.

Ventricular assist devices were placed as a bridge totransplant in 110 patients. We focused our analysis on the 2 most common causesof end-stage heart failure requiring transplantation: idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy (n = 201) and coronary artery disease (n = 213). Data includinggender, age, date of transplant, cause of heart failure, prior heart transplant, placement of a ventricular assist device, type of ventricular assist device, and panel-reactive antibody sensitization were analyzed to derive Kaplan-Meiersurvival probabilities and multivariable Cox regression models.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who received aventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant, survival was decreased at 1 year (P = .008) and 5 years (P = .019), but not at 10 years, posttransplant. Inpatients with coronary artery disease, the use of a ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant did not influence survival at 1, 5, and 10 tearsposttransplant.

We sought to determine factors related toposttransplant survival in patients supported with continuous-flow LVADs.METHODS: The HeartMate II LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif) wasimplanted in 468 patients as a bridge to transplant at 36 centers in amulticenter trial. Patients who underwent transplantation after support werestratified by demographics: gender, age, etiology, body mass index, duration ofdevice support, and by adverse events during support. The median age was 54 years(range 18-73 years); 43\\\% had ischemic etiology, and 18\\\% were women. Survival was determined at the specific intervals of 30 days and 1 year after transplantation.RESULTS: Of 468 patients, 250 (53\\\%) underwent cardiac transplant after a medianduration of LVAD support of 151 days (longest: 3.2 years), 106 (23\\\%) died, 12(2.6\\\%) recovered ventricular function and the device was removed, and 100 (21\\\%)were still receiving LVAD support. The overall 30-day and 1-year posttransplantsurvivals were 97\\\% and 87\\\%. There were no significant differences in survivalbased on demographic factors or LVAD duration of less than 30 days, 30 to 90days, 90 to 180 days, and more than 180 days. Patients requiring more than 2units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support had astatistically significant decreased 1-year survival (82\\\% vs 94\\\%) when comparedwith patients who did not require more than 2 units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support (P = .03). There was a trend for slightly lowersurvival at 1 year in patients with percutaneous lead infections during LVADsupport versus no infection (75\\\% vs 89\\\%; P = .07).CONCLUSIONS: Post-cardiac transplant survival in patients supported withcontinuous-flow devices such as the HeartMate II LVAD is equivalent to that with conventional transplantation. Furthermore, posttransplant survival is notinfluenced by the duration of LVAD support. The improved durability and reducedshort- and long-term morbidity associated with the HeartMate II LVAD has reduced the need for urgent cardiac transplantation, which may have adversely influenced survival in the pulsatile LVAD era.

However, it remains to be seen whether newer continuous-flow leftventricular assist devices have a similar effect on pulmonary hypertension. Theobjective of this study was to determine whether the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp,Pleasanton, Calif), a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device, iseffective in improving pulmonary hemodynamics in the period after leftventricular assist device support and posttransplant.METHODS: Fifty patients with end-stage heart failure underwent HeartMate II left ventricular assist device placement as a bridge to transplant. We evaluated theirpulmonary hemodynamics with right-sided heart catheterization at baseline, after left ventricular assist device placement, and after heart transplant.RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 53.7 +/- 13.5 years. Ischemic etiology was present in 60\\\% of the patients. After left ventricular assist device placement(mean duration, 135 +/- 60 days), mean systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterypressures decreased significantly from a baseline of 55.2 +/- 13.4 mm Hg and 27.3+/- 6.8 mm Hg, respectively, to 35.9 +/- 10.8 mm Hg and 15.8 +/- 6.5 mm Hg,respectively (P < .001). Similarly, mean pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly from a baseline of 3.6 +/- 1.9 Woods units to 2.1 +/- 0.8 Woodsunits (P < .001). Posttransplant pulmonary hemodynamics also remained withinnormal limits, even in patients with previously severe pulmonary hypertension.CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices effectively improvepulmonary hemodynamics associated with end-stage heart failure. Moreover,pulmonary hemodynamics remain within normal limits in the posttransplant period, even in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, adequate leftventricular decompression achieved with newer left ventricular assist devices canreverse significant pulmonary hypertension in patients with end-stage heartfailure, making them eligible for cardiac transplantation.Copyright 2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Although cardiac transplantation is anexcellent treatment option, it is a limited resource and most patients areineligible for cardiac transplantation using standard listing criteria.Increasingly, newer surgical options for these patients include the usage ofmarginal donor organs in an extended criteria-alternate list heart transplantprogram (EC-AL), or left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy(DT-LVAD). The purpose of this study was to compare baseline characteristics and outcomes after EC-AL versus DT-LVAD.METHODS: From March 2000 to August 2008, 153 consecutive patients who had beenturned down for standard heart transplantation underwent either EC-AL or DT-LVAD.The most common reasons for standard heart transplant ineligibility for bothgroups were advanced age, diabetes mellitus with end-organ dysfunction, andsignificant renal insufficiency. Patients in the alternate list program received a donor organ that had been turned down by all other centers for standard listrecipients. The most common reasons for donor heart refusal were decreased leftventricular function, left ventricle hypertrophy, or coronary artery disease.Outcomes for both groups were retrospectively reviewed after Institutional ReviewBoard permission was obtained. Comparisons were also made between patients thathad been matched by propensity score analysis.RESULTS: In all, 93 patients underwent EC-AL, and 60 underwent DT-LVAD. Baseline preoperative characteristics of both groups were similar except that 87\\\% ofDT-LVAD patients (52 of 60) required preoperative mechanical or inotropic supportwhereas only 51\\\% of EC-AL patients (47 of 93) required support (p<0.0001).Thirty-day operative mortality and 1-year survival were 2.5\\\% and 82.2\\\% for EC-AL and 6.7\\\% and 77.5\\\% DT-LVAD, respectively (p=0.2411 and p=0.5036). Overallsurvival at 3 years was better for EC-AL versus DT-LVAD. The DT-LVAD patients hadimproved survival compared with the Randomized Evaluation of MechanicalAssistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial DT-LVAD cohort, a historical control. These findings were corroborated in the analysis ofpropensity-matched patients.CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively, the DT-LVAD cohort was more unstable, with greaterneed for inotropes or mechanical support. Despite this, perioperative and 1-year mortality was similar for the two groups. Three-year survival was better forEC-AL. The DT-LVAD patient survival was better than that of the REMATCH DT-LVADcohort.Copyright (c) 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy ofstandard adult VADs in adolescents and children as well as report our earlyexperience with miniaturized VADs in small children.METHODS: A 15-year retrospective review was performed on all patients youngerthan 18 years of age undergoing insertion of a pulsatile VAD at our institution.RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent VAD placement during the study period. Themean age was 12 (range, 6 months to 18 years), with a mean body surface area of1.48 (range, 0.25 to 2.3 m2). Diagnoses included dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 15),myocarditis (n = 2), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure (n = 1). Ten childrenunderwent insertion of biventricular VADs, and 8 had implantation of leftventricular VADs. The mean support duration was 57 days (range, 2 to 175 days).Complications included bleeding requiring reoperation (n = 4), stroke (n = 5),and device-related infection (n = 2). Outcomes of VAD support were as follows:VAD explantation in 1 case, death while receiving mechanical support in 3patients, and successful transplantation in 14 patients (77\\\%). Survival at 6months after orthotopic heart transplantation was 93\\\% with 1-year and 5-yearsurvival rates of 83\\\%.CONCLUSIONS: Currently available VADs are applicable for use as a bridge toorthotopic heart transplantation or in rare instances for myocardial recovery.The increasing accessibility of miniaturized devices allow for long-term support in smaller children and infants while awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation.
