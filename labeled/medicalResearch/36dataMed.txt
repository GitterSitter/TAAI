Recently, continuous flow VAD (CVAD) has emerged as an attractive      clinical option for long-term mechanical support of HF patients, with      bridge-to-transplant outcomes comparable with pulsatile flow VAD (PVAD).      Continuous flow VADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than the      first-generation PVAD. Despite the widespread clinical use, CVAD support has been      associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, and aortic valve       insufficiency. Speculation that diminished arterial pressure pulsatility      associated with continuous flow devices may be contributing to these      complications has sparked much debate over CVAD support. Studies comparing      pulsatile flow and continuous flow (CF) support have presented conflicting      findings, and the relevance to CVAD as DT is uncertain due to variations in      device operation, support duration, and the criteria used to quantify      pulsatility. Currently, there is interest in developing control algorithms for      CVAD to increase the delivered pulsatility as a strategy to mitigate adverse      event risks associated with CVAD therapy. There may also be the added benefit of       specific control strategies for managing CVAD therapy, potentially improving the       rate of myocardial recovery and successful weaning of mechanical circulatory      support.FAU - Soucy, Kevin GAU  - Soucy KGAD  - Division of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.FAU - Koenig, Steven CAU  - Koenig SCFAU - Giridharan, Guruprasad AAU  - Giridharan GAFAU - Sobieski, Michael AAU  - Sobieski MAFAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cardiovascular Diseases/surgeryMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - *Models, CardiovascularMH  - Pulsatile Flow/*physiologyMH  - PulseEDAT- 2013/07/04 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/22 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/04 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f9bb3 [doi]AID - 00002480-201307000-00002 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2013 Jul-Aug;59(4):355-66. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f9bb3.- 23820272own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130703dcom- 20131021is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 59ip  - 4dp  - 2013 jul-augti  - rotary pumps and diminished pulsatility: do we need a pulse?pg  - 355-66lid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e31829f9bb3 [doi]ab  - ventricular assist devices (vads) have been successfully used as a bridge to      heart transplant and destination therapy (dt) for congestive heart failure (hf)      patients. recently, continuous flow vad (cvad) has emerged as an attractive      clinical option for long-term mechanical support of hf patients, with      bridge-to-transplant outcomes comparable with pulsatile flow vad (pvad).      continuous flow vads are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than the      first-generation pvad. despite the widespread clinical use, cvad support has been      associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, and aortic valve       insufficiency. speculation that diminished arterial pressure pulsatility      associated with continuous flow devices may be contributing to these      complications has sparked much debate over cvad support. studies comparing      pulsatile flow and continuous flow (cf) support have presented conflicting      findings, and the relevance to cvad as dt is uncertain due to variations in      device operation, support duration, and the criteria used to quantify      pulsatility. currently, there is interest in developing control algorithms for      cvad to increase the delivered pulsatility as a strategy to mitigate adverse      event risks associated with cvad therapy. there may also be the added benefit of       specific control strategies for managing cvad therapy, potentially improving the       rate of myocardial recovery and successful weaning of mechanical circulatory      support.fau - soucy, kevin gau  - soucy kgad  - division of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, university of louisville,      louisville, kentucky 40202, usa.fau - koenig, steven cau  - koenig scfau - giridharan, guruprasad aau  - giridharan gafau - sobieski, michael aau  - sobieski mafau - slaughter, mark sau  - slaughter msla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109sb  - immh  - animalsmh  - cardiovascular diseases/surgerymh  - equipment designmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - *models, cardiovascularmh  - pulsatile flow/*physiologymh  - pulseedat- 2013/07/04 06:00mhda- 2013/10/22 06:00crdt- 2013/07/04 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e31829f9bb3 [doi]aid - 00002480-201307000-00002 [pii]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2013 jul-aug;59(4):355-66. doi: 10.1097/mat.0b013e31829f9bb3.
