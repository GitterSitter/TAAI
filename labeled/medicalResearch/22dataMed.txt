J Card Surg. 2003 Mar-Apr;18(2):107-13.Left ventricular assist devices as bridge to heart transplantation: The Niguarda Experience.Vitali E(1), Lanfranconi M, Bruschi G, Russo C, Colombo T, Ribera E.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, A. De Gasperis, Niguarda Hospital, Milan,Italy. evitali@ospedaleniguarda.itBACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of death in Westerncountries. Heart transplantation currently is the only accepted therapy forpatients with end-stage heart failure, but the supply of donor hearts isinadequate, and different mechanical circulatory support systems have beeninvestigated as bridges to heart transplant.METHODS: Since April 1992, 53 patients (47 men, 6 women, aged 12 to 61 years)received left ventricle mechanical circulatory support as bridge to hearttransplant. The two principal devices used were: the Novacor LVAS in 31 patients and the DeBakey VAD in 11 patients.RESULTS: All patients survived the operation. Mean duration of LVAD support was2.8 +/- 5.6 months. Thirty-seven patients (71.1\%) underwent hearttransplantation. Twelve major bleeding episodes occurred in nine patients(16.9\%). Globally, major and minor neurologic events occurred in 13 patients(24.5\%). Ten patients (19.9\%) assisted with the Novacor Wearable LVAS device weredischarged at home while waiting for heart transplant (HTx). The mean follow-upof the 34 discharged transplanted patients was 45.3 +/- 37 months. Actuarialsurvival of transplanted patients while on LVAD was 91.0 +/- 4.9\% and 83.4 +/-8.5\% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. No differences in post-transplant long-term survival and rejection and allograft vasculopathy occurred between patientstransplanted with or without LVAD implanted.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD therapy proved to be effective in bridging patients withend-stage heart failure to HTx. While on LVAD support, patients assisted withimplantable wearable devices could be discharged at home, ameliorating theirquality of life. The excellent survival rate after HTx is concomitant with a low incidence of rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.: 12783077  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1630. j card surg. 2003 mar-apr;18(2):107-13.left ventricular assist devices as bridge to heart transplantation: the niguarda experience.vitali e(1), lanfranconi m, bruschi g, russo c, colombo t, ribera e.author information: (1)department of cardiac surgery, a. de gasperis, niguarda hospital, milan,italy. evitali@ospedaleniguarda.itbackground: congestive heart failure is the leading cause of death in westerncountries. heart transplantation currently is the only accepted therapy forpatients with end-stage heart failure, but the supply of donor hearts isinadequate, and different mechanical circulatory support systems have beeninvestigated as bridges to heart transplant.methods: since april 1992, 53 patients (47 men, 6 women, aged 12 to 61 years)received left ventricle mechanical circulatory support as bridge to hearttransplant. the two principal devices used were: the novacor lvas in 31 patients and the debakey vad in 11 patients.results: all patients survived the operation. mean duration of lvad support was2.8 +/- 5.6 months. thirty-seven patients (71.1\%) underwent hearttransplantation. twelve major bleeding episodes occurred in nine patients(16.9\%). globally, major and minor neurologic events occurred in 13 patients(24.5\%). ten patients (19.9\%) assisted with the novacor wearable lvas device weredischarged at home while waiting for heart transplant (htx). the mean follow-upof the 34 discharged transplanted patients was 45.3 +/- 37 months. actuarialsurvival of transplanted patients while on lvad was 91.0 +/- 4.9\% and 83.4 +/-8.5\% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. no differences in post-transplant long-term survival and rejection and allograft vasculopathy occurred between patientstransplanted with or without lvad implanted.conclusions: lvad therapy proved to be effective in bridging patients withend-stage heart failure to htx. while on lvad support, patients assisted withimplantable wearable devices could be discharged at home, ameliorating theirquality of life. the excellent survival rate after htx is concomitant with a low incidence of rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
