Studies have suggested that outcomes after VAD implantation may bedependent on institutional procedural volume, and outcome data fromnon-transplant centres are lacking. This study reviews the outcomes of patientswho received a long-term VAD at our centre to determine if these devices can besafely implanted at tertiary care, low-volume, non-transplant centres.METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study, examining theclinical outcomes of consecutive patients who received a long-term VAD over a42-month period.RESULTS: During the study period 73 patients required MCS, of whom 16 received a long-term VAD. This select group had a mean Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile of 1.6 (0.9) and beforeimplantation 94\% required at least 1 inotropic medication, 69\% had suffered acardiac arrest, 63\% required an intra-aortic balloon pump, 69\% requiredmechanical ventilation, and 44\% required short-term MCS. The primary outcome ofsurvival to transplant or ongoing MCS at 1 year was achieved in 75\% of patients. Operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital survival were 100\%, 88\%, and81\%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term VADs can be implanted at low-volume, nontransplant centreswith survival rates comparable with contemporary clinical trials. Availability ofa specialty trained multidisciplinary team with expertise in short-term andlong-term MCS options facilitates appropriate patient selection and might be moreimportant than institutional volume in determining outcomes after implantation.Copyright Â© 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
