This protocol permitted the rendering of safe and effective dental      care in this setting and did not result in near-term (1-30 days) excessive      hemorrhage, local and systemic infection, or contamination of the VAD. STUDY      DESIGN: This descriptive cross-sectional study by the University of California,      Los Angeles, Hospital Dental Service examined the dental care of 9 patients (mean      age, 50 +/- 12.9 years) with class IV stage D heart failure. RESULTS: Nine      patients, 22 days (mean) after VAD placement, received dental treatment after      intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and maintenance of prior anticoagulation,      antiplatelet, or antithrombin regimen. Eight patients had extractions (mean, 4;      range, 1-12), and one of them also required scaling and root planing (SRP) of the      remaining teeth. A ninth individual only required SRP of 4 quadrants. No adverse       outcomes developed. CONCLUSIONS: Emergent removal of active dental disease in      patients with VAD awaiting heart transplant can be safely accomplished using      established protocols with extended vigilance.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
