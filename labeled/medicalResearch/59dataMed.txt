Recurrent VF and repeated AICD shocks necessitated thisaction.RESULTS: Although requiring ECMO and inotropic support in the first 17hourspost-transplant, the patient was discharged from hospital on day 15post-transplant with normal cardiac function.CONCLUSION: We report some of the salient points of the process and discuss theutility of this technology to an Australian transplant unit.Crown Copyright Â© 2015.
