ASAIO J. 2013 Sep-Oct;59(5):533-6. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829f0e52.Impella to unload the left ventricle during peripheral extracorporeal membraneoxygenation.Cheng A(1), Swartz MF, Massey HT.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Rochester Medical Center,Rochester, New York 14642, USA.Peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) for acutecardiac failure reestablishes normal oxygen delivery and perfusion. However, VAECMO can be limited by insufficient ventricular unloading, resulting in thrombus formation and pulmonary edema. Impella 2.5 has been used to unload the leftventricle and provide hemodynamic support during acute heart failure. We present our experience of the Impella 2.5 as an adjunct for left ventricular unloadingduring peripheral VA ECMO support and as a bridge for the HeartMate II leftventricular assist device (LVAD). An Impella 2.5 was placed in patients who were on peripheral VA ECMO with evidence of left ventricular distension. Patients who were candidates for heart transplant were transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD. Five patients on VA ECMO with ventricular distension underwent Impella 2.5implantation, resulting in a decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter asmeasured by echocardiography (7.8 Â± 1.4 vs. 6.2 Â± 0.8 cm, p = 0.001). Fourpatients were subsequently transitioned to the HeartMate II LVAD afterrestoration of end-organ function. Impella 2.5 is a safe means to unload the leftventricle while on peripheral VA ECMO to prevent left ventricle thrombusformation and worsening pulmonary edema in patients transitioning to a HeartMate II LVAD.: 23995998  [pubmed - indexed for medline]356. asaio j. 2013 sep-oct;59(5):533-6. doi: 10.1097/mat.0b013e31829f0e52.impella to unload the left ventricle during peripheral extracorporeal membraneoxygenation.cheng a(1), swartz mf, massey ht.author information: (1)division of cardiothoracic surgery, university of rochester medical center,rochester, new york 14642, usa.peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va ecmo) for acutecardiac failure reestablishes normal oxygen delivery and perfusion. however, vaecmo can be limited by insufficient ventricular unloading, resulting in thrombus formation and pulmonary edema. impella 2.5 has been used to unload the leftventricle and provide hemodynamic support during acute heart failure. we present our experience of the impella 2.5 as an adjunct for left ventricular unloadingduring peripheral va ecmo support and as a bridge for the heartmate ii leftventricular assist device (lvad). an impella 2.5 was placed in patients who were on peripheral va ecmo with evidence of left ventricular distension. patients who were candidates for heart transplant were transitioned to the heartmate ii lvad. five patients on va ecmo with ventricular distension underwent impella 2.5implantation, resulting in a decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter asmeasured by echocardiography (7.8 â± 1.4 vs. 6.2 â± 0.8 cm, p = 0.001). fourpatients were subsequently transitioned to the heartmate ii lvad afterrestoration of end-organ function. impella 2.5 is a safe means to unload the leftventricle while on peripheral va ecmo to prevent left ventricle thrombusformation and worsening pulmonary edema in patients transitioning to a heartmate ii lvad.
