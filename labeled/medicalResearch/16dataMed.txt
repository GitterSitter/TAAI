Unlike      other devices requiring open-heart surgery, thin active flexible membrane of      IntraVAD, made of ionic polymer-metal composites and shape memory alloys (SMA),      enables transcatheter implantation and eliminates thoracotomy. Actuation      mechanism of the device mimics the natural motion of the heart, applies almost no      shear stress on blood cells, and leaves no stagnant points. Hence, it reduces      hemolysis and thrombosis risks. The first step in designing the device is      defining the objectives based on hemodynamics of eligible patients. A      3-dimensional model is extracted from magnetic resonance images of a subject to      provide a precise representation of the inner shape of the ventricle. Numerical      solution to the mathematical model of the behavior of ionic polymer-metal      composites is then used to check their compliancy with the objectives. Different       actuator designs are evaluated to perform the desired motions and address the      cardiac insufficiency. Using an iterative design and simulation process, various       geometric and material parameters affecting the performance of the device are      optimized, including those of the antagonistic two-way SMA actuators. Although      methods and results provided here are for the left ventricle, the same are also      applicable to the right ventricle.FAU - Hosseinipour, MAU  - Hosseinipour MAD  - Dynamic and Smart Systems Laboratory, The University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA,       mhp@vt.edu.FAU - Elahinia, MAU  - Elahinia MFAU - Wanna, FAU  - Wanna FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20140131PL  - United StatesTA  - Ann Biomed EngJT  - Annals of biomedical engineeringJID - 0361512SB  - IMMH  - Cardiac CatheterizationMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Heart Ventricles/physiopathologyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Models, CardiovascularEDAT- 2014/02/01 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/19 06:00CRDT- 2014/02/01 06:00PHST- 2013/08/29 [received]PHST- 2014/01/17 [accepted]PHST- 2014/01/31 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10439-014-0978-8 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Biomed Eng. 2014 May;42(5):999-1011. doi: 10.1007/s10439-014-0978-8.
