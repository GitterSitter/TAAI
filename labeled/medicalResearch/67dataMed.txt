Epub 2012 Oct 25.Use of a single-circuit CentriMagÂ® for biventricular support in postpartumcardiomyopathy.Aggarwal A(1), Modi S, Kumar S, Korrapati C, Tatooles A, Pappas PS, Bhat G.Author information: (1)Center for Heart Transplant and Assist Devices, Advocate Christ MedicalCenter, Oak Lawn, IL, USA.Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is defined by acute heart failure in the latestages of pregnancy to a few months postpartum. Cardiogenic shock in PPCM, thoughrare, can be life-threatening, often requiring support with mechanicalcirculatory support devices. We present a case of 37-year-old Caucasian femalewho developed cardiogenic shock within 24 hours of the delivery of her twins. Theechocardiogram demonstrated severe biventricular failure which necessitatedbiventricular device placement and support with a CentriMagÂ® centrifugal pump.This biventricular support was employed, using a single-circuit CentriMagÂ® pump, using a \Y\ connection which made weaning from right-sided support and conversionto univentricular support easier and feasible. The patient recovered four weekslater and was explanted off the CentriMagÂ® support and did well. This technology allows for the CentriMagÂ® to be considered as an early option for biventricularsupport in the treatment and management of these patients as a bridge torecovery.: 23109751  [pubmed - indexed for medline]546. perfusion. 2013 mar;28(2):156-9. doi: 10.1177/0267659112464713. epub 2012 oct 25.use of a single-circuit centrimagâ® for biventricular support in postpartumcardiomyopathy.aggarwal a(1), modi s, kumar s, korrapati c, tatooles a, pappas ps, bhat g.author information: (1)center for heart transplant and assist devices, advocate christ medicalcenter, oak lawn, il, usa.peripartum cardiomyopathy (ppcm) is defined by acute heart failure in the latestages of pregnancy to a few months postpartum. cardiogenic shock in ppcm, thoughrare, can be life-threatening, often requiring support with mechanicalcirculatory support devices. we present a case of 37-year-old caucasian femalewho developed cardiogenic shock within 24 hours of the delivery of her twins. theechocardiogram demonstrated severe biventricular failure which necessitatedbiventricular device placement and support with a centrimagâ® centrifugal pump.this biventricular support was employed, using a single-circuit centrimagâ® pump, using a \y\ connection which made weaning from right-sided support and conversionto univentricular support easier and feasible. the patient recovered four weekslater and was explanted off the centrimagâ® support and did well. this technology allows for the centrimagâ® to be considered as an early option for biventricularsupport in the treatment and management of these patients as a bridge torecovery.
