Renal failure after LVAD      placement can occur to varying degrees from cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) or due to       intrinsic renal disease. Patients with severely impaired renal function after      LVAD may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) as a temporary or permanent      means of support. We present a unique case of a patient who initiated peritoneal       dialysis (PD) 1 year after placement of an LVAD for destination therapy (DT). One      year later, PD continues to be successfully utilized by this patient for RRT.      There are several proven and theoretical benefits to PD in LVAD patients.      Peritoneal dialysis can provide sustained daily ultrafiltration offering greater       hemodynamic stability, preservation of residual renal function, and a lower risk       of systemic infection. Conversely, limitations to PD include nutritional risks      due to peritoneal albumin losses, hyperglycemia, and potential limitations to      successful catheter placement. Considering our patient\s successful outcome and      the potential benefits associated with PD, despite the limitations, we conclude      that PD should strongly be considered in patients with LVADs that require RRT.FAU - Guglielmi, Anthony AAU  - Guglielmi AAAD  - From the Center for Heart Transplant and Assist Devices, Advocate Christ Medical       Center, Oak Lawn, Illinois.FAU - Guglielmi, Kelly EAU  - Guglielmi KEFAU - Bhat, GeethaAU  - Bhat GFAU - Siemeck, RoxanneAU  - Siemeck RFAU - Tatooles, Antone JAU  - Tatooles AJLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Kidney Diseases/*complications/therapyMH  - MaleMH  - *Peritoneal DialysisEDAT- 2013/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/26 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000020 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Jan-Feb;60(1):127-8. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000020.- 24270236own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20131225dcom- 20140822is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 60ip  - 1dp  - 2014 jan-febti  - peritoneal dialysis after left ventricular assist device placement.pg  - 127-8lid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000020 [doi]ab  - patients with refractory congestive heart failure may be considered for      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (lvad). renal failure after lvad      placement can occur to varying degrees from cardiorenal syndrome (crs) or due to       intrinsic renal disease. patients with severely impaired renal function after      lvad may require renal replacement therapy (rrt) as a temporary or permanent      means of support. we present a unique case of a patient who initiated peritoneal       dialysis (pd) 1 year after placement of an lvad for destination therapy (dt). one      year later, pd continues to be successfully utilized by this patient for rrt.      there are several proven and theoretical benefits to pd in lvad patients.      peritoneal dialysis can provide sustained daily ultrafiltration offering greater       hemodynamic stability, preservation of residual renal function, and a lower risk       of systemic infection. conversely, limitations to pd include nutritional risks      due to peritoneal albumin losses, hyperglycemia, and potential limitations to      successful catheter placement. considering our patient\s successful outcome and      the potential benefits associated with pd, despite the limitations, we conclude      that pd should strongly be considered in patients with lvads that require rrt.fau - guglielmi, anthony aau  - guglielmi aaad  - from the center for heart transplant and assist devices, advocate christ medical       center, oak lawn, illinois.fau - guglielmi, kelly eau  - guglielmi kefau - bhat, geethaau  - bhat gfau - siemeck, roxanneau  - siemeck rfau - tatooles, antone jau  - tatooles ajla  - engpt  - case reportspt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109sb  - immh  - agedmh  - heart failure/*complications/surgerymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - kidney diseases/*complications/therapymh  - malemh  - *peritoneal dialysisedat- 2013/11/26 06:00mhda- 2014/08/26 06:00crdt- 2013/11/26 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000020 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2014 jan-feb;60(1):127-8. doi: 10.1097/mat.0000000000000020.
