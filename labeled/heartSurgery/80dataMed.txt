Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II(HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD.METHODS: This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patientstransplanted during 2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were dividedinto two groups according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) orrequired additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were comparedfor early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major earlypost-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival.RESULTS: Early graft loss was 10.7\% in isolated HMII and 25\% in HMII + RVADpatients (P = 0.26). There were no observed differences in the rates of primarygraft dysfunction (7.3 vs 0\%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5\%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25\%, P = 0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary arteryresistance (odds ratio: 3.286, 95\% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant predictor for adverse outcome ofmechanically-bridged heart transplant recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 Â± 5\% in isolated HMII and 75 Â± 15\% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that heart transplant recipients who requiredunplanned RV mechanical support after LVAD implantation achieved comparable ratesof early graft loss, post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-yeargraft survival was equivalent between those two groups. Given the small samplesize, further studies involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.Â© The Author 2014.
