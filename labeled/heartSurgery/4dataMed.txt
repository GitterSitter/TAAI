Carolina.Alba@uhn.on.caBACKGROUND: The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted CirculatorySupport (INTERMACS) scale classifies advanced heart failure patients according tohemodynamic status. This study assessed the usefulness of the INTERMACS scale to predict outcomes in advanced heart failure patients undergoing mechanicalcirculatory support (MCS).METHODS: Fifty-four patients underwent MCS implantation from 2001 to 2007. Group A included 27 patients at INTERMACS level 1 and 2. Group B included 27 atINTERMACS level 3 and 4. Patient characteristics pre-MCS implant, incidence ofcomplications during support, and survival between groups were compared.RESULTS: Before MCS implantation, Group A had significantly lower cardiac index, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic pulmonary pressure, higher central venous pressure, and lower urine output (p < .05). After MCS, Group A had a lowerincidence of infections (17\% vs 46\%; odds ratio [OR], 0.25, 95\% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.06-0.6) and a higher incidence of liver injury (39\% vs 11\%; OR5, 95\% CI, 1.15-25). Mortality at 30 days was higher in Group A (38\% vs 11\%; OR, 4.8; 95\% CI, 1.1-21); however, the mortality after 30 days post-MCS support wassignificantly higher in Group B (0\% vs 18\%, p < .05). Cox model showed overallsurvival was poorer in Group A (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.1-7).CONCLUSION: INTERMACS levels identified patients at risk for developingcomplications after MCS support. INTERMACS is a valid score system that should beconsidered as a tool to assess patient profile and predict complications andmortality after MCS implantation.: 19632582  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1071. j heart lung transplant. 2009 aug;28(8):827-33. doi:10.1016/j.healun.2009.04.033.usefulness of the intermacs scale to predict outcomes after mechanical assistdevice implantation.alba ac(1), rao v, ivanov j, ross hj, delgado dh.author information: (1)division of cardiology and heart transplant, toronto general hospital,toronto, ontario, canada. carolina.alba@uhn.on.cabackground: the interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatorysupport (intermacs) scale classifies advanced heart failure patients according tohemodynamic status. this study assessed the usefulness of the intermacs scale to predict outcomes in advanced heart failure patients undergoing mechanicalcirculatory support (mcs).methods: fifty-four patients underwent mcs implantation from 2001 to 2007. group a included 27 patients at intermacs level 1 and 2. group b included 27 atintermacs level 3 and 4. patient characteristics pre-mcs implant, incidence ofcomplications during support, and survival between groups were compared.results: before mcs implantation, group a had significantly lower cardiac index, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic pulmonary pressure, higher central venous pressure, and lower urine output (p < .05). after mcs, group a had a lowerincidence of infections (17\% vs 46\%; odds ratio [or], 0.25, 95\% confidenceinterval [ci], 0.06-0.6) and a higher incidence of liver injury (39\% vs 11\%; or5, 95\% ci, 1.15-25). mortality at 30 days was higher in group a (38\% vs 11\%; or, 4.8; 95\% ci, 1.1-21); however, the mortality after 30 days post-mcs support wassignificantly higher in group b (0\% vs 18\%, p < .05). cox model showed overallsurvival was poorer in group a (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95\% ci, 1.1-7).conclusion: intermacs levels identified patients at risk for developingcomplications after mcs support. intermacs is a valid score system that should beconsidered as a tool to assess patient profile and predict complications andmortality after mcs implantation.
