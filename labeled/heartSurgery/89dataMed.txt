Ventricular assist devices were placed as a bridge totransplant in 110 patients. We focused our analysis on the 2 most common causesof end-stage heart failure requiring transplantation: idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy (n = 201) and coronary artery disease (n = 213). Data includinggender, age, date of transplant, cause of heart failure, prior heart transplant, placement of a ventricular assist device, type of ventricular assist device, and panel-reactive antibody sensitization were analyzed to derive Kaplan-Meiersurvival probabilities and multivariable Cox regression models.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who received aventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant, survival was decreased at 1 year (P = .008) and 5 years (P = .019), but not at 10 years, posttransplant. Inpatients with coronary artery disease, the use of a ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant did not influence survival at 1, 5, and 10 tearsposttransplant. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who received aHeartmate I (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif) ventricular assist device as abridge to a cardiac transplant, elevation in the pretransplant panel-reactiveantibody correlated with a decrease in long-term survival.CONCLUSION: In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, placement of aHeartmate I ventricular assist device as a bridge to a cardiac transplant isassociated with an elevation in the pretransplant panel-reactive antibody and adecrease in 1- and 5-year survivals after cardiac transplantation.2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
