[Epub ahead of print]A single German center experience with intermittent inotropes for patients on thehigh-urgent heart transplant waiting list.HÃ¼bner T(1), Nickel T, Steinbeck G, Massberg S, Schramm R, Reichart B, Hagl C,Kiwi A, Weis M.Author information: (1)Medizinische Abteilung, Kliniken der Barmherzigen Schwestern, KrankenhausNeuwittelsbach, Renatastrasse 71a, 80639, Munich, Germany.AIM: Currently, more than 900 patients with end-stage heart failure are listedfor heart transplantation in Germany. All patients on the Eurotransplanthigh-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to berelisted every 8Â weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated withtachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospectiveanalysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated withintermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy.METHODS AND RESULTS: 117 consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at ourintensive care heart failure unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients(12Â \%) were stabilized and delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103patients (age 42Â Â±Â 15Â years), different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone,adrenaline, noradrenaline, levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\sspecific characteristics. After initial recompensation, patients were weaned frominotropes as soon as possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4Â days)were given as a predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57Â \% of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropicsupport was necessary due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14Â \%) needed a left- or biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14Â \%) died whilewaiting and 87 (84Â \%) received heart transplants after 87Â Â±Â 91Â days. Cumulative 3and 12Â months survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67Â \%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as abridge to transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These dataprovide the basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropesin patients on the HU waiting list.: 25857908  [pubmed - in process]19. clin res cardiol. 2015 apr 5.
