Circulation. 2002 Jun 18;105(24):2855-60.Initial clinical experience with the Jarvik 2000 implantable axial-flow leftventricular assist system.Frazier OH(1), Myers TJ, Gregoric ID, Khan T, Delgado R, Croitoru M, Miller K,Jarvik R, Westaby S.Author information: (1)Cullen Cardiovascular Surgical Research Laboratories, Texas Heart Institute,Houston, USA.Comment in    Circulation. 2002 Jun 18;105(24):2808-9.BACKGROUND: Implantable left ventricular assist systems (LVASs) are used forbridging to transplantation, bridging to myocardial improvement, and forpermanent circulatory support. Conventional implantable systems have inherentlimitations that increase morbidity during support. In contrast, small,efficient, axial-flow pumps, which have been under development for the pastdecade, have the potential to improve the length and quality of life in patients with severe heart failure. Methods and Results- To assess the safety and clinicalutility of the Jarvik 2000, we implanted this device in 10 transplant candidates (mean age 51.3 years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV. Implantationwas achieved through a left thoracotomy during partial cardiopulmonary bypass.The mean support period was 84 days. Within 48 hours postoperatively, the cardiacindex increased 43\%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased 52\%, systemicvascular resistance decreased significantly, and inotropic support becameunnecessary. Eight patients underwent physical rehabilitation and returned toNYHA class I. Their left ventricular dimensions, cardiothoracic ratios, andpressure-volume loop analyses showed good left ventricular unloading. Sevenpatients underwent transplantation and 3 died during support. No devicethrombosis was observed at explantation.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 functions as a true assist device by partiallyunloading the left ventricle, thereby optimizing the patient\s hemodynamics. Our preliminary results indicate that this LVAS may safely provide circulatoryassistance for heart transplant candidates.: 12091825  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1682. circulation. 2002 jun 18;105(24):2855-60.initial clinical experience with the jarvik 2000 implantable axial-flow leftventricular assist system.frazier oh(1), myers tj, gregoric id, khan t, delgado r, croitoru m, miller k,jarvik r, westaby s.author information: (1)cullen cardiovascular surgical research laboratories, texas heart institute,houston, usa.comment in    circulation. 2002 jun 18;105(24):2808-9.background: implantable left ventricular assist systems (lvass) are used forbridging to transplantation, bridging to myocardial improvement, and forpermanent circulatory support. conventional implantable systems have inherentlimitations that increase morbidity during support. in contrast, small,efficient, axial-flow pumps, which have been under development for the pastdecade, have the potential to improve the length and quality of life in patients with severe heart failure. methods and results- to assess the safety and clinicalutility of the jarvik 2000, we implanted this device in 10 transplant candidates (mean age 51.3 years) in new york heart association (nyha) class iv. implantationwas achieved through a left thoracotomy during partial cardiopulmonary bypass.the mean support period was 84 days. within 48 hours postoperatively, the cardiacindex increased 43\%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased 52\%, systemicvascular resistance decreased significantly, and inotropic support becameunnecessary. eight patients underwent physical rehabilitation and returned tonyha class i. their left ventricular dimensions, cardiothoracic ratios, andpressure-volume loop analyses showed good left ventricular unloading. sevenpatients underwent transplantation and 3 died during support. no devicethrombosis was observed at explantation.conclusions: the jarvik 2000 functions as a true assist device by partiallyunloading the left ventricle, thereby optimizing the patient\s hemodynamics. our preliminary results indicate that this lvas may safely provide circulatoryassistance for heart transplant candidates.
