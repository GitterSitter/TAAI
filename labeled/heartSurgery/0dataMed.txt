Ochsner J. 2010 Winter;10(4):241-4.Right ventricular function and left ventricular assist device placement: clinicalconsiderations and outcomes.Lainez R(1), Parrino G, Bates M.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Ochsner ClinicFoundation, New Orleans, LA.The HeartMate II is an axial-flow left ventricular assist device that is approvedfor the treatment of advanced heart failure as a bridge to transplant ordestination therapy. Despite the success of this device, right ventricularfailure remains a persistent problem in most studies. Right ventriculardysfunction is usually defined as the need for right heart mechanical support or the persistent requirement for inotropes to support right heart function beyond14Â days. Over 21Â months, 45 patients with end-stage heart disease underwentplacement of the HeartMate II at our institution. This continuous cohort ofpatients underwent a retrospective review to evaluate the incidence of rightheart failure. The perioperative survival was 91\% with no incidents of mechanicalsupport for the right ventricle and no requirements for inotropes beyond 14Â days.This survival was consistent to beyond 1Â year at the time of the study, and 18\%of patients underwent heart transplant with 100\% survival.PMCID: PMC3096228: 23074408  [pubmed]1014. ochsner j. 2010 winter;10(4):241-4.right ventricular function and left ventricular assist device placement: clinicalconsiderations and outcomes.lainez r(1), parrino g, bates m.author information: (1)division of cardiothoracic surgery, department of surgery, ochsner clinicfoundation, new orleans, la.the heartmate ii is an axial-flow left ventricular assist device that is approvedfor the treatment of advanced heart failure as a bridge to transplant ordestination therapy. despite the success of this device, right ventricularfailure remains a persistent problem in most studies. right ventriculardysfunction is usually defined as the need for right heart mechanical support or the persistent requirement for inotropes to support right heart function beyond14â days. over 21â months, 45 patients with end-stage heart disease underwentplacement of the heartmate ii at our institution. this continuous cohort ofpatients underwent a retrospective review to evaluate the incidence of rightheart failure. the perioperative survival was 91\% with no incidents of mechanicalsupport for the right ventricle and no requirements for inotropes beyond 14â days.this survival was consistent to beyond 1â year at the time of the study, and 18\%of patients underwent heart transplant with 100\% survival.pmcid: pmc3096228
