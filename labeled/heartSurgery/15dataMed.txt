However, patients receiving ACE-Iduring VAD-support had lower Col1A1 mRNA content at transplantation. The totalcollagen content was not influenced by mechanical unloading or by ACE-Imedication.CONCLUSION: Mechanical unloading by VAD does not reduce the collagen content ofthe terminal failing ventricle possibly due to increased TGF beta1 levels.However, Col1A1 production may be reduced by ACE-I medication during VAD support.: 16322702  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1428. eur j heart fail. 2006 may;8(3):278-83. epub 2005 nov 23.influence of ace-inhibition and mechanical unloading on the regulation ofextracellular matrix proteins in the myocardium of heart transplantationcandidates bridged by ventricular assist devices.milting h(1), kassner a, arusoglu l, meyer he, morshuis m, brendel r, klauke b,el banayosy a, k„∂rfer r.author information: (1)ruhr-universit„§t bochum, herz-und diabeteszentrum nrw, klinik f„ºr thorax-undkardiovaskularchirurgie, erich und hanna klessmann-institut f„ºr kardiovaskul„§reforschung und entwicklung, georgstr. 11, d-32545 bad oeynhausen, germany.hmilting@hdz-nrw.debackground: whether adverse structural changes in the myocardium due toremodelling can be reversed by ventricular assist device (vad) support inpatients with end-stage heart failure is controversial.aims: to investigate the effect of vad support on the extra-cellular matrix.methods: we analysed the collagen content in terminal failing ventricles ofvad-patients and donor hearts using 4-hydroxyproline for total collagen and real time rt-pcr for fibronectin (fn), collagen i alpha 1 (col1a1), iii alpha 1(col3a1) and tgf beta 1 analysis.results: compared to donor hearts we found similar increases in col1a1 and tgfbeta1 but not col3a1 and fn mrnas, which were similar in the myocardium frompatients receiving a vad or heart transplant. however, patients receiving ace-iduring vad-support had lower col1a1 mrna content at transplantation. the totalcollagen content was not influenced by mechanical unloading or by ace-imedication.conclusion: mechanical unloading by vad does not reduce the collagen content ofthe terminal failing ventricle possibly due to increased tgf beta1 levels.however, col1a1 production may be reduced by ace-i medication during vad support.
