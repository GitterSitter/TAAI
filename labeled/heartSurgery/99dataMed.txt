Epub 2010 Jul 8.Prevalence of de novo aortic insufficiency during long-term support with leftventricular assist devices.Pak SW(1), Uriel N, Takayama H, Cappleman S, Song R, Colombo PC, Charles S,Mancini D, Gillam L, Naka Y, Jorde UP.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used aslong-term therapy for end-stage heart failure patients. We compared theprevalence of aortic insufficiency (AI) after HeartMate II (HMII) vs HeartMateXVE (HMI) support and assessed the role of aortic root diameter and aortic valve opening in the development of AI.METHOD: Pre-operative and post-operative echocardiograms of 93 HMI and 73 HMIIpatients who received implants at our center between January 2004 and September2009 were retrospectively reviewed. After excluding patients with prior orconcurrent surgical manipulation of the aortic valve, with baseline AI, orwithout baseline echoes, 67 HMI and 63 HMII patients were studied. AI was deemed significant if mild to moderate or greater. Pathology reports were reviewed for77 patients who underwent heart transplant.RESULTS: AI developed in 4 of 67 HMI (6.0\%) and in 9 of 63 HMII patients (14.3\%).The median times to AI development were 48 days for HMI patients and 90 days for HMII patients. For patients who remained on device support at 6 and 12 months,freedom from AI was 94.5\% and 88.9\% in HMI patients and 83.6\% and 75.2\% in HMIIpatients (log rank p = 0.194). Aortic root diameters, as determined byechocardiography for the patients with AI, trended to be larger at baseline (3.43Â± 0.43 vs 3.15 Â± 0.40; p = 0.067) and follow-up (3.58 Â± 0.54 vs 3.29 Â± 0.50; p = 0.130) compared with those who did not have AI. Aortic root circumferences wereassessed directly by a pathologist in those patients who underwent transplant andwere significantly larger in HMII patients who had developed AI compared withthose patients who did not (8.44 Â± 0.89 vs 7.36 Â± 1.02 cm; p = 0.034). Lastly, AIwas more common in patients whose aortic valve did not open (11 of 26 vs 1 of 14;p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: Aortic insufficiency occurs frequently in patients who receivecontinuous-flow support with a HMII LVAD, and may be associated with aortic root diameter enlargement and aortic valve opening. These findings warrant a morethorough preoperative patient evaluation and additional studies to investigatethe factors, that may be associated with AI development.Copyright Â© 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
