Epub 2013 Jan 2.Patient selection for ventricular assist devices: a moving target.Miller LW(1), Guglin M.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33606, USA. lmiller5@health.usf.eduThe number of patients with advanced heart failure that has become unresponsiveto conventional medical therapy is increasing rapidly. One of the most promising new alternatives to heart transplantation is use of ventricular assist devices(VADs). To date, there are no guidelines for appropriate selection for use ofthese devices that are approved by national societies in the field. This reviewaddresses all of the general criteria for clinicians to keep in mind regardingwhen to refer a patient for evaluation and the specific issues addressed inpatient selection. The field of mechanical circulatory support has advancedsignificantly over the past 10 years, resulting in rapid expansion of patientswith advanced heart failure who can benefit from implantable devices. Withprogress of technology, limitations associated with age, body size, andcomorbidities gradually become less prohibitive. The continuing simplification ofdesign along with continued reduction in size of the devices, plus eventualelimination of the external drive line will make the use of VADs a superioroption to heart transplant and even to medical management in many patients. Weanticipate that the patient selection process outlined in the present review willcontinue to shift toward less advanced cases of heart failure.Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
