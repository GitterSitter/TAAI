In a cohort of patients with advanced systolic HF followed      at a single university center, 2,718 patients had body mass indexes (BMIs)      measured at baseline, and 469 patients with HF had waist circumferences (WCs)      measured at baseline. Elevated BMI was defined as >/=25 kg/m(2). High WC was      defined as >/=88 cm in women and >/=102 cm in men. The primary outcome was death,      urgent heart transplantation, or ventricular assist device placement. The mean      age was 53.0 +/- 12.4 years, 25\% of subjects were women, and the mean left      ventricular ejection fraction was 22.9 +/- 7.19\%. In men, 2-year event-free      survival was better for high versus normal BMI (63.2\% vs 53.5\%, p <0.001) and for      high versus normal WC (78.8\% vs 63.1\%, p = 0.01). In women, 2-year event-free      survival was better for elevated versus normal BMI (67.1\% vs 56.6\%, p = 0.01) but      similar in the 2 WC groups. In multivariate analyses, normal BMI and normal WC      were associated with higher relative risk for the primary outcome in men (BMI      1.34, WC 2.02) and women (BMI 1.38, WC 2.99). In conclusion, in patients with      advanced HF, high BMI and WC were associated with improved outcomes in both      genders. Further investigation of the interaction between body composition and      gender in HF outcomes is warranted.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
