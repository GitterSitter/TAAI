The purpose of this study was to      determine pre- and peri-operative predictors of hospital LOS after LVAD      implantation. METHODS: We analyzed adult primary continuous-flow LVAD patients      implanted between June 23, 2006 and December 31, 2010 at 105 institutions from      the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support      (INTERMACS). Retrospective analyses included measures of central tendency,      frequencies, correlations and stepwise multivariable regression modeling (p </=      0.05). Independent variables included demographic characteristics, pre-implant      clinical and behavioral variables and concomitant surgery. RESULTS:      Characteristics of the patients (n = 2,200) included: mean age 54.6 +/- 12.6      years; 79\% male; 69\% white; 57\% INTERMACS Profile 1 or 2; 37\% diabetic; 21\% with       history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG); 7\% with history of valve surgery;      and 37\% with concomitant surgery. Median hospital LOS (implant to discharge) was       20 days. Significant predictors of an increased hospital LOS included demographic      characteristics (older age and non-white), pre-implant clinical variables      (history of CABG or valve surgery, diabetes, ascites, INTERMACS Profiles 1 and 2,      low albumin, high blood urea nitrogen, high right atrial pressure) and      concomitant surgery, explaining 12\% variance (F = 22.65, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:      Demographic characteristics, pre-implant variables and concomitant surgery      partially explained hospital LOS after continuous-flow LVAD implant. These      variables have implications regarding selection of patients for mechanical      circulatory support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
