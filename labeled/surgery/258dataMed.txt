Total cardiac output       in CF-LVAD patients during exercise is predominantly determined by pump speed,      the pressure difference across the pump, and in some cases ejection through the      aortic valve. Fixed pump speed utilized in CF-LVADs may provide insufficient      support, resulting in a moderate cardiac output increase during increased      physical strain. Ongoing studies are evaluating whether pump speed changes in      response to varied loading conditions may enable LVADs to provide sufficient      support even during strenuous exercise. In the currently used devices, evidence      suggests that focus on optimizing non-cardiac peripheral parameters is vital.      Extra-cardiac potentially reversible factors are anemia with low oxygen-carrying       capacity, obesity and general deconditioning with low muscle mass. In addition,      exercise training in CF-LVAD patients can improve peak VO2. To design      interventions to improve functional capacity in patients treated with modern      durable LVADs, a detailed understanding of exercise physiology in a      continuous-flow circulatory system is necessary. In this review we address the      different components of exercise physiology in LVAD patients and point out      potential solutions or areas of future research.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
