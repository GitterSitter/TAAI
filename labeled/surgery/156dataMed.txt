To assess long-term freedom from DL      infection associated with this technique, a multicenter SSI registry was      initiated. It was hypothesized that the modified tunneling technique is      associated with at least 50\% reduction in DL infection at 1 year post-implant      compared with the velour-to-skin method used in the HeartMate II (HMII)      Destination Therapy (DT) trial. METHODS: SSI is a retrospective and prospective      registry of patients who have received the HMII device. Results are reported from      the retrospective cohort, which consists of 200 patients who were implanted      during the period 2009-2012 with the SSI tunneling method and on HMII support for      at least 10 months at the time of enrollment. The prevalence and incidence of DL       infection after left ventricular assist device implantation in the SSI      retrospective cohort were determined and compared with a control group of 201      patients also on HMII support for at least 10 months from the HMII DT clinical      trial who were implanted during the period 2007-2009 using the traditional method      in which a small section of the velour portion of the DL was externalized.      RESULTS: The 1-year and 2-year prevalence rates of DL infection were 9\% and 19\%      in the SSI patient group compared with 23\% and 35\% in the control group (hazard      ratio 0.49, 95\% confidence interval 0.33-0.73, p < 0.001). The event-per-patient       year was 0.11 and 0.22 for the SSI and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001).       Based on a multivariate analysis, age and DL exit side were the only independent       variables associated with DL infection. Effects of management changes over the      eras were not studied and could have contributed to the findings. CONCLUSIONS:      These results suggest that leaving the entire DL velour portion below the skin is      associated with 50\% reduction in DL infection compared with results from the HMII      DT trial.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
