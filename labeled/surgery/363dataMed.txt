This study evaluated our strategy for right heart failure using a      temporary right VAD (RVAD) with an extracorporeal centrifugal pump. METHODS: From      January 2001 to December 2010, 108 patients underwent LVAD implantation at our      institution and their clinical outcomes were studied. RESULTS: A temporary      centrifugal RVAD was implanted in 26 patients. Multivariate logistic regression      revealed pre-operative extracorporeal life support (odds ratio [OR], 37.0),      central venous pressure (OR, 1.2), mean pulmonary artery pressure (OR, 0.9), and       serum total bilirubin (OR, 1.4) were the risk factors for RVAD requirement.      RVAD-off test was conducted, and 11 of the 26 patients showed significant      recovery of right heart function and were eventually removed from RVAD support.      The survival of patients with isolated LVAD was significantly better than those      with a paracorporeal pulsatile BiVAD (80\% vs 11\% at 1 year, p < 0.001). However,       there was no significant difference between the survival of patients who      underwent isolated LVAD support and those who were initially implanted with      temporary BiVAD but underwent the RVAD removal (80\% vs 73\% at 1 year, p = 0.827).      CONCLUSION: Our strategy with temporary RVAD for severe acute right heart failure      was effective in selecting the patients who could be weaned from RVAD support.      Patient survival was improved by avoiding the long-term support with a      paracorporeal pulsatile BiVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
