Although heart transplantation is the best therapy for end-stage heart failure,      most candidates die in the waiting period due to the lack of donor organs. This      condition represent a new era of heart failure surgery. METHODS: We      retrospectively investigated 159 patients from 1998 to 2011 with a mean age of      40.0 years (range = 5-65), who were mostly diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy (n      = 113). After April 2007, 67 patients underwent vascular assist device (VAD)      implantation surgery for acute or chronic end-stage heart failure. We performed      69 heart transplantation with 27 on VAD systems before transplantation. RESULTS:       Early mortality was 13.3\% with 21 patients after the heart transplantation. The      67 patients supported with VAD did not experience an intraoperative death. The      mean support time was 214 days (range = 3-1035). Twenty-four patients (35.8\%) are      still on pump support. The overall survival until transplantation or weaning was       77.6\% at mean of 250.7 days survival reached 90\% with Heartware (Hartware Inc,      Miramar, Fla, USA) continuous flow pumps. CONCLUSION: After the introduction of      VAD in 2007, the overall picture has been restructured radically for heart      failure surgery, reducing patient loss on the waiting list. Especially, since      2009 nearly 80\% of donor hearts were used for patients on mechanical circulatory       support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
