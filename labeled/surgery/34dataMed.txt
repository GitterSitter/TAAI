PATIENTS: Our patient was urgently      waiting for a cardiac transplant whilst receiving LVAD support. Recurrent VF and       repeated AICD shocks necessitated this action. RESULTS: Although requiring ECMO      and inotropic support in the first 17hours post-transplant, the patient was      discharged from hospital on day 15 post-transplant with normal cardiac function.       CONCLUSION: We report some of the salient points of the process and discuss the      utility of this technology to an Australian transplant unit.CI  - Crown Copyright (c) 2015.
