Once haemodynamic stability has been established       with a ventricular assist device (VAD), the decision to wait for myocardial      recovery as opposed to listing for an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can be      difficult. We have undertaken this study to establish the criteria for      determining the need for heart transplantation following VAD implant for      fulminant myocarditis. METHODS: A total of 442 VADs were implanted between 1993      and 2011. Twenty-four VADs were implanted for fulminant myocarditis with      refractory cardiogenic shock. We retrospectively analysed the variables and the      pathology for this cohort. Patients who had a full recovery of myocardial      function and subsequent VAD explant (Explant) were compared with those bridged to      OHT. There was one acute death. RESULTS: There was no difference in the past      medical history between the groups. Explant patients had a more acute onset of      heart failure with a median of 7 days between the onset of symptoms and VAD      implant, when compared with 22 days for OHT (P = 0.01). A rapid recovery in      myocardial function was seen in the Explant group, with recovery of myocardial      function (ejection fraction = 53 +/- 24\%) in 14 +/- 7 days. Myocardial function      was sustained for 5 years following the VAD explant. The female gender favoured      myocardial recovery and VAD explantability. Two patients had giant cell      myocarditis, neither of whom had a recovery of function, and they were bridged to      heart transplant with a VAD. CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant myocarditis is a fatal      condition without mechanical support. The rapid onset of symptoms is associated      with a complete recovery of myocardial function and VAD explant. The absence of      rapid recovery of myocardial function should prompt listing for a heart      transplant.FAU - Atluri, PavanAU  - Atluri PAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Perelman School of      Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.FAU - Ullery, Brant WAU  - Ullery BWFAU - MacArthur, John WAU  - MacArthur JWFAU - Goldstone, Andrew BAU  - Goldstone ABFAU - Fairman, Alex SAU  - Fairman ASFAU - Hiesinger, WilliamAU  - Hiesinger WFAU - Acker, Michael AAU  - Acker MAFAU - Woo, Y JosephAU  - Woo YJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120507PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocarditis/complications/*therapyMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Prosthesis Implantation/methodsMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/complications/*therapyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/05/09 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/19 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/09 06:00PHST- 2012/05/07 [aheadofprint]AID - ezs242 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs242 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Feb;43(2):379-82. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs242.
