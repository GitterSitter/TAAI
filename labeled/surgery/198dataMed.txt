This      may be a disadvantage to their priority for organ allocation. We sought to      determine the relationship between VAD implantation and successful      transplantation among patients listed for heart transplant. METHODS: Adults with       CHD patients (N = 1,250) were identified from the United Network for Organ      Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2010 and compared to patients without      congenital etiology for heart failure (N = 59,606). VAD use at listing, listing      status, status upgrades and reasons for upgrade prior to transplant were trended       at 5-year intervals and appropriate statistical comparisons were made between      groups. RESULTS: Since 1985, VAD use prior to transplant has increased      significantly in patients without CHD, but not in CHD patients (17\% vs 3\% in 2006      to 2010, p < 0.0001). CHD patients were more likely to be listed as Status 2,      compared to those without (66\% vs 40\%, p < 0.001 for 2006 to 2010), and less      likely to be upgraded to Status 1 after listing (43\% vs 55\%, p = 0.03). Among      those upgraded to Status 1, CHD patients were less likely to have a VAD at      transplant than those without (3\% vs 18\%, p = 0.005). VAD use was more likely to       result in death in CHD patients. CONCLUSIONS: VAD use is less common in CHD      patients than in patients without CHD, both at the time of listing and      transplantation. Reduced VAD use appears to contribute to lower listing status      and organ allocation. These differences have grown more disparate over time.      Separate criteria for organ allocation for CHD patients may be justified.CI  - (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
