The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome of      end-stage RCM patients after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation      and to determine factors that may be associated with improved survival. METHODS:       This investigation is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data that       include 28 consecutive patients with end-stage RCM who received continuous-flow      LVADs at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Outcome was assessed by survival       with LVAD support until heart transplantation or all-cause mortality. RESULTS:      The mean follow-up time post-LVAD implantation was 448 +/- 425 days. The mean      hospitalization time was 29 +/- 19 days and was complicated mainly by      post-operative right ventricular (RV) failure requiring short-term medical      support. The short-term in-hospital mortality was 14\%. Ten patients underwent      heart transplantation with 100\% survival post-transplant during the follow-up      period. One-year survival for patients with LVADs without transplantation was      64\%, and was not significantly different between amyloidosis and non-amyloidosis       patients. Larger left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions      were significantly associated with improved survival rates (RR = 0.94 and 0.95, p      < 0.05, respectively), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) </=46       mm was associated with increased mortality post-LVAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS:      LVAD is a feasible, life-saving therapy for end-stage heart failure related to      RCM, especially as a bridge to transplant and in patients with larger LV      dimensions.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
