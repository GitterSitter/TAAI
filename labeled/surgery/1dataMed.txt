The focus of this study was to analyze our institution\s       entire experience with primary CF-VAD implants, evaluate the baseline variables,       determine which factors predict the need for exchange, and evaluate the impact of      exchange on survival and event-free survival. METHODS: We retrospectively      reviewed the data of all patients in a single center who received a primary      CF-VAD implant between December 1999 and December 2013. All CF-VAD exchanges were      reviewed; demographics, indications, preoperative and operative data, and      clinical outcomes were summarized. Univariate and multivariable regression      analyses were performed to ascertain predictors for exchange. Time-to-event and      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: We identified 469 patients who      underwent 546 CF-VAD implantations. Of these patients, 66 (14\%) underwent 77      exchanges from one CF-VAD to another. The primary indications included hemolysis       or thrombosis (n = 49; 63.6\%), infection (n = 9; 11.7\%), or other causes (n = 19;      24.7\%). Survival was not significantly different between the exchange and      nonexchange groups. Multivariable regression analysis identified a history of      cerebrovascular events as a significant predictor for exchange. Among exchange      patients, 11 underwent heart transplantation, 3 had their CF-VADs explanted, 26      had ongoing support, and 26 died during device support. CONCLUSIONS: In our      series of contemporary CF-VAD exchanges, a history of previous cerebrovascular      events was a significant predictor for exchange. Exchange did not affect early or      late survival. Our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment of      pump-related complications with exchange is safe and justified.CI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
