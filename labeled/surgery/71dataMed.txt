There are few current      pediatric data assessing the impact of VAD support on post-transplant survival.      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric (</=18 years old, n      = 4,028) transplants performed between 1995 and 2011 and contained within the      United Network for Organ Sharing data set. Transplants were divided into three      eras: early (1995 to 2002, n = 1,450); intermediate (2003 to 2007, n = 1,138);      and recent (2008 to 2011, n = 1,440). VADs were present at transplant in 398      patients (9.8\%). Outcomes among patients with and without VADs were assessed and       compared across eras. RESULTS: The use of VADs for bridge to transplant has      increased (early 1.1\%, intermediate 10.5\%, recent 17.9\%; p < 0.0001). Mean weight      among VAD-supported patients (early 63.5 kg, intermediate 42.3 kg, recent 28.8      kg; p < 0.0001) has decreased during this period. VAD patients <10 kg had an      increased risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.1      to 10.8) compared with non-mechanical support patients. In multivariable      analyses, extracorporeal VADs were the only type of VAD associated with higher      post-transplant mortality (OR = 3.0, 95\% CI 0.8 to 10.6). Other types of VAD had       lower mortality (OR = 0.5, 95\% CI 0.2 to 1.0). Long-term survival was unaffected       by the use of a VAD pre-transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients bridged to      transplantation with VADs are increasingly younger and smaller. Complication      rates remain high among patients <10 kg. Early post-transplant survival among      intracorporeal and paracorporeal VAD patients is excellent and better when      compared with unsupported patients. The use of short-term support devices is      associated with higher post-transplant mortality. Long-term survival is      unaffected by VAD use.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.
