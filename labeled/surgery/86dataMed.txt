BACKGROUND: The transfemoral approach to IABP placement is associated with major       disadvantages, including the risk for infection and limitation of patient      mobility in those requiring extended support. METHODS: We developed a      percutaneous technique for placing IABPs in the left axillary artery that permits      upright sitting and ambulation. We performed a retrospective review of data from       patients who had undergone left axillary IABP implantation between 2007 and 2012.      RESULTS: Fifty patients who received a left axillary IABP as a bridge to      transplantation were identified, of whom 42 (84\%) underwent heart or      heart-multiorgan transplantation. Cumulative survival on IABP support was 92\%,      and post-transplant 90-day survival was 90\%. Median duration of support was 18      days. Four of 50 patients (8\%) died while on IABP support, and 3 (6\%) received      greater mechanical circulatory support. Four patients (8\%) had clinically      significant thromboembolic or bleeding events without long-term sequelae. The      most common minor adverse event was IABP malposition, in 22 patients (44\%).      Prolonged IABP support in the heart-transplantation cohort was associated with      significant improvements in mean pulmonary artery pressure and in creatinine and       total bilirubin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous insertion of an IABP      through the left axillary artery is a feasible and relatively well-tolerated      strategy to bridge patients with end-stage heart failure to heart      transplantation. This form of mechanical-device treatment permits upright sitting      and ambulation in those requiring extended support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
