The current analysis includes more than 6000      patients and updated risk factors for continuous flow pumps. Among continuous      flow pumps, actuarial survival is 80\% at 1 year and 70\% at 2 years. Quality of      life indicators are generally favorable and adverse event burden will likely      influence patient selections of advanced heart failure therapies.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
