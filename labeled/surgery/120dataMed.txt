Therefore, the balance between anti-coagulant and pro-coagulant factors needs to       be tightly controlled. The principle hypothesis of this study is that different      pump designs may have an effect on hemolysis and activation of the coagulation      system. Referring to this, the HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA)      and the HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) were      investigated. METHODS: For 20 patients with LVAD support (n = 10 each), plasma      coagulation, full blood count, and clinical chemistry parameters were measured.      Platelet function was monitored using platelet aggregometry, platelet function      analyzer-100 system ( Siemens, Marburg, Germany), vasodilator-stimulated      phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay, immature platelet fraction,      platelet-derived microparticles, and von Willebrand diagnostic. RESULTS: Acquired      von Willebrand syndrome could be detected in all patients. Signs of hemolysis, as      measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean, 470 U/liter HMII, 250 U/liter      HVAD; p < 0.001), were more pronounced in the HMII patients. In contrast, D-dimer      analysis indicated a significantly higher activation of the coagulation system in      HVAD patients (mean, 0.94 mg/liter HMII, 2.01 mg/liter HVAD; p < 0.01). The      efficacy of anti-platelet therapy using clopidogrel was not sufficient in more      than 50\% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the finding that all      patients with rotary blood pumps suffered from von Willebrand syndrome. In      addition, a distinct footprint of effects on hemolysis and the coagulation system      can be attributed to different devices. As a consequence, the individual status      of the coagulation system needs to be controlled in long-term patients.CI  - (c) 2013 Published by International Society for the Heart and Lung      Transplantation on behalf of International Society for Heart and Lung      Transplantation.FAU - Birschmann, IngvildAU  - Birschmann IAD  - Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation,      Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.
