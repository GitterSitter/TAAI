This      regulatory process requires a judicious balance between assuring safety and      efficacy, while providing efficient review to facilitate access to innovative      therapies. Recent contrasting views of the regulatory process have emphasized the      difficulties in obtaining an optimal balance. Mechanical circulatory support has       evolved to become an important therapy for patients with advanced heart failure      with the advent of more durable, implantable ventricular assist devices. The      regulatory oversight of these new technologies has been difficult owing to the      complexities of these devices, associated adverse event profile, and severity of       illness of the intended patient population. Maintaining a regulatory environment       to foster efficient introduction of safe and effective technologies is critical      to the success of ventricular assist device therapy and the health of patients      with advanced heart failure. Physicians representing key surgical and cardiology       societies, and representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, National      Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,      Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, and industry      partners gathered to discuss relevant issues regarding the current regulatory      environment assessing ventricular assist devices. The goal of the meeting was to       explore innovative ways to foster the introduction of technologically advanced,      safe, and effective ventricular assist devices.
