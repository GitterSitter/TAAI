Little is known      about post-transplant outcomes in patients complicated by late RHF during LVAD      support. METHODS: Between May 2004 and December 2013, 141 patients underwent      cardiac transplantation after isolated LVAD bridging at our center. Late RHF was       defined as heart failure requiring medical intervention >4 weeks after LVAD      implantation. RESULTS: The patients\ mean age was 53 +/- 13 years, 82\% were men,       and 36\% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of LVAD support before      transplantation was 0.75 years. Late RHF developed in 21 patients (15\%) during      LVAD support. Of these patients, 11 were supported with inotropic agents at the      time of transplantation. Patients with RHF had higher creatinine (1.6 +/- 0.88      mg/dL vs 1.3 +/- 0.67 mg/dL, p = 0.07), higher blood urea nitrogen (32 +/- 17      mg/dL vs 24 +/- 10 mg/dL, p = 0.0013), higher total bilirubin (0.96 +/- 0.46      mg/dL vs 0.78 +/- 0.42 mg/dL, p = 0.07), and lower albumin (3.8 +/- 0.60 g/dL vs       4.1 +/- 0.46 g/dL, p = 0.0019) at the time of transplantation compared with      patients who did not develop RHF. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher       in patients with late RHF during LVAD support (29\% vs 6.7\%, p = 0.002). Overall      post-transplant survival rates were 87\% at 1 year, 83\% at 3 years, and 77\% at 5      years. The 5-year post-transplant survival was significantly worse in patients      who developed late RHF during LVAD support compared with survival in patients who      did not develop RHF (26\% vs 87\%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Late RHF during LVAD      support adversely affects post-transplant survival.CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Takeda, KojiAU  - Takeda KAD  - Departments of (a)Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery.
