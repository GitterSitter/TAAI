There is rapid      growth in the use of left ventricular assist device therapy (LVAD) for advanced      heart failure, with a movement to pursue device intervention earlier in the      disease spectrum before comorbidities escalate. With this increase in LVAD use      have come new challenges, including unanticipated adverse events and high      readmission rates. Simultaneously, complications encountered during LVAD support       and an increased number of patients supported with a goal for transplant have had      an important effect on the allocation of cardiac allografts. Still, the field      continues to evolve and address these challenges in systematic fashion to provide      novel solutions and meet the needs of a growing population with advanced heart      failure. This has led to an extensive body of literature, ranging from case      reports to multicenter clinical trials, which will enhance the future of LVAD      technology and patient outcomes. This review summarizes important publications in      mechanical circulatory support during the past 24 months.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
