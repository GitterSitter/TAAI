It is caused by dysfunction of the heart due to muscle damage (systolic or diastolic\r\ndysfunction), valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias or other rare causes. Acute heart failure can\r\npresent as new-onset heart failure in people without known cardiac dysfunction, or as acute\r\ndecompensation of chronic heart failure.\r\nAcute heart failure is a common cause of admission to hospital (over 67,000 admissions in\r\nEngland and Wales per year) and is the leading cause of hospital admission in people 65 years\r\nor older in the UK.\r\nThis guideline includes important aspects of the diagnosis and management of acute heart\r\nfailure that are not addressed by the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure (NICE clinical\r\nguideline 108). The guideline on chronic heart failure focused on long-term management rather\r\nthan on the immediate care of someone who is acutely unwell as a result of heart failure.\r\nThis guideline covers the care of adults (aged 18 years or older) who have a diagnosis of acute\r\nheart failure, have possible acute heart failure, or are being investigated for acute heart failure. It\r\nincludes the following key clinical areas:\r\nthe role of early natriuretic peptide testing and echocardiography\r\nthe role of specialist management units\r\nthe use of ventilatory support, pharmacological therapy and ultrafiltration\r\ntreatment after stabilisation, including selected surgical interventions and initiation of the\r\npharmacological therapies that are used in the management of chronic heart failure.\r\nDrug recommendations\r\nThe guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug\'s summary of product characteristics to\r\ninform decisions made with individual patients.\r\nIn memory of Christopher Jones, patient member of the GDG who ensured that the patient\r\nvoice was heard during the development of this guideline.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014.

Last modified October 2014 Page 4 of 26\r\nPatient-centred care\r\nThis guideline offers best practice advice on the care of adults (aged 18 years and over) with\r\nacute heart failure or possible acute heart failure.\r\nPatients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the NHS\r\nConstitution for England – all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care\r\nshould take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity\r\nto make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare\r\nprofessionals. Healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health\'s advice on\r\nconsent. If someone does not have capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should\r\nfollow the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary\r\ncode of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards.\r\nNICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS\r\nservices. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patient experience\r\nin adult NHS services.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 5 of 26\r\nKey priorities for implementation\r\nThe following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation. The full list\r\nheart transplant\r\nof recommendations is in section 1.\r\nOrganisation of care\r\nAll hospitals admitting people with suspected acute heart failure should provide a specialist\r\nheart failure team that is based on a cardiology ward and provides outreach services.\r\nEnsure that all people being admitted to hospital with suspected acute heart failure have\r\nearly and continuing input from a dedicated specialist heart failure team.\r\nDiagnosis, assessment and monitoring\r\nIn people presenting with new suspected acute heart failure, use a single measurement of\r\nserum natriuretic peptides (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-B-type\r\nnatriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) and the following thresholds to rule out the diagnosis of\r\nheart failure.\r\nBNP less than 100 ng/litre\r\nNT-proBNP less than 300 ng/litre.\r\nIn people presenting with new suspected acute heart failure with raised natriuretic peptide\r\nlevels (see recommendation 1.2.2), perform transthoracic Doppler 2D echocardiography to\r\nestablish the presence or absence of cardiac abnormalities.\r\nIn people presenting with new suspected acute heart failure, consider performing\r\ntransthoracic Doppler 2D echocardiography within 48 hours of admission to guide early\r\nspecialist management.\r\nTreatment after stabilisation\r\nIn a person presenting with acute heart failure who is already taking beta-blockers, continue\r\nthe beta-blocker treatment unless they have a heart rate less than 50 beats per minute,\r\nsecond or third degree atrioventricular block, or shock.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014.

All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 13 of 26\r\n2 Research recommendations\r\nThe Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research,\r\nbased on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future.\r\n2.1 Dopamine\r\nIn people with acute heart failure, congestion and worsening renal function, does the addition of\r\nlow-dose dopamine to standard therapy lead to greater diuresis and renal protection compared\r\nwith adding placebo to standard therapy?\r\nWhy this is important\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted to investigate whether the addition of\r\nlow-dose dopamine to standard therapy leads to more clinically and cost effective decongestion\r\nin people admitted to hospital for treatment of decompensated heart failure. The study should\r\naim to investigate the diuretic effect of dopamine as well as effects on renal function.\r\nOne of the most common and difficult to manage problems arising during the initial treatment of\r\npeople with acute heart failure is an inadequate response to intravenous diuretic therapy (that is,\r\nfailure to relieve congestion), which is often associated with worsening renal function. This\r\ncombination frequently leads to a prolonged inpatient stay and is associated with higher inpatient\r\nmortality rates and higher post-discharge mortality and re-admission rates. The best treatment\r\nfor this combination of problems is unknown. However, theoretical and experimental evidence\r\nindicates that low-dose dopamine may improve renal blood flow, as well as enhance sodium and\r\nwater excretion. Clinical trials have not yet resolved whether in some patients, the use of\r\nlow-dose dopamine actually results in improved decongestion and shorter hospital stays.\r\n2.2 Thiazide\r\nIn people with acute heart failure and persistent congestion, does the addition of a thiazide\r\ndiuretic to standard therapy lead to greater diuresis compared with adding placebo to standard\r\ntherapy?\r\nWhy this is important\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 14 of 26\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted to investigate whether the addition of a\r\nthiazide diuretic to standard therapy leads to more clinically and cost effective decongestion in\r\npeople admitted to hospital for treatment of decompensated heart failure.\r\nOne of the most common and difficult to manage problems arising during the initial treatment of\r\npeople with acute heart failure is an inadequate response to intravenous diuretic therapy. This\r\nfrequently leads to a prolonged inpatient stay and is associated with higher inpatient mortality\r\nand higher post-discharge mortality and re-admission rates. The best treatment for this problem\r\nis unknown. However, there is some inconsistent and non-robust evidence that addition of a\r\nthiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (metolazone) may be beneficial. The proposed study would aim\r\nto resolve this uncertainty and guide the management of a difficult clinical problem.\r\n2.3 Intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation\r\nIn people with acute heart failure and hypoperfusion syndrome, is the use of intra-aortic balloon\r\ncounter-pulsation pump (IABP) better than the use of intravenous inotropes?\r\nWhy this is important\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted in people with decompensated heart failure\r\ndue to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion comparing the use of\r\nIABP with the use of inotropes/vasopressors. This would determine which strategy is more\r\nclinically and cost effective in this cohort.\r\nIABP is used in the hospital setting as an adjuvant in people with critical coronary ischaemia and\r\nin people with mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. It has also been used in\r\npeople who develop cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is uncertain\r\nwhether it can provide clinical benefit in the critically unwell patients with acute heart failure due\r\nto left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion.\r\n2.4 Ultrafiltration\r\nIn people with decompensated heart failure, fluid congestion and diuretic resistance, does\r\nultrafiltration lead to more rapid and effective decongestion compared with continuing diuretic\r\ntreatment?\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved. Last modified October 2014 Page 15 of 26\r\nWhy this is important\r\nA randomised controlled trial should be undertaken to determine whether ultrafiltration is more\r\nclinically and cost effective than conventional diuretic therapy for people admitted to hospital with\r\ndecompensated heart failure. The study should not only investigate several clinical outcomes but\r\nalso consider the impact of treatments on quality of life and provide data on safety.\r\nPeople who have fluid retention that is resistant to conventional diuretic therapy, with or without\r\nrenal dysfunction, make up a high proportion of hospital admissions due to heart failure. Such\r\nadmissions are often prolonged and therefore have important budgetary implications for the\r\nNHS. The few, relatively small scale, randomised trials of ultrafiltration performed so far have\r\nbeen conducted in healthcare settings very different from the UK, with less fluid retention than is\r\nusually seen in UK practice, and where length of stay is usually much shorter than in UK (and\r\nEuropean) practice. Although technically feasible, the evidence for benefit on heart failure\r\noutcomes is inconsistent and difficult to generalise to UK practice. Therefore a UK-based study\r\nof sufficient quality is needed.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014. All rights reserved.

Last modified October 2014 Page 23 of 26\r\nAbout this guideline\r\nNICE clinical guidelines are recommendations about the treatment and care of people with\r\nspecific diseases and conditions.\r\nNICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a scope that defines what the guideline will\r\nand will not cover.\r\nThis guideline was developed by the National Clinical Guideline Centre. The Centre worked with\r\na Guideline Development Group, comprising healthcare professionals (including consultants,\r\nGPs and nurses), patients and carers, and technical staff, which reviewed the evidence and\r\ndrafted the recommendations. The recommendations were finalised after public consultation.\r\nThe methods and processes for developing NICE clinical guidelines are described in The\r\nguidelines manual.\r\nNICE produces guidance, standards and information on commissioning and providing\r\nhigh-quality healthcare, social care, and public health services. We have agreements to provide\r\ncertain NICE services to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Decisions on how NICE\r\nguidance and other products apply in those countries are made by ministers in the Welsh\r\ngovernment, Scottish government, and Northern Ireland Executive. NICE guidance or other\r\nproducts may include references to organisations or people responsible for commissioning or\r\nproviding care that may be relevant only to England.\r\nStrength of recommendations\r\nSome recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline\r\nDevelopment Group makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and\r\nharms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some\r\ninterventions, the Guideline Development Group is confident that, given the information it has\r\nlooked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the\r\nrecommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made\r\n(the strength of the recommendation).\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014.

This discussion aims to help\r\nthem to reach a fully informed decision (see also Patient-centred care).\r\nInterventions that must (or must not) be used\r\nWe usually use \'must\' or \'must not\' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation.\r\nOccasionally we use \'must\' (or \'must not\') if the consequences of not following the\r\nrecommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.\r\nInterventions that should (or should not) be used – a \'strong\'\r\nrecommendation\r\nWe use \'offer\' (and similar words such as \'refer\' or \'advise\') when we are confident that, for the\r\nvast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. We\r\nuse similar forms of words (for example, \'Do not offer…\') when we are confident that an\r\nintervention will not be of benefit for most patients.\r\nInterventions that could be used\r\nWe use \'consider\' when we are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for\r\nmost patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice\r\nof intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the\r\npatient\'s values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare\r\nprofessional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.\r\nOther versions of this guideline\r\nThe full guideline, Acute heart failure: diagnosing and managing acute heart failure in adults\r\ncontains details of the methods and evidence used to develop the guideline. It is published by\r\nthe National Clinical Guideline Centre.\r\nThe recommendations from this guideline have been incorporated into a NICE pathway.\r\nWe have produced information for the public about this guideline.\r\nAcute heart failure NICE clinical guideline 187\r\n© NICE 2014.

Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when\r\nexercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual\r\nassist support devices\r\nresponsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of\r\nthe individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by\r\nthe summaries of product characteristics of any drugs.\r\nImplementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers.\r\nCommissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the\r\nguidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate\r\nunlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this\r\nguidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those\r\nduties.\r\nCopyright\r\n© National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014.
