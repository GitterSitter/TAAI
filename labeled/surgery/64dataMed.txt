Our group developed two transplant programs at Instituto Nacional del      Torax and Clinica Davila. We report our clinical experience based on distinctive       clinical policies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients were      transplanted between November 2008 and April 2013, representing 51\% of all      Chilean cases. Distinctive clinical policies include intensive donor management,       generic immunosuppression and VAD (ventricular assist devices) insertion.      RESULTS: Ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy were the main indications (23 (43\%)      each), age 48 +/- 13 years and 48 (91\%) were male. Transplant listing Status: IA       14 (26\%) (VAD or 2 inotropes), IB 14 (26\%) (1 inotrope) and II25 (47\%) (no      inotrope). Mean waiting time 70 +/- 83 days. Twelve (24\%) were transplanted      during VAD support (median support: 36 days). OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: orthotopic      bicaval transplant with ischemia time: 175 +/- 54 min. Operative mortality: 3      (6\%), all due to right ventricular failure. Re-exploration for bleeding 2 (4\%),      stroke 3 (6\%), mediastinitis 0 (0\%), pneumonia 4 (8\%), and transient dialysis 6      (11\%). Mean follow-up was 21 +/- 14 months. Three-year survival was 86 +/- 6\%.      One patient died of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and the other died suddenly       (non-compliance). Freedom from rejection requiring specific therapy was 80 +/- 7\%      at 3 years of follow-up. Four hundred eighty four endomyocardial biopsies were      done: 11 (2.3\%) had 2R rejection. All survivors are in NYHA (New York Heart      Association) functional class I and all but one have normal biventricular      function. CONCLUSION: Mid-term results are similar to those reported by the      registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. This      experience has a higher proportion of VAD support than previous national series.       Rejection rates are low in spite of generic immunosuppression.FAU - Villavicencio, MauricioAU  - Villavicencio MFAU - Rossel, VictorAU  - Rossel VFAU - Larrea, RicardoAU  - Larrea RFAU - Peralta, Juan PabloAU  -
