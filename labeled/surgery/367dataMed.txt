Although extracorporeal membrane      oxygenation is commonly used in infants and children, ventricular assist devices       (VAD) provide a longer duration of support with fewer complications before      recovery or as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx), as described herein.      METHODS: This retrospective chart review of eight patients transplanted from      April 2008 to December 2011, after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      implantation due to end-stage heart failure. Their mean age was 12 years (9-15 y)      and mean body weight, 48 kg (20-78). All were New York Heart Association      functional class IV with mean left ventricular ejection fractions less than 15\%.       RESULTS: The six patients (75\%) received HTx after a mean LVAD support duration      of 43.2 days; 2 (25\%) died before a suitable heart became available. Their mean      duration of LVAD support was 30 days. There were 4 (50\%) who experienced      clinically evident thromboembolic events: 3 (37.5\%) cerebrovascular with 1      mortality and 1 (12.5\%) as acute limb ischemia. Transient hemodialysis was      performed in 4 (50\%). Bloodstream infection identified in 6 (75\%) was controlled       with intravenous antibiotics. Driveline infection identified in 4 (50\%) was      treated successfully with local wound dressing changes and intravenous      antibiotics. One 9-year-old boy died of rejection at 16 months after      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the organ shortage, pediatric patients      have a low chance to undergo HTx. VAD provides long-term support for children      with end-stage heart failure before a suitable heart becomes available. A      thromboembolic event remains a major complication influencing their survival.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012.
