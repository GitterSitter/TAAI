Unloading of the left ventricle with an      implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may reverse these pulmonary      vascular changes. We studied the effect of implanting centrifugal LVADs in a      cohort of patients with secondary PH as a bridge to candidacy. METHODS: Pulmonary      haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal LVADs at a single unit      between May 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:      Twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal LVADs (eight HeartWare      ventricular assist device (HVAD), HeartWare International, USA and 21      VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd., Australia). Seventeen were ineligible for transplant      by virtue of high TPG/PVR. All the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon       pump followed by LVAD insertion. Four required temporary right VAD support.      Thirty-day mortality post-LVAD was 3.4\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\%      (24 of 28). Thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortality      was 7.7\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\% (10 of 11). Baseline and post-VAD       pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic PAP (mmHg), mean      PAP, TPG (mmHg) of 57 +/- 9.5, 42 +/- 4.4 and 14 +/- 3.9 reduced to 32 +/- 7.5,      18 +/- 5.5 and 9 +/- 3.3, respectively. PVR reduced from 5 +/- 1.5 to 2.1 +/- 0.5      Wood units (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In selected heart failure patients with      secondary PH, use of centrifugal LVAD results in significant reductions in PAP,      TPG and PVR, which are observed within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months.      Such patients bridged to candidacy have post-transplant survival comparable with       those having a heart transplant as primary treatment.FAU - Kutty, Ramesh SAU  - Kutty RSAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The Transplant Unit, Papworth Hospital,      Cambridge, UK. ramesh.kutty@papworth.nhs.ukFAU - Parameshwar, JayanAU  - Parameshwar JFAU - Lewis, CliveAU  - Lewis CFAU - Catarino, Pedro AAU  - Catarino PAFAU - Sudarshan, Catherine DAU  - Sudarshan CDFAU - Jenkins, David PAU  - Jenkins DPFAU - Dunning, John JAU  - Dunning JJFAU - Tsui, Steven SAU  - Tsui SSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130122PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Jun;43(6):1242-3. - 23345184own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130517dcom- 20140305is  - 1873-734x (electronic)is  - 1010-7940 (linking)vi  - 43ip  - 6dp  - 2013 junti  - use of centrifugal left ventricular assist device as a bridge to candidacy in      severe heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension.pg  - 1237-42lid - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs678 [doi]ab  - objectives: raised pulmonary artery pressure (pap), trans-pulmonary gradient      (tpg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) are risk factors for poor outcomes       after heart transplant in patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (ph) and      may contraindicate transplant. unloading of the left ventricle with an      implantable left ventricular assist device (lvad) may reverse these pulmonary      vascular changes. we studied the effect of implanting centrifugal lvads in a      cohort of patients with secondary ph as a bridge to candidacy. methods: pulmonary      haemodynamics on patients implanted with centrifugal lvads at a single unit      between may 2005 and december 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. results:      twenty-nine patients were implanted with centrifugal lvads (eight heartware      ventricular assist device (hvad), heartware international, usa and 21      ventrassist, ventracor ltd., australia). seventeen were ineligible for transplant      by virtue of high tpg/pvr. all the patients were optimized with inotrope/balloon       pump followed by lvad insertion. four required temporary right vad support.      thirty-day mortality post-lvad was 3.4\% (1 of 29) with a 1-year survival of 85.7\%      (24 of 28). thirteen patients have been transplanted to date: 30-day mortality      was 7.7\% (1 of 13) and 1-year survival was 91\% (10 of 11). baseline and post-vad       pulmonary haemodynamics were significantly improved: systolic pap (mmhg), mean      pap, tpg (mmhg) of 57 +/- 9.5, 42 +/- 4.4 and 14 +/- 3.9 reduced to 32 +/- 7.5,      18 +/- 5.5 and 9 +/- 3.3, respectively. pvr reduced from 5 +/- 1.5 to 2.1 +/- 0.5      wood units (p < 0.05). conclusions: in selected heart failure patients with      secondary ph, use of centrifugal lvad results in significant reductions in pap,      tpg and pvr, which are observed within 1 month, reaching a nadir by 3 months.      such patients bridged to candidacy have post-transplant survival comparable with       those having a heart transplant as primary treatment.fau - kutty, ramesh sau  - kutty rsad  - department of cardiothoracic surgery, the transplant unit, papworth hospital,      cambridge, uk. ramesh.kutty@papworth.nhs.ukfau - parameshwar, jayanau  - parameshwar jfau - lewis, cliveau  - lewis cfau - catarino, pedro aau  - catarino pafau - sudarshan, catherine dau  - sudarshan cdfau - jenkins, david pau  - jenkins dpfau - dunning, john jau  - dunning jjfau - tsui, steven sau  - tsui ssla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20130122pl  - germanyta  - eur j cardiothorac surgjt  - european journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the european      association for cardio-thoracic surgeryjid - 8804069sb  - imcin - eur j cardiothorac surg. 2013 jun;43(6):1242-3.
