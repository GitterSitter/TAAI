This study investigates whether these therapeutic advances      have translated into improvement in outcomes for patients with advanced HF      referred to a heart transplant center. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HF      (n=2507) referred to a single university center were analyzed in three 6-year      eras during which medical and device therapies were evolving: 1993 to 1998 (era      1), 1999 to 2004 (era 2), and 2005 to 2010 (era 3). Impaired hemodynamics and      comorbidities were more frequent at time of referral in later eras, whereas other      HF severity parameters where similar or improved. Successive eras had greater      usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers,       beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, implantable cardioverter defibrillators,       and cardiac resynchronization therapy, consistent with evolving evidence and      guideline recommendations over the study period. All-cause mortality and sudden      death were significantly lower in era 2 and 3 compared with era 1. After      multivariable risk adjustment, era 3 had significantly decreased 2- and 3-year      all-cause mortality risk and significantly decreased 1- and 3-year sudden death      risk compared with era 1. However, progressive HF death and the combined outcome       of mortality/urgent transplant/ventricular assist device were modestly increased       in the latter eras. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 2 decades, patients with advanced       HF referred to and managed at a tertiary university referral center have      benefited from advances in HF medications and devices, as evidenced by      improvements in overall survival and sudden death risk.FAU - Loh, John CAU  - Loh JCAD  - David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095,      USA.FAU - Creaser, JulieAU  - Creaser JFAU - Rourke, Darlene AAU  - Rourke DAFAU - Livingston, NancyAU  - Livingston NFAU - Harrison, Tamara KAU  - Harrison TKFAU - Vandenbogaart, ElizabethAU  - Vandenbogaart EFAU - Moriguchi, JaimeAU  - Moriguchi JFAU - Hamilton, Michele AAU  - Hamilton MAFAU - Tseng, Chi-HongAU  - Tseng CHFAU - Fonarow, Gregg CAU  - Fonarow GCFAU - Horwich, Tamara BAU  - Horwich TBLA  - engGR  - 1K23HL085097/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 HL085097/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20130311PL  - United StatesTA  - Circ Heart FailJT  - Circulation.
