The prolonged time for patients awaiting HTx       on the high-urgency (HU) status leads mostly to serious medical complications.      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the trend of changes in the      frequency of ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation in patients on the HU      status. METHODS: A total of 22 adult patients awaiting transplantation on the HU       status at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2011 were analyzed,      assessing risk profile, blood group, and complication rates in terms of VAD      implantation or death. Results were compared with 16 consecutive patients who      were on transplant list with the HU status between January 2010 and December 2010      at our institution. RESULTS: Mean age was 49.5 +/- 12.1 (2010 group) years and      51.4 +/- 10.7 years (2011 group; p = 0.62). Mean logEuroSCORES raised not      significantly from 9.1 +/- 6.3\% (2010 group) to 10.7 +/- 14.7\% (2011 group; p =      0.68). Six patients died on the HU status and seven patients had to be supplied      with a VAD in 2011. In comparison with the preceding year, only two patients died      in 2010 and none of our patients on the HU status had to be provided with      mechanical circulatory support. CONCLUSION: Because of the prolonged waiting time      on the HU list, the earlier-mentioned data demonstrate a negative trend in      transplant medicine. Especially when taking into consideration that five of seven      patients who needed a VAD implantation during the HU waiting period had blood      group O. Furthermore, the data derived from Eurotransplant show that the waiting       period for patients with blood group O was considerably longer when compared with      patients of the same average body height and weight but with other blood groups.CI  - Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .
