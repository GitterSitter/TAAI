This article defines and clarifies the major      classification of these pumps as axial or centrifugal continuous-flow devices by       discussing the difference in their inherent mechanics and describing how these      features translate clinically to pump selection and patient management issues.      Axial vs centrifugal pump and bearing design, theory of operation, hydrodynamic      performance, and current vs flow relationships are discussed. A review of axial      vs centrifugal physiology, pre-load and after-load sensitivity, flow pulsatility,      and issues related to automatic physiologic control and suction prevention      algorithms is offered. Reliability and biocompatibility of the two types of pumps      are reviewed from the perspectives of mechanical wear, implant life, hemolysis,      and pump deposition. Finally, a glimpse into the future of continuous-flow      technologies is presented.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.
