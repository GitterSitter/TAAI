Therefore, hESC-derived and hiPSC-derived\r\n      cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs and hiPSC-CMs, respectively) offer great potential for\r\n      cardiac regenerative medicine. Unlike some organs, the heart has a limited\r\n      ability to regenerate, and dysfunction resulting from significant cardiomyocyte\r\n      loss under pathophysiological conditions, such as myocardial infarction (MI), can\r\n      lead to heart failure. Unfortunately, for patients with end-stage heart failure, \r\n      heart transplantation remains the main alternative, and it is insufficient,\r\n      mainly because of the limited availability of donor organs. Although left\r\n      ventricular assist devices are progressively entering clinical practice as a\r\n      bridge to transplantation and even as an optional therapy, cell replacement\r\n      therapy presents a plausible alternative to donor organ transplantation. During\r\n      the past decade, multiple candidate cells were proposed for cardiac regeneration,\r\n      and their mechanisms of action in the myocardium have been explored. The purpose \r\n      of this article is to critically review the comprehensive research involving the \r\n      use of hESCs and hiPSCs in MI models and to discuss current controversies,\r\n      unresolved issues, challenges, and future directions.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

METHODS: Patients \r\n      with perioperative RVF who underwent temporary RVAD implantation between January \r\n      2010 and February 2014 were reviewed. A dacron graft was attached to the\r\n      pulmonary artery and passed through a subxiphoid exit, where the RVAD outflow\r\n      cannula was inserted. The inflow cannula was percutaneously cannulated in the\r\n      femoral vein, and the sternum was primarily closed. On the day of RVAD\r\n      explantation, the outflow graft of the RVAD was pulled and ligated, and the\r\n      insertion site was secondarily closed. The RVAD inflow cannula was removed, and\r\n      direct pressure was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (age 58 +/- 14 years)\r\n      were supported. Seventeen patients (81\%) had RVF after left ventricular assist\r\n      device implantation, and 4 patients developed postcardiotomy RVF. The median\r\n      duration of RVAD support was 9 days (range: 2-88 days). Eleven patients (52\%)\r\n      were successfully weaned from the RVAD. Two patients were bridged to\r\n      transplantation. Eight patients died on left ventricular assist device and/or\r\n      RVAD support. The survival rates to discharge or heart transplantation, and to\r\n      1-year, were 62\% and 52\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No technical issues were\r\n      encountered in this large series of RVAD implantations using the described\r\n      technique for various forms of postoperative RVF. Extended support duration and\r\n      reduction of resternotomy risks may be the main advantages of this technique\r\n      compared with conventional RVAD implantation methods.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

It is one of the\r\n      leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and carries a 5-year\r\n      mortality of 50\%, estimated by WHO to represent 30\% of deaths in the United\r\n      States. Costs related to the care of patients with CHF have increased\r\n      substantially over the past 2 decades partly owing to increased frequency of\r\n      hospitalization, implantation of costly novel devices and, as the disease\r\n      progresses, consideration for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, and end-of-life care. CHF progression is accompanied by changes within\r\n      the myocardium, collectively referred to as left ventricular remodeling, which\r\n      can be categorized into changes in the cardiomyocytes and changes that occur in\r\n      the volume and composition of the extracellular matrix. Since remodeling in heart\r\n      failure is progressive and detrimental, the majority of treatment strategies are \r\n      aimed at stopping or possibly reversing this process. Some successful methods\r\n      include medical management, long-term or destination mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, cardiac resychronization therapy, and biventricular pacemakers. During\r\n      the last few decades, the management of heart failure has evolved tremendously\r\n      with the introduction of new therapies and assist devices. Advances in mechanical\r\n      support, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and total artificial heart have\r\n      significantly reduced mortality in patients awaiting transplantation.

However, these therapeutic strategies are limited by a lack of\r\n      donor hearts and by the associated complications, such as coagulation and\r\n      infection, due to the used artificial mechanical circulatory assist devices.\r\n      Therefore, new strategies for myocardial regenerative approaches are under\r\n      extensive research to produce contractile myocardial tissue in the future to\r\n      replace non-contractile myocardial ischemic and scarred tissue. Different\r\n      approaches, such as cell transplantation, have been studied intensively. Although\r\n      successful approaches have been observed, there are still limitations to the\r\n      application. It is envisaged that myocardial tissue engineering can be used to\r\n      help replace infarcted non-contractile tissue. The developed tissue should later \r\n      mimic the aligned fibrillar structure of the extracellular matrix and provide\r\n      important guidance cues for the survival, function and the needed orientation of \r\n      cardiomyocytes. Nanostructured surfaces have been tested to provide a guided\r\n      direction that cells can follow. In the present study, the cellular\r\n      adhesion/alignment of human cardiomyocytes and the biocompatibility have been\r\n      investigated after cultivation on different laser-patterned nanowires compared\r\n      with unmodified nanowires. As a result, the nanostructured surfaces possessed\r\n      good biocompatibility before and after laser modification. The laser-induced\r\n      scalability of the pattern enabled the growth and orientation of the adhered\r\n      myocardial tissue. Such approaches may be used to modify the surface of potential\r\n      scaffolds to develop myocardial contractile tissue in the future.\r\nFAU - Kiefer, Karin\r\nAU  - Kiefer K\r\nAD  - Clinic for Paediatric Cardiology, Saarland University, Building 9, 66421 Homburg,\r\n      Germany.

The use of ventricular assist devices to provide circulatory \r\n      support to these patients remains challenging. In the current study, a continuous\r\n      axial-flow pump was used to support a univentricular Fontan circulation. A\r\n      modified Fontan circulation (atrio-pulmonary connection) was constructed in six\r\n      Yorkshire piglets (8-14 kg). A Dacron conduit (12 mm) with two branches was\r\n      constructed to serve as a complete atrio-pulmonary connection without the use of \r\n      cardiopulmonary bypass. The Impella pump was inserted into the conduit through an\r\n      additional Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft in five animals. Hemodynamic data\r\n      were collected for 6 hours under the supported Fontan circulation. The control\r\n      animal died after initiating the Fontan circulation independent of resuscitation.\r\n      Four pump supported animals remained hemodynamically stable for 6 hours with pump\r\n      speeds between 18,000 rpm and 22,000 rpm (P1-P3). Oxygen saturation was\r\n      maintained between 95\% and 100\%. Normal organ perfusion was illustrated by blood \r\n      gas analysis and biochemical assays.

Clinicians have, therefore, turned to mechanical means of circulatory \r\n      support. At present, a broad range of devices are available, which may be\r\n      extracorporeal, implantable, or percutaneous; temporary or long term. Although\r\n      counter pulsation provided by intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and comprehensive \r\n      mechanical support for both the systemic and the pulmonary circulation through\r\n      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain a major tool of acute care in\r\n      patients with cardiogenic shock, both before and after surgical or percutaneous\r\n      intervention, the development of devices such as the Impella or the Tandemheart\r\n      allows less invasive forms of temporary support. On the other hand, concerning\r\n      mid-, or long-term support, left ventricular assist devices have evolved from a\r\n      last resort life-saving therapy to a well-established viable alternative for\r\n      thousands of heart failure patients caused by the shortage of donor organs\r\n      available for transplantation. The optimal selection of the assist device is\r\n      based on the initial consideration according to hemodynamic situation,\r\n      comorbidities, intended time of use and therapeutic options.

The two main reasons for this \r\n      development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing\r\n      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTX). Furthermore, the\r\n      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience\r\n      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term\r\n      patient outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist\r\n      device (LVAD) implantation at our Erlangen Heart Center during January 2000-July \r\n      2013. The main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the\r\n      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. From all patients, we created a\r\n      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and\r\n      described the overall outcome. RESULTS: VAD implantation was performed in 266\r\n      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2\% of the total of 12254 cardiac\r\n      surgical operations in that period). From these patients, 223 underwent LVAD or\r\n      biventricular (BVAD) implantation; the remaining received a right (RVAD)\r\n      implantation. The most frequent underlying clinical diagnoses were dilated (n =\r\n      84, 37.7\%, DCM) or ischemic (n = 61, 27.4\%, ICM) cardiomyopathy. The pathological\r\n      findings in the apex biopsy were generally non-specific and showed variable\r\n      interstitial myocardial fibrosis with evidence of fibre loss, fatty degeneration \r\n      and variable irregular atrophy of muscle fibres, consistent with dilated and\r\n      ischemic cardiomyopathies as the most frequent causes of heart failure in these\r\n      patients. Only a few cases showed other specific features such as myocarditis and\r\n      AL-amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during\r\n      LVAD implantation are rather non-specific and they generally reflect the late\r\n      stage or consequences of chronic myocardial damage in cases of dilated or\r\n      ischemic cardiomyopathies. Variable patchy chronic inflammatory changes may be\r\n      observed in cardiomyopathies as a non-specific reaction caused by myocardial\r\n      fiber damage and should not lead to misinterpretation as evidence of myocarditis \r\n      or revision of original diagnosis.\r\nFAU - Strecker, Thomas\r\nAU  - Strecker T\r\nAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nFAU - Rosch, Johannes\r\nAU  - Rosch J\r\nAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nFAU - Weyand, Michael\r\nAU  - Weyand M\r\nAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nFAU - Agaimy, Abbas\r\nAU  - Agaimy A\r\nAD  - Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg\r\n      Erlangen, Germany.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\t\r\nDEP - 20140815\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Int J Clin Exp Pathol\r\nJT  - International journal of clinical and experimental pathology\r\nJID - 101480565\r\nSB  - IM\r\nPMC - PMC4203167\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4203167\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)\r\nOT  - apex pathology\r\nOT  - dilatative cardiomyopathy\r\nOT  - ischemic cardiomyopathy\r\nOT  - myocarditis\r\nEDAT- 2014/10/23 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/10/23 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/10/23 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014 [ecollection]\r\nPHST- 2014/07/10 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/21 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/15 [epublish]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Aug 15;7(9):5549-56. eCollection 2014.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25330851\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141021\r\nDCOM- 20150511\r\nIS  - 2329-0358 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1425-9524 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 19\r\nDP  - 2014\r\nTI  - The effect of the sequential therapy in end-stage heart failure (ESHF)--from\r\n      ECMO, through the use of implantable pump for a pneumatic heart assist system,\r\n      Religa Heart EXT, as a bridge for orthotopic heart transplant (OHT).

Methods applied at the right time\r\n      before the occurrence of irreversible changes in organs give a chance for\r\n      survival and prolong life. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on the safety and\r\n      efficacy of the sequential use of the above treatments in a 58-year old patient\r\n      with heart failure in dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM). A 7-day mechanical blood\r\n      circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO),\r\n      followed by a 13-day implantation of a left ventricular assist device, Religa\r\n      Heart EXT, was used as a bridge to a successful orthotopic heart transplant\r\n      (OHT). On Day 40 after OHT, the patient was discharged home with stable function \r\n      of the circulatory system. We describe our experiences with the qualification,\r\n      preparation, and procedure of sequential ECMO, Religa Heart EXT, and OHT.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Application of short-term ECMO as a bridge-to-bridge helped save the\r\n      patient from severe cardiogenic shock caused by increased left ventricular\r\n      afterload. The experimental implantation of an innovative Religa Heart EXT\r\n      prosthesis was a safe and efficacious bridge to transplantation. Too short time\r\n      of Religa Heart EXT implantation in the discussed patient prevented the\r\n      possibility to evaluate the occurrence of thromboembolic complications and\r\n      infections compared to the documented complications of POLVAD implanted until\r\n      now.

New literature suggests that rates of\r\n      device-related thrombosis may be increasing since 2011, which is particularly\r\n      troublesome given that this pathology can result in a disabling stroke, organ\r\n      damage, and death. In 2013, a group of practitioners in the field of mechanical\r\n      circulatory support published a treatment algorithm based on their expert\r\n      opinion. However, a comprehensive review of the pharmacotherapy of this condition\r\n      is lacking. A search of the literature revealed 20 separate publications of case \r\n      reports or case series describing outcomes associated with the use of drug\r\n      therapy for suspected pump thrombosis. Each of these experiences was limited by\r\n      small sample size, nonrandomized treatment allocation, and nonstandardized\r\n      medication dosing. Data describing the outcomes of surgical versus medical\r\n      management of device thrombosis are also sparse, with only three published\r\n      reports identified. Based on the review of this limited literature, surgical\r\n      management appears to be the preferred treatment modality, especially in those\r\n      with organ hypoperfusion or hemodynamic instability. In patients ineligible for\r\n      surgery, pharmacotherapy options remain limited. Use of all drug classes\r\n      described in the literature for the HeartMate II device-fibrinolytics,\r\n      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors-was hindered by \r\n      either marginal efficacy or bleeding. Based on historical experience with\r\n      unfractionated heparin in patients under HeartMate II support, we recommend this \r\n      agent as a possible option for those with suspected pump thrombosis in lieu of\r\n      surgical device exchange. For the HeartWare HVAD, limited data suggest that\r\n      direct intraventricular administration of alteplase may be an acceptable\r\n      treatment alternative. Additional research is clearly needed to further delineate\r\n      the role of pharmacotherapy and to identify the optimal agent for managing this\r\n      potentially life-threatening condition.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.\r\nFAU - Jennings, Douglas L\r\nAU  - Jennings DL\r\nAD  - Nova Southeastern University, Ft.

Patients seek out\r\n      informational resources when considering implantation. The primary study\r\n      objective was to characterize the scope and quality of available LVAD educational\r\n      materials. METHODS AND RESULTS: In July 2013, we performed a cross-sectional\r\n      search of Internet, print, and multimedia resources available to patients\r\n      considering LVAD. Written materials <10 sentences, videos <2 minutes, and\r\n      materials clearly directed to healthcare professionals were excluded.\r\n      Seventy-seven materials met inclusion criteria. Potential benefits of LVAD\r\n      therapy were discussed in all (n=77), whereas less often mentioned were risks\r\n      (n=43), lifestyle considerations (n=29), surgical details (n=26), caregiver\r\n      information (n=9), and hospice or palliative care (n=2). Of the 14 materials that\r\n      recognized a decision or alternate treatment option, 7 used outdated statistics, \r\n      12 scored above an eighth grade reading comprehension level, and 12 met <50\% of\r\n      International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. In the survey participants\r\n      rated all but one as biased toward accepting LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although \r\n      many resources exist for patients considering an LVAD, the content is suboptimal.\r\n      Benefits of LVADs are often presented in the absence of risks, alternative\r\n      options, and caregiver considerations. Most materials use outdated statistics,\r\n      are above the reading level of average Americans, and are biased toward accepting\r\n      LVAD therapy. There is no tool that would qualify as a formal decision aid.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.\r\nFAU - Iacovetto, Matthew C\r\nAU  - Iacovetto MC\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Matlock, Daniel D\r\nAU  - Matlock DD\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - McIlvennan, Colleen K\r\nAU  - McIlvennan CK\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Thompson, Jocelyn S\r\nAU  - Thompson JS\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Bradley, William\r\nAU  - Bradley W\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - LaRue, Shane J\r\nAU  - LaRue SJ\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.).\r\nFAU - Allen, Larry A\r\nAU  - Allen LA\r\nAD  - From the School of Medicine (M.C.I.), Divisions of General Internal Medicine\r\n      (D.D.M.) and Cardiology (C.K.M., L.A.A.), and Colorado Health Outcomes Program\r\n      (D.D.M., C.K.M., J.S.T., L.A.A.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Mechanical Circulatory Support Program, University of Colorado Hospital, \r\n      Aurora (W.B.); and Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation, Division\r\n      of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis-School \r\n      of Medicine, MO (S.J.L.). larry.allen@ucdenver.edu.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\t\r\nDEP - 20141014\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes\r\nJT  - Circulation.

The focus of this study was to analyze our institution\s \r\n      entire experience with primary CF-VAD implants, evaluate the baseline variables, \r\n      determine which factors predict the need for exchange, and evaluate the impact of\r\n      exchange on survival and event-free survival. METHODS: We retrospectively\r\n      reviewed the data of all patients in a single center who received a primary\r\n      CF-VAD implant between December 1999 and December 2013. All CF-VAD exchanges were\r\n      reviewed; demographics, indications, preoperative and operative data, and\r\n      clinical outcomes were summarized. Univariate and multivariable regression\r\n      analyses were performed to ascertain predictors for exchange. Time-to-event and\r\n      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: We identified 469 patients who\r\n      underwent 546 CF-VAD implantations. Of these patients, 66 (14\%) underwent 77\r\n      exchanges from one CF-VAD to another. The primary indications included hemolysis \r\n      or thrombosis (n = 49; 63.6\%), infection (n = 9; 11.7\%), or other causes (n = 19;\r\n      24.7\%). Survival was not significantly different between the exchange and\r\n      nonexchange groups. Multivariable regression analysis identified a history of\r\n      cerebrovascular events as a significant predictor for exchange. Among exchange\r\n      patients, 11 underwent heart transplantation, 3 had their CF-VADs explanted, 26\r\n      had ongoing support, and 26 died during device support. CONCLUSIONS: In our\r\n      series of contemporary CF-VAD exchanges, a history of previous cerebrovascular\r\n      events was a significant predictor for exchange. Exchange did not affect early or\r\n      late survival. Our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment of\r\n      pump-related complications with exchange is safe and justified.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Primarily on the basis\r\n      of these animal data, the notion that chronic left ventricular assist device\r\n      (LVAD)-induced unloading will result in atrophy has dominated the clinical heart \r\n      failure field, and anti-atrophic drugs have been used to enhance the cardiac\r\n      recovery potential observed in some LVAD patients. However, whether\r\n      unloading-induced atrophy in experimental normal heart models applies to failing \r\n      and hypertrophic myocardium in heart failure patients unloaded by continuous-flow\r\n      LVADs has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: The study examined whether mechanical\r\n      unloading by continuous-flow LVAD leads to myocardial atrophy. METHODS: We\r\n      prospectively examined myocardial tissue and hemodynamic and echocardiographic\r\n      data from 44 LVAD patients and 18 untransplanted normal donors. RESULTS:\r\n      Cardiomyocyte size (cross-sectional area) decreased after LVAD unloading from\r\n      1,238 +/- 81 mum(2) to 1,011 +/- 68 mum(2) (p = 0.001), but not beyond that of\r\n      normal donor hearts (682 +/- 56 mum(2)). Electron microscopy ultrastructural\r\n      evaluation, cardiomyocyte glycogen content, and echocardiographic assessment of\r\n      myocardial mass and left ventricular function also did not suggest myocardial\r\n      atrophy. Consistent with these findings, t-tubule morphology, cytoplasmic\r\n      penetration, and distance from the ryanodine receptor were not indicative of\r\n      ongoing atrophic remodeling during LVAD unloading. Molecular analysis revealed no\r\n      up-regulation of proatrophic genes and proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome\r\n      system. CONCLUSIONS: Structural, ultrastructural, microstructural, metabolic,\r\n      molecular, and clinical functional data indicated that prolonged continuous-flow \r\n      LVAD unloading does not induce hypertrophy regression to the point of atrophy and\r\n      degeneration. These findings may be useful in designing future investigations\r\n      that combine LVAD unloading and pharmaceutical therapies as a bridge to recovery \r\n      of the failing heart.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Diabetes is prevalent\r\n      in advanced heart failure patients. In this study, we sought to investigate the\r\n      effects of mechanical circulatory support on diabetic parameters with LVAD\r\n      implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, data on 244 LVAD \r\n      recipients between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Patients without history of\r\n      diabetes, death within the first 3 months after LVAD implantation, heart\r\n      transplantation after LVAD, or LVAD explantation were excluded from the study.\r\n      Baseline demographic, laboratory, and echocardiographic information prior to LVAD\r\n      placement and 6-month follow-up were obtained. Laboratory values indicative of\r\n      diabetic control were found to improve significantly at 6 months post-LVAD\r\n      implantation (glycated haemoglobin, 7.2 vs. 6.1\%, P < 0.0001; serum fasting\r\n      glucose, 141 vs. 122 mg/dL, P = 0.003; mean daily insulin dose, 30 vs. 24 IU/day,\r\n      P = 0.02). Additionally, the use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was\r\n      successfully discontinued in six patients at 6 months post-LVAD implantation.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term LVAD therapy is associated with improvement in diabetic\r\n      control which is probabvly due to improvements in cardiac output and\r\n      normalization of biochemical derangements resulting from diabetes.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 The Authors.

We aimed to summarize the\r\n      current evidence on outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. \r\n      METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007 \r\n      to December 2013, supplemented with manual review. Three reviewers independently \r\n      assessed each study for saliency on patient-centered outcomes. Data were\r\n      summarized in tabular form. Overall study characteristics encouraged inclusion of\r\n      all indications (destination therapy and bridge to transplant) and prevented\r\n      meta-analysis. The electronic search identified 465 abstracts, of which 50 met\r\n      inclusion criteria; manual review added 2 articles in press. The articles\r\n      included 10 industry-funded trials and registries, 10 multicenter reports, and\r\n      the remainder single-center observational experiences. Estimated actuarial\r\n      survival after continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ranged from 56\% to\r\n      87\% at 1 year, 43\% to 84\% at 2 years, and 47\% at 4 years. Improvements in\r\n      functional class and quality of life were reported, but missing data complicated \r\n      interpretation. Adverse events were experienced by the majority of patients, but \r\n      estimates for bleeding, stroke, infection, right heart failure, arrhythmias, and \r\n      rehospitalizations varied greatly. CONCLUSIONS: The totality of data for\r\n      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices show consistent improvements in\r\n      survival and quality of life counterbalanced by a range of common complications. \r\n      Although this summary should provide a practical resource for healthcare\r\n      provider-led discussions with patients, it highlights the critical need for\r\n      high-quality patient-centered data collected with standard definitions.\r\nCI  - (c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.\r\nFAU - McIlvennan, Colleen K\r\nAU  - McIlvennan CK\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.). colleen.mcilvennan@ucdenver.edu.\r\nFAU - Magid, Kate H\r\nAU  - Magid KH\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Ambardekar, Amrut V\r\nAU  - Ambardekar AV\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Thompson, Jocelyn S\r\nAU  - Thompson JS\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Matlock, Daniel D\r\nAU  - Matlock DD\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nFAU - Allen, Larry A\r\nAU  - Allen LA\r\nAD  - From the Division of Cardiology (C.K.M., A.V.A., L.A.A.), Adult and Child Center \r\n      for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (K.H.M., J.S.T.), and Division \r\n      of General Internal Medicine (D.D.M.), University of Colorado School of Medicine,\r\n      Aurora; Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI (K.H.M.); and\r\n      Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium, Denver (C.K.M., D.D.M.,\r\n      L.A.A.).\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - K23 HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K23AG040696/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K23HL105896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\t\r\nPT  - Review\r\nDEP - 20141007\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Circ Heart Fail\r\nJT  - Circulation.

Although results reported have been excellent, \r\n      older recipients and donors associated with significant comorbidities are now the\r\n      rule rather than the exception. Moreover, heart failure has become a significant \r\n      public health problem with a growing population of patients in countries unable\r\n      to answer the demand for transplantation. An emerging answer to this dilemma\r\n      comes from results reported with the use of continuous flow pumps where patient\r\n      survival approaches 80\% one and 2 years after implantation in selected patients. \r\n      Is it time to triage patients to continuous flow pumps? Should we recommend\r\n      continuous flow pump implantations in patients with various comorbidities, and\r\n      offer transplantation to a selected group of patients who will reach the\r\n      long-term benefit of the procedure?\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

However, expansion of this technology is still limited by\r\n      complications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential to\r\n      identify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor \r\n      may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditional\r\n      cardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may \r\n      also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.\r\n      Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to \r\n      outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base to\r\n      support these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did not\r\n      identify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potential\r\n      predictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely a\r\n      relatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasive\r\n      techniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,\r\n      recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements and\r\n      validated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting of\r\n      CF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) consider\r\n      potential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTN\r\n      management is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the new\r\n      reliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research and\r\n      management possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the \r\n      CF-LVAD patient population move forward.\r\nFAU - Wasson, Lauren T\r\nAU  - Wasson LT\r\nAD  - NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center, 622 West 168th Street, \r\n      PH12-134, New York, NY, 10032-3720, USA.\r\nFAU - Yuzefpolskaya, Melana\r\nAU  - Yuzefpolskaya M\r\nFAU - Wakabayashi, Michiyori\r\nAU  - Wakabayashi M\r\nFAU - Takayama, Hiroo\r\nAU  - Takayama H\r\nFAU - Naka, Yoshifumi\r\nAU  - Naka Y\r\nFAU - Uriel, Nir\r\nAU  - Uriel N\r\nFAU - Jorde, Ulrich P\r\nAU  - Jorde UP\r\nFAU - Demmer, Ryan T\r\nAU  - Demmer RT\r\nFAU - Colombo, Paolo C\r\nAU  - Colombo PC\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - T32 HL007343/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Heart Fail Rev\r\nJT  - Heart failure reviews\r\nJID - 9612481\r\nSB  - IM\r\nPMC - PMC4385742\r\nMID - NIHMS633555\r\nOID - NLM: NIHMS633555 [Available on 05/01/16]\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4385742 [Available on 05/01/16]\r\nEDAT- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2016/05/01 00:00\r\nAID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2015 May;20(3):317-22. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9458-3.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25283167\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20141006\r\nLR  - 20141007\r\nIS  - 1827-1618 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0026-4725 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2014 Oct 6\r\nTI  - Non-transplant surgical therapy options of heart failure.\r\nAB  - Congestive heart failure (CHF) results from damage to the myocardium and has a\r\n      broad etiology ranging from ischemic to non--ischemic etiology. It is one of the \r\n      leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and carries a 5--year\r\n      mortality of 50\%, estimated by WHO to represent 30\% of deaths in the United\r\n      States. Costs related to the care of patients with CHF have increased\r\n      substantially over the past 2 decades partly owing to increased frequency of\r\n      hospitalization, implantation of costly novel devices and, as the disease\r\n      progresses, consideration for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, and end--of--life care. CHF progression is accompanied by changes within\r\n      the myocardium, collectively referred to as left ventricular remodeling, which\r\n      can be categorized into changes in the cardiomyocytes and changes that occur in\r\n      the volume and composition of the extracellular matrix. Since remodeling in heart\r\n      failure is progressive and detrimental, the majority of treatment strategies are \r\n      aimed at stopping or possibly reversing this process. Some successful methods\r\n      include medical management, long--term or destination mechanical circulatory\r\n      support, cardiac resychronization therapy, and biventricular pacemakers. During\r\n      the last few decades, the management of heart failure has evolved tremendously\r\n      with the introduction of new therapies and assist devices. Advances in mechanical\r\n      support, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and total artificial heart have\r\n      significantly reduced mortality in patients awaiting transplantation. This\r\n      manuscript is an overview of non--transplant surgical options in the management\r\n      of CHF.\r\nFAU - Neragi-Miandoab, S\r\nAU  - Neragi-Miandoab S\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein \r\n      College ofMedicine, Bronx, NY, USA - siyamekneragi@yahoo.com.\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20141006\r\nTA  - Minerva Cardioangiol\r\nJT  - Minerva cardioangiologica\r\nJID - 0400725\r\nEDAT- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/10/07 06:00\r\nAID - R05Y9999N00A140060 [pii]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Minerva Cardioangiol. 2014 Oct 6.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25277608\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141003\r\nDCOM- 20150126\r\nLR  - 20150429\r\nIS  - 1558-3597 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0735-1097 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 64\r\nIP  - 14\r\nDP  - 2014 Oct 7\r\nTI  - National trends in the utilization of short-term mechanical circulatory support: \r\n      incidence, outcomes, and cost analysis.\r\nPG  - 1407-15\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2014.07.958 [doi]\r\nLID - S0735-1097(14)05651-4 [pii]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The number of alternatives to intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation\r\n      in the treatment of anticipated and established acute circulatory failure is\r\n      growing. Despite the clinical importance and significant cost of short-term\r\n      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, the state of their present use has \r\n      not been analyzed on a national scale. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was \r\n      to characterize the demographics, treatment practices, survival rates, and cost\r\n      of short-term MCS. METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed all\r\n      adult patients receiving short-term MCS in the United States from 2004 to 2011 by\r\n      using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization\r\n      Project. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, use of percutaneous devices for short-term\r\n      MCS increased by 1,511\% compared with a 101\% increase in nonpercutaneous devices.\r\n      Mortality rates declined over this period (p for trend = 0.027) from 41.1\% in\r\n      2004 to 2007 to 33.4\% in 2008 to 2011. A similar trend was observed for the\r\n      subset of patients with cardiogenic shock, decreasing from 51.6\% to 43.1\% (p for \r\n      trend = 0.012). Hospital costs also declined over this period (p for trend =\r\n      0.011). Multivariable analysis revealed balloon pumps (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; 95\%\r\n      confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 2.52), coagulopathy (OR: 2.35; 95\% CI: 1.88 to \r\n      2.94), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR: 3.50; 95\% CI: 2.20 to 5.57) before \r\n      short-term MCS were among the most significant predictors of mortality.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-term MCS in the United States has increased rapidly,\r\n      whereas rates of in-hospital mortality have decreased. These changes have taken\r\n      place in the context of declining hospital costs associated with short-term MCS.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
