We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwent      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile      (HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and the      effect on body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) who      underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for      weight change. In the 30-day survivors, end points of the study were continued      LVAD support, heart transplant, or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass      surgery and was excluded. RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria,      BMI was 35.6 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 +/- 5.5      kg/m(2) (mean BMI change -2.5 kg/m(2); P = .063), with a mean follow-up time of      301.6 +/- 255.5 days. The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9      kg/m(2) (P = .016 vs baseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1 kg/m(2)      increase in BMI. BMI <30 kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\%), 5      of 19 (26\%) in XVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12       XVE, 2 HMII) or 50\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was      4.6 kg/m(2) (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30      kg/m(2) provided significant weight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in      recipients of the continuous flow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a      heart transplant after LVAD insertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6 kg/m(2) (P =      .003). LVAD implantation provides a period of hemodynamic support for obese      patients with advanced heart failure, during which time opportunity may be      available for weight loss. Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater      weight loss than nonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may      be necessary to achieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous      flow LVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
