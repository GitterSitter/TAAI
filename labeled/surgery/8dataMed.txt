ISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 1\r\nThe international society of heart and lung transplantation\r\nguidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients\r\nTask Force 1: Peri-operative Care of the Heart Transplant Recipient (Aug. 4, 2010)\r\nChair: Maria Rosa Costanzo, MD; Co-Chairs: Anne Dipchand, MD; Randall Starling, MD\r\nContributing Writers: Allen Anderson, MD; Michael Chan, MD; Shashank Desai, MD; Savitri Fedson, MD; Patrick Fischer, MD;\r\nGonzalo Gonzales-Stawinski, MD; Luigi Martinelli, MD; David McGiffin, MD; Francesco Parisi, MD; Jon Smith, MD\r\nTopic 1: Surgical Issues Impacting Care in\r\nthe Immediate Post-operative Period\r\nIntroduction\r\nThis section deals with surgical issues that may\r\npotentially complicate the immediate post-transplant period.\r\nMany of these issues, particularly ones that arise in patient\r\nassist support devices \r\nselection can have a very important impact on the immediate\r\npost-operative course of the patient and some can have far\r\nreaching consequences for long-term graft and patient\r\nsurvival. Donor-recipient matching refers to the avoidance\r\nof size discrepancies that can impair graft function. However,\r\nin the broader sense, donor factors, particularly ones that\r\nmight have an adverse impact on graft function, need to be\r\nviewed in the context of the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s condition. These\r\nfactors include the urgency of transplantation, the presence of\r\ncomorbid disease and the adequacy of physical reserves in the\r\nrecipient, which are important considerations in the context of\r\nthe recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to tolerate a post-operative course that\r\nmay be complicated by impaired graft function as the direct\r\nresult of transplantation of a marginal donor heart. The\r\nprojected ischemic time is another important variable in\r\ndecision making regarding the use of a particular donor heart.\r\nThe projected ischemic time is also emblematic of an\r\nimportant axiom in donor selection and matching to a specific\r\nrecipientÃ¢â‚¬â€?and that is that factors that may adversely impact\r\npost-operative graft function should not be considered in\r\nisolation. For example, the use of a heart from a donor who\r\ndied of toxicity (such as carbon monoxide) should be\r\nconsidered together with other important factors that have\r\npotentially compounding adverse effects, such as older donor\r\nage and longer rejected ischemic time. Although the\r\ntechniques of donor heart procurement and implantation are\r\nstandardized, there are factors such as the method of\r\nmyocardial preservation and technique of donor heart\r\nimplantation (biatrial versus bicaval technique) that may\r\ninfluence the post-heart transplant (HT) period. Post-operative\r\ncomplications such as sternal wound infection and pericardial\r\neffusion may cause the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convalescence to be\r\nprolonged.\r\nDonor Heart Selection\r\nBrain death is a hostile environment for the donor heart\r\nthat undoubtedly contributes to the occurrence of primary\r\ngraft failure (PGF) after HT. Donor heart dysfunction results\r\nfrom the Ã¢â‚¬Å“catecholamine stormÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (hypertension, tachycardia,\r\nand intense vasoconstriction) that produces an increase in\r\nmyocardial oxygen demand and potentially myocardial\r\nischemia. These phenomena may mediate myofibrillar\r\ndegeneration, a process characterized by injury and death of\r\nmyofibers in a hypercontracted state. After dissipation of this\r\nintense sympathetic activity, there is loss of sympathetic tone\r\nwith a massive reduction in systemic vascular resistance,\r\nwhich may contribute to a second phase of potential\r\nmyocardial injury, precipitated by abnormal myocardial\r\nloading conditions and impaired coronary perfusion.\r\nMyocardial injury interacts with other factors such as older\r\ndonor age and longer ischemic time, increasing the probability\r\nof post-operative primary graft dysfunction.\r\nDonor Age\r\nOlder donor age has been identified as a risk factor for\r\ndeath from any cause1\r\n and from early graft failure.2\r\n and it\r\ncompounds the influence of other risk factors for death from\r\nearly graft failure such as donor left ventricular (LV)\r\ndysfunction, longer ischemic time, and size mismatch (smaller\r\ndonor to a larger recipient). The impact of older donor age is a\r\nreflection of the general decline in myocardial reserves\r\noccurring with advancing age as well as the use of older donor\r\nhearts for marginal recipients. Furthermore, older donor hearts\r\nmay be less able to withstand primary graft dysfunction and\r\nearly acute HT rejection.\r\nEarly in HT the upper donor age limit was 35 years, but\r\nover the ensuing 4 decades it has progressively risen with the\r\nroutine use of donors older than 40 years and frequently Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50 \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 2\r\nyears. A safe Ã¢â‚¬Å“older donor ageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has not been established.\r\nStudies usually employ artificial age cutoffs (such as 40 or 50\r\nyears) so that assignment of a 41-year-old donor to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“older\r\ngroupÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ may not provide accurate information regarding the\r\neffects of older donor age on post-HT outcomes. Furthermore,\r\nthe impact of older donor age cannot be decoupled from\r\nrecipient risk factors that can influence early post-HT survival.\r\nSome studies3, 4 demonstrated inferior 1-month survival in\r\nrecipients receiving hearts from donors older than 40 or 50\r\nyears of age than in those receiving hearts from donors\r\nyounger than 40 years. However, other studies5\r\n showed\r\nsimilar 30-day or discharge mortality in recipients of donor\r\nhearts older than 50 years versus those and in those receiving\r\nyounger donor organs (5\% versus 3.5\%).\r\nRecommendations on Donor Heart Selection2, 3:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Taking into consideration only the variable of Ã¢â‚¬Å“donor\r\nage,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the hearts of donors younger than 45 years will\r\ninvariably have sufficient reserves to withstand the rigors\r\nof HT even in settings of prolonged ischemic time,\r\nrecipient comorbidities, and multiple previous recipient\r\noperations with hemodynamically destabilizing bleeding.\r\nHearts from donors between the ages of 45 to 55 years\r\nshould probably be used when the projected ischemic\r\ntime is Ã¢â€°Â¤ 4 hours and the potential recipient does not have\r\ncomorbidities or surgical issues where anything less than\r\nrobust donor heart performance could prove fatal. The use\r\nof donor hearts > 55 years should only be used if the\r\nsurvival benefit of HT for a recipient unequivocally\r\nexceeds the decrement in early HT survival due to\r\ntransplantation of a heart with limited myocardial\r\nreserves.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nTransplantation of Hearts from Donors with Infection\r\nThe reluctance to use hearts from donors contaminated\r\nwith microorganisms, who have died of sepsis or central\r\nnervous system infection, is based on: (1) the potential\r\ntransmission of microorganisms to the recipient resulting in\r\neither infection of anastomotic suture lines or systemic\r\ninfection, (2) potential transmission of mediators of endotoxic\r\nshock from donor to recipient, and (3) contribution of donor\r\nsepsis to myocardial dysfunction.6-8 Serious complications due\r\nto the transmission of donor infection to a recipient have\r\nincluded arterial anastomotic rupture in a renal transplant\r\npatient (Staphylococcus aureus9\r\n and Bacteroides species,10\r\nEscherichia coli10) and recipient entero-abdominal fungal\r\ninfection after a pancreatic transplant (Candida albicans11).\r\nNevertheless, hearts from donors with severe sepsis and death\r\ndue to severe infection (meningitis, pneumonia, or septic\r\nshock) without transmission to recipients6, 12, 13 as well as the\r\nuse of hearts with bacterial and fungal contamination.14-16 have\r\nbeen used. Overall the risk of donor to recipient transmission\r\nappears to be very low.\r\nRecommendation on the Transplantation of Hearts\r\nfrom Donors with Infection6\r\n:\r\nClass IIa\r\n1. Hearts from donors with severe infection can be used\r\nprovided that: 1) the donor infection is community\r\nacquired and donor death occurs rapidly (within 96\r\nhours); 2) repeat blood cultures before organ procurement\r\nare negative; 3) pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy is\r\nadministered to the donor; 4) donor myocardial function\r\nis normal; and 5) there is no evidence of endocarditis by\r\ndirect inspection of the donor heart. If such hearts are\r\nused for transplantation, the recipient should undergo\r\nsurveillance blood cultures on the first post-operative day\r\nand pathogen-specific antibiotic therapy should be\r\nadministered for an appropriate duration of time.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nTransplantation of Hearts from Donors with Potential\r\nDrug Toxicities\r\nCocaine. Toxic effects on the heart include\r\nvasoconstriction, coronary endothelial dysfunction, and\r\nmyocardial toxicity. These effects occur through a powerful ÃŽÂ±-\r\n1 adrenergic effect, indirectly through release of\r\nnorepinephrine by the sympathetic nervous system, an induced\r\ndeficiency of endothelium-derived relaxation factor with the\r\npotential for intravascular thrombosis, and depression of\r\nmyocardial contractility.17-21 The most frequently observed\r\ncardiac abnormalities after repeated cocaine abuse are\r\nventricular hypertrophy and a cardiomyopathy. Since\r\nintravenous (IV) cocaine as compared to non-IV cocaine\r\nabuse is considered more toxic to the heart, the use of hearts\r\nfrom IV cocaine abusers is discouraged. Use of hearts from\r\ndonors with a history of non-IV cocaine abuse appears to be\r\nsafe in terms of early post-operative course. Data from the\r\nUnited Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) suggest that 1-\r\nyear HT mortality is similar for recipients of hearts from nonusers\r\nversus past users (> 6 months) or current users of\r\ncocaine.22-29\r\nAlcohol abuse. Direct toxic effects of ethanol on the heart\r\ninclude alterations in energy stores reducing the effectiveness\r\nof calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum,23, 24 and\r\nsodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity,\r\nand interference with calcium-troponin binding, all of which \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 3\r\nattenuate myosin-actin interaction. Transplantation of a heart\r\nfrom a donor with a history of alcohol abuse may unmask\r\nbiochemical abnormalities that may manifest as early graft\r\nfailure.25, 26 Survival (including early patient survival and graft\r\nfunction) has been shown to be inferior27, 28 in recipients of\r\nhearts from donors with a history of alcohol abuse. However,\r\none report suggests that alcohol use in donors may be\r\nprotective after HT with improved outcomes for hearts from\r\nalcoholic versus non-alcoholic donors.29\r\nCarbon monoxide poisoning. As a result of the much\r\ngreater affinity of carbon monoxide versus oxygen for\r\nhemoglobin, a leftward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin\r\ndissociation curve occurs with reduced oxygen delivery to the\r\ntissues and impairment of mitochondrial cellular respiration\r\ndue to competition of carbon monoxide with oxygen for\r\ncytochrome a3.\r\n30 The myocardium is particularly susceptible\r\nto oxygen deprivation and the resulting myocardial injury may\r\nmanifest as PGF in the immediate post-operative period.\r\nReports on the outcomes of hearts from donors with carbon\r\nmonoxide intoxication have yielded conflicting results 31, 32\r\nOther poisonings. There are reports of transplantation of\r\nhearts from donors with a variety of other types of poisonings\r\nincluding cyanide,33-35 methanol, and ecstasy36 with\r\nsatisfactory HT function. The hearts from donors with these\r\ntypes of poisonings may be considered for HT provided there\r\nis good cardiac function.\r\nRecommendation on the Transplantation of Hearts\r\nfrom Donors with Potential Drug Toxicities22, 29, 35, 37,\r\n38:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Hearts from donors with a history of past or current nonIV\r\ncocaine abuse can be used for transplantation provided\r\ncardiac function is normal and left ventricular\r\nhypertrophy (LVH) is absent.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. In light of current information, the use of hearts from\r\ndonors with a history of Ã¢â‚¬Å“alcohol abuseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ remains\r\nuncertain, but is should probably be considered unwise.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n3. The use of hearts from donors who have died of carbon\r\nmonoxide intoxication can be recommended with caution,\r\nalthough safety has not been completely established. It is\r\nrecommended that these hearts be used provided there is a\r\nnormal donor electrocardiogram (ECG) and\r\nechocardiogram, minimal elevation of cardiac markers,\r\nminimal inotropic requirements, a relatively short\r\nischemic time, a favorable donor to recipient weight ratio,\r\nand a recipient with normal pulmonary vascular\r\nresistance.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nUse of Donors with Pre-existing Cardiac\r\nAbnormalities\r\nCoronary artery disease. The concern regarding\r\ntransplantation of donor hearts with recognized or\r\nunrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) revolves around\r\nthe risk of acute graft failure and the subsequent development\r\nof coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV). There is a paucity\r\nof information in the literature to provide guidance as to how\r\nmuch CAD in a donor heart can be accepted without\r\nincreasing the risk of early graft failure.39-41 One report42\r\nsuggests that if donor hearts with more than single-vessel\r\nCAD are used, the risk of early graft failure is substantial\r\n(6.3\% in donors without CAD, 7.5\% in donors with singlevessel\r\nCAD, 42.3\% in donor hearts with double- and triplevessel\r\nCAD).\r\nDonor left ventricular hypertrophy. The reluctance to use\r\ndonor hearts with LVH is based on the increased risk of early\r\ngraft failure and the long-term effects of diastolic heart failure\r\nand suboptimal long-term survival. The probability that LVH\r\nwill produce early graft failure is is influenced by other\r\nconfounding factors43 such as history of hypertension,\r\nischemia time, severity of LVH, donor size, and whether or\r\nnot LVH is evident on ECG. One small study44 raised\r\nconcerns that any degree of donor heart LVHy may result in\r\nearly graft failure. A more recent study, however,45 46 found\r\nthat mild and even moderate LVH did not increase 30-day\r\nmortality. Early mortality was increased only45 if donor wall\r\nthickness was > 14 mm.\r\nDonor valvular heart disease. The finding of a bicuspid\r\naortic valve does not contraindicate the use of a donor heart.\r\nIn the case valvular disease associated with hemodynamic\r\nabnormalities, the donor heart may still be used for HT. Bench\r\nrepair or replacement of a donor aortic valve,38 47 and repair of\r\nan incompetent mitral valve48 has been performed with\r\nfavorable outcomes.\r\nRecommendations on the Use of Donors with Preexisting\r\nCardiac Abnormalities39, 49:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As far as function is concerned, a donor heart should not\r\nbe used in the presence of intractable ventricular\r\narrhythmias, the need for excessive inotropic support\r\n(dopamine at a dose of 20 Ã‚Âµg/kg/min or similar doses of\r\nother adrenergic agents despite aggressive optimization of\r\npreload and after load), discreet wall motion \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 4\r\nabnormalities on echocardiography, or left ventricular\r\nejection fraction (LVEF) < 40\% despite optimization of\r\nhemodynamics with inotropic support.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\n2. A donor heart with a normally functioning bicuspid aortic\r\nvalve can be used for HT. Anatomically and\r\nhemodynamically abnormal aortic and mitral valves may\r\nundergo bench repair or replacement with subsequent\r\ntransplantation of the heart.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. The use of donor hearts with obstructive disease in any\r\nmajor coronary artery should be avoided unless the heart\r\nis being considered for the alternate list recipients with\r\nconcomitant coronary bypass surgery.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. It would seem appropriate to use hearts from donors with\r\nLVH provided that it is not associated with ECG findings\r\nof LVH and LV wall thickness is < 14 mm.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nDonor Cardiac Function\r\nDonor risk factors known to be associated with early graft\r\nfailure include higher doses of inotropic support, depressed\r\nsystolic function (particularly discreet wall motion\r\nabnormalities), older donor age, and donor-recipient size\r\nmismatch (small female donors to large male recipients).49 In\r\none study,49 the requirement for dopamine or dobutamine\r\ndoses > 20 Ã‚Âµg/kg/min with or without additional inotropic\r\nagents was an independent risk factor for PGF and early\r\nmortality. However, because high dose inotropic support is\r\noften required to overcome the hemodynamic consequences of\r\na low systemic vascular resistance, optimization of preload\r\nand afterload should be achieved before declaring that high\r\ndose inotropic agents is a contraindication to the use of a\r\ndonor heart. Elevated cardiac markers such as CPK-MB\r\nisoenzyme and troponin should not preclude the use of a donor\r\nheart. If substantial myocardial injury is associated with the\r\nrelease of cardiac markers, this will usually be manifested by\r\nthe echocardiographic finding of either global or discreet wall\r\nmotion abnormalities.\r\nRecommendations on Donor Cardiac Function:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As far as the function is concerned, a donor heart should\r\nnot be used in the presence of intractable ventricular\r\narrhythmias, the need for excessive inotropic support\r\n(dopamine at a dose of 20 Ã‚Âµg/kg/min or similar doses of\r\nother adrenergic agents despite aggressive optimization of\r\npreload and after load), discreet wall motion\r\nabnormalities on echocardiography or LVEF < 40\%\r\ndespite optimization of hemodynamics with inotropic\r\nsupport.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nDonor-Recipient Size Matching\r\nOversizing of a donor heart can occur (1) in pediatric HT\r\nwhen the size of the donor heart for a smaller recipient is\r\nmisjudged; (2) when the native heart disease does not result in\r\ncardiomegaly and a larger donor heart is implanted; or (3)\r\nafter multiple previous operations resulting in rigidity of the\r\nmediastinum despite maneuvers such as opening the left side\r\nof the pericardium to allow the donor heart to protrude into the\r\nleft pleural space. These situations may be associated with\r\ninability to close the chest without hemodynamically\r\nimportant cardiac compression. Severe undersizing is also an\r\nimportant issue, since a small donor heart may be unable to\r\nsupport the circulation of a much larger recipient. Making the\r\ndetermination of the adequacy of the size of a donor for a\r\nspecific recipient and judgment is required. Determination of\r\ndonor/recipient size match is complicated by the poor\r\nrelationship between echocardiographic adult heart size and\r\nbody weight.50 As a general rule, the donor weight should be\r\nwithin 30\% of the recipient weight for adults. However, in\r\nnon-urgent recipients survival was not adversely affected by\r\nundersizing of donor hearts up to a donor to recipient body\r\nweight ratio of 0.8.51, 52 In contrast, survival was inferior in\r\nUNOS status 1 recipients, if they received an undersized heart\r\npresumably due to a smaller cardiac reserve. 49 According to a\r\nmultivariable analysis, implantation of a smaller female donor\r\nheart into a larger male recipient was an independent risk\r\nfactor for early graft failure. Furthermore, the risks of\r\nundersizing a donor heart are compounded by the presence of\r\nother donor risk factors contributing to early graft failure, such\r\nas older donor age, abnormal systolic function of the donor\r\nheart and prolonged ischemic time.\r\nRecommendations on Donor-Recipient Size\r\nMatching51, 52:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As a general rule the use of hearts from donors whose\r\nbody weight is no greater than 30\% below that of the\r\nrecipient is uniformly safe. Furthermore, a male donor of\r\naverage weight (70 kg) can be safely used for any size\r\nrecipient irrespective of weight. Use of a female donor\r\nwhose weight is more than 20\% lower than that of a male\r\nrecipient should be viewed with caution.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 5\r\nProjected Ischemic Time\r\nProlongation of the ischemic time in HT adversely\r\nimpacts the performance of the donor heart in the immediate\r\npost-operative period. Furthermore, the ischemic time\r\ninteracts with a number of other variables including older\r\ndonor age, increased inotropic requirements of the donor, and\r\nabnormal donor cardiac function to further increase the\r\nprobability of primary graft dysfunction. The upper limit for\r\nischemic time is unknown and it depends on the relative\r\nweight of other risk factors. For example, a heart of a young\r\ndonor with robust performance without inotropic requirements\r\nis likely to tolerate an ischemic time longer than 6 hours with\r\ngood post-operative graft function, whereas a donor heart with\r\nimpaired function on substantial inotropic support from an\r\nolder donor is unlikely to tolerate longer ischemic times.\r\nRecommendations on Ischemic Times49:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. As a general rule the ischemic time should be less than 4\r\nhours. However, there are situations in which ischemic\r\ntimes longer than 4 hours are anticipated. Donor hearts\r\nwith ischemic times longer than 4 hours should only be\r\naccepted when other factors interacting with ischemic\r\ntime are ideal, including donor young age, normal cardiac\r\nfunction and absence of inotropic support.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nDonor Heart Procurement\r\nThe procedure of donor heart procurement is as critical\r\nfor the success of HT as implantation, because errors in\r\nassessment, selection, and surgical technique may have\r\nprofound repercussions in the immediate post-transplant\r\nperiod. The procuring surgeon must verify that the function of\r\nthe heart is visually satisfactory, that areas of akinesis are\r\nabsent on the echocardiogram, and that the size match for the\r\nintended recipient is appropriate. The heart should be carefully\r\ninspected for palpable CAD and evidence of myocardial\r\ncontusion so that if these problems are found a decision can be\r\nmade about the suitability of the donor heart for the intended\r\nrecipient. Post-operative right ventricular (RV) failure can\r\nresult in RV distention during the procurement procedure and\r\nsignificantly complicate recipient management. This can occur\r\nbecause of overly vigorous fluid infusion in response to blood\r\nand fluid loss during abdominal organ procurement. After\r\nexcision, it is important that the heart be thoroughly inspected,\r\nalthough most abnormalities (such as a patent foramen ovale,\r\nbicuspid aortic valve) do not significantly alter the immediate\r\npost-operative period. Atresia of the coronary sinus ostium\r\nwith retrograde drainage through a persistent left superior\r\nvena cava may go unnoticed until inspection or implantation\r\nof the donor heart. Unfortunately, ligation of the left superior\r\nvena cava in the presence of this anomaly is highly likely to\r\nresult in irreversible PGF. The procuring surgeon can simply\r\nlook into the right atrium to verify the presence of a coronary\r\nsinus ostium.53-55\r\nThe adequacy of myocardial preservation, the\r\nbiochemical derangements that can be induced during the\r\nischemic period, and unpredictable myocardial reperfusion\r\ninjury may have profound effects on the immediate postoperative\r\ncourse. It is the complex bioenergetic processes and\r\ntheir derangement which will frequently underpin PGF. The\r\nprimary methods of maintaining cellular and functional\r\nintegrity of the myocardium during the ischemic period are\r\nthrough hypothermia and mechanical arrest of the heart.\r\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) is consumed at a low level to\r\nallow breaking of actin-myosin cross bridges even during\r\nmechanical cardiac arrest. Although during the ischemic\r\nperiod the myocardium can use stored glycogen to produce\r\nATP by anaerobic glycolysis, irreversible myofiber\r\ncontracture will occur if the ATP level falls below a critical\r\nthreshold, Preservation must also maintain ion homeostasis.\r\nAlthough sodium-potassium ATPase activity is markedly\r\nreduced by hypothermia, there is still passive ion movement\r\ndown a concentration gradient. Consequently, intracellular\r\nhydrogen ions are exchanged for extracellular sodium ions,\r\nwhich in turn are exchanged for calcium ions. Accumulation\r\nof calcium ions in the sarcolemma is potentially very\r\ndamaging to myofibers upon reperfusion. Reperfusion injury\r\nhas several components:\r\n(1) Free radical injuryÃ¢â‚¬â€?these oxygen-derived free radicals\r\ncause direct myocardial injury. They are generated under\r\nnormal aerobic conditions but are rapidly neutralized by\r\nintracellular enzymatic scavengers. However, under\r\nconditions of ischemia and reperfusion, they may\r\naccumulate in quantities that overwhelm the natural\r\nscavengers, setting the stage for free radical injury.\r\n(2) Complement activationÃ¢â‚¬â€?activation of the complement\r\ncascade results in the production of potent anaphylatoxins\r\nthat mediate increased vascular permeability, leukocyte\r\nchemotaxis, adhesion and activation, and vascular smooth\r\nmuscle contraction.\r\n(3) Neutrophil activationÃ¢â‚¬â€?neutrophil activation during\r\nreperfusion involves accumulation of these cells on\r\nendothelial surfaces and promoting the release of\r\ninflammatory molecules.\r\n(4) Endothelial injuryÃ¢â‚¬â€?Ã¢â‚¬Å“endothelial cell activationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a term\r\nused to describe the response of endothelial cells to \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 6\r\nischemia. It involves promotion of leukocyte adhesion,\r\nsmooth muscle proliferation and vasoconstriction.\r\n(5) Cytokine releaseÃ¢â‚¬â€?a number of molecules are released\r\nthat amplify inflammatory responses.\r\n(6) Calcium overloadÃ¢â‚¬â€?as indicated earlier, calcium ions can\r\naccumulate in the sarcoplasmic reticulum damaging\r\nmyocytes on reperfusion.\r\nThe role of myocardial preservation solutions in HT is to\r\npreserve the microvascular, cellular, and functional integrity\r\nof the heart. The ingredients of the flush solution include (1)\r\nhypothermia, (2) potassium to arrest the heart, (3) prevention\r\nof cellular swelling with impermeants such as lactobionate and\r\nraffinose, (4) magnesium to prevent calcium accumulation in\r\nthe sarcoplasmic reticulum, and (5) free radical scavengers to\r\nprevent free radical injury. Experimental56 and clinical57 use of\r\nthe UW solution, which is an intracellular (high potassium)\r\nsolution that includes the above ingredients, have provided\r\nsufficient evidance to support the expectation of excellent\r\nmyocardial preservation for at least 6 hours of ischemic time.\r\nDonor Heart Implantation\r\nImplantation of the donor heart is a technically\r\nstraightforward procedure. The standard biatrial technique is\r\nincreasingly being replaced by the bicaval technique. The\r\nlatter may be associated with a lower incidence of sinoatrial\r\nnode dysfunction in the early post-operative period and\r\nreduced requirement for permanent pacing at 30 and 90 days\r\nafter HT.58\r\nOne technical point that requires emphasis is the\r\nimportance of accurately cutting the correct length of the\r\npulmonary artery because excessive length can result in\r\npulmonary artery kinking and obstruction and, if\r\nunrecognized, this can result in severe RV failure.59 The\r\nconditions of reperfusion of the donor heart are important with\r\nregard to the pressure. Ideally, the heart should be reperfused\r\nat a perfusion pressure of 50 to 70 mm Hg. Very occasionally,\r\nthe perfusion pressure can be excessively low (< 50 mm Hg)\r\ndespite the infusion of vasoactive agents. Under those\r\ncircumstances, the heart may not develop prompt return of\r\ncoordinated contraction. If this occurs, controlled aortic root\r\nreperfusion60 may be used. This involves reapplying the aortic\r\ncrossclamp and infusing pump blood into the aortic root\r\nthrough the needle vent to produce a pressure of 70 to 80 mm\r\nHg until satisfactory cardiac function develops, at which time\r\nthe crossclamp can be removed.\r\nPost-operative Surgical Problems\r\nSurgical wound infection. Infection is an important cause\r\nof mortality and morbidity after HT. Bacterial infection\r\npredominates in the early post-transplant period with a peak\r\nincidence in the first post-operative week.61 Although the\r\nincidence of sternal wound infection and mediastinitis after\r\nHT is low ,it can be the cause of serious morbidity and\r\nmortality. The cornerstone of prevention of bacterial infection\r\nand contamination of the surgical wound is application of\r\nstrict surgical aseptic techniques. All indwelling lines and\r\ndevices should receive similar aseptic care. Protective\r\nisolation has not been proven beneficial in reducing the\r\nincidence of infection in HT recipients.62, 63 Peri-operative\r\nprophylactic antibiotics should be administered. An example\r\nof a commonly used protocol is a pre-operative IV dose of\r\nvancomycin 15 mg/kg and ceftazidime 15 mg/kg both\r\nadministered 1 hour before HT to ensure effective circulating\r\nlevels before the skin incision. Vancomycin is readministered\r\nat the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at a dose\r\nof 10 mg/kg. Post-operatively, vancomycin (10 mg/kg IV\r\nevery 8 hours with adjustment for renal function) and\r\nceftazidime 1 gm IV every 8 hours are administered for 4\r\ndays. At the conclusion of the operation, the surgical wound\r\nmay be irrigated with dilute vancomycin solution to decrease\r\ncolony counts of gram-positive skin organisms. The surgical\r\ndressing is left in place for 48 hours, and after its removal, the\r\nwound is painted with an iodine containing solution once or\r\ntwice daily for several days until the wound is sealed.\r\nRe-entry for bleeding may be required after HT. In most\r\npatients undergoing HT, the operation is performed in the\r\nsetting of one or more risk factors for bleeding including\r\ncoagulopathy associated with multiple previous operations,\r\nuse of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), poor tissues due\r\nto the ravages of heart failure, and abnormal coagulation due\r\nto hepatic congestion. Re-entry should be undertaken for\r\npersistent chest tube output (as a general rule 400 mL/hr for 1\r\nhour, > 300 mL/hr for 3 hours, and 200 mL/hr for 4 hours),\r\nany circulatory instability associated with bleeding, or\r\nradiographic or echocardiographic evidence of retained\r\nthrombus.\r\nFrequently, patients undergoing HT have a large\r\npericardial space in which a much smaller donor heart is\r\nimplanted, setting the stage for the accumulation of frequently\r\nlarge pericardial effusions. This has been described64 in up to\r\n30\% of patients. If a pericardial effusion is anticipated given a\r\nlarge pericardial space and a much smaller heart, a soft drain\r\nsuch as a Blake drain can be left in the posterior pericardial\r\nspace connected to a drainage bulb and can be left for 5 to 6\r\ndays (the standard chest tubes are removed at the usual time)\r\nto prevent, as much as possible, collection of fluid in the\r\npericardium. The Blake drain is removed when the drainage is\r\n< 40 mL/24 hours. If a large pericardial effusion occurs, even \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 7\r\nin the absence of echocardiographic evidence of tamponade,\r\ndrainage by a subxiphoid approach is recommended.\r\nTopic 2: Early Post-operative Care of the\r\nHeart Transplant Recipient\r\nIntroduction\r\nEarly post-operative management of the newly\r\ntransplanted heart allograft is focused on maintenance of\r\nhemodynamic stability as the allograft restores normal cardiac\r\nfunction to the chronic heart failure patient. While the graft\r\nbegins to support the recipient as soon as separation from CPB\r\nis complete, there is invariably a period of time during which\r\nthe allograft and its recipient require active hemodynamic\r\nmanagement and support. The nature and duration of this\r\nsupport is determined by several factors including the quality\r\nand preservation of the donor heart and pre-operative\r\ncondition of the recipient. Recipient factors such as vasomotor\r\ntone, severity and reversibility of pulmonary vascular\r\nhypertension, pulmonary function, degree of pre-operative\r\nfluid overload, renal function, destabilizing post-operative\r\nbleeding, and immunologic compatibility may have a\r\nprofound effect upon early post-operative management.\r\nAdditional factors such as HT surgical technique (biatrial vs.\r\nbicaval vs. orthotopic vs. heterotopic) and donor/recipient size\r\nmatching affect post-operative management strategies.\r\nPeri-operative and Post-operative Monitoring\r\nHemodynamic Monitoring\r\nAdequate hemodynamic monitoring of the HT recipient at\r\na minimum includes direct measurement of the arterial\r\npressure, central venous pressure (CVP) or right atrial pressure\r\n(RAP), and cardiac output (CO). Typically, adult patients are\r\nmonitored with an indwelling arterial catheter (femoral, radial,\r\nor both), and a thermodilution or oximetric pulmonary artery\r\ncatheter. Less commonly used are surgically placed,\r\npercutaneous right and left atrial catheters, or noninvasive\r\nmeans of assessing CO. One such method utilizes lithium\r\nchloride as indicator for peripheral thermodilution technique.65\r\nRegardless of the type of catheter used for continuous\r\nhemodynamic monitoring after HT, it is wise to remove the\r\ncatheter as soon as possible to minimize the risk of catheterrelated\r\ninfections, including sepsis, allograft valvular\r\nendocarditis, or bacterial seeding of the atrial suture lines,\r\ncomplications which are often fatal.66, 67\r\nArterial monitoring is similar in pediatric patients, but\r\nCVP monitoring is generally with a line ending in the superior\r\nvena cava or an atrial catheter. Pulmonary artery catheters are\r\nused infrequently in the pediatric population.\r\nEchocardiographic Monitoring\r\nIntra-operative echocardiography has become a standard\r\nprocedure during most cardiac surgery, including HT.68\r\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide\r\nimaging assistance to identify intracardiac thrombi. In\r\naddition, TEE provides real-time assessment of the cardiac\r\nallograft during de-airing, separation from CPB, and after\r\nimplantation of the donor heart as the chest is closed.\r\nVentricular function, valve function, and surgical anastomoses\r\ncan be assessed. In the post-operative period, both\r\ntransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and TEE may be used to\r\nassess heart allograft function, particularly in the setting of\r\nacute hemodynamic instability arising from allograft\r\ndysfunction due to rejection, RV failure, or tamponade.69-71\r\nWhen adequate transthoracic imaging is limited by poor\r\nacoustic windows, TEE often overcomes this obstacle. TTE is\r\ngenerally adequate in the pediatric population in the postoperative\r\nperiod. It is reasonable to perform a TTE in the first\r\nweek after HT. The timing and frequency of additional\r\nechocardiograms depends upon heart allograft function and\r\nthe presence of a pericardial effusion.\r\nElectrocardiographic Monitoring\r\nContinuous ECG monitoring is universal. Twelve-lead\r\nrecordings are obtained immediately post-operatively and as\r\nneeded to assess the cardiac rhythm, conduction system, and\r\nischemic changes. Several ECG abnormalities are frequently\r\npresent following HT. The most frequent abnormalities\r\ninclude sinus node dysfunction and complete or incomplete\r\nright bundle branch block. Progressive worsening of the\r\nconduction system in the early period after HT is a poor\r\nprognostic sign.72, 73\r\nContinuous Oxygen Saturation Monitoring\r\nContinuous pulse oximetry is indicated in the immediate\r\npost-operative period to insure adequate oxygenation at all\r\ntimes, particularly because the critically ill early postoperative\r\npatient is at risk for sudden changes in pulmonary\r\nstatus.\r\nRenal Function\r\nAn indwelling urinary catheter is used to monitor renal\r\nfunction and urine output.\r\nAdequacy of urine output depends upon several factors\r\nincluding fluid status, heart allograft function, intrinsic renal\r\nfunction, recent hemodynamic status, and the presence of\r\nnephrotoxic and vasoconstrictive medications such as\r\ncalcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and vasopressors. Urine output\r\ntypically is Ã¢â€°Â¥ 30 mL/hour. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 8\r\nIn the pediatric population, adequate urine output is age\r\nand size dependent. Oliguria or anuria are particularly\r\nconcerning as they are suggestive of significant acute renal\r\nfailure.\r\nOften, higher doses of IV loop diuretics are required after\r\nHT due to pre-existing diuretic resistance. Oliguria refractory\r\nto diuretics is problematic in the immediate post-operative\r\nsetting because fluid overload and RV dysfunction can\r\ndevelop over a few hours unless ultrafiltration and renal\r\nreplacement therapies such as continuous veno-venous\r\nhemofiltration or dialysis are employed.\r\nRecommendations on the Post-operative Monitoring\r\nof Heart Transplant Recipients7, 72-89:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Peri-operative monitoring of heart transplant recipients\r\nshould include (1) continuous ECG monitoring; (2) postoperative\r\n12-lead ECG; (3) invasive arterial pressure\r\nmonitoring; (4) direct measurement of RAP or CVP; (5)\r\nmeasurement of left atrial or pulmonary artery wedge\r\npressure (PAWP); (6) intermittent measurement of CO;\r\n(7) continuous measurement of arterial oxygen saturation;\r\n(8) intra-operative TEE; (9) continuous assessment of\r\nurinary output.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nHemodynamic Management\r\nBackground\r\nThe newly transplanted heart allograft typically displays\r\nexcellent LV systolic function. Systolic LV dysfunction is\r\nparticularly worrisome as it may suggest poor donor heart\r\nquality, inadequate preservation, or early rejection\r\n(hyperacute, antibody mediated rejection). The frequency and\r\nseverity of RV dysfunction after HT is variable and may be\r\nanticipated in patients with risk factors such as elevated\r\npulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), excessive bleeding,\r\npulmonary edema, poor donor heart preservation before\r\nimplant, poor RV protection during allograft implantation,\r\nischemia from air embolization into the right coronary artery,\r\nor significant donor/recipient size mismatch.74\r\nEven heart allografts that display excellent early function\r\ntypically experience a functional decline over the first 12 postoperative\r\nhours. This decrease in function is believed to be\r\ndue to the effects of ischemia and reperfusion and myocardial\r\nedema, which result in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.\r\nDonor heart LVH (wall thickness Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1.4 cm) and or prolonged\r\nischemia times (> 240 min) may also lead to impaired\r\ndiastolic function in the early post-operative period. With\r\nintra-operative TEE, it is not uncommon to observe an\r\nincrease in LV wall thickness and mass.75, 76, 90-92 Furthermore,\r\nin the early post-operative period after HT, examination of the\r\nmitral inflow pattern by Doppler echocardiography often\r\nreveals a restrictive cardiac filling pattern.77\r\nDiastolic stiffness leads to an increase in intracardiac\r\nfilling pressures and reduced stroke volume, whereas systolic\r\ndysfunction leads to a transient decline in CO. These early\r\nrestrictive hemodynamic findings are often transient but may\r\npersist for 6 to 8 weeks after HT.78, 93 In the setting of an\r\nexcellent hemodynamic status, these changes are of little or no\r\nconsequence. However, if the initial CO is marginal, or if the\r\nheart allograft function is obviously impaired, despite\r\ninotropic support, this further, predictable decline in function\r\nmay necessitate additional hemodynamic support, including\r\nadditional vasoactive drugs, an intraaortic balloon pump\r\n(IABP) or a left and/or right ventricular assist device (VAD).\r\nassist support devices\r\nWhen deciding the minimum heart allograft function\r\nacceptable before leaving the operating room, considerations\r\nshould include, in addition to the cardiac index (CI), the dose\r\nand number of inotropic agents employed to enable separation\r\nfrom CPB, the independent function of the RV and LV, and\r\nthe recipient risks for right heart failure.\r\nHeart rate is variable and ranges from bradycardia to\r\ntachycardia. Factors such as parasympathetic denervation,\r\nsurgical trauma, catecholamine administration, and even\r\ngenomic variations in the ÃŽÂ²-adrenergic receptor may affect the\r\nsinus node rate.94 Although sinus rhythm is typically observed,\r\nsinus node dysfunction may arise from injury related to donor\r\ncardiectomy or preservation. In this instance, the cardiac\r\nrhythm is usually either junctional or accelerated junctional.\r\nThe incidence of sinus node dysfunction is reduced with the\r\nbicaval or total orthotopic HT technique, as compared to the\r\nclassic biatrial technique developed by Lower and Shumway.79\r\nSinus node dysfunction is usually transient but may persist for\r\nseveral weeks after HT. Sinus node dysfunction requiring a\r\npacemaker occurs in about 5\% of patients undergoing biatrial\r\nanastomoses. Pre-operative use of amiodarone in heart\r\ntransplant recipients may increase the risk of sinus node\r\ndysfunction and bradyarrythmias in the early post-operative\r\nperiod. This may require the use of isoproterenol,\r\ntheophylline, or more prolonged temporary atrial pacing. The\r\nneed for permanent pacing may increase with donor age.80\r\nHeart rate is generally maintained in the 90 to 110 bpm range\r\nafter HT using atrial or atrioventricular (AV) pacing or\r\nchronotropic drugs. This rate contributes to maintaining an\r\nadequate CO and permits adequate cardiac filling in the setting\r\nof decreased stroke volume and diastolic dysfunction\r\nimmediately after heart transplantation. In the setting of \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 9\r\nsignificant donor under sizing with respect to the recipient\r\n(donor weight > 30\% below recipient weight), a higher heart\r\nrate may be necessary to account for even lower stroke\r\nvolume indices.52, 81, 95\r\nIn the pediatric population the heart rate adequate to\r\nmaintain an acceptable CO also varies according to both donor\r\nand recipient age.\r\nReduced myocardial contractility is frequently seen after\r\nHT as a result of donor organ trauma, preservation and\r\nischemia, catecholamine depletion, and donor brain death. In\r\naddition, myofibrillar degeneration can result from the\r\nsympathetic storm accompaning brain herniation. Infusion of\r\none or more inotropes in the early post-operative period\r\nusually provides the hemodynamic support needed in the first\r\nfew post-operative days as the heart allograft recovers. These\r\nagents are usually weaned over the first post-operative week.\r\nPrimary Graft Failure and Right Ventricular Dysfunction\r\nPrimary graft failure after HT is the presence of severe\r\nmechanical dysfunction without obvious anatomic (surgical)\r\nor immunologic causes such as hyperacute rejection. Primary\r\ngraft failure has been variably defined in the literature as heart\r\nallograft dysfunction requiring 2 or more inotropes, or the\r\nneed for mechanical circulatory support, either with an IABP\r\nor a VAD within 24 hours of HT. The true prevalence,\r\ntherefore, depends upon the criteria used for diagnosis, but\r\nestimates range from approximately 1.4\% to 30.7\%.82, 83, 96-100\r\nIt is important to recognize that PGF can result in RV, LV, or\r\nbiventricular failure.\r\nIsolated RV failure is more common than biventricular\r\nfailure. Cardinal features include an elevated RAP > 20 mm\r\nHg, left atrial pressure < 10 mm Hg, with decreasing CO and\r\nhigh pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, and a falling mean\r\narterial pressure, or normal PA pressures with falling CO.101,\r\n102\r\nHeart allograft failure accounts for 40\% of the mortality\r\nwithin the first 30 days after HT and 18\% of the mortality for\r\nthe second through the twelfth months.98 Thirty-day survival\r\nwith PGF has increased over time from 43\% during the period\r\nfrom 1992 to 1997 to 57\% during the period from 1998 to\r\n2004.98 In addition to the increased risk of mortality during the\r\nfirst month, PGF also confers a worse conditional 1-year\r\nsurvival.81\r\nThe pathophysiology that underlies PGF is generally\r\nmultifactorial. It includes recipient characteristics such as\r\npulmonary arterial hypertension and increased PVR, and prior\r\nMCS, donor characteristics and factors such as prolonged\r\ndonor ischemia time, poor organ preservation, and\r\ndevelopment of reactive oxygen species.82, 84, 97-99, 103\r\nPossible explanations for the association between preoperative\r\nMCS and PGF are that pretransplant VADs may be\r\na surrogate of prolonged ischemia due to longer explantation\r\nof the native heart or that the longer CPB times associated\r\nwith presence of a VAD may trigger a greater inflammatory\r\nresponse which may increase the risk of PGF.103\r\nEarly heart allograft dysfunction has also been associated\r\nwith the use of organs from female donors into male\r\nrecipients; however, in recent times the results of some studies\r\nhave shown that increased body surface area in the recipient or\r\nsmaller donor for a larger recipient have not been associated\r\nwith worse outcomes.85, 98 There have been concerns that the\r\nuse of Ã¢â‚¬Å“marginalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“extendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ donors may lead to an\r\nincreased incidence of PGF. There are a number of criteria to\r\ndefine the Ã¢â‚¬Å“extendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ heart donor. These can be grouped into\r\nnon-cardiac and cardiac factors. Non-cardiac factors include\r\nadvanced donor age, donor size, and ischemic time. In\r\naddition, other comorbidities of the donor, such as positive\r\nviral serologies, diabetes mellitus, or substance abuse would\r\nbe considered as non-cardiac risks for suboptimal donor organ\r\nquality. The cardiac criteria for Ã¢â‚¬Å“extendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ donors include\r\nLVH, congenital heart abnormalities, high donor\r\ncatecholamine requirements, RV and/or LV systolic\r\ndysfunction and CAD.104 Lima et al. conducted a retrospective\r\nstudy of 260 HT patients with both standard and Ã¢â‚¬Å“extendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\r\nlist donors.103 The Ã¢â‚¬Å“extendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ list donors most commonly\r\nwere older and had diabetes. They reported no difference in\r\nthe incidence of PGF, with 23\% in the standard group and\r\n26\% in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“extendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ list. The two factors the authors\r\nidentified as risk factors poorer outcomes were length of\r\nischemia time and pre-operative MCS.\r\nAssessment of graft function can be made by\r\nhemodynamic measurement, TEE, and gross visual inspection\r\nof the heart. The hemodynamic parameters that are suspicious\r\nfor graft dysfunction are a CI < 2.0 L/min/m2\r\n, a RAP > 15 mm\r\nHg and a PCWP >15 mm Hg when on maximal inotropic\r\nsupport. The RV stroke work (RVSW) or RVSW index\r\n(RVSWI) [RVSWI = (mean pulmonary artery pressure\r\n[MPAP]-CVP)*(SVI)*(0. 0136) (g*m/m2\r\n) where 0.0136\r\nconverts mm Hg Hg-liters/beat beat-m2 to g*m/ m2\r\n], which\r\nhave been used to assess RV function and likelihood of failure\r\nin a non-transplant VAD population105, 106 may be helpful in\r\ndetermining the appropriate time for institution of MCS\r\n(Table 1). \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 10\r\nTable 1 Functional Variables of the Right Ventricle\r\nFunctional Parameters Normal Value Load Dependency\r\nMild RV\r\ndysfunction\r\nModerate RV\r\ndysfunction:\r\nSevere RV\r\ndysfunction\r\nSystolic Performance Variables\r\nRVFAC (\%) 32-60 +++ 25-31 18-24 < 17\r\nRVEF (\%) 45-68 +++ 35-44 26-34 < 25\r\nTAPSE >15 mm ++\r\nTricuspid annular plane\r\nmaximal systolic velocity (using\r\nspectral pulse wave tissue\r\nDoppler)\r\n> 12cm/s\r\nIVA ( using tissue pulsed wave\r\nDoppler)\r\n1.4 Ã‚Â± 0.5 m/s2 +\r\nDiastolic Performance Variables\r\nIVC dimension (cm), collapse\r\nindex\r\n< 1.7 cm, CI > 50\% +++\r\nTricuspid early (E) to late (A)\r\nfilling velocity ratio\r\n1.5 Ã‚Â± 0.3 +++\r\nHepatic vein profile (S:systolic;\r\nD: diastolic)\r\nS/D velocity ratio > 1, no S\r\nreversal, atrial reversal < 50\%\r\nS\r\n+++\r\nassist support devices \r\nIVRT < 60 ms +++\r\nRapid myocardial filling\r\nvelocity (Et) (cm/s)\r\n15.6 Ã‚Â± 3.9 +++\r\nLate diastolic myocardial filling\r\nvelocity, At (cm/s)\r\n15.4 Ã‚Â± 4.5 +++\r\nCombined systolic and diastolic\r\nparameter RVMPI\r\n0.28 Ã‚Â± 0.04 ++\r\nIVA, isovolumic acceleration using Doppler tissue imaging; IVC, inferior vena cava; RV, right ventricle; RVEF, right ventricular\r\nejection fraction; RVFAC, right ventricular fractional area change; RVMPI, right ventricular myocardial performance index; TAPSE,\r\ntricuspid annular plane systolic excursion; IVRT, isovolumic relaxation time.\r\nAdapted from Haddad F. et al.107\r\nPost-operatively, hemodynamically-significant RV\r\ndysfunction is one of the most serious complications that can\r\noccur after HT and it is associated with increased early and\r\nlate mortality. Patients should be carefully screened and then\r\nmonitored for the development of pulmonary vascular\r\nhypertension while waiting for a suitable donor organ to insure\r\nthat the transpulmonary gradient (TPG) and PVR remain\r\nwithin an acceptable range.107-109 These criteria are detailed in\r\nthe 2006 International Society for Heart and Lung\r\nTransplantation (ISHLT) Listing Criteria Guidelines.86\r\nKnowledge of the pre-operative pulmonary hemodynamics\r\nmay aid the planning of peri-operative strategies to avoid or\r\nbetter manage RV dysfunction. Pulmonary artery pressures\r\nmay decline rapidly after HT and usually reach a new baseline\r\nby 1 year.87 Even when initially poor, RV function typically\r\nimproves over time with proper support. It is during this early\r\npost-operative period when PA pressures are highest and RV\r\nfunction is poorest that overt RV dysfunction may develop and\r\nlead to cardiogenic shock. Timely and aggressive\r\nhemodynamic support during this time is essential. When\r\npharmacologic therapy fails, prompt insertion of a right VAD\r\nis indicated and can provide support while RV dysfunction\r\nresolves.88\r\nSeveral features may be present in patients with postoperative\r\nRV dysfunction after HT. First, there is an increased\r\nPVR that may be due to reversible pulmonary vasoconstriction\r\nas well as chronic changes due to remodeling of the\r\npulmonary vasculature.110 Second, there is RV dysfunction\r\ndue to either graft-related issues, such as ischemia, or PGF.88\r\nUsually LV systolic and diastolic functions are adequate and\r\nthus LV end-diastolic pressure is low. In this instance RV\r\ndysfunction leads to a reduction in the LV stroke volume due \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 11\r\nto inadequate LV filling.88 If significant LV dysfunction is\r\npresent, there is the added feature of LV failure complicating\r\nRV failure. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, insertion of\r\nan IABP may effectively reduce LV afterload and improve RV\r\nperfusion.\r\nTherapy, in general, is aimed at reducing RV afterload\r\nwhile maintaining an adequate but not excessive RV preload\r\n(CVP < 15 mm Hg). Inotropic support of the RV should also\r\nbe provided; usually an IV drug with ÃŽÂ²-agonist properties is\r\nselected first. Mean arterial blood pressure must be maintained\r\nnot only to insure end-organ perfusion but also to maintain RV\r\nperfusion, which occurs in systole as well as diastole. Mild\r\nRV dysfunction may be treated with inotropic agents and\r\nvasodilators such as nitroglycerine or nitroprusside.88\r\nSystemic vasodilation leading to arterial hypotension or\r\nnecessitating the addition of peripheral vasoconstrictors is a\r\nfrequent limiting factor in the use of these agents. The ideal\r\nagent should selectively decrease PVR. At least equivalent, if\r\nnot superior RV afterload reduction, with less systemic\r\nhypotension is achieved by the administration of\r\nprostaglandins. The only truly selective pulmonary vasodilator\r\ncurrently available is inhaled nitric oxide (iNO).89\r\nData have also suggested that concomitant use of a\r\ntricuspid DeVega annuloplasty may help preserve RV function\r\npost-operatively and allow for lower RA pressures.111\r\nBiventricular graft dysfunction can certainly occur with PGF,\r\nand it will be associated with elevated filling pressures for\r\nboth ventricles, low CO, and hypotension. Isolated LV failure\r\nis rare after HT. When this occurs, CAD in the donor heart\r\nshould be ruled out, and if needed, coronary artery bypass\r\ngrafting (CABG) performed.\r\nOther Cardiac Abnormalities\r\nTricuspid Regurgitation\r\nTricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most common valvular\r\nabnormality after orthotropic HT.112 Its reported incidence\r\nvaries between 19\% and 84\%, depending on the definition of\r\nsignificant TR, time of diagnosis, and the surgical\r\ntransplantation technique.112 The incidence and severity of TR\r\nmay increase over time and progression to significant TR has\r\nbeen associated with increased morbidity and mortality.112\r\nAlthough the majority of patients do well with medical\r\ntherapy, a small proportion eventually requires surgical\r\nintervention. The TR occurring in the early peri-operative\r\nperiod is, for the most part, functional. The regurgitant jet is\r\ntypically central and caused by geometric distortion of the AV\r\nannular ring and dilation, and malcoaptation of the valve\r\nleaflets. Causes include biatrial anastomoses, allograft\r\nrejection with RV dysfunction, or mismatch between donor\r\nheart and recipient atrial size. In 166 patients undergoing HT\r\nwith a modified biatrial surgical technique, patients without\r\nTR (67\%) had a donor to recipient (D/R) ratio of < 1, whereas\r\nthose with moderate to severe TR had a D/R ratio of > 1.113\r\nCompared to 88 patients with the bicaval approach, 161\r\nrecipients of the biatrial technique had an increased\r\noccurrence and progression of TR (15\% at 1 month, 30\% at 24\r\nmonths vs. 41\% at 1 month, 52\% at 24 months)114 This lends\r\nstrong support to the belief that preservation of atrial and\r\ntricuspid annulus geometry is crucial in preventing\r\ndevelopment of significant TR.\r\nOther factors influencing atrial remodeling and\r\nenlargement, including allograft rejection > ISHLT Grade 2\r\nand pre-operative pulmonary hypertension independently\r\npredict early TR development.112 The majority of patients with\r\nmoderate to severe TR are asymptomatic. However, adverse\r\nclinical consequences have been reported, such as progressive\r\nRV dysfunction and failure with debilitating symptoms of\r\ndyspnea and peripheral edema, use of high diuretic doses,\r\ndeteriorating functional status, renal dysfunction, and even\r\ndecreased survival. The effects of sub-clinical TR remain\r\ncontroversial. One report described a benign clinical course\r\nfor HT recipeints with less than moderate TR.115 In contrast,\r\nBurgess et al observed that 9\% of patients with TR diagnosed\r\nduring the fourth post-operative week had a 90\% chance of\r\ndeveloping RV failure at a mean follow-up period of 5 years,\r\nleading to an increased mortality (28\% vs. 20\%, p < 0.001).116\r\nProgressive RV cavity enlargement, with disproportionate\r\nelongation of the mid-minor axis, elevated right-sided\r\npressures and more advanced functional class, was associated\r\nwith more severe TR.112, 117 Up to 76\% of patients with TR\r\nhad overt right-heart failure in the immediate post-operative\r\nperiod, and this correlated with pulmonary hypertension after\r\nHT.112 Lewen et al found that 13 of 14 (93\%) patients with\r\nmoderate to severe TR after HT had RV volume overload and\r\nhigher PVR.118 Williams et al noted higher RAP (mean 10 vs.\r\n6 mm Hg, p < 0.05), lower CI (mean 2.0 vs. 2.5 L/min/m2\r\n, p <\r\n0.05) and greater right-side cardiac dimensions in 23 of 72\r\npatients with moderate to severe TR.119\r\nWith longer follow-up duration, the severity and clinical\r\nimpact of TR worsens. Among 238 patients who survived Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1\r\nyear after HT, Aziz et al observed persistent higher mean\r\nRAP, PA systolic pressure and RV dimensions among patients\r\nwith clinical TR. Clinically, 35\% of patients complained of\r\nfatigue, 61\% had chronic fluid overload, 78\% had lower\r\nextremity edema, and 29\% had liver congestion. Furthermore,\r\nrenal function and physical capacity were inferior in the same\r\ngroup.120 Progression of TR has also been correlated with\r\nchange in RV diastolic area and tricuspid annulus, and intra-\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 12\r\noperative TR severity showed a strong correlation with RV\r\ndysfunction, peri-operative mortality and odds of late\r\nsurvival.112, 120, 121\r\nThe mainstay of therapy for symptomatic severe TR is\r\nuse of diuretics. In refractory cases, surgical intervention with\r\ntricuspid valve annuloplasty, repair or replacement, should be\r\nconsidered, depending on the anatomic abnormality of the\r\ntricuspid valve apparatus. In tricuspid annular dilation,\r\napplication of an annuloplasty ring may be sufficient to reduce\r\nthe effective regurgitant orifice. In contrast, surgical repair or\r\nreplacement is required with leaflet or chordal damage to\r\nrestore a functional AV valve apparatus in the right heart.\r\nOverall, various reports have cited tricuspid valve replacement\r\n(TVR) incidence rates between 4\% and 6\% in HT recipients,\r\nwith a mean lag time of 12 to 21 months.112, 122, 123 In another\r\nseries, however, only 5/526 (0.95\%) HT recipients later\r\nrequired tricuspid valve surgery due to severe TR.124 If\r\nreplacement is performed, the best results are achieved before\r\nRV function deteriorates due to severe TR.125 Most patients\r\nhave shown a reduction in their furosemide dose and lower\r\nserum creatinine levels, as well as significantly improved\r\nalbumin and total bilirubin values, implying relief of hepatic\r\ncongestion.112, 123 Prophylactic tricuspid valve annuloplasty\r\n(TVA) on the donor heart at the time of transplantation has\r\nbeen shown to reduce TR immediately after HT as well as on\r\nlong-term follow-up. Sixty patients undergoing orthotopic HT\r\nwith bicaval anastomosis were randomized to either\r\nconcomitant DeVega TVA or no intervention on the donorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\nTV. At 5 years of follow up, compared to patients without TV\r\nintervention, recipients of the DeVega TVA had lower perioperative\r\ncardiac mortality [3 (10\%) vs, 7 (23\%); p < 0.05],\r\naverage amount of TR (0.5Ã‚Â± 0.4 vs. 1.5Ã‚Â± 1.3; p < 0.05),\r\npercentage of patients with TR Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2+ (0 vs. 34\%; p < 0.05),\r\nserum creatinine (sCr) (1.8Ã‚Â±0.7 vs. 2.9Ã‚Â±2.0 mg/dL; p < 0.05)\r\nand change in sCr from baseline (0.7Ã‚Â±0.8 vs. 2.0 Ã‚Â± 2.1 mg/dL;\r\np < 0.05).111 These benefits did not result in significant\r\ndifferences between groups in 5 year survival. Other studies\r\nyielded similar results.126\r\nMitral Regurgitation\r\nMitral regurgitation (MR) can occur in > 50\% of all HT\r\nrecipients in the peri-operative period.115, 127 It typically occurs\r\nin the absence of donor heart structural pathology, but in some\r\ncases it results from incomplete mitral leaflet coaptation due to\r\natrial enlargement.\r\nOther less common causes of MR include asynchronous\r\natrial contraction due to donor and recipient sinus node\r\ndischarge, papillary muscle ischemia, or LV outflow\r\nobstruction. In most cases, MR is mild and asymptomatic.68-71,\r\n128-131 The need for mitral valve repair or replacement is very\r\nrare.\r\nRecommendations on the Management of Perioperative\r\nTricuspid Valve Regurgitation111, 112:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Tricuspid valve regurgitation identified intra-operatively\r\nand estimated to be moderate or severe (> 2+), should be\r\nre-evaluated by TTE or TEE within 24 hours of HT and\r\nclosely monitored for the first few post-operative days.\r\nThe frequency of subsequent follow up should be guided\r\nby clinical and hemodynamic variables.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass II:\r\n1. DeVega annuloplasty of the donor TV can be considered\r\nto maintain the normal size of the TV annulus.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPericardial Effusion\r\nThe development of pericardial effusion has been shown\r\nto occur in more than 20\% of HT recipients.132 Nonetheless,\r\npericardial effusions are rarely associated with hemodynamic\r\ninstability and typically resolve spontaneously by the fourth\r\npost-operative week.133, 134 Moreover, it is uncommon for\r\npericardial effusions to progress to cardiac tamponade.135 In\r\nfact, large but slowly accumulating pericardial effusions\r\nusually cause little hemodynamic impairment in HT\r\nrecipients. However, the development of a loculated\r\nhematoma or mediastinal bleeding, which can develop rapidly\r\nin the early post-operative period, may result in tamponade\r\nphysiology.136 Occasionally, there is isolated RV tamponade\r\nthat may be difficult to distinguish from primary RV failure.\r\nEchocardiography is important for recognition and timely\r\nreturn to the operating room for exploration and evacuation of\r\nthe hematoma to improve RV mechanics and function.\r\nAlthough early reports identified an association between acute\r\nheart allograft rejection and the development or rapid increase\r\nof post-operative pericardial effusions, this finding was not\r\nconfirmed in newer retrospective studies.132\r\nIn a recent retrospective analysis of 203 HT recipients, the\r\nthree factors that predicted the development of post-operative\r\npericardial effusion were absence of a previous cardiac\r\nsurgery, the intra-operative use of aminocaproic acid, and\r\nlower recipient weight. The reasons for the association of\r\nthese factors with pericardial effusions occurring after heart\r\ntransplant remain unclear.137\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 13\r\nRecommendations on the Management of Perioperative\r\nPericardial Effusions132, 137:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Pericardial effusions occurring after HT should be\r\nmonitored by echocardiogram.\r\n2. Percutaneous or surgical drainage should be done when\r\nthe pericardial effusion causes hemodynamic\r\ncompromise.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Pericardial effusions that are not hemodynamically\r\ncompromising do not require drainage unless there is a\r\nstrong suspicion of an infectious etiology.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPharmacologic Management of Primary Graft Failure\r\nand Right Ventricular Dysfunction\r\nThe pharmacologic management of PGF and RV heart\r\nallograft dysfunction includes the use of high-dose inotropic\r\nagents and/or pulmonary vasodilators.\r\nIntravenous Vasoactive Medications\r\nVasoactive medications are selectively employed in the\r\nimmediate post-operative period (including the period leading\r\nto separation from CPB) to achieve several specific goals: (1)\r\ninotropic support of the RV and/or LV; (2) chronotropic\r\nsupport; (3) increase of pulmonary blood flow/pulmonary\r\nvasodilation; and (4) peripheral arterial vasodilation or\r\nvasoconstriction.\r\nFrequently, agents are chosen for their ability to increase\r\nboth contractility and heart rate while decreasing pulmonary\r\nand systemic vascular resistance. As a potent chronotrope,\r\ninotrope, and vasodilator, isoproterenol is in many respects the\r\nideal agent for hemodynamic support after HT, particularly in\r\nthe setting of bradycardia or sinus node dysfunction. It has\r\nbeen a commonly used agent since the early days of HT.78\r\nHowever, tachycardia can limit its usefulness, particularly in\r\nbicaval and total HT, where the incidence of sinus node\r\ndysfunction is lower than with the biatrial surgical technique.\r\nWhereas the dose range for isoproterenol is usually 2 to 10\r\nÃ‚Âµg/min, this drug can be titrated to achieve a target heart rate\r\nof 90 to 110 bpm. Atrial pacing combined with dobutamine\r\nachieves results similar to those of isoproterenol.\r\nCombined infusion of low-dose dobutamine and\r\ndopamine (both at starting doses of 2.5-5 Ã‚Âµg/kg/min) is\r\nanother commonly used inotropic regimen after HT.138 This\r\ncombination of inotropes may be titrated to achieve the\r\ndesired hemodynamic effects. Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase\r\ninhibitor with inotropic and vasodilatory properties, may also\r\nbe considered for hemodynamic support, particularly in the\r\nsetting of pulmonary vascular hypertension, high systemic\r\nvasomotor tone or if there is evidence of heart allograft\r\ndysfunction upon separation from CPB.139\r\nIn some instances, peripheral arteriolar vasoconstrictors\r\nmay be required to counteract the vasodilation seen during or\r\nafter CPB and maintain a systemic arterial pressure adequate\r\nfor the perfusion of vital organs. While the etiology of this\r\nvasodilation is unclear, several hypotheses invoked to explain\r\nits occurrence include the release during CPB of cytokines,\r\nwhich may produce a systemic inflammatory response\r\nsyndrome (SIRS), the effects of pre-operative medications\r\nsuch as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or\r\nrelative/absolute deficiency of vasopressin. Septic shock\r\narising from an occult intra-abdominal catastrophe must also\r\nbe considered, especially if there is lactic acidosis that persists\r\nbeyond 6 hours after HT.140 The range of vasodilation seen in\r\nthe post-operative period ranges from mild and responsive to\r\nthe infusion of a low dose of a single ÃŽÂ±-adrenergic agent to\r\nquite profound and refractory to high levels of multiple\r\nvasoconstrictors. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene\r\nblue has been successfully used for the treatment of\r\ncatecholamine-refractory vasoplegia after CPB.141 It has been\r\ndemonstrated that an infusion of low-dose arginine\r\nvasopressin can improve vasomotor tone (and thus arterial\r\npressure) and permit reduction or discontinuation of high-dose\r\ncatecholamines in patients receiving left VADs.142 Arginine\r\nvasopressin has also been shown to prevent hypotension after\r\nCPB in patients undergoing CABG or valve surgery\r\n(Table 2).143\r\nRecommendations for Peri-operative Vasoactive\r\nDrugs Use in Heart Transplant Recipients139, 141-150:\r\n(See Table 2)\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Continuous infusion of an inotropic agent should be used\r\nto maintain hemodynamic stability post-operatively.\r\nInotropes should be weaned as tolerated over the first 3 to\r\n5 days.

Low dose vasopressin (0.03-0.1 U/min) or methylene blue\r\ncan be added to ÃŽÂ±-agonist for vasodilatory shock.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nPulmonary Vasodilators\r\nProstanoids\r\nThe prostanoids are naturally occurring substances that\r\nproduce vasodilation by inducing smooth muscle relaxation.\r\nThey have short half-lives, on the order of minutes, and are\r\npotent pulmonary vasodilators. Of the prostanoids,\r\nprostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and epoprostenol or prostacyclin are\r\ngiven IV whereas iloprost is sdministered by inhalation.\r\nProstaglandin E1\r\nThe use of continuous infusion PGE1 for RV dysfunction\r\ndue to pulmonary hypertension after HT has been described in\r\nnumerous case reports.143, 144, 151 PGE1 is metabolized in the\r\nfirst pass through the pulmonary circulation and, therefore, the\r\nrisk of systemic arterial vasodilatation is reduced but not\r\ncompletely eliminated. Kieler-Jensen, et al. compared the\r\nsystemic and pulmonary vasodilating effects of PGE1 with\r\niNO and IV prostacyclin. This increased CO more than either\r\nPGE1 or iNO, but iNO reduced PVR more and was the only\r\npulmonary selective vasodilator and thus preferred in the\r\nsetting of systemic hypotension.89, 152\r\nProstacyclin\r\nIntravenous prostacyclin (PGI2) is an approved therapy\r\nfor pulmonary arterial hypertension (World Health\r\nOrganization Group I). Pascual et al. reported a series of 9\r\npatients who developed RV dysfunction early after HT despite\r\ninotropic and vasodilator infusions. Prostacyclin infusion,\r\nstarted at 0.5 ng/kg/min and titrated to 5.0 ng/kg/min, resulted\r\nin an increased CI with reduced RAP and mean PA pressures.\r\nTherapy was maintained for 48 hours and weaned over 24\r\nhours.145 Comparative studies have shown more pulmonary\r\nvasodilator effects and more pronounced peripheral\r\nvasodilation with PGI2 than with nitroprusside and\r\nnitroglycerine.89\r\nContinuous inhaled PGI2 has also been used in the\r\ntreatment of RV dysfunction after HT and cardiac surgery.\r\nHaraldsson, et al. reported its use in 9 patients (2 of whom\r\nwere HT recipients) with pulmonary hypertension and an\r\nincreased PVR. Inhalation of PGI2, at 10 Ã‚Âµg/mL, produced\r\nreductions in mean pulmonary artery pressure and PVR\r\nwithout affecting systemic vascular resistance. No change in\r\nCO was noted.153 The use of the intermittently inhaled\r\nprostacyclin analogue, iloprost, has also been reported.146\r\nInhaled Nitric Oxide\r\nNitric oxide (iNO), also previously known as endothelialderived\r\nrelaxation factor, causes vasodilation by activating\r\nguanylate cyclase and increasing the production of cyclic\r\nguanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which then activates a\r\ncGMP protein kinase leading to smooth muscle relaxation.\r\nWhen inhaled in doses up to 80 ppm, it causes selective\r\npulmonary vasodilation leading to reduced PVR, increased\r\npulmonary blood flow, and reduced RV afterload. It reacts\r\nreadily with oxyhemoglobin to yield methemoglobin and\r\nnitrate, thus, its activity outside the pulmonary vasculature is\r\nlimited and, generally, systemic vasodilation does not occur.\r\nNitric oxide has been shown to reduce PVR, increase RV\r\nstroke work, and reduce the incidence of RV dysfunction. It\r\nalso appears to be safe with a very low incidence of\r\nmethemoglobinemia with proper monitoring. In addition,\r\nbecause iNO produces vasodilation in the areas of the lung\r\nthat are well ventilated, theoretically it should not exacerbate \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 15\r\nventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching. Consequently, it\r\nwould seem to be the optimal selective pulmonary\r\nvasodilator.154\r\nHowever, despite its theoretical advantages, the clinical\r\nuse of iNO remains somewhat controversial. In the United\r\nStates, its only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\r\napproved indication is for hypoxic respiratory failure in the\r\nnewborn. Studies in adult respiratory distress syndrome have\r\nidentified no consistent benefit. Its use in managing RV\r\ndysfunction after left VAD implantation has been described.155\r\nData in HT is limited to small case series and anecdotal\r\nreports.89, 147, 148, 156, 157 There have been no adequately\r\npowered trials to critically assess mortality or other outcomes.\r\nSildenafil\r\nSildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is an\r\nevolving therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension that may\r\nhave a role in the treatment of RV dysfunction after HT.\r\nMichelakis et al. demonstrated in 13 patients referred for heart\r\nand lung transplantation that a single dose of sildenafil was as\r\neffective and selective as iNO for pulmonary vasodilation.158\r\nCase reports and small anecdotal studies suggest sildenafil\r\nmay attenuate the rebound pulmonary hypertension sometimes\r\nnoted with withdrawal of iNO and reduce PA pressure after\r\ncardiac surgery.159-161 In a series of 13 patients with RV\r\ndysfunction and low CO despite therapy with dobutamine,\r\nisoproterenol, PGE1, and iNO during the first post-operative\r\nday (1-18 hours) after HT, oral sildenafil at 3 mg/kg to a\r\nmaximum of 250 mg/day resulted in immediate hemodynamic\r\nimprovement.149 Although an oral form is widely available, an\r\nIV formulation is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.\r\nRecommendations for the Medical Management of\r\nRight Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary\r\nVascular Hypertension after Heart Transplantation139,\r\n141-149, 162:\r\n(See Figure 1)\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

Use of IABP alone is up to 66\% to 70\% in some\r\nreports,101, 103 with use of other VADs of 22\% to 29\% and\r\nECMO in 7\% to 10\% of patients.\r\nECMO has been used to support patients with PGF who\r\nfail to wean from CPB. Some recommend ECMO as the first\r\nline of support because it makes separation from CPB\r\npossible.102, 171 However, more recent publications have not\r\nagreed with this recommendation.\r\nVentricular assist devices that have been used for\r\nrecovery in PGF include Pierce-Donachy VAD,167 Delphin\r\ncentifugal VAD,168 ABIOMED 5000 BVS,82, 96, 166, 169, 170 Biomedicus\r\ncentrifugal pump,82, 85, 101, 164-166 Novacor,83\r\nThoratec,82, 83, 101, 166 HeartMate LVAD,96 and Levitronix.84, 173\r\nNewer percutaneous devices such as the TandemHeart have\r\nanecdotally been used for PGF. In rare circumstances, a\r\nThoratec device can be implanted as an right VAD to allow\r\nfor patient physical therapy and ambulation while waiting for\r\ngraft recovery. Although the choice of device is influenced by\r\nanatomical considerations, hemodynamic stability, and\r\nsurgeon preferences, VADs suited for temporary circulatory\r\nsupport should be preferred. The VAD for PGF should be easy\r\nto prime, implant, manage, and remove. In addition, it should\r\nbe less expensive than devices designed for long-term support\r\nand require little anticoagulation for the first 24 hours postoperatively.\r\nWith the advances in MCS technology, the\r\nsmaller devices can now provide substantial support, with less\r\ncost and less physical manipulation of the transplanted heart.\r\nThe Levitronix Centrimag is a magnetically levitated\r\ncentrifugal extra-corporeal pump that can provide flows of 5\r\nto 7 L/min, and can be used for left, right, and bi-ventricular\r\nsupport.173 The TandemHeart is an extracorporeal axial flow \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 16\r\npump that has been used support cardiac function in\r\npostcardiotomy shock.174 Flows of 4 L/min can be maintained,\r\nand these VADs can also be used to support the LV, RV or\r\nboth. Oxygenators can be inserted into the circuit of these\r\nVADs, if needed, which decreases the appeal for ECMO in\r\nadults. An IABP can be used concurrently with a VAD for\r\nPGF to facilitate afterload reduction and to maintain some\r\npulsatile flows. The Impella Recover LD/LP 5.0 has also been\r\nused to support patients with postcardiotomy shock.175\r\nAcute Right Ventricular Failure\r\nPreload\r\nOptimization\r\nHemodynamically Unstable\r\n(low output syndrome)\r\nMaintenance of\r\nSR and AV synchrony Ventilatory Support\r\nVolume Overload State\r\nMild progressive diuresis\r\ngoal:0.5-1 L daily negative\r\nAcute RVMI or PE\r\nor Hypovolemic State\r\n(Consider 300-600 ml\r\ncrystalloid challenge.\r\n(D/C/if unresponsive)\r\nCardioversion\r\nPacemeker Implantation\r\n(atrio-ventricular)\r\nAntiarrhythmics as required\r\nAvoid:\r\nInspiratory pressure > 30 mmHg\r\nAuto PEEP\r\nHypercapnia\r\nAcidosis\r\nHypoxemia\r\nContinuous infusion\r\nof loop diuretics\r\nand/or combination diuretics\r\nConsider CVVH or\r\nUltrafiltration\r\nMinimize transfusions\r\nAtrial septostomy\r\nRV assist device\r\nECMO\r\nNotric oxide trial (inhaled)\r\nor prostanoids\r\nCombinatio Based upon response\r\nEpinephrine Hypotensive-unresponsive\r\nVasopressine Hypotensive-tachycardic\r\nPhenylephrine Hypotensive-tachycardic\r\nNorepinephrine Hypotensive\r\nDopamine Hypotensive, non-tachycardic\r\nMilrinone Normotensive, chronic BB\r\nDobutamie Normotensive\r\nInotrope-Vasopressor Preferred Use\r\nUnresponsive\r\nAlso consider\r\nUnresponsive\r\nUnresponsive\r\nFigure 1 Management of right ventricular dysfunction.

Adapted from Hannad F et al.162\r\nBecause of immunosuppression and the risks of infection,\r\nthe shortest possible duration of support is preferred.\r\nHowever, once a VAD is implanted, it is often best to delay\r\nweaning attempts for 36 to 48 hours. Evidence of heart\r\nallograft recovery can be seen on TTE, although often TEE is\r\nneeded because of poor transthoracic acoustic windows.\r\nDecreased requirement for inotropic support also signifies\r\ngraft recovery. Hemodynamic parameters such as a decrease\r\nin RAP or RV end diastolic pressure may be helpful, but this\r\nwill depend on the configuration of MCS. Increased pulsewave\r\namplitude on arterial waveforms can also be a sign of\r\ngraft recovery.\r\nSurvival with PGF has improved over the past 15 years.98\r\nCoupled with the recognition that early retransplantation\r\nwithin 6 months of primary HT is associated with poorer\r\nsurvival, there is now increasing consensus that bridging to\r\nrecovery results in better survival.84, 101, 176 Patient survival\r\nrates to hospital discharge after MCS for PGF ranges from 0\%\r\nto 71\% depending on the report and the type of MCS used.82-\r\n84, 96, 101, 102, 163, 166, 177, 178 However, these data are based on\r\nsmall case series or case reports.

The timing MCS discontinuation should be guided by\r\nevidence of graft recovery. If there is no evidence of graft\r\nfunctional recovery within 3 to 4 days, hyperacute and\r\nantibody mediated rejection should be excluded and the\r\noption of listing for repeat HT may be considered.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1. Use of ECMO support in adults requires consideration of\r\nthe risk of infection, immobility, and need for\r\nanticoagulation.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPediatric Considerations\r\nIn the setting of acute RV failure in the peri-operative\r\nperiod, it is imperative that any potential residual anatomic\r\nlesions be investigated and rectified if present. This is\r\nespecially important in the child with complex congenital\r\nheart disease who has undergone pulmonary artery\r\nreconstruction. The associated abnormalities may be amenable\r\nto intervention in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Less\r\ncommonly, the size of the left atrial anastamosis may be a\r\nproblem. If stenosis is hemodyamically significant and not\r\nrecognized intra-operatively by TEE, it is likely to cause\r\nhemodynamic instability in the immediate post-operative\r\nperiod and require a return to the operating room for revision.\r\nRarely, progressive pulmonary vein stenosis can be a problem.\r\nThe complication of high PVR leading to acute RV\r\nfailure, and the principles of post-operative management are\r\nsimilar in children and adults. However, in the literature, with\r\nstudies showing variable outcomes with varying levels of PVR\r\nor transpulmonary gradient elevation,179-184 have been reported\r\nand there is no consensus regarding relative or absolute cutoff\r\nvalues for HT candidacy. Even the values of parameters (PVR,\r\nPVR indexed (PVRi), systolic PA pressure, and TPG) whose\r\nproperative measurement is deemed imprtant for risk\r\nstratification remain controversial.88, 183, 184 Responses of\r\npulmonary arterial hypertension to vasodilators are also felt to\r\nbe of variable significance in terms of an accurate prediction\r\nof outcomes.184 In addition, determination of PVR is difficult,\r\nespecially in infants with complex congenital heart disease.185,\r\n186\r\nIn an early pediatric series of 6 patients with resting PVR\r\nvalues between 7 and 15 Wood Units,187 5 underwent HT after\r\ndemonstration of a decrease in PVR in response to IV\r\nnitroprusside and 4 were long-term survivors.187 Correlation of\r\nPVR and PVRi values with outcomes after HT in 82 patients\r\naged 4 to 61 years showed188 that 33\% of patients with a PVRi\r\nof > 6 Wood Units developed RV failure with a mortality of\r\n15\%, wherease no patient with a PVRi below this value\r\ndeveloped RV failure. The results also confirm that high PVR\r\nis not an absolute contraindication to HT as 28 of 33 patients\r\nwith a PVRi of > 6 Wood Units and 10 of 12 patients with a\r\nPVRi of > 9 Wood Units were successfully transplanted.\r\nassist support devices \r\nThe infant population with either congenital heart disease\r\npredisposing to systemic pulmonary vascular pressures (duct\r\ndependent single ventricle physiology) or cardiomyopathy\r\nhave a low incidence of significant post-operative\r\ncomplications due to pulmonary vascular hypertension. Of\r\n139 consecutive infant HT recipients up to 12 months of age,\r\nonly 1 death occurred as a result of pulmonary vascular\r\nhypertension.189\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 18\r\nRecommendations for the Management of Early\r\nHeart Allograft Dysfunction in Pediatric\r\nRecipients179, 181, 183-187, 189:\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1.

Contrary to the experience and practice in adults, the first\r\nchoice for support in the setting of PGF in the pediatric\r\nsetting should be ECMO.\r\nClass IIa, Level of Evidence C.\r\nArrhythmias\r\nHeart rate is variable and ranges from bradycardia to\r\ntachycardia. Factors such as parasympathetic denervation,\r\nsurgical trauma, catecholamine administration, and even\r\ngenomic variations in the ÃŽÂ²-adrenergic receptor may affect the\r\nsinus node rate.94\r\nBradycardia\r\nMost HT recipients display normal sinus rhythm upon\r\nreperfusion. A complete or incomplete right bundle branch\r\nblock may be present in 14\% to 60\% of patients.190, 191 PR and\r\nQT intervals remain normal, despite the bundle branch block.\r\nHowever, the incidence of bradyarrhythmias ranges from 8\%\r\nto 64\%.192-194 Sinus node dysfunction in the immediate postoperative\r\nperiod may be related to surgical trauma, sinus node\r\nischemia, and recipient medical therapy and donor age and\r\nischemic time.195 In addition, the donor heart has an increased\r\nsensitivity to and production of adenosine, which may\r\ncontribute to some peri-operative bradycardia.196, 197 Absolute\r\nor relative bradycardia typically occurs within the first 2\r\nweeks.198\r\nRates of sinus node dysfunction and the need for\r\npermanent pacing have decreased with the adoption of the\r\nbicaval Wythenshawe technique, and the total heart technique\r\nthat has separate anastamoses of the pulmonary and caval\r\nveins, to replace the standard biatrial technique pioneered by\r\nLower and Shumway.192, 196, 199 In a randomized study of\r\nsurgical techniques, 36 of 41 patients with the bicaval\r\napproach had sinus rhythm in the operating room, with the rest\r\nreturning to sinus rhythm in a few days. In contrast, the\r\nbiatrial method resulted in only 20 of 40 patients with\r\nspontaneous sinus rhythm and 5 patients in whom sinus\r\nrhythm never returned.200 In another report the rate of\r\ntemporary pacing was up to 38\% in the standard biatrial\r\napproach to transplantation and only 20\% with the bicaval\r\ntechnique.201 More recent data suggest that hospital length of\r\nstay and need for pacing are also lower with the bicaval\r\ntechnique.202\r\nWith modern surgical techniques, 18\% to 27\% of HT\r\nrecipients require temporary pacing.194, 203 Sinus node\r\ndepression is usually corrected by chronotropic support with\r\nisoproterenol, dobutamine, or dopamine, which are routinely\r\nused (see section on Pharmacologic management posttransplant).\r\nOther pharmacologic agents that have been used\r\nfor bradycardia after HT are theophylline and terbutaline. As\r\nthere is invariably some diastolic dysfunction and a reduced\r\nstroke volume in the post transplant heart, maintaining heart\r\nrate is crucial to maintaining CO.\r\nTachyarrhythmias\r\nSinus tachycardia is the most common heart rhythm after\r\nHT. With loss of vagal innervation and parasympathetic input,\r\nthe transplanted heart will assume the automatic sinus rate,\r\nwhich should be < 130 bpm. However, both ventricular and\r\natrial tachyarrhthymias may occur in the post-operative\r\nperiod.\r\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are\r\ncommon in the post-operative period. Studies have suggested\r\nan incidence of 7\% to 25\% for arrhythmias lasting longer than\r\n1 hour or leading to hemodynamic compromise.190, 204-206\r\nWithin the first 2 weeks after HT, AF is more common than\r\nAFL, occurring in 5\% to 24\% of patients, although more\r\ncontemporary estimates are lower (6\%-10\%). The incidence of\r\nAF after HT, may be less than that occurring after\r\nconventional cardiac surgery.190, 207 When AF occurs within 2\r\nweeks of transplantation, it does not appear to be associated\r\nwith rejection.204, 206 In contrast, later AF may be associated\r\nwith rejection and an increase in overall mortality.208 The\r\nlikelihood of AF after HT is greater with older donor and\r\nrecipient age. The incidence of AF in the post-operative period\r\ndoes not appear to be affected by the surgical technique. A\r\nlarge retrospective study showed that bicaval and total HT are\r\nassociated with a lower incidence of AFL201, 206 due to the\r\nphysical reduction of left atrial size by these procedures. The\r\ndevelopment of atrial tachyarrhythmias may also be due to\r\nconduction abnormalities in the donor heart. Accessory\r\npathways and re-entrant circuits have been described, in\r\naddition to standard AFL macro-reentrant circuits. These can\r\nbe treated with radio-frequency ablation.207 Although\r\nadenosine administration can help to clarify the diagnosis of\r\natrial arrhythmias in the HT recipient, the dose should be\r\nreduced by one-half to one-third 209 because of an increased\r\nsensitivity to its effects. Premature ventricular contractions \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 19\r\ncan be seen in as many as 95\% of HT recipients in the\r\nimmediate post-operative period. 204 Non-sustained ventricular\r\ntachycardia (VT) occurs in less than 2\% of HT recipients, 190\r\nand it is triggered by increased sensitivity to catecholamines\r\nand longer ischemic times.\r\nPharmacologic management of tachyarrythmias is limited\r\nbecause the donor heart is denervated. Digoxin will not be\r\neffective for rate control. ÃŽÂ²-blocker therapy can lower heart\r\nrates through direct effect on cardiac ÃŽÂ² receptors. The nondihydropyridine\r\ncalcium channel blockers, verapamil and\r\ndiltiazem, can help control heart rate, but should be used\r\njudiciously because they can have negative inotropic effects\r\nand inhibit the metabolism of CNI. Amiodarone can safely be\r\nused after HT for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Sotalol\r\ncan be used in patients without significant renal dysfunction.\r\nDofetlide has many drug interactions and should be avoided if\r\npossible unless there are no other antiarrhythmic options for\r\nrate control.\r\nRecommendations for the Peri-operative\r\nManagement of Cardiac Arrhythmias in Heart\r\nTransplant Recipients190-192, 194, 205, 207, 209:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and betablockers\r\nmay be used in HT recipients for rate control.\r\nLevel of Evidence: B.\r\nRenal Function and Fluid Status Management\r\nThere are many insults to the kidneys in HT recipients.\r\nThe renal function of many chronic heart failure patients is\r\nimpaired due to chronic low output states, high venous filling\r\npressures, and upregulation of the renin-aldosteroneangiotensin\r\nsystem leading to salt and water retention.210\r\nVolume overload persisting after donor HT can acutely\r\ndistend the more sensitive, ischemically injured, pressure\r\noverloaded RV and aggravate post-operative RV\r\ndysfunction.225, 226\r\nCardiac cachexia and hypoalbuminemia can result in low\r\nplasma oncotic pressures, ascites, peripheral edema, and\r\npoorer outcomes.211 The cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic\r\nresistance typical of advanced heart failure complicates postoperative\r\nmanagement of HT recipeients. Early institution of\r\nCNI can further reduce responsiveness to diuretics due to the\r\nrenal vasoconstrictive properties of these drugs.\r\nPatients receiving successful MCS can be better\r\nnourished and euvolemic to even mildly hypovolemic at the\r\ntime of HT. The end-organ sequelae of chronic heart failure\r\nare often resolved in these patients. Whereas renal function\r\nand nutritional status are improved, the risk of peri-operative\r\nbleeding and resulting hypovolemia may be increased.212\r\nThe use of blood products and management of\r\ncoagulopathy in HT recipients is discussed elsewhere in these\r\nguidelines. \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 20\r\nAfter HT, renal function may be a marker of cardiac\r\nfunction. As RAP rise above 15 to 20 mm Hg, there is\r\nincreased renal venous pressure and decreased perfusion\r\npressure.213-215 Perfusionists can perform ultrafiltration during\r\nCPB to reduce volume overload. Adequate CO can be\r\nmaintained using pharmacologic support or MCS if needed. If\r\noliguria develops, loop diuretics can be used. If urine output is\r\n< 1 mL/kg/min, appropriate interventions should be initiated.\r\nIf preload is low, with RAP < 10 to 12 mm Hg, volume\r\nreplacement should be considered. If the RAP is high, then\r\ncontinued use of diuretics or ultrafiltration should be\r\nconsidered to reduce renal preload and improve renal\r\nfunction.216, 217 In the heart failure and cardiorenal literature,\r\nvolume overload has been recognized as a risk factor for\r\nworsening renal function.218, 219 Ultrafiltration can be\r\nperformed with either standard dialysis platforms, or with the\r\nsmaller continuous ultrafiltration machines. The smaller\r\nmachines can provide substantial rates of ultrafiltration with\r\nlimited effect on the mean arterial pressure, and do not require\r\nthe placement of dialysis catheters.220\r\nThe incidence of renal failure requiring hemodialysis after\r\nHT ranges from 1\% to 15\%217, 221-224 and is associated with\r\nincreased mortality up to 50\% compared with 1.4\% to 4.2\% in\r\npatients not requiring renal replacement therapy.211, 222, 223 The\r\nuse of dialysis in the immediate post-transplant setting can be\r\ntransient.223 Risk factors for the development of renal failure\r\nare longer bypass time, diabetes mellitus, and low serum\r\nalbumin levels, but not pre-operative sCr.223\r\nFor patients requiring MCS, ultrafiltration or dialysis can\r\nbe performed into the circuit in some systems, and should be\r\nconsidered earlier in the setting of RV failure.169\r\nIf renal failure occurs in the immediate post-operative\r\nperiod after HT, the addition of monoclonal or polyclonal\r\nantibodies to delay initation of CNI should be considered. In\r\n2007, 51\% of HT recipients received mono- or polyclonal\r\nantibody therapy, 28\% with an anti-CD 25 (IL-2) receptor\r\nantagonist, and 20\% with anti-thymocyte globulin.225.\r\n226-229\r\nThe use of both anti-thymocyte globulin and the IL-2 receptor\r\nantagonist, basiliximab, to delay CNI initiation led to\r\nimproved renal function early after HT.230 231 More recently, a\r\nsingle-center comparison of anti-thymocyte globulin with\r\nbasiliximab suggested that induction with anti-thymocyte\r\nglobulin confers better renal protection than basiliximab with\r\nsustained benefits to 6 months after HT.232 Strategies to delay\r\nthe initiation of CNI, should be considered when there is preoperative\r\nrenal dysfunction, or a post-operative worsening of\r\nsCr > 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 umol/L).\r\nRecommendations for Peri-operative Renal Function\r\nand Fluid Status Management in Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients210, 220, 223, 232:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

In addition to the goal of\r\nachieving tight glycemic control, it is also imperative to avoid\r\ndangerous hypoglycemia. In a recent trial of intensive glucose\r\ncontrol (glucose target range 81-108 mg/dL) versus\r\nconventional control (glucose < 180 mg/dL) in 6104 medical\r\nintensive care patients found that the higher mortality rate in\r\nthe intensive control was attributable to hypoglycemic\r\nevents.237 Many protocols include a concomitant dextrose\r\ninfusion to minimize this risk. Although no randomized trials\r\nsupport the use of one protocol over another, a review of 12\r\nregimens has shown that while 238 target ranges for blood\r\nglucose are variable, levels < 200 mg/dL are consistently\r\nassociated with reduced surgical site infections.239\r\nDiabetics should be monitored for the development of\r\ndiabetic ketoacidosis, because even Type II diabetics may\r\ndevelop ketosis in the setting of stress such as surgery.\r\nAs a general rule, oral hypoglycemics should be\r\ndiscontinued pre-operatively and not used in the immediate\r\npost-operative period as they may be associated with\r\ncomplications such as lactic acidosis (metformin), or fluid\r\nretention (thiazolidinediones).240 The oral hypoglycemics may\r\nbe safely re-introduced during the first week after HT when\r\nglucose levels have become stable. Insulin-dependent\r\ndiabetics should be converted back to intermittent\r\nsubcutaneous insulin when it is safe to do so.\r\nRecommendations for the Peri-operative\r\nManagement of Hyperglycemia in Heart Transplant\r\nRecipient234, 238:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

It is\r\nimportant to recognize that antimicrobial regimens should be\r\ntailored to the pathogens prevaling in the transplant center.

In\r\naddition, infants with an open chest and/or requiring ECMO\r\nsupport are a particularly high-risk group for invasive fungal\r\ninfection with a mortality of nearly 50\% within the Pediatric\r\nHeart Transplant Study.246 Therefore, it is common practice to\r\nuse an IV anti-fungal agent such as fluconazole for\r\nprophylaxis in this group. In addition, in a large multicenter\r\nregistry, Pneumocystis jiroveci has been shown to occur at a\r\nlow incidence of 1\% but associated with increased mortality,\r\nprimarily within the first year post-transplant.247 Therefore, it\r\nis common practice to continue prophylaxis for at least 3\r\nmonths and for up to 24 months after heart transplantation.\r\nRecommendations for Peri-operative Infection\r\nProphylaxis and Treatment in Pediatric Heart\r\nTransplant Recipients242-245:\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1.

This was first demonstrated by Patel\r\nand Terasaki, who documented poor survival of renal\r\nallografts in recipients whose serum caused lysis of donor\r\nleukocytes in an in vitro crossmatch test.248 This cell lysis was\r\nlater proven to be due to the presence of alloantibodies in the\r\nrecipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serum directed against donor HLA antigens.249\r\nSince then, various modifications of crossmatch testing, in\r\nwhich recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serum is combined with donor cells, have\r\nbeen routinely used to determine donor-recipient\r\ncompatibility. The crossmatch test helps clinicians avoid\r\ntransplantation of an organ into a recipient with donor specific\r\nantibodies.\r\nMethods for the Detection of Anti-HLA Antibodies\r\nThe detection of anti-HLA antibodies requires the\r\nrecipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serum as the source of Ã¢â‚¬Å“unknownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ anti-HLA\r\nantibodies and cells or materials bearing Ã¢â‚¬Å“knownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ HLA\r\nantigens. These panel reactive antibody (PRA) tests, which\r\ndetermine the percentage of possible donor HLA antigens\r\ntargeted by the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preformed circulating antibodies, is\r\nroutinely used to assess the likelihood of a recipient to reject a\r\ndonor organ (Table 4).\r\nThe target HLA antigens may be constitutively expressed\r\nantigens on the cell membranes of T-cells (Class I HLA\r\nantigens) and of B cells (Class I and II HLA antigens).\r\nAntibodies directed against these antigens may be detected in\r\na number of ways:\r\n(1) The complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) method\r\nevaluates target (donor) cell lysis occurring in the\r\npresence of antibody-antigen complex and complement\r\nactivation and it is detected by the addition of a dye that\r\npenetrates only into the lysed cells. This method has been\r\nfor the most part superseded by flow-cytometry\r\ntechniques.\r\n(2) Complement-independent flow-cytometry enables the\r\ndetection of the primary anti-HLA antibody after target\r\n(donor) cells are incubated with the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serum and\r\na secondary fluorescent-labeled antiglobulin (AHG).\r\nTable 4 Panel-Reactive Antibody and Crossmatch Methods Among\r\n20 Histocompatibility Laboratories\r\nMethod Description PRA (\%) XM (n)\r\nCDC with T lymphocytes without AHG 8 9\r\nCDC with T lymphocytes with AHG 15 12\r\nCDC with B lymphocytes without AHG 8 10\r\nCDC with B lymphocytes with AHG 5 5\r\nFlow Cytometry with T lymphocytes 3 12\r\nFlow Cytometry with B lymphocytes 1 11\r\nFlow beads with Class I antigens 7 -\r\nFlow beads with Class II antigens 2 -\r\nELISA with Class I antigens 7\r\nELISA with Class II antigens 5\r\nAHG, anti-human globulin; CDC, complement-dependent\r\ncytotoxicity; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay;\r\nn, number of programs using the indicated technique; PRA,\r\npanel-reactive antibody; XM, crossmatch methods.\r\nAdapted from Betkowski AS, et al.250\r\nBriefly, these PRA tests consist of adding the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\nserum to HLA-antigen-bearing cells (lymphocytes) obtained\r\nfrom a panel of random individuals from the local population\r\n(usually 30-60) who are felt to be representative of the\r\npotential donor pool. The PRA result represents the percentage\r\nof the panel of cells which undergo lysis in the presence of the\r\nrecipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serum. This PRA measurement does not specify the\r\nHLA antigens against which the recipient has antibodies; it\r\nsimply estimates the percentage of the local donor pool that\r\nwill be incompatible. At most transplantation centers a percent\r\nPRA Ã¢â€°Â¥10\% is the threshold above which virtual or real time\r\nprospective crossmatch should be done to determine if the\r\nrecipient antibodies are actually directed against donor tissue\r\n(see below).250 The correlation between preformed antibodies\r\ndirected against HLA antigens and poor outcomes after HT\r\nhas been demonstrated with both cytotoxicity and flow\r\ncytometry methods.251 In both these cell-based assays,\r\nrecipient antibodies not specific for donor HLA antigens may\r\nalso bind to target cells and cause their lysis. The CDC assay\r\nrequires larger amounts of blood for antibody screening than\r\ncomplement-independent assays, an important consideration\r\nin pediatric HT candidates.\r\n(3) Solid-phase assays permit identification of specific HLAantibodies\r\nbecause individual HLA antigens are mounted \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 24\r\nonto an artificial support such as plastic plates for ELISA,\r\nmicrobeads for flow cytometry or the multiplex platform\r\nLuminex.\r\nThe common denominator of these methods is the\r\npresence of a high-affinity, clinically available anti-IgG\r\nantibody coupled with an enzyme which produces a\r\nassist support devices\r\ncolorimetric reaction when exposed to specific substrates\r\n(ELISA) or fluorochromes (flow cytometry).\r\nEvaluation of antibody specificity using panels of cells\r\ncan be difficult, especially in highly sensitized patients, even\r\nafter cumbersome adsorption/elution techniques to remove\r\nnon-HLA antibodies. Furthermore, the HLA types on the\r\npanel cells used for screening should reflect the antigenic\r\nfrequency in the regional population of the transplant center.\r\nThe availability of single antigen-coated plates/beads greatly\r\nfacilitates the evaluation of antibody specificity. In highly\r\nsensitized recipients, these assays can provide valuable\r\ninformation regarding the specific HLA antigens not targeted\r\nby recipient antibodies and therefore considered acceptable\r\ndonor/recipient pairs.\r\nThe availability of single-antigen assays also permits the\r\nidentification of rare or infrequently expressed HLA antigens.\r\nFor example, the less recognized anti-HLA class II DP\r\nalloantibodies may mediate chronic humoral rejection in renal\r\ntransplant recipients.252 In addition, solid-phase PRA tests\r\nenable one to distinguish a positive cytotoxic result due to\r\nbinding of anti-HLA antibodies to HLA antigens from cell\r\nlysis due to binding of antibodies to non-HLA molecules also\r\nexpressed on the surface of T and B cells.251 It is important to\r\nnote that solid-phase assays can be altered by various\r\npreparations containing HLA-Ab (IV Ig) or non-HLA\r\nantibodies (antiplastic-antibodies, especially in patients with\r\nhemodialysis or MCS).\r\nIdeally more than 1 PRA screening method should be\r\nperformed on more than 1 occasion (separated by at least 2\r\nweeks) for accurate assessment of the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\r\nallosensitization status.252 The number of patients at risk for\r\ndeveloping antibodies against donorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ HLA antigens is\r\nincreasing due to previous transplants, use of homograft\r\nmaterials in cardiac surgery, exposure to paternal HLA\r\nantigens during pregnancy and transfusion of blood products.\r\nAlthough the use of MCS devices may be associated with\r\nelevated PRA levels, the antibodies which develop in this\r\nsetting may not be directed against HLA antigens and the\r\ncrossmatch may be negative.252There is no universally\r\naccepted definition of a PRA threshold above which a real\r\ntime or virtual prospective crossmatch should be done.250\r\nIn a real-time prospective crossmatch, the donorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\nlymphocytes are directly exposed to the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serum and\r\nobserved for lysis prior to accepting the donor for transplant.\r\nReal-time prospective crossmatch cannot be prospectively\r\nperformed in the absence of readily available donor cells or\r\nwhen a short organ ischemia time is essential for successful\r\ntransplantation. This is the case in HT, particularly when the\r\ndonor heart is geographically distant from the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\nhospital. The predominant practice has been to accept only\r\norgans from local donors for immunologically sensitized HT\r\ncandidates (candidates with serum antibodies directed against\r\nHLA antigens), so that a prospective donor/recipient\r\ncrossmatch can be performed. The need for a prospective\r\ncrossmatch limits the pool of potential donors, and thus results\r\nin longer waiting times, and higher waiting list mortality\r\nwhile.253-255 As described above, assays that use HLA antigencoated\r\nsolid-phase matrices are capable of identifying HLAspecific\r\nantibodies with high sensitivity and accuracy.\r\n256\r\nThese methods have been used to predict immune\r\ncompatibility between donor and recipient by comparing the\r\npotential recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s HLA-specific antibodies with the HLA\r\ntype of the prospective donor, an approach called the virtual\r\ncrossmatch.257 The use of the virtual crossmatch in kidney\r\nallocation is currently being debated.258, 259 Thus far, in kidney\r\ntransplantation the availability of virtual crossmatch has not\r\neliminated the need for a serologic prospective crossmatch. If\r\nthis demonstrates donor/recipient incompatibility, the organ is\r\nreallocated to a different recipient.257\r\nRecommendations for the Evaluation of\r\nDonor/Recipient Histocompatibility250-253, 255, 256, 259:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Screening PRA should be performed in all HT candidates.\r\nWhen the PRA is elevated (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10\%) further evaluation is\r\nrecommended.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2.

In\r\nthe absence of international standards, each transplant \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 25\r\ncenter must define the threshold of antibody levels used to\r\ndefine which specific donor HLA antigens confer an\r\nunacceptable rejection risk.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n5. The virtual crossmatch, which compares recipient antiHLA\r\nantibody specificities with donor HLA antigens,\r\nshould be routinely used to increase the donor pool for\r\nsensitized recipients.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nRisk-Assessment and Prophylaxis Strategies for\r\nAllosensitized Heart Transplant Candidates\r\nPre-transplant Strategies for Sensitized Patients\r\nSeveral therapeutic regimens have been used to reduce\r\nallosensitization before HT or to treat antibody-mediated\r\nrejection (AMR). These therapies, however, have not been\r\ntested in randomized, controlled clinical trials. The two main\r\nstrategies that have been employed to reduce allosensitization\r\ninclude high-dose IV immunoglobulin (IV Ig) and\r\nplasmapheresis (PP) combined with IV Ig or low-dose CMV\r\nhyperimmune globulin (CMVIg). There are several agents and\r\ninterventions that can augment the potency of these treatment\r\nmodalities, including splenectomy, anti-CD20 antibody\r\ntherapy, and clinically available immunosuppressive\r\nmodalities (Table 2).252\r\nHigh-dose IV Ig\r\nThe initial mechanism of action of IV Ig may be\r\nneutralization/elimination of preformed antibodies by antiidiotypic\r\nantibodies present in IV Ig. The IV Ig is believed to\r\ndiminish circulating antibodies levels, to inhibit B-cell\r\nantibody synthesis and to attenuate complement-mediated\r\nendothelial cell injury. This treatment modality can be used to\r\ndesensitize patients waiting for transplantation or used postoperatively\r\nfor treatment of AMR, is easily administered and\r\nis less expensive than plasmapheresis. Treatment with IV Ig\r\ndoes not uniformly reduce allosensitization, requires\r\nadministration of a large volume of fluid, results in a less rapid\r\nantibody removal than plasmapheresis and effectiveness varies\r\nfrom batch to batch. Its effectiveness has not been proven in\r\nassist support devices\r\n\r\npatients with a high titer of donor specific antibodies. In\r\naddition for a period of time after IV Ig administration donor\r\nspecific antibody levels must be determined with alternative\r\nmethods. The IV Ig is given at a dose of 2 g/kg over 4 hours\r\nand this dose is repeated monthly 4 times.\r\nPlasmapheresis\r\nPlasmapheresis rapidly reduces anti-HLA or isoagglutinin\r\nantibodies levels. This reduction permits immunomodulation\r\nat a lower IV Ig dose and induces donor-specific\r\nunresponsiveness. Plasmapheresis has predictable kinetics, is\r\neffective in patients with high donor-specific antibodies titers,\r\nwhich can be easily monitored during therapy. The long-term\r\neffectiveness of plasmapheresis is limited by the recurrence of\r\ndonor-specific antibodies if transplant does not immediately\r\nfollow this desensitization therapy. Performance of\r\nplasmapheresis requires central access and the procedure is\r\nexpensive.\r\nPlasmapheresis with Low-dose CMVIg\r\nThis procedure may be considered for patients requiring\r\nurgent transplantation both pre-and post-operatively. Each\r\nplasmapheresis session is followed by the administration of\r\nCMVIg at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Inadequate availability of\r\nCMVIg limits the delivery of this therapy.\r\nAnti-CD20 (Rituximab)\r\nThe use of rituximab results in rapid and sustained\r\nablation of the B cell compartment, but it has no effect on\r\nplasma cells or on circulating antibody levels. Rituximab\r\ninhibits CD-20+\r\n B-cells proliferation and induces apoptosis in\r\nthese cells by antibody- and complement-dependent\r\ncytotoxicity. Circulating antibodies levels may be more\r\neffectively reduced when rituximab is combined with\r\nplasmapheresis or IV Ig. Rituximab can be used pre- and postoperatively,\r\nis generally well tolerated and it associated with\r\nlittle toxicity. Rituximab does not eliminate plasma cells in the\r\nspleen and bone marrow, it cannot independently reduce\r\ndonor-specific antibody titers, it may have immunosuppressive\r\neffects which persist for months and it is very costly.\r\nRituximab is given at a dose of 375 mg/m2\r\n weekly for four\r\nweeks and its effects are monitored with the performance of\r\nCD-20+ cell count in the peripheral blood.260 Reconstitution of\r\nnormal B cells typically begins 6 to 9 months after termination\r\nof rituximab.\r\nImmunoabsorption\r\nThis therapy removes IgG 1, 2, and 4 subclasses, but not\r\nthe complement-binding IgG3. Immunoabsorption can be\r\ncarried out pre- and post-operatively and it is effective in\r\npatients with high donor-specific antibodies titers, which can\r\nbe easily monitored during and after therapy. Therapy is\r\ncontinued until IgG and PRA levels have been significantly\r\nreduced compared to baseline. The disadvantages of\r\nimmunosabsorption include a high cost and an increased risk\r\nof infections. This modality is generally not totally effective\r\nwhen used alone.\r\nSplenectomy\r\nSplenectomy, which can now be performed with\r\nminimally invasive techniques, is associated with a reduction\r\nin plasma cells and precursor B cells. It may produce more \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 26\r\neffective antibody reduction when combined with\r\nplasmapheresis or IV Ig. The main limitations of splenectomy\r\nare its inability to independently reduce donor-specific\r\nantibodies titers and the life-long risks of sepsis from\r\nencapsulated bacteria.258\r\nTable 5 Examples of Desensitization Therapies\r\nTherapy Dose Frequency\r\nPlasmapheresis (A, F) 1.5 volume exchanges (A) 5 consecutive days\r\n(B) 5 times, every other day\r\n(C) 2-3 times/week until transplant\r\n(D) 5 times, every other day, every\r\n2-4 weeks\r\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IV\r\nIg)\r\n(A, B) 2g/kg IV divided over 2 days\r\n(C) 2-3 g/kg IV divided over 4 days\r\n(D) 0.1 mg/kg IV\r\n(E) 100 mg/kg IV\r\n(F) 20 g (of 10\% IV Ig)\r\n(G) 150 g (of 10\% IV Ig) divided over 3 rounds\r\n(A) Every 2-4 weeks\r\n(D) Every 2-4 weeks\r\n(E) Every 4 weeks\r\n(G) Every 4 weeks\r\nRituximab (A) 1g IV\r\n(C, E) 375 mg/m2\r\n(G) 500 mg\r\n(A) Weekly x 4\r\n(C) x 2 doses\r\n(E) Weekly x 4\r\n(G) Every 2 weeks\r\nCyclophosphamide\r\n(used in the past)\r\n(A) 1 mg/kg orally\r\n(C) 0.5 mg-g/m2\r\n(D) 1 mg/kg orally\r\n(A) daily\r\n(A) UCLA; (B) Stanford University; (C) University of Maryland; (D) University of Toronto; (E) University of Wisconsin; (F) Loyola\r\nUniversity Chicago; (G) University of Berlin.\r\nAdapted from Kobashigawa J, et al.252\r\nRecommendations for the Risk-Assessment and\r\nProphylaxis Strategies for Allosensitized Heart\r\nTransplant Candidates252, 260:\r\n(See Table 5)\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

The presence of anti-HLA antibodies is\r\nregularly monitored in allosensitized patients undergoing\r\ndesensitizing therapies until a compatible heart allograft\r\nbecomes available.250 In ambulatory, non-sensitized HT\r\nassist support devices\r\ncandidates, it is reasonable to screen for anti-HLA antibodies\r\nevery 6 months. In HT candidates requiring blood\r\ntransfusions, anti-HLA antibody level determination should be\r\nrepeated 2 to 4 weeks later and prospective donor recipient\r\ncrossmatch is required if a suitable donor organ becomes\r\navailable in the interim period. No uniform recommendations\r\nexist as to the frequency of antibody monitoring after an\r\ninfection or during MCS (Table 3).\r\nAs stated in the section pertaining to desensitization\r\ntherapies, circulating immunoglobulins are measured before\r\nand after immunoabsorption and plasmapheresis, and\r\nlymphocyte subpopulations before and after the use of\r\nrituximab.\r\nIn addition to the post-operative retrospective crossmatch,\r\ndonor-specific antibodies levels should be obtained when\r\nAMR is suspected or confirmed by EMB.\r\nAlthough some reports suggest a correlation between\r\nincreased levels of soluble HLA class I molecules (sHLA-I)\r\nand HT rejection, their determination is not routinely done in\r\nthe clinical setting.261\r\nMeasurement of donor-specific antibodies level should be\r\ndone if the finding of positive C4D staining in EMB tissue\r\nsuggests the presence of AMR.261 In addition, monitoring\r\ndonor-specific class I and class II HLA antibodies after\r\ntransplantation has been used as a diagnostic/prognostic tool\r\nfor AMR.254, 258\r\nRecommendations for Monitoring of\r\nAllosensitization Status of Heart Transplant\r\nCandidates and Recipients250, 252, 260:\r\n(Table 6)\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1.

It is characterized by a cytotoxic\r\ncomplement mediated antibody reaction and most often occurs\r\nin the setting of preformed antibodies directed against epitopes\r\nof the HLA system or ABO system. Allosensitized patients\r\nwho are sensitized may avoid hyperacute rejection by\r\ndesensitization strategies (described above) and, most\r\ncommonly, by acceptance only of donors with Ã¢â‚¬Å“acceptable\r\nantigensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and/or low level or Ã¢â‚¬Å“weakÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ antibody responses.\r\nDespite manoeuvres to avoid hyperacute rejection sensitized\r\nrecipients have a lower survival than those with PRA < 10\%\r\nand appear to experience delayed AMR associated with\r\nelevated titers of donor specific antibodies.252\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 28\r\nTable 6 Panel-Reactive Antibody Screening Frequency After Original Assessment\r\nNumber of heart transplant centers screening at each interval\r\nPRA 1 mon 2 mon 3 mon 4-6 mon 1 year Variable SE Other Total\r\nNegative 10 2 8 16 7 4 16 2 65\r\nPositive 33 8 6 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . 65\r\nPRA, panel-reactive antibody; SE, sensitizing events.\r\nAdapted from Betkowski AS, et al.250\r\nAcute AMR is observed in allosensitized patients and is\r\nassociated with inferior HT survival. The incidence may be up\r\nto 15\% in the first year after HT and the clinical presentation\r\nhas no pathognomonic features. Histological features include\r\nmyocardial capillary injury with endothelial-cell swelling and\r\nintravascular macrophage accumulation. If these pathologic\r\nabnormalities occur in the presence of unexplained HT\r\ndysfunction, with or without symptoms of hemodynamic\r\ncompromise, immunostaining can be performed to look for\r\ncapillary deposition of immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM and/or\r\nIgA) plus complement (C3d, C4d and/or C1q) by\r\nimmunofluorescence on frozen sections, CD68 staining of\r\nmacrophages within capillaries (CD31- or CD34-positive) by\r\nimmunohistochemistry, and C4d staining of capillaries by\r\nparaffin immunohistochemistry.262\r\nIt is recommended that patients with hemodynamic\r\ncompromise undergo assessment for circulating antibodies.\r\nAlthough screening is not currently advocated, every EMB\r\nshould undergo histologic evaluation for features suggestive of\r\nAMR. If these are seen, the diagnosis of AMR should be\r\nconfirmed via immunohistochemistry, either\r\nimmunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase, using antibodies\r\ndirected against CD68, CD31, and C4d, and a serum sample\r\nshould be tested for donor-specific antibodies. If these markers\r\nare positive, a diagnosis of AMR can be made. Patients who\r\nhave several episodes of documented AMR should be\r\nevaluated with at least 1 of these immunohistochemical\r\nmethods in each EMB and monitored for the production of\r\ndonor-specific antibodies. It is also recognized that acute\r\ncellular rejection and AMR can co-exist, but further studies\r\nare needed to determine the frequency and clinical\r\nsignificance of this finding.262\r\nTreatment of Antibody-mediated Rejection\r\nRecommendations for the Treatment of AntibodyMediated\r\nRejection252, 263:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

Changes in therapy that can be considered for\r\nmaintenance immunosuppression in patients who\r\nexperience AMR can include switch to tacrolimus (TAC)\r\nin patients receiving cyclosporine (CYA)-based\r\nimmunosuppression, increased doses of mycophenolate\r\nmofetil (MMF) and CS.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nAllosensitization in Pediatric Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients\r\nThe frequency of HLA sensitization is increasing in the\r\npediatric population due to the greater number of patients with\r\ncomplex congenital heart disease undergoing palliative\r\nsurgical procedures with exposure to blood products and\r\nvalved or non-valved allograft materials. These can induce a\r\nstrong HLA class I and class II antibody response that can\r\npersist for up to 8 years after allograft implantation.242, 264, 265\r\nIn addition, the increasing application of pediatric MCS\r\ntechnology for end-stage heart failure has led to an\r\nunprecedented occurrence of allosensitization in children with\r\ncardiomyopathy.243\r\nThe requirement of a negative prospective crossmatch in\r\ncritically ill children can negatively impact survival because it\r\ninevitably prolongs the waiting time for a donor organ. A\r\nretrospective analysis of HT candidates since 1990 (n=252),\r\nfor which CDC allo-antibodies data were available,\r\ndemonstrated that allosensitization influences both pre- and\r\npost-HT outcomes.244 Of 252 subjects, 38 (15\%) had preoperative\r\nallosensitization, defined as a PRA > 10\%. At 1 year\r\nafter listing, sensitized subjects had a hgher mortality than\r\nnon-sensitized subjects (22\% vs. 8.4\% p=0.055). Survival at\r\nall time points after listing (regardless of transplantation) was\r\nworse for sensitized subjects (p = 0.04).\r\nAlthough no statistically significant differences in postoperative\r\ngraft or patient survival were noted, allosensitization \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 29\r\nbefore HT was associated with decreased freedom from CAV\r\n(hazard ratio 2.76, 95\% confidence interval 1.18 to 6.45;\r\np = 0.019). Because of the high wait-list mortality for\r\nsensitized pediatric HT recipients, protocols for peri-operative\r\nantibody removal without a prospective crossmatch have been\r\ndeveloped and utilized in some centers with reasonable\r\nsuccess. In 31 pediatric procedures, HT recipients with a\r\npositive CDC crossmatch, the median B- and T-cell PRA\r\nwere, respectively, 76\% and 52\%. Almost 50\% of the\r\nrecipients were older than 1 year of age at HT. Therapies in\r\nmost cases were intra-operative plasma exchange/\r\nplasmapheresis, post-HT plasmapheresis, and drug therapy\r\nusing TAC, MMF, CS, and IV Ig. Survival rates at 1 year\r\nwere 84\%, and probability of survival at 3 and 5 years were,\r\nrespectively, 79\%, and 70\%, similar to the overall US\r\ntransplant survival rates (www.unos.org). More than 70\% of\r\nthe subjects experienced acute rejection events. However, the\r\nfrequency of rejection with hemodynamic compromise varied\r\nwidely (0-60\%) between centers. Most acute rejection\r\nepisodes developed early, and C4d or C3d positivity generally\r\ndisappeared after the first few months. Evaluation of incidence\r\nof CAV is ongoing, but survivors have normal graft function.\r\nAge did not influence outcomes.245, 266\r\nData on the impact of desensitization strategies are even\r\nmore limited in the pediatric than in the adult population.\r\nResults of desensitization procedures in children remain\r\ninconclusive, because antigenic stimuli, such as devices and\r\nallograft materials remain in place during therapy. Given the\r\ninability to predict the timing of donor organ availability, the\r\npotential morbidities associated with the available\r\ndesensitization therapies and the acceptable intermediate\r\noutcomes of HT despite a positive crossmatch, most centers\r\ndo not practice desensitization strategies in highly sensitized\r\npediatric patients.\r\nRecommendations for the Approach to\r\nAllosensitization in Pediatric Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients244, 245, 266:\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1.

This small\r\npool has provided compelling motivation to challenge\r\nprevious mandates against the usage of certain donors, such as\r\nthose of incompatible blood groups.267\r\nAmong potential HT candidates, infants are particularly\r\nsuited for this approach because of an immature immune\r\nsystem that precludes T-cell independent responses.268 Taking\r\nadvantage of this natural lag in immune responsiveness, the\r\nToronto group reported a protocol in which infants\r\nintentionally received ABO-incompatible heart allografts.\r\nNone of the infants received aggressive pre-operative\r\nimmunosuppression for antibody removal, and those who had\r\npositive antibody titers underwent plasma exchange using the\r\nCPB circuit at the time of HT. Short-term outcomes were\r\nexcellent, without a single patient developing hyperacute\r\nrejection.269 Since the original report, centers have\r\nincreasingly adopted the practice of ABO-incompatible HT\r\nwith short-term results similar to those of the original Toronto\r\ncohort.270-275 At the present time, intermediate-term results\r\nappear equivalent to those reported for ABO compatible\r\npediatric HT recipients.271, 276\r\nThe safety and feasibility of pediatric ABO-incompatible\r\nHT with the use of intra-operative plasma exchange has been\r\nestablished.269 This strategy improved the likelihood of HT\r\nand reduced infant waiting list mortality.271, 275, 277 These data\r\nled to a UNOS policy change in September 2006 allowing the\r\nlisting for HT of infants across the ABO blood group\r\nbarrier.278\r\nFor neonates and infants undergoing ABO-incompatible\r\nHT, in addition to the routine peri-operative management,\r\nfurther attention must be paid to issues related to blood\r\nproduct transfusion. Every effort must be made to avoid blood\r\nproducts that may contain donor-specific antibodies, as this\r\nmay lead to AMR.\r\nPatient Selection\r\nassist support devices\r\nSuitability for ABO-incompatible HT is ultimately based\r\non the stage of immunologic maturation of the candidate at the\r\ntime of evaluation. While age may correlate with the time of\r\ndevelopment of isohemagglutins, it is the titers of these\r\nantibodies that become critical in patient selection. There are\r\nseveral reports in the literature of successful ABO-\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 30\r\nincompatible HT beyond the infancy period in patients who\r\nwere 2, 3.5, and 5 years of age and who lacked\r\nisohemagglutinins.270, 279 However, age itself is clearly not the\r\nprimary risk indicator, and serves only as a surrogate marker\r\nfor an individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to produce isohemagglutinins. Even\r\nfor infants who have begun to produce isohemagglutinins, the\r\nabsolute titer above which HT is contraindicated remains\r\nunclear. Successful HT even in children with donor-specific\r\nisohemagglutinin titers as high as 1:64 has been reported.271\r\nFive patients in the Toronto cohort with pre-operative\r\nisohemagglutinin titers ranging from 1:8 to 1:128 underwent\r\nsuccessful HT without AMR and minimal re-accumulation of\r\nanti-donor antibodies after HT. Therefore, the absolute upper\r\nlimit of age or isohemagglutinin titers remain unclear.\r\nRecommendations for the Selection of Candidates\r\nfor ABO Ã¢â‚¬Å“IncompatibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Heart Transplant269, 271:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

The CPB circuit is\r\nprimed with plasma as appropriate for the particular donorrecipient\r\nblood group combination (Table 7). Approximately 2\r\nto 3 times the total body plasma volume is exchanged during\r\nthe initiation of CPB to remove donor-specific\r\nisohemagglutinins, which are remeasured before the release of\r\nthe aortic cross-clamp to ensure a negative or low donorspecific\r\ntiter (<1:4). With the utilization of pre-operative\r\nplasma exchange, there have been no reported cases of\r\nhyperacute rejection.\r\nRecommendation for the Intra-operative Care of\r\nABO Ã¢â‚¬Å“IncompatibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Heart Transplant Recipients269,\r\n271:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

In the\r\nshort-term, most patients do not develop rising titers of\r\nisohemagglutinins. In the few that do, concern and/or evidence\r\nfor AMR have been very rare. In the 2 patients with reported\r\nAMR in the Toronto cohort, management similar to that of the\r\nsensitized population with a course of plasmapheresis and\r\naugmentation of immunosuppression was successful.276, 278\r\nRecommendations for the Monitoring of\r\nIsohemagglutinin Levels in ABO Ã¢â‚¬Å“IncompatibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\r\nHeart Transplant Recipients269, 277:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

It is estimated that blood transfusions are needed in\r\n80\% of all cardiac surgery patients. Nearly 15\% of all blood\r\nproducts in the US are used in association with cardiac\r\nsurgery.284, 285 Of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 20\%\r\nare prone to peri-operative hemostatic abnormalities that\r\nrequire surgical revision in 2\% to 6\% of all patients.286-289\r\nassist support devices\r\nCardiac surgery-related factors that contribute to\r\ncoagulopathies include platelet consumption and dysfunction,\r\nhemodilution with consumption of clotting factors,\r\nhypothermia, activation of the inflammatory cascade, and\r\nfibrinolysis.290 Different studies consistently find advanced\r\nage, increased pre-operative sCr level, small body surface\r\narea, emergency surgery, low temperature during CPB,\r\nassist support devices\r\nduration of extracorporeal circulation (> 150 minutes),\r\ncombined valvular revascularization surgery, number of\r\nbypass grafts (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5), reoperative surgery, and pre-operative\r\nantiplatelet therapy to be risk factors for bleeding in cardiac\r\nsurgery.285, 286, 289, 291-293\r\nCoagulopathy in Heart Transplantation\r\nHT recipients have additional risk factors for perioperative\r\nbleeding including recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coagulopathy, need\r\nfor repeat median sternotomy, and a prolonged CPB.294\r\nVarious factors contribute to a recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coagulopathy. First,\r\nmany patients are on anticoagulation pre-operatively for poor\r\nLV function, AF, mechanical valves, or MCS. In the pediatric\r\npopulation, patients with complex congenital heart disease\r\nafter multiple corrective procedures with or without allograft\r\nmaterial, patients being transplanted from ECMO, and\r\nchronically cyanotic patients with extensive collaterals are\r\noften very challenging in terms of peri-operative hemostasis.\r\nHepatic or renal dysfunction associated with heart failure can\r\nalso contribute to coagulopathies. Amiodarone-treated HT\r\nrecipients have greater peri-operative bleeding.295 Many HT\r\nrecipients have greater bleeding because native heart\r\nexplantation is complicated by adhesions due to prior\r\nsurgeries.\r\nAs therapies for advanced heart failure evolve, a greater\r\nnumber of patients receive MCS as a bridge to HT. With the\r\nexception of the Jarvik VAD which is placed through a\r\nthoracotomy, most VADs are implanted through a sternotomy\r\nand the resulting scarring remains a major source of HT\r\nsurgical bleeding. In addition, except for patients with the\r\nHeartMate XVE, recipients of MCS require warfarin\r\nanticoagulation, which is intensified if VAD-related clotting\r\nproblems occur. However, in some retrospective studies, the\r\nuse of warfarin has not been shown to increase the risk of\r\noperative bleeding.296\r\nCoagulation\r\nBleeding in cardiac surgery can be broadly divided into 2\r\ncategories: surgical bleeding (at an anastomotic site, from a\r\nvessel, or at a suture line) or non-surgical bleeding\r\n(coagulopathy). This review is mainly focused on non-surgical\r\nbleeding. Hemostasis has been described in detail\r\nelsewhere.297, 298 Briefly, the coagulation cascade consists of\r\nan extrinsic system activated by a tissue factor\r\n(thromboplastin), an intrinsic system activated by contact with\r\nsurfaces, and a common pathway. The complexity of the\r\ncoagulation cascade is further enhanced by the discoveries of \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 33\r\ntissue factor expressing cells and platelets in a hemostatic\r\nprocess that include initiation, amplification and\r\npropagation.299 From the initial steps of homeostasis, both\r\nplatelets and coagulation activation are amplified. Thrombin is\r\na key activator of clotting through pathways that include\r\nplatelet activation and the formation of a fibrin clot as well as\r\nthe clot dissolving aspect with thrombomodulin and the\r\nrelease of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The final\r\nproduct of this cascade is thrombus at the site of vascular\r\ninjury, limitation of clot propagation, and a time delayed\r\nprocess of vessel recanalization.\r\nCoagulopathy With Cardiopulmonary Bypass\r\nIn cardiac surgery, the use of the extracorporeal surface of\r\nthe CPB circuit disrupts the normal homeostatic mechanisms\r\nthat maintain blood fluidity. During extracorporeal circulation,\r\na decrease of coagulation factors and platelets as well as an\r\nactivation of fibrinolysis is observed. First, the hemodilution\r\ncaused by priming of the extracorporeal circuit can contribute\r\nto this decrease. Further, there is activation and denaturation\r\nof these coagulant proteins by the artificial surfaces.\r\nThrombin, which is continuously generated during CPB, can\r\nbe measured intra-operatively despite administration of high\r\nheparin doses being administered.300-302 Platelets are activated\r\nby the thrombin, fibrinogen bound to the circuit, and the shear\r\nforces of contacting the surface. In addition, the circuit has no\r\nendothelial cells that normally continuously suppress platelets\r\nactivation. With activation during CPB, platelets become\r\nrefractory to subsequent stimuli and are dysfunctional after\r\nCPB.303-305 Approaches to reduce platelet activation include\r\ncontrolled use of suction, avoidance of air bubbles, and use of\r\nheparin-coated bypass materials or more biocompatible\r\nextracorporeal circuits. Further, pro-inflammatory proteins\r\nsuch as kallikrein and complement also become activated by\r\nthe extracorporeal circuit, which leads to the activation of\r\nleucocytes, endothelial cells and the systemic release of\r\ncytokines. This cascade results in inflammation that promotes\r\nabnormal hemostasis and increases the risk of multi-organ\r\nfailure.306\r\nFibrinolysis, also activated by CPB, ceases with\r\ndiscontinuation of the circuit. Perhaps increased fibrinolysis is\r\ninduced by the coagulation factors via activation of factor XII\r\nand thrombin which in turn stimulate the release of tissue\r\nplasminogen activator from the endothelium.\r\nHypothermia can also alter the clotting mechanisms.\r\nChanges in platelet aggregation in patients undergoing\r\nhypothermic CPB at 27Ã‚Â°C to 28Ã‚Â°C have been seen.307-309\r\nassist support devices\r\nConventional tests of the hemostatic mechanisms are done at\r\n37 C, which limits the detection of some of the clotting defects\r\nduring hypothermia.\r\nThus, IV heparin is used to prevent the catastrophic\r\nclotting that can occur in an extracorporeal circuit. Heparin is\r\na heterogeneous glycosaminoglycan closely related to the\r\nendogenous heparan present on the surface of endothelial cells\r\nand in the extracellular matrix. This compound binds to\r\nantithrombin with high affinity. This complex results in a\r\nthousand-fold increase in binding affinity to thrombin and\r\nfactor Xa.310 High-dose heparin (300 to 400 U/kg) is routinely\r\nused to anticoagulate patients before initiation of CPB.\r\nHeparin dosing has been empirically established from the\r\nactivated clotting time (ACT) as the dose at which clotting no\r\nlonger occurs in the circuitry.311 Thus, many surgical teams\r\nstrive to keep an ACT > 400 seconds even though lower levels\r\nmay be effective.312 The main advantage of heparin is that its\r\nanticoagulant effects can be reversed with the use of\r\nprotamine, which combines with heparin into a complex\r\ndevoid of anticoagulant effects. The efficacy is dependent on\r\nthe heparin-protamine ratio of 1:1 to 1:3. High doses of\r\nprotamine can cause inhibition of coagulation and platelet\r\naggregation and can paradoxically increase the risk of\r\nbleeding.313 In addition, rapid injection of protamine can cause\r\nhistamine release and hypotension. It can also produce lifethreatening\r\npulmonary hypertension. Thus, minimization of\r\nprotamine dosage is preferred. The ACT is used to gauge\r\nreversal of heparin effects. The goal is usually to achieve a\r\nlevel < 130 seconds or within 10\% of the pre-CPB value.\r\nTesting to Evaluate Hemostasis in Cardiac Surgery\r\nPre-operative evaluation of hemostasis must include\r\nknowledge of the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s renal and hepatic function and\r\ntreatment with platelet inhibitors and oral anticoagulants. Preoperative\r\nevaluation should include determination of the\r\nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin\r\ntime (PT).314 This evaluation, however, falls short of\r\naccurately predicting the risk of bleeding with cardiac\r\nsurgery315, 316 and of detecting defects of primary hemostasis,\r\nsuch as von Willebrand disease and platelet dysfunction.286\r\nAt a minimum, intra-operative assessment of hemostasis\r\nshould include measurement of ACT due to its ability to\r\nmonitor high heparin concentrations used during CPB.\r\nLimitations of ACT testing include variability of\r\ncommercially available devices and alterations in values with\r\nthe administration of aprotinin. The use of\r\nthromboelastography, which measures the physical strength of\r\nthe fibrin clot during the coagulation process, has been shown\r\nto improve diagnosis of intra-operative bleeding and to reduce\r\nthe need for blood transfusions.317-320 However, pre-operative \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 34\r\nthromboelastography has limited ability to predict blood loss\r\nduring cardiac surgery.\r\nPlatelet function is the other important determinant of\r\noperative bleeding. Platelet counts > 100,000/uL are generally\r\nconsidered adequate for surgical hemostasis. Although platelet\r\naggregometry is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“gold-standardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ test of platelet function,\r\neasier point of care assays, such as the one using the platelet\r\nfunction analyzer-100 (PFA-100) are typically employed\r\nduring cardiac surgery. In these assays, whole blood is used to\r\ntest the time required for platelets to plug a hole in a collagencoated\r\ncartridge through which blood is forced to flow. The\r\nability of these assays to predict the risk of intra-operative\r\nbleeding is uncertain.319, 321, 322\r\nTests of fibrinolysis include fibrinogen levels and Ddimer\r\nvalues. Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin in\r\nroute to becoming a clot. Levels can be directly measured,\r\nwith normal values being in the range of 150 to 400 mg/dL. A\r\nfibrinogen level > 100 mg/dL is adequate for hemostasis.\r\nFibrinolysis is a process in which plasmin cleaves cross-linked\r\nfibrin to produce dimeric units (D-dimer). Values of D-dimer\r\nvalues correlate with the level of fibrinolysis present in the\r\nsurgical patient and with the risk of bleeding after cardiac\r\nsurgery.323\r\nMost tests of hemostasis have not been evaluated in\r\nrandomized clinical trials. Assay values considered significant\r\nare derived from clinical bleeding but not specifically from\r\nthat occurring during cardiac surgery.\r\nRecommendations for the Evaluation of Hemostasis\r\nin Heart Transplant Recipients314:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

Fibrinogen levels and D-Dimer values should be\r\nmeasured post-operatively because these are tests of\r\nfibrinolysis and correlate with the risk of bleeding after\r\nHT surgery.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n4. Thromboelastography may be repeated after HT surgery\r\nto monitor patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hemostasis.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nReversal of Anticoagulation before Heart\r\nTransplantation\r\nIn patients chronically anticoagulated with warfarin\r\nundergoing cardiac surgery, including HT, the risk of bleeding\r\nis likely to be increased when the international normalized\r\nratio (INR) is Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1.5. Therefore, it is reasonable to reduce the\r\nINR to this level at the time of surgery.324 Several therapies\r\nare available for the reversal of oral anticoagulation, and these\r\ninclude oral or IV vitamin K, human fresh frozen plasma\r\n(FFP), prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), and\r\nrecombinant active factor VII (rFVIIa).325 Vitamin K alone is\r\ninappropriate if rapid normalization of the INR is required,\r\nbecause the onset of action is 4 to 6 hours after IV\r\nadministration and at least 24 hours after oral\r\nadministration.324 Therefore, when rapid reversal of warfarin\r\nis needed, vitamin K at doses of 2.5 to 5 mg should be\r\nadministered IV in conjunction with FFP, PCCs, or rFVIIa.325\r\nThe PCCs are concentrates of essential coagulation\r\nfactors, often including factors II, VII, IX, and X.326 Whereas\r\nin the US, PCCs and rFVII are not approved by the FDA for\r\nreversal of anticoagulation, in Europe these substances are\r\napproved specifically for this indication. The PCCs are\r\nappropriate for emergency reversal of oral anticoagulation\r\nbecause of their rapid onset of action. A dose of 500 U\r\n(typically approximately 7 U/kg) is effective for rapid\r\ncorrection of an INR < 5, but higher doses (up to 50 U/Kg)\r\nmay be necessary in patients with INR values above this\r\nlevel.327\r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 35\r\nComparative studies have demonstrated that PCCs are\r\nmore effective than FFP for correcting patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ INRs. In one\r\nsuch study, the mean post-treatment and lowest INR values in\r\npatients receiving 4 units of FFP were, respectively 2.3 and\r\n1.6, compared with 1.3 in patients receiving PCC at a dose of\r\n25 to 50 U/kg.328-332 Also, post-treatment levels of factor IX\r\nwere much lower in the FFP group than in the PCC group (19\r\nvs. 68.5 U/dL). Similarly, in a second study, only 1 of 6\r\npatients receiving 4 units of FFP achieved a safe INR level <\r\n1.5, compared with 5 of 6 patients receiving PCC (50 U/kg).325\r\nIn this study, the mean correction time was 41 minutes with\r\nPCC, significantly shorter than the 115 minutes observed with\r\nFFP. The time required for INR correction was reported to be\r\n4 to 5 times shorter with PCC. Another advantage of PCCs\r\nover human plasma is that smaller volumes of PCCs are\r\nrequired to reverse anticoagulation, because the concentration\r\nof clotting factors in PCCs is approximately 25 times higher\r\nthan that in human plasma.326, 332 Although human plasma is\r\noften administered at doses approximately 15 mL/kg, double\r\nhuman plasma doses or 2.4 L in an 80-kg patient, are required\r\nto reverse anticoagulation in critically ill patients.325 In\r\ncontrast to FFP, recommended doses of PCC can be delivered\r\nat a volume of 1 to 2 mL/kg. With PCCs the smaller volumes\r\nminimize the risk of worsening fluid overload and shorten\r\ninfusion time.325 Compared to FFP, PCCs can be prepared\r\nfaster, can be stored at room temperature, avoiding the need\r\nfor thawing and warming, and do not require crossmatching\r\nbefore administration. Thus the time from patient presentation\r\nto correction of INR is much shorter with PCCs than with FFP\r\n(15 min vs. 1-2 hr).326 The PCCs may also be associated with\r\nlower risks of viral or prion contamination and of transfusionrelated\r\nacute lung injury (TRALI), a major cause of death after\r\ntransfusion.325 The PCCs have been associated with a modest\r\nrisk of thrombogenic events.\r\nAlthough preliminary studies have demonstrated the\r\nsafety and efficacy of rFVIIa for anticoagulation reversal, this\r\nmodality is not yet approved in either the US or Europe.\r\nAdvantages of rFVIIa over FFP are similar to those of PCCs,\r\nincluding low infusion volume and rapid administration time,\r\nbut comparative studies are lacking.325, 333\r\nRecommendations for the Reversal of\r\nAnticoagulation before Heart Transplantation324, 326,\r\n328, 332:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Pre-operatively, the INR should be reduced to Ã¢â€°Â¤ 1.5.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Low doses of vitamin K (2.5-5.0 mg) given IV are\r\npreferable to high doses because they are associated with\r\na lower risk of anaphylaxis.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n3. Given the need for rapid normalization of the INR,\r\nchronically anticoagulated patients about to undergo HT\r\nshould receive vitamin K in conjunction with FFP, PCCs,\r\nor rFVII depending on their availability and the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\nrenal and hepatic functions.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPeri-operative Management of Heart Transplant\r\nassist support devices\r\nRecipients with Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia\r\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immunemediated\r\ndisorder characterized by the formation of antibodies\r\nagainst the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. The frequency\r\nof HIT ranges from 0.2\% to 5.0\% in patients exposed to\r\nheparin for more than 4 days. In addition to duration of\r\ntherapy, the 3 factors most strongly associated with the\r\ndevelopment of HIT include use of unfractionated rather than\r\nlow-molecular-weight heparin, surgical rather than medical\r\nsetting, and female gender.334\r\nassist support devices\r\nThere are a number of anticoagulants that can be used\r\ninstead of heparin in patients with HIT including a direct\r\nthrombin inhibitor such as lepirudin (recombinant hirudin),\r\nbivalirudin, or argatroban; or danaparoid. To date, no\r\nprospective randomized studies have compared the relative\r\nefficacy and toxicity of the available agents. However,\r\nbecause of their different modes of excretion and inactivation,\r\npatients with HIT and renal insufficiency are usually treated\r\nwith argatroban, whereas those with hepatic impairment are\r\ntypically given lepirudin.\r\nLepirudin (RefludanÃ‚Â®) is a recombinant hirudin approved\r\nby the FDA for the treatment of HIT complicated by\r\nthrombosis. A starting dose of lepirudin Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.10 mg/kg/hr has\r\nbeen recommended in patients with serum creatinine < 1\r\nmg/dL. Because the drug undergoes renal clearance and\r\nanticoagulant effect is not easily reversed, doses must be\r\ndecreased in patients with renal insufficiency and the aPTT\r\nmust be closely monitored to avoid drug accumulation.335\r\nBivalirudin (Angiomax), a hemodialyzable direct\r\nthrombin inhibitor and hirudin analog has been successfully\r\nemployed in patients with HIT, with reduced doses safely\r\nemployed in patients with combined hepatic and renal failure.\r\nIt is approved by the FDA for patients with, or at risk of, HIT\r\nwho are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The\r\nrecommended initial dose of bivalirudin for HIT is\r\napproximately 0.15 mg/kg/hour, adjusted to achieve an aPTT \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 36\r\nof 1.5 to 2.5 times the baseline value. Doses of 0.14\r\nmg/kg/hour in patients with hepatic dysfunction and 0.03 to\r\n0.05 mg/kg/hour in patients with renal or combined hepatic\r\nand renal dysfunction have been successfully employed. The\r\ndevelopment of anti-hirudin antibody formation can occur\r\nwith longer treatment.\r\nArgatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor with a short in\r\nvivo plasma half-life of 24 minutes; and its effect is monitored\r\nby the aPTT. In patients with normal hepatic function, the\r\nstandard starting dose is 2 Ã‚Âµg/kg/min by continuous IV\r\ninfusion, adjusted to maintain the aPTT at 1.5 to 3 times the\r\nbaseline value. Due to hepatobiliary elimination, a lower\r\nstarting dose (0.5-1.2 Ã‚Âµg/kg/min) is appropriate in patients\r\nwith hepatic dysfunction, combined hepatic/renal dysfunction,\r\nheart failure, or anasarca.335 In such patients, the aPTT should\r\nbe checked at 4-hour intervals after drug initiation or dose\r\nchange to ensure that the desired level of anticoagulation is\r\npresent. An even lower starting dose of argatroban (0.2\r\nÃ‚Âµg/kg/min) may be appropriate in critically ill patients with\r\nmultiple organ dysfunction and HIT.335\r\nDanaparoid (OrgaranÃ‚Â®) is a heparinoid that includes\r\npredominantly dermatan sulfate and low-sulfated heparan\r\nsulfate. It is available in many countries but not in the US.\r\nIt has been given to patients with HIT or a history of HIT\r\nwho require CPB. The recommended dose includes an initial\r\nIV bolus of 2250 U, modified up or down according to body\r\nweight, followed by an IV infusion of 400 U/hr for 4 hours,\r\n300 U/hr for the next 4 hours, and 200 U/hr thereafter. Doses\r\nare adjusted to achieve anti-Xa levels of 0.5 to 0.8 U/mL.\r\nDisadvantages of danaparoid include the need to measure antifactor\r\nXa levels, its long half-life (25 Ã‚Â± 100 h), renal\r\nelimination, and the absence of an antidote.335\r\nOther approaches, including plasmapheresis, are not\r\neffective for the treatment of HIT and should not be used in\r\nplace of the compounds described above.\r\nPatients with a history of HIT who require CPB have been\r\nsuccessfully anticoagulated with a brief course of\r\nunfractionated heparin without complications. This approach\r\nis based on the theory that a secondary immune response after\r\nre-exposure to heparin is unlikely to occur until at least 3 days\r\nlater. Thus, a brief exposure to heparin during CPB should not\r\nimmediately elicit HIT antibodies. Furthermore, because\r\nheparin is rapidly cleared after the procedure, even if\r\nantibodies appeared, they would not be thrombogenic in the\r\nabsence of heparin. In a report of 3 patients with HIT\r\nrequiring urgent HT, re-exposure to unfractionated heparin in\r\nthe absence of heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA)\r\nwas uneventful.336 Heparin was discontinued and a direct\r\nthrombin inhibitor (agatroban or lepirudin) was used for a few\r\nhours post-operatively in all 3 cases to prevent recurrence of\r\nthrombosis due to the re-exposure to heparin. Another report\r\nyielded similar results.337\r\nRecommendations for Anticoagulation in Heart\r\nTransplant Recipients335-337:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. The absence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies should\r\nbe confirmed.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. The use of unfractionated heparin should be restricted to\r\nthe operative procedure itself. Low molecular weight\r\nheparin is not recommended, due to a longer half-life than\r\nunfractionated heparin and the inability to fully reverse its\r\neffect with protamine.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n3. Alternative anticoagulants can be used pre- and postoperatively\r\nin patients with history of HIT in whom the\r\nplatelet count has recovered but IgG antibodies to the\r\nplatelet factor 4/heparin complex are still present.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n4. Patients with abnormal hepatic and normal renal function\r\ncan be treated with lepirudin, danaparoid, or\r\nfondaparinux, while those with abnormal renal and\r\nnormal hepatic function can receive argatroban at\r\nstandard doses or lepirudin at reduced doses.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n5. Patients with both renal and hepatic dysfunction can be\r\ntreated with argatroban or bivalirudin at reduced doses.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nPharmacologic Management of Bleeding\r\nAprotinin\r\nAprotinin is a potent inhibitor of the serine proteases\r\nincluding plasmin, thrombin, kallikrein, and activated protein\r\nC. The safety and efficacy of aprotinin in reducing bleeding\r\nduring cardiac surgery has been demonstrated in several metaanalyses\r\nbut has not been tested in large-scale randomized\r\ntrials.338-341 In a cohort of HT recipients, aprotinin was found\r\nto significantly reduce bleeding in those with previous\r\nsternotomies but not in patients without prior surgeries.294 In\r\naddition,342, 343 a recent large observational study has shown an\r\nincreased risk of renal failure, myocardial infarction or heart\r\nfailure, and stroke or encephalopathy with the use of aprotinin\r\nin heart surgery patients.344 The results of this study triggered \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 37\r\na FDA warning regarding the risks of aprotinin. This drug\r\nshould not be used in HT surgery.\r\nTranexamic Acid and Epsilon-aminocaproic Acid\r\nTranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid are lysine\r\nanalogues with antifibrinolytic activity. Both agents\r\ncompetitively inhibit the binding of plasmin to fibrinogen and\r\nt-PA to plasmin via lysine recognition sites required for\r\nfibrinolysis. Tranexamic acid is almost 10 times more potent\r\nthan epsilon-aminocaproic acid.345 In contrast to aprotinin,\r\nneither agent is associated with an increased risk of end-organ\r\ndamage.344, 346, 347 Epsilon-aminocaproic acid has been\r\ncompared to aprotinin and found to have similar efficacy.340\r\nLysine analogues are indicated for the treatment of bleeding in\r\na number of conditions but are not approved by the FDA for\r\nassist support devices\r\nuse in CPB despite evidence that their administration before\r\nCPB is associated with a 30\% reduction in bleeding and blood\r\ntransfusion requirement.348-351 Epsilon-aminocaproic acid is\r\ngiven as a loading dose of 75 to 150 mg/kg at the beginning of\r\nsurgery followed by a continuous infusion at 10 to 15\r\nmg/kg/hr. The dosage of tranexamic acid is 1/10 of epsilonaminoproic\r\nacid.\r\nDesmopressin\r\nDesmopressin, a vasopressin analogue with minimal\r\nvasopressor activity, stimulates the release of factors VIII:C\r\nand von Willebrand from the endothelium. Desmopressin only\r\nmodestly reduces bleeding and its use is not routinely\r\nrecommended.339, 352, 353\r\nassist support devices\r\nTransfusion Strategies for Bleeding\r\nAppropriate levels of coagulation factors are necessary\r\nfor adequate surgical hemostasis. FFP administration should\r\nbe guided by coagulation tests and measured deficiencies.340\r\nNo evidence exists for the prophylactic use of FFP to prevent\r\nbleeding.341 Goals of FFP administration should be to achieve\r\n1.5 times the control mean of both the prothrombin time and\r\nthe aPTT.342 Fibrinogen infusion is also important in massive\r\nbleeding. Levels drop with massive bleeding and subsequent\r\nred cell transfusions. Substitution should be done to maintain a\r\nlevel higher than 1 g/L.342\r\nAlthough platelet transfusions are common in cardiac\r\nsurgery, few randomized trials support their routine use.\r\nGuidelines support the use of platelet transfusion when there is\r\nclinical evidence of microvascular bleeding in conjunction\r\nwith excessive blood loss.343 A transfusion threshold of\r\n50,000/uL is generally recommended.342 Prophylactic platelet\r\ntransfusions during cardiac surgery are not useful in\r\npreventing bleeding and may be associated with an increase in\r\npulmonary vascular resistance.344\r\nRecombinant FVIIa is not approved for bleeding during\r\ncardiac surgery, although case reports and small series have\r\nshown some efficacy in cases of excessive or refractory\r\nbleeding345-347 occurring during implant or explant of VADs\r\nand HT.348-350 Recombinant FVIIa combines with tissue factor\r\nat the site of injury and activates the coagulation cascade.\r\nHowever, because tissue factor is also expressed on\r\nmonocytes and atherosclerotic blood vessels, it may have\r\nprothrombotic effects in cardiac surgery patients.351 Despite\r\nthe potential efficacy of rFVIIa seems to have, prospective\r\nrandomized trials with rFVIIa still do not confirm the efficacy\r\nor safety of this costly agent in cardiac surgery.\r\nGaps in Evidence\r\nTransfusion stragtegies are not well studied. Consensus\r\nopinion drives the decision of when to transfuse blood\r\nproducts. Expert opinions on which clinical situations require\r\ntransfusions are highly variable. Recombinant FVIIa has not\r\nbeen tested in controlled clinical trials and therefore there is\r\nlittle evidence to support its use in a bleeding cardiac surgery\r\npatient. Tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid have not been\r\nevaluated in a definitive randomized study. Very few studies\r\nhave been performed specifically in HT recipients. Thus, the\r\nrecommendations for HT are extrapolated from evidence\r\nregarding achievement of hemostasis in general cardiac\r\nsurgery.\r\nRecommendations for the Pharmacologic\r\nManagement of Coagulopathies in Heart Transplant\r\nRecipients339, 346, 347, 351-353:\r\nClass I:\r\n1. Transfusion of coagulation factors is necessary for\r\nadequate hemostatsis. Thus, FFP and platelets should be\r\ntransfused based on measured levels. Fibrinogen infusion\r\nfor massive bleeding and inadequate fibrinogen levels is\r\nneeded to control blood loss.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1.

Desmopressin is not recommended for routine use\r\nbecause its modest reduction in bleeding has been\r\nassociated with adverse clinical events.\r\nLevel of Evidence: A.\r\nConclusion\r\nCompared to patients undergoing general cardiac surgery,\r\nHT recipients have a greater incidence of coagulopathies due\r\nto multiple factors that include greater severity of illness in\r\nheart failure patients, more frequent use of anticoagulants, and\r\nprotracted extracorporeal circulation in patients undergoing\r\nMCS explantation. There are several laboratory and point of\r\ncare tests to assess the severity of the coagulopathy present in\r\nindividual patients. The application of a combination of intraoperative\r\nsurgical techniques, pharmacologic therapies, as\r\nwell as transfusion strategies are needed to control the\r\nbleeding commonly occurring during HT.\r\nTopic 6: Documentation and\r\nCommunication with the Multidisciplinary\r\nTeam\r\nMultidisciplinary Team\r\nA HT center should identify a multidisciplinary team\r\n(composed of individuals from surgery, medicine, nursing,\r\nnutrition, social services, physical therapy, and pharmacology)\r\nwith each member having specific responsibilities. In addition\r\nto cardiology and cardiac surgery, medical specialties that\r\nshould be represented in the cardiac transplant team include\r\ninfectious diseases, nephrology, pulmonary with respiratory\r\ntherapy support, pathology, immunology, anesthesiology,\r\nphysical therapy, and rehabilitation medicine. The Organ\r\nProcurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the\r\nUnited States, the British Transplant Society (BTS), and the\r\nEuropean Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT) have\r\nrecommendations for the multi-disciplinary approach to\r\nHT.354, 355\r\nAs with the evaluation and discussion that accompanies\r\nlisting a patient for transplantation, a similar approach is\r\nuseful in dealing with the HT recipient. In addition to\r\nphysicians and transplant nurse coordinators, the team should\r\ninclude the following:\r\na. Social work/social services personnel have a\r\nmultifunctional and undisputed role in transplant\r\ncenters.356 One important function is the pre-operative\r\nscreening for psycho-social conditions that might\r\nadversely affect recipient outcome, such as depression,\r\nand adherence to medical treatment regimens.357, 358\r\nb. Psychiatry/psychology specialists diagnose psychiatric\r\nillnesses, manage pharmacologic therapy, 359 and identify\r\npersonality traits that may allow the transplant team to\r\nimprove the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding and adherence to\r\ntheir medical therapy.360, 361 Qualified social work\r\ncounselors often subsume the functions of these\r\nspecialists.\r\nc. In the US, clinical pharmacists can play a pivotal role in\r\nthe management of HT recipients. In European countries,\r\nthis role is often fulfilled by transplant physicians. There\r\nare numerous interactions among medications and\r\nbetween medications and food and other nutritional\r\nsupplements requiring both monitoring and education of\r\npatients and care givers on the complexities of\r\npharmacological therapyin HT recipients. These patients\r\noften have other chronic diseases, and management of a\r\ncomplex poly-pharmacy is crucial for long-term allograft\r\nand patient survival. In the outpatient management of\r\nkidney transplant recipients, the involvement of a\r\ntransplant pharmacist led to improved patient compliance\r\nwith medications at the end of 1 year (95.1\% in those\r\npatients who interacted with pharmacists vs. 81.6\% with\r\nthose who did not).362, 363 In addition, the inclusion of\r\npharmacy input led to an increase in Ã¢â‚¬Å“therapeuticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ drug\r\nconcentrations from 48\% to 64\%.363.\r\nd. Dieticians play an important during both the pre- and\r\npost-HT periods. Pre-operatively, HT recipients are often\r\nmalnourished and cachectic as a consequence of longstanding\r\nheart failure. Better nutrition at this point\r\nimproves operative survival. Post-operatively, HT\r\nassist support devices\r\nrecipients often need education on avoidance of weight\r\ngain associated with the use of CSs and hyperglycemia\r\ncontrol. Weight loss while waiting for HT is often\r\nnecessary because obesity in the HT recipient is\r\nassociated with poorer short-term outcomes.\r\ne. Physical and occupational therapy are equally important\r\nin the pre-and post- HT periods. Cardiac rehabilitation\r\nshould begin in the hospital and continue after discharge.\r\nSupervised exercise may also facilitate adherence to a\r\nlong-term exercise program.\r\nf. Infectious disease specialists with a focus on\r\nimmunocompromised patients are invaluable in the \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 39\r\nmanagement of HT recipients in terms of diagnois and\r\ntherapy of community acquired and opportunistic\r\ninfections and the development of protocols for infection\r\nprophylaxis against invasive fungi and CMV.\r\ng. In those countries without a socialized or national medical\r\nsystem, financial counselors should be part of the\r\nmultidisciplinary team to help HT candidates or recipients\r\nwith insurance claims and health care coverage or private\r\nfund raising.\r\nCommunication\r\nMeetings should be scheduled at regular intervals to\r\nfacilitate discussion of HT candidates, recipients, and\r\nprogrammatic concerns. Telecommunication or electronic\r\nconferencing can be used to allow for collaborations between\r\ngeographically distant groups. These meetings should include\r\nscheduled internal quality assessments by physicians, nurses,\r\nand the other allied health professionals.364\r\nRecommendations for the Documentation and\r\nCommunication with the Multidisciplinary Team356,\r\n357, 362:\r\nClass I:\r\n1.

This condition accounts for the highest\r\nproportion of deaths (20\%) in the pediatric population within\r\nthe first 30 post-operative days.366 In a report from the\r\nPediatric Heart Transplant Study, early heart allograft failure\r\nwas the commonest cause of early death in infants.367 Finally,\r\nmortality due to PGF is higher in recipients with than in those\r\nwithout congenital heart disease (5\% vs. 1\%), and as high as\r\n10\% in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.368 Table\r\n1 summarizes potential causes of PGF after pediatric HT.365\r\nIf the recipient cannot be weaned off CPB, MCS should\r\nbe instituted. Urgent re-transplantation may be considered but\r\nit is associated with a high mortality.96, 366, 369\r\nECMO and Primary Graft Failure in Pediatric Heart\r\nTransplantation\r\nSince the first reported neonatal survivor in the 1970s, the\r\nECMO portion of the Extracorporeal Life Support\r\nOrganization (ELSO) Registry contains a total of 386 ECMO\r\ntherapies for pediatric HT with survival ranging from 31\% in\r\nnewborns to 57\% in older children.370, 371 Registry indications\r\nfor ECMO after HT include pulmonary disease and acute\r\nrejection. Requirements for ECMO support in pediatric HT\r\nrecipients range between 10\% and 60\% and subsequent\r\nsurvival after PGF varies between 20\% and 75\%. Some\r\nfavorable outcomes have been achieved with ECMO as a\r\nbridge to recovery and this type of support is available at\r\nmany pediatric HT centers. Using the definition noted above,\r\nHuang reported PGF in 33\% of pediatric HT recipients, 44\%\r\nof whom required MCS.85 There was an 18\% early mortality\r\nrate in the PGF group. Of 4 children with acute HT failure that\r\nwere supported with ECMO, 2 survived, 1 after retransplantation.369\r\nKirschbom reported ECMO support in 9 of\r\n12 children, only 2 of whom (22\%) survived.372 Chou reported\r\na 9\% ECMO use rates for PGF, including 4 children, 3 of\r\nwhom survived.373 Fenton reported 15 children (9\% of their\r\ntransplant series) who required ECMO within 6 weeks of HT \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 40\r\nand 58\% of these survived.374 Finally, the Denver group\r\nreported that 8 of 14 infants (57\%) undergoing HT for\r\nhypoplastic left heart syndrome required ECMO after HT and\r\nwere discharged alive.375 Survivors were likely to be weaned\r\nwithin 84 hours of ECMO support.\r\nIndications for ECMO Support after Pediatric Heart\r\nTransplantation\r\nFailure of Separation from Cardiopulmonary Bypass\r\nIf the recipient cannot be weaned from CPB, the standard\r\nmeasures should be instituted after assessment of residual\r\nanatomic lesions, ventilatory and pharmacologic support,\r\nhematologic and biochemical profile, and fluid status. Once\r\nthese measures have been optimized and hyperacute rejection\r\nhas been excluded, then a diagnosis of primary PGF can be\r\nmade and ECMO support can be considered.\r\nInadequate Post-operative Cardiac Function\r\nExisting or progressively poorer post-operative allograft\r\nfunction, evidence of a low cardiac output, and poor systemic\r\noxygen delivery unresponsive to escalating medical therapy\r\nmay also warrant consideration of ECMO support in the ICU.\r\nAgain, all appropriate measures should be undertaken to\r\noptimize support and exclude a correctable cause for the poor\r\nallograft function as outlined above.376-379\r\nCardiac Arrest\r\nEmergency cannulation for ECMO during cardiac arrest\r\nis increasingly common.

Cannulae placed directly into the aorta and\r\nthe atria may be associated with improved flows but may be\r\nless stable. Direct cannulation may be used in the case of\r\nhemodynamic instability or technical difficulties. Approaches\r\nincluding cannulation, technique, equipment, flows,\r\nmonitoring, and anticoagulation are center specific.\r\nLeft Heart Distension on Cardiac Extracorporeal\r\nMembrane Oxygenation\r\nA left-sided vent is not required if cardiac ejection is\r\nsufficient to prevent LV over-distension. Distension of the LV\r\nwill result in increased wall tension, decreased LV perfusion,\r\nand ischemia, which may impair the ability to improve heart\r\nallograft function. In addition, LV distension may have\r\ndetrimental effects on pulmonary function. If pulmonary\r\nassist support devices\r\nedema develops or LA/LV distension is detected by\r\nechocardiography, a vent should be inserted through the\r\npulmonary vein or directly into the left atrium.382\r\nAlternatively, if the chest wound has been closed, an atrial \r\nISHLT Guidelines for the Care of Heart Transplant Recipients Task Force 1\r\n 41\r\nseptostomy is performed.384, 385 If it is anticipated that a patient\r\nwill require ECMO after HT, the atrial septum may be\r\nfenestrated at the time of implantation.\r\nRecommendations for the Conduct of\r\nExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support in\r\nPediatric Heart Transplant Recipients:382, 384\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. The amount of circulatory support provided by ECMO\r\nshould be sufficient to achieve adequate systemic\r\nperfusion and oxygen delivery while waiting for the\r\nmyocardium to recover.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Left heart distension during ECMO support should be\r\naggressively treated as it will compromise pulmonary\r\nfunction and impede LV recovery.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nDuration of Support after Heart Transplantation\r\nThe purpose of ECMO is to maintain the systemic\r\ncirculation and end-organ function while investigating the\r\ncause of heart allograft failure, and waiting for myocardial\r\nrecovery. The literature suggests that cardiac recovery can be\r\nexpected within 3 to 7 days after HT and this time interval is\r\nsufficient to assess severity and reversibility of end-organ\r\ndamage and to consider other options, including weaning of\r\nsupport due to allograft recovery, implantation of a VAD as a\r\nbridge to re-transplantation, or treatment withdrawal.85, 96, 369,\r\n372, 375, 386-388\r\nTiming of Discontinuation of Extracorporeal\r\nMembrane Oxygenation Support in the Setting of\r\nPrimary Graft Failure\r\nWeaning ECMO should be considered when there is\r\nevidence of improved cardiac function on echocardiography\r\nand evidence of ejection in the arterial tree. Case reports\r\nsupport recovery if there are signs of improvement within 3 to\r\n7 days, but primarily within the first 3 days of support.85, 369,\r\n370, 373, 376, 379, 387\r\nRecommendations for the Timing of Discontinuation\r\nof Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support in\r\nthe Setting of Primary Graft Failure386:\r\nClass IIa:\r\n1. Clinical and echocardiographic variables should be\r\nserially assessed to determine if myocardial recovery is\r\noccurring.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\n2. Objective signs of recovery should lead to weaning and\r\ndiscontinuation of ECMO support.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nClass IIb:\r\n1. Lack of objective evidence of myocardial recovery within\r\n3 to 5 days should prompt consideration of either\r\ninstitution of long term MCS as a bridge to recovery or\r\nHT or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.\r\nLevel of Evidence: C.\r\nGaps in Evidence:\r\n1.
