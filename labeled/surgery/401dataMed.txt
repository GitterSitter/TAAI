Mechanical circulatory support is a promising therapy as both a bridge       to transplantation and destination therapy. Elderly patients are frequently      ineligible for heart transplantation because of their age and comorbidities, and       the application of mechanical circulatory support for destination therapy in this      population is not well defined. A review of the literature was undertaken to      better characterize our experience to date with mechanical circulatory support in      older heart failure populations. Mechanical circulatory support is being employed      increasingly for destination therapy indications in older patients. The newer      continuous flow devices appear to have disproportionate advantage in elderly      patients, which has translated into marked improvement in 1- and 2-year survival.      The rational implementation of MCS devices in elderly heart failure patients      needs to focus on (1) continuous flow devices that appear to have particular      benefit in this population, (2) extensive pre-MCS assessment including variables       relating to frailty, and (3) intervening before these patients develop      cardiogenic shock. More data are needed on the cost-benefit analysis of routine      use of CF devices as destination therapy in elderly patients with heart failure.FAU - Butler, Craig RAU  - Butler CRAD  - Division of Cardiology, Walter C.
