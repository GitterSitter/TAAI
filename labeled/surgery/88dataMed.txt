We compared results of 67 patients      who received first-time left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) with sealed      inflow and outflow grafts (S-graft group) with a preceding 65 patients who      received an LVAD with nonsealed grafts (NS-graft group). Overall, the amount of      blood product transfusions was less in the S-graft group than that in the      NS-graft group (red blood cells, 4.9 +/- 4.5 vs. 8.0 +/- 9.4 units, p = 0.022;      fresh-frozen plasma, 5.0 +/- 3.0 vs. 8.7 +/- 9.3 units, p = 0.004; platelets, 2.9      +/- 1.1 vs. 4.5 +/- 3.5 units, p = 0.001; and cryoprecipitate, 1.2 +/- 0.9 vs.      2.01 +/- 1.9 units, p = 0.002). Within a follow-up period of 6 months, no      device-related infections or strokes occurred in the S-group, but the NS-group      had one (1.5\%) driveline infections and four (6\%) strokes. The 30 days survival      rate was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.053), but favored the       S-group (97\%) over the NS-group (88\%). Use of a HMII with a sealed graft on the      inflow and outflow conduits is associated with less postoperative bleeding and      may have helped to decrease the frequency of postoperative adverse events.FAU - Gregoric, Igor DAU  - Gregoric IDAD  - From the Department of Cardiopulmonary Transplantation and the Center for Cardiac      Support, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke\s Episcopal Hospital, Houston, Texas.FAU - Radovancevic, RajkoAU  - Radovancevic RFAU - Patel, ManishAU  - Patel MFAU - Fenik, YelenaAU  - Fenik YFAU - Cohn, William EAU  - Cohn WEFAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Anticoagulants)RN  - 9000-70-8 (Gelatin)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Anticoagulants/therapeutic useMH  - Blood CoagulationMH  - Blood TransfusionMH  - FemaleMH  - Gelatin/chemistryMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/methodsMH  - Heart Ventricles/surgeryMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Postoperative ComplicationsMH  - Prosthesis FailureMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Stroke/prevention & controlMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2014/03/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/13 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000071 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 May-Jun;60(3):300-3. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000071.- 24618753own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140430dcom- 20141217is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 60ip  - 3dp  - 2014 may-junti  - use of sealed grafts in the heartmate ii left ventricular assist device inflow      and outflow conduits.pg  - 300-3lid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000071 [doi]ab  - gelatin-impregnated nonporous sealed grafts were introduced in the inflow and      outflow conduits for use with the heartmate ii (hmii) to eliminate preclotting      procedures and to reduce operative bleeding. we compared results of 67 patients      who received first-time left ventricular assist devices (lvads) with sealed      inflow and outflow grafts (s-graft group) with a preceding 65 patients who      received an lvad with nonsealed grafts (ns-graft group). overall, the amount of      blood product transfusions was less in the s-graft group than that in the      ns-graft group (red blood cells, 4.9 +/- 4.5 vs. 8.0 +/- 9.4 units, p = 0.022;      fresh-frozen plasma, 5.0 +/- 3.0 vs. 8.7 +/- 9.3 units, p = 0.004; platelets, 2.9      +/- 1.1 vs. 4.5 +/- 3.5 units, p = 0.001; and cryoprecipitate, 1.2 +/- 0.9 vs.      2.01 +/- 1.9 units, p = 0.002). within a follow-up period of 6 months, no      device-related infections or strokes occurred in the s-group, but the ns-group      had one (1.5\%) driveline infections and four (6\%) strokes. the 30 days survival      rate was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.053), but favored the       s-group (97\%) over the ns-group (88\%). use of a hmii with a sealed graft on the      inflow and outflow conduits is associated with less postoperative bleeding and      may have helped to decrease the frequency of postoperative adverse events.fau - gregoric, igor dau  - gregoric idad  - from the department of cardiopulmonary transplantation and the center for cardiac      support, texas heart institute at st. luke\s episcopal hospital, houston, texas.fau - radovancevic, rajkoau  - radovancevic rfau - patel, manishau  - patel mfau - fenik, yelenaau  - fenik yfau - cohn, william eau  - cohn wefau - frazier, o hau  - frazier ohla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109rn  - 0 (anticoagulants)rn  - 9000-70-8 (gelatin)sb  - immh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - anticoagulants/therapeutic usemh  - blood coagulationmh  - blood transfusionmh  - femalemh  - gelatin/chemistrymh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantation/methodsmh  - heart ventricles/surgerymh  - heart-assist devices/*adverse effectsmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - postoperative complicationsmh  - prosthesis failuremh  - retrospective studiesmh  - stroke/prevention & controlmh  - time factorsmh  - treatment outcomeedat- 2014/03/13 06:00mhda- 2014/12/18 06:00crdt- 2014/03/13 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000071 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2014 may-jun;60(3):300-3. doi: 10.1097/mat.0000000000000071.
