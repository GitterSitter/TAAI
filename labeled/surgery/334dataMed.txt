Analysis of the United Network of Organ      Sharing database.PG  - 1192-8LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2012.07.004 [doi]LID - S1053-2498(12)01176-X [pii]AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of bridging patients with cardiac allograft failure to      retransplantation (ReTx) with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) have not been       well studied. The United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to      analyze outcomes of patients successfully bridged with MCS to cardiac ReTx.      METHODS: Of 1,690 cardiac ReTx identified in the UNOS database from October 1987       to July 2011, 149 (8.8\%) were bridged to ReTx with MCS. RESULTS: Patients bridged      to ReTx with MCS had a poorer survival than patients not bridged (p < 0.0001).      ReTx after ventricular assist device (VAD) support had better survival than ReTx       after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; half-life, 3.9 years vs 61 days,      p = 0.026). For patients bridged to ReTx, graft survival was 40\% for ReTx within       1 year of primary Tx vs 64\% (p = 0.003). When ReTx was performed 1 year after      cardiac Tx, survival was similar in patients bridged with a VAD and those not      bridged (mean, 7.5 vs 8.7 years; p = 0.8). Survival for patients bridged to ReTx       with ECMO was consistently worse (p </= 0.05) in all analyses. The 1-year      survival of ReTx after VAD performed in 2003 to 2011 (67\%) was better than in the      earlier era of 1987 to 2002 (37\%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Bridging patients to      ReTx with ECMO at any time is not advisable. Bridging patients with MCS to ReTx      within 1 year of primary cardiac Tx is not advisable. Survival after ReTx for      patients bridged by VAD has improved considerably over time. Patients who survive      the first year after cardiac Tx can be bridged by VAD to ReTx with an expectation      that outcomes can be similar to ReTx patients who did not require MCS.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
