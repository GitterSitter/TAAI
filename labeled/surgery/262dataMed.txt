RV deformation      analysis by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) has recently allowed a deeper      analysis of RV longitudinal function. The aim of the study was to observe RV      function by STE in patients with advanced heart failure before and after LVAD      implantation. METHODS: Transthoracic echo Doppler was performed in 10 patients      referred for LVAD therapy at baseline and with serial echocardiograms after LVAD       implantation. In a sub-group of 4 patients, an echocardiographic evaluation was      also made after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support was initiated and before      LVAD implantation. All echocardiographic images were analyzed off-line to      calculate the free wall RV longitudinal strain (RVLS). RESULTS: Three patients      who presented the lowest free wall RVLS values at baseline, showed a progressive       decline of RVLS after LVAD implant, presenting finally RV failure; however,      patients with higher values of RVLS at baseline presented a further and overt      increase of strain values in the course of follow-up. The overall performance for      the prediction of RV failure after LVAD implant was greatest for free wall RVLS      (area under the curve, 0.93). For the sub-group receiving the IABP as an      intermediate step, only 2 patients with an increase of RVLS after IABP      implantation also showed an increase of RVLS levels, after subsequent LVAD      implantation. The 2 patients without an increase of RVLS after IABP implantation       also presented with RV failure after LVAD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study of 10       patients indicates that the new parameter of RVLS, representing RV myocardial      deformation, may have important clinical implications for the selection and      management of LVAD patients. A large multicenter study is required to confirm      these observations and to quantify the clinical significance of changes in RVLS      value.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
