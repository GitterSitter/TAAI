BACKGROUND: The 2006 UNOS      thoracic organ allocation policy change was implemented to allow for greater      regional sharing of organs for heart transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed 36,789      patients who were listed for heart transplantation from January 1999 through      April 2012. These patients were separated into 2 eras centered on the July 12,      2006 UNOS policy change. Pre- and post-transplantation characteristics were      compared by UNOS regions. RESULTS: Waitlist mortality decreased nationally (up to      180 days: 13.3\% vs. 7.9\% after the UNOS policy change, p < 0.001) and within each      region. Similarly, 2-year post-transplant mortality decreased nationally (2-year       mortality: 17.3\% vs. 14.6\%; p < 0.001) as well as regionally. Waitlist time for      UNOS status 1A and 1B candidates increased nationally 17.8 days on average (p <      0.001) with variability between the regions. The greatest increases were in      Region 9 (59.2-day increase, p < 0.001) and Region 4 (41.2-day increase, p <      0.001). Although the use of mechanical circulatory support increased nearly      2.3-fold nationally in Era 2, significant differences were present on a regional       basis. In Regions 6, 7, and 10, nearly 40\% of those transplanted required left      ventricular assist device bridging, whereas only 19.6\%, 22.3\%, and 15.5\% required      a left ventricular assist device in regions 3, 4, and 5, respectively.      CONCLUSIONS: The 2006 UNOS policy change has resulted in significant regional      heterogeneity with respect to waitlist time and reliance on mechanical      circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation, although overall both      waitlist mortality and post-transplant survival are improved.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
