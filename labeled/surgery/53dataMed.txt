While in      hospital, patients with a VAD have traditionally been taught by an educator nurse      with VAD expertise in preparation for discharge. In 2004, our centre implemented       a successful competency-based patient education program in post-heart transplant       patients and thought that a similar program may provide increased confidence for       bedside nurses to actively participate in VAD patient education prior to      discharge. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to create a      competency-based education program that would provide consistency in patient      teaching. A questionnaire was developed and completed by 13 bedside nurses. This       pre-test questionnaire indicated the need for a systematic and organized approach      to VAD patient teaching. Furthermore, adequate resources, consistency in teaching      methods, and feedback were seen to be essential. A pilot competency-based program      was designed to lead bedside nurses and patients through a series of learning      phases and has successfully been implemented. Since its implementation, the      questionnaire has been repeated with results reflecting satisfaction with the      revised competency-based program. Our findings and evaluation of the program      through pre- and post-testing reflect an increase in organization in our teaching      methods and has led to improved confidence and satisfaction for bedside nurses      using this program. By redeveloping the current method of VAD education, our goal      has been to improve the ways in which we deliver teaching to our patients. It is       thought that, as with our experience in the post-heart transplant population,      bedside nurses and team members will feel more empowered to provide teaching to      patients with a VAD.FAU - Loughran, StephanieAU  - Loughran SAD  - St. Paul\s Hospital, Vancouver, BC. sloughran@providencehealth.bc.caFAU - Kealy, JenniferAU  - Kealy JFAU - Shook, AlyssaAU  - Shook AFAU - Kaan, AnnemarieAU  - Kaan ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - Can J Cardiovasc NursJT  - Canadian journal of cardiovascular nursing = Journal canadien en soins infirmiers      cardio-vasculairesJID - 8913645SB  - NMH  - British ColumbiaMH  - Competency-Based Education/*methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Patient Education as Topic/*methodsMH  - Postoperative Care/nursingMH  - Program DevelopmentMH  - *Self CareEDAT- 2012/08/23 06:00MHDA- 2012/09/21 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/23 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2012 Summer;22(3):18-23.- 22908523own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120822dcom- 20120920is  - 0843-6096 (print)is  - 0843-6096 (linking)vi  - 22ip  - 3dp  - 2012 summerti  - the development and evaluation of a competency-based program for patients with a       ventricular assist device.pg  - 18-23ab  - the ventricular assist device (vad) is a mechanical device that is used to      provide long term support either as a bridge or as an alternative to      transplantation for patients suffering from end stage heart failure. while in      hospital, patients with a vad have traditionally been taught by an educator nurse      with vad expertise in preparation for discharge. in 2004, our centre implemented       a successful competency-based patient education program in post-heart transplant       patients and thought that a similar program may provide increased confidence for       bedside nurses to actively participate in vad patient education prior to      discharge. the purpose of this quality improvement project was to create a      competency-based education program that would provide consistency in patient      teaching. a questionnaire was developed and completed by 13 bedside nurses. this       pre-test questionnaire indicated the need for a systematic and organized approach      to vad patient teaching. furthermore, adequate resources, consistency in teaching      methods, and feedback were seen to be essential. a pilot competency-based program      was designed to lead bedside nurses and patients through a series of learning      phases and has successfully been implemented. since its implementation, the      questionnaire has been repeated with results reflecting satisfaction with the      revised competency-based program. our findings and evaluation of the program      through pre- and post-testing reflect an increase in organization in our teaching      methods and has led to improved confidence and satisfaction for bedside nurses      using this program. by redeveloping the current method of vad education, our goal      has been to improve the ways in which we deliver teaching to our patients. it is       thought that, as with our experience in the post-heart transplant population,      bedside nurses and team members will feel more empowered to provide teaching to      patients with a vad.fau - loughran, stephanieau  - loughran sad  - st. paul\s hospital, vancouver, bc. sloughran@providencehealth.bc.cafau - kealy, jenniferau  - kealy jfau - shook, alyssaau  - shook afau - kaan, annemarieau  - kaan ala  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - canadata  - can j cardiovasc nursjt  - canadian journal of cardiovascular nursing = journal canadien en soins infirmiers      cardio-vasculairesjid - 8913645sb  - nmh  - british columbiamh  - competency-based education/*methodsmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - patient education as topic/*methodsmh  - postoperative care/nursingmh  - program developmentmh  - *self careedat- 2012/08/23 06:00mhda- 2012/09/21 06:00crdt- 2012/08/23 06:00pst - ppublishso  - can j cardiovasc nurs. 2012 summer;22(3):18-23.
