The two main reasons for this       development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTX). Furthermore, the      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term      patient outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist      device (LVAD) implantation at our Erlangen Heart Center during January 2000-July       2013. The main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. From all patients, we created a      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and      described the overall outcome. RESULTS: VAD implantation was performed in 266      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2\% of the total of 12254 cardiac      surgical operations in that period). From these patients, 223 underwent LVAD or      biventricular (BVAD) implantation; the remaining received a right (RVAD)      implantation. The most frequent underlying clinical diagnoses were dilated (n =      84, 37.7\%, DCM) or ischemic (n = 61, 27.4\%, ICM) cardiomyopathy. The pathological      findings in the apex biopsy were generally non-specific and showed variable      interstitial myocardial fibrosis with evidence of fibre loss, fatty degeneration       and variable irregular atrophy of muscle fibres, consistent with dilated and      ischemic cardiomyopathies as the most frequent causes of heart failure in these      patients. Only a few cases showed other specific features such as myocarditis and      AL-amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during      LVAD implantation are rather non-specific and they generally reflect the late      stage or consequences of chronic myocardial damage in cases of dilated or      ischemic cardiomyopathies. Variable patchy chronic inflammatory changes may be      observed in cardiomyopathies as a non-specific reaction caused by myocardial      fiber damage and should not lead to misinterpretation as evidence of myocarditis       or revision of original diagnosis.FAU - Strecker, ThomasAU  - Strecker TAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.FAU - Rosch, JohannesAU  - Rosch JAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.FAU - Weyand, MichaelAU  - Weyand MAD  - Center of Cardiac Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.FAU - Agaimy, AbbasAU  - Agaimy AAD  - Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg      Erlangen, Germany.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20140815PL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Clin Exp PatholJT  - International journal of clinical and experimental pathologyJID - 101480565SB  - IMPMC - PMC4203167OID - NLM: PMC4203167OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)OT  - apex pathologyOT  - dilatative cardiomyopathyOT  - ischemic cardiomyopathyOT  - myocarditisEDAT- 2014/10/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/23 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/23 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/07/10 [received]PHST- 2014/08/21 [accepted]PHST- 2014/08/15 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Aug 15;7(9):5549-56. eCollection 2014.- 25337196own - nlmstat- in-processda  - 20141022is  - 1936-2625 (electronic)is  - 1936-2625 (linking)vi  - 7ip  - 9dp  - 2014ti  - pathological findings in cardiac apex removed during implantation of left      ventricular assist devices (lvad) are non-specific: 13-year-experience at a      german heart center.pg  - 5549-56ab  - background and aim: ventricular assist devices (vad) have become an established      therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. the two main reasons for this       development are the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the increasing      number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (htx). furthermore, the      enormous advances in the technical equipment and the rising clinical experience      have improved the implantation technique, the durability and the long-term      patient outcomes. methods: we reviewed all cases of left ventricular assist      device (lvad) implantation at our erlangen heart center during january 2000-july       2013. the main aim of this study was to analyze the underlying pathology from the      cardiac apex removed during the implantation. from all patients, we created a      follow-up, analyzed the pathological features with the clinical diagnoses and      described the overall outcome. results: vad implantation was performed in 266      cases at our center in the last 13 years (2.2\% of the total of 12254 cardiac      surgical operations in that period). from these patients, 223 underwent lvad or      biventricular (bvad) implantation;
