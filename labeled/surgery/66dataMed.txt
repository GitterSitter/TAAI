The HeartMate II risk score (HMRS)      was recently derived and validated to predict 90-day mortality in clinical trial       patients with continuous-flow LVADs. The aim of this study was to test HMRS      validity in predicting survival at our institution. METHODS: We performed a      retrospective analysis of patients implanted with HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec,      Pleasanton, CA) LVADs from March 31, 2004 to September 20, 2012 at the Columbia      University Medical Center (CUMC). Patients were stratified according to HMRS      profiles (HMRS Low < 1.58, 1.58 </= HMRS Medium </= 2.48, HMRS High > 2.48)      calculated using age, albumin, creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR)      and center volume. Outcome was defined as survival at 90 days after device      implantation. RESULTS: HeartMate II LVADs were implanted in 205 patients.      Pre-operative data from 201 patients were categorized into HMRS Low (n = 101;      1.04 [0.64 to 1.31]), HMRS Medium (n = 73; 1.98 [1.78 to 2.25]) and HMRS High (n       = 27, 3.07 [2.70 to 3.43]) (p < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 90      days (HMRS Low 91.0 +/- 2.9\%, HMRS Medium 91.7 +/- 3.2\%, HMRS High 88.7 +/- 6.1\%)      and at 1 year (HMRS Low 85.5 +/- 3.8\%, HMRS Medium 79.3 +/- 5.5\%, HMRS High 82.4       +/- 8.4\%) after LVAD implantation were not statistically different (p = 0.43).      Prediction of 90-day mortality by receiver operating characteristic was poor (AUC      = 0.56). CONCLUSION: HMRS stratification poorly discriminates 90-day mortality      after HMII LVAD implantation at our institution. Its generalizability as a      universal prognostic score may be limited.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.      Published by Elsevier Inc.
