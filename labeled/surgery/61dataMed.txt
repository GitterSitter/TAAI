VADs may serve as a bridge to heart transplantation or as permanent      circulatory assistance, also referred to as destination therapy. There is a      paucity of information regarding the nutrition complications in VAD patients, and      as such, little is presently known of the optimal means of nutrition assessment      and management of these complex and often critically ill patients. In this      review, a general overview of the VAD, comparisons of nutrition assessment      measures, and strategies to meet the nutrition needs of these patients are      provided using evidence-based information wherever possible. Because there is a      lack of nutrition studies and assessment guidelines specifically for VAD      patients, many of the guidelines for care of these patients are currently based      on the information available for the care of patients with heart failure.      Although the optimal measure to assess nutrition status remains poorly studied, a      systematic, thorough nutrition assessment of patients with heart failure and      heart transplant candidates prior to VAD placement appears to be important to      identify those at nutrition risk and, with appropriate nutrition therapy,      decrease their risk for morbidity and mortality. VAD patients with inadequate      oral intake may require nutrition support to meet their nutrition needs; however,      feeding the hemodynamically compromised patient provides additional challenges.FAU - Montgomery, Tricia DAU  - Montgomery TDAD  - Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, AZ 85054, USA. montgomery.triciadawn@mayo.eduFAU - Cohen, Ashley EAU  - Cohen AEFAU - Garnick, JamesAU  - Garnick JFAU - Spadafore, JeniferAU  - Spadafore JFAU - Boldea, EvaAU  - Boldea ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20120420PL  - United StatesTA  - Nutr Clin PractJT  - Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for      Parenteral and Enteral NutritionJID - 8606733SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - Heart Failure/complications/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart Ventricles/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - Malnutrition/diagnosis/prevention & controlMH  - *Nutrition AssessmentMH  - *Nutritional SupportEDAT- 2012/04/24 06:00MHDA- 2012/09/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/24 06:00PHST- 2012/04/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 0884533612444537 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0884533612444537 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Nutr Clin Pract. 2012 Jun;27(3):352-62. doi: 10.1177/0884533612444537.
