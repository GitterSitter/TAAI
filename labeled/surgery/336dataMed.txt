METHODS: We      conducted a prospective, single-group trial of a ventricular assist device      designed specifically for children as a bridge to heart transplantation. Patients      16 years of age or younger were divided into two cohorts according to      body-surface area (cohort 1, <0.7 m(2); cohort 2, 0.7 to <1.5 m(2)), with 24      patients in each group. Survival in the two cohorts receiving mechanical support       (with data censored at the time of transplantation or weaning from the device      owing to recovery) was compared with survival in two propensity-score-matched      historical control groups (one for each cohort) undergoing extracorporeal      membrane oxygenation (ECMO). RESULTS: For participants in cohort 1, the median      survival time had not been reached at 174 days, whereas in the matched ECMO      group, the median survival was 13 days (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). For      participants in cohort 2 and the matched ECMO group, the median survival was 144       days and 10 days, respectively (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). Serious adverse      events in cohort 1 and cohort 2 included major bleeding (in 42\% and 50\% of      patients, respectively), infection (in 63\% and 50\%), and stroke (in 29\% and 29\%).      CONCLUSIONS: Our trial showed that survival rates were significantly higher with       the ventricular assist device than with ECMO. Serious adverse events, including      infection, stroke, and bleeding, occurred in a majority of study participants.
