Improved long-term outcomes may facilitate the use of device therapy as       an alternative to heart transplantation. However, there are scarce data about the      long-term outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. This study      sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients receiving continuous-flow      left ventricular assist devices. METHODS: Between March 2004 and June 2010, 140      patients underwent continuous-flow left ventricular assist device insertion as a       bridge to transplantation or a destination therapy. These patients\ charts were      retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The initial strategy for continuous-flow left       ventricular assist device therapy was bridge to transplantation in 115 patients      (82\%) and destination therapy in 25 patients (18\%). Of those, 24 (17\%) died on      left ventricular assist device support, 94 (67\%) were successfully bridged to      transplantation, and 1 (0.71\%) showed native heart recovery. Twenty-four patients      (17\%) had been on continuous-flow left ventricular assist device support for more      than 3 years (mean, 3.9 years; range, 3.0-7.5 years). Estimated on-device      survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 83\%, 75\%, and 61\%, respectively.      Rehospitalizations due to bleeding, cardiac events, and device-related issues      were common. The freedom from rehospitalization rates at 1 and 3 years was 31\%      and 6.9\%, respectively. A total of 14 patients (10\%) required device exchange.      CONCLUSIONS: Current continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices can provide       satisfactory long-term survival. However, rehospitalization is frequently      required.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published by      Elsevier Inc.
