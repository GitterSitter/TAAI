Framingham, MA)      ventricular assist device (HVAD) is approved for implantation through a      sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. We report on our initial experience with       this device implanted off-pump via thoracotomy. METHODS: A total of 26 patients      were included in this review. All patients were Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support categories 2 or 3 and underwent      implantation of an HVAD as an elective procedure via thoracotomy and mini      sternotomy approach. Three-dimensional echocardiography was used to assess the      ventricle and was also used to facilitate proper pump positioning. Patients were       managed during follow-up using anti-coagulants at a target international      normalized ratio 2.0 to 2.5 as well as anti-platelet agents. RESULTS:      Implantation was performed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, but 1      patient did require conversion to on-pump surgery. There were no perioperative      deaths or right heart failure events. The mean intensive care unit stay was 1.5      days. Transfusions of 1 to 3 units of packed red blood cells were required in 16       patients, whereas 10 patients maintained a stable perioperative hematocrit of at       least 30\% and did not require transfusion. Survival through 90 days was 100\%, and      survival through 180 days was 87\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience was favorable in      respect to outcome, safety, and use of blood products. Our technique can be used       as an alternative approach for left ventricular assist device implantation using       the HVAD.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
