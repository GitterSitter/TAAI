The outcomes       of these patients after LVAD implantation are unknown. METHODS: Baseline      predictors and outcomes were collected and analyzed from patients with active      substance abuse and a cohort of patients without active substance abuse matched      for age, INTERMACS profile and year of implantation. The primary outcome was      all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included rates of listing for cardiac      transplantation, transplantation and chronic drive-line infection. RESULTS: The      cohort consisted of 20 consecutive LVAD recipients with active substance abuse      and 40 recipients without active substance abuse. During a median follow-up      period of 2.3 years (IQR 1.4 to 3.6), the substance abuse group had 3.2 times the      rate (hazard) of death compared with a matched cohort (HR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.2 to 8.0,      p < 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of listing for transplant was 69\% lower (rate      ratio 0.31, p < 0.0005), rate of cardiac transplant was 89\% lower (rate ratio      0.11, p < 0.0005), and risk of chronic drive-line infection was 5.4 times higher       (rate ratio 5.4, p < 0.0005) in the substance abuse group. CONCLUSIONS: Active      substance abuse in patients who received an LVAD was associated with increased      mortality and overall poor outcomes. Larger scale data will be needed to confirm       these findings and to inform decision-making in this population.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
