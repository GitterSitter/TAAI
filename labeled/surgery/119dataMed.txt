Anti-coagulation strategies      used to treat this complication are empiric and without firm data for guidance.      The addition of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to intravenous      anti-coagulation has been suggested by several case series and recent guidelines.      The aim of this study was to evaluate our use of eptifibatide for the treatment      of suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center      cohort study was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The medical informatics      system was queried to identify all LVAD patients who received eptifibatide for      suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis from January 1, 2011, through April 30, 2013.       RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (16 HeartMate II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], 1      HeartWare [HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA]) with 22 separate      administration attempts received eptifibatide (dose range, 0.1-2 mug/kg/min) for       suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis presenting as one or more of the following      findings: elevated lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, elevated plasma       free hemoglobin, LVAD dysfunction, or new, persistently high LVAD power. The mean      time from device implantation to eptifibatide therapy was 47.34 days (range,      3.88-397.67 days). Of the 22 attempts, 5 (22.7\%) resulted in resolution of 1 or      more patient-specific indicators of LVAD thrombus/thrombosis. Three patients      (17.6\%) had resolution of an indicator while also remaining free from continued      hemolysis, death, pump exchange, or emergent heart transplant. Bleeding events      were common, with 11 patients (64.7\%) experiencing bleeding during the infusion.       Seven patients (41.2\%) died, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage as the cause of      death in 2 patients. Pump exchange was performed in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our       limited experience indicates the risk of using eptifibatide outweighs the      proposed benefit of salvaging the existing LVAD in the setting of suspected pump       thrombus/thrombosis at our institution.CI  - Published by International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation on      behalf of International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.FAU - Tellor, Bethany RAU  - Tellor BRAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri.
