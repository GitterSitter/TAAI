Five patients in our center had a      mechanical aortic valve at the time of device implantation and were studied      regarding thromboembolic complications. DESIGN: Five patients operated upon with       an LVAD (1 HeartMate I, 4 HeartMate II) between 2002 and 2011 had a mechanical      aortic valve at the time of implantation. The first patient had a patch closure      of the aortic valve. In four patients, the prosthesis was left in place.      Anticoagulants included aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel. RESULTS: The average       and accumulated treatment times were 150 and 752 days, respectively. Three of the      five patients showed early signs of valve thrombosis on echo with concomitant      valve dysfunction. Four patients were transplanted without thromboembolic events       during pump treatment. One patient died from a hemorrhagic stroke after 90 days      on the LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of leaving a mechanical heart valve in      place at the time of LVAD implantation in five patients led to valvular      thrombosis in three but did not provoke embolic events. It increased the      complexity of postoperative anticoagulation.FAU - Ahn, HenrikAU  - Ahn HAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine and Health Sciences,       Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Department of Cardiovascular      Surgery, County Council of Ostergotland, Linkoping, Sweden.
