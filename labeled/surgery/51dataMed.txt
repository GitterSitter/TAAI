With an increasing demand on       the supply of organs available for heart transplant, alternative strategies are      being sought to maintain patients with end-stage cardiac failure for longer      periods of time. Devices that support a failing heart, allowing cardiac recovery       in some cases, or more commonly accommodate the time to source a suitable donor      heart for transplantation, provide crucial therapeutic options. Extra-corporeal      membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices are the mainstay of such      bridging therapy. Although providing essential support to critically ill      patients, they are not without their own significant associated risks.      Therapeutic advances aim to reduce the risks associated with these bridging      systems, and new artificial devices are being developed to improve this      supportive care.FAU - Pincott, E SianAU  - Pincott ESAD  - Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, WCIN 3JH, UK.FAU - Burch, MichaelAU  - Burch MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Future CardiolJT  - Future cardiologyJID - 101239345SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - *Child WelfareMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*methodsMH  - Heart Failure/*surgery/therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - *PediatricsEDAT- 2012/09/28 06:00MHDA- 2013/02/21 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/28 06:00AID - 10.2217/fca.12.56 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Future Cardiol. 2012 Sep;8(5):753-63.- 23013126own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120927dcom- 20130219is  - 1744-8298 (electronic)is  - 1479-6678 (linking)vi  - 8ip  - 5dp  - 2012 septi  - mechanical bridging to orthotopic heart transplantation in children.pg  - 753-63ab  - this article discusses the main methods currently used in clinical practice to      support patients with end-stage heart failure and the research into new devices      under development, particularly for young children. with an increasing demand on       the supply of organs available for heart transplant, alternative strategies are      being sought to maintain patients with end-stage cardiac failure for longer      periods of time. devices that support a failing heart, allowing cardiac recovery       in some cases, or more commonly accommodate the time to source a suitable donor      heart for transplantation, provide crucial therapeutic options. extra-corporeal      membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices are the mainstay of such      bridging therapy. although providing essential support to critically ill      patients, they are not without their own significant associated risks.      therapeutic advances aim to reduce the risks associated with these bridging      systems, and new artificial devices are being developed to improve this      supportive care.fau - pincott, e sianau  - pincott esad  - department of cardiology, great ormond street hospital, london, wcin 3jh, uk.fau - burch, michaelau  - burch mla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - englandta  - future cardioljt  - future cardiologyjid - 101239345sb  - immh  - childmh  - *child welfaremh  - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/*methodsmh  - heart failure/*surgery/therapymh  - heart transplantation/*methodsmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - hemodynamicsmh  - humansmh  - *pediatricsedat- 2012/09/28 06:00mhda- 2013/02/21 06:00crdt- 2012/09/28 06:00aid - 10.2217/fca.12.56 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - future cardiol. 2012 sep;8(5):753-63.
