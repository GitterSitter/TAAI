The analysis is based on data from >10,000 patients and updates      demographics, survival, adverse events and risk factors. Among patients with      continuous-flow pumps, actuarial survival continues to be 80\% at 1 year and 70\%      at 2 years. The report features a comparison of two eras of continuous-flow      durable devices in the USA in terms of device strategy, patient profiles, adverse      event burden, survival and quality of life.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
