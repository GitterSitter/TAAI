Patients (pts) may need to be bridged with a continuous       flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) while on the transplant list as      logistic factors like organ availability are unknown. Cardiac transplantation      post-LVAD can be a surgically challenging procedure and outcome in these pts is      perceived to be poorer based on experience with earlier generation pulsatile flow      pumps. Data from a single institution comparing these pts with those undergoing      direct transplantation in the present era of continuous flow device therapy are      limited. AIM: Evaluate results of cardiac transplantation in pts bridged with a      CF-LVAD (BTx) and compare outcomes with pts undergoing direct transplantation      (Tx) in a single institution. RESULTS: From June 2007 till January 2012, 106 pts       underwent cardiac transplantation. Among these, 37 (35\%) pts (51+/-11 years; 85\%       male) were bridged with a CF-LVAD (BTx), while 70 (65\%) comprised the Tx group      (53+/-12 years; 72\% males). The median duration of LVAD support was 227 (153,327)      days. During the period of LVAD support, 10/37 (27\%) pts were upgraded to status       1A and all were successfully transplanted. Median hospital stay in the BTx (14      days) was slightly longer than the Tx group (12 days) but not statistically      significant (p=0.21). In-hospital mortality in the BTx (5\%) and Tx (1\%) were      comparable (p=0.25). Estimated late survival in the BTx cohort was 94+/-7,      90+/-10 and 83+/-16\% at the end of one, two and three years, respectively which      was comparable to 97+/-4\%, 93+/-6\% and 89+/-9\% for the Tx group (p=0.50).      CONCLUSION: Cardiac transplantation after LVAD implant can be performed with      excellent results. Patients can be supported on the left ventricular assist      device even for periods close to a year with good outcome after cardiac      transplantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic      Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ).
