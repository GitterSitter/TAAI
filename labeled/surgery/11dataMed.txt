In\r\nselected cases an implantable automatic defibrillator and/or resynchronisation therapy may be of\r\nadditional benefit. However, in some patients with end-stage heart failure these therapies are\r\ninsufficient. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can be an alternative in these subjects. The\r\ngoal of MCS is to support the circulation until transplantation (bridge to transplantation), or until\r\nthe heart recovers (bridge to recovery), or as a permanent treatment option. The third alternative,\r\nwhich is called destination therapy (DT), is a possible option for selected patients who are not\r\neligible for heart transplantation due to advanced age or comorbidities.\r\nQuestion at issue:\r\nDoes mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) reduce\r\nmorbidity, improve quality of life, and prolong survival in patients with end-stage heart failure\r\nnot eligible for heart transplantation in comparison to optimal medical treatment?\r\nPatients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO1 and PICO2)\r\nP = Patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure despite optimal medical treatment\r\nI1 = Left ventricular assist device with pulsatile flow (PF-LVAD)\r\nC1= Optimal medical treatment (OMT)\r\nI2 = Left ventricular assist device with continuous flow (CF-LVAD)\r\nC2= Left ventricular assist device with pulsatile flow (PF-LVAD)\r\nO = Survival, quality of life (QoL), functional capacity (NYHA classification, 6 minute walk test,\r\nexercise test) and biomarkers of heart failure. Complications such as infections,\r\nhaemorrhages, thromboembolic events, neuropsychological functions\r\nStudied risks and benefits for patients of the new health technology\r\nThe systematic literature search identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and one nonrandomised\r\ncontrolled study that have evaluated the effects of PF-LVAD in comparison to OMT,\r\nand one RCT and two non-randomised controlled studies that have evaluated the effects of PFLVAD\r\nin comparison to CF-LVAD in patients with terminal heart failure.\r\nPulsatile flow LVAD in comparison to optimal medical management (PICO1)\r\nConclusions: Pulsatile LVAD as destination therapy probably increases survival (GRADE\r\nïƒ…ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??), and may improve the functional capacity (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??ï??) in patients with terminal\r\nleft ventricular heart failure in comparison with OMT. It is uncertain whether the treatment has\r\nany effect on quality of life (GRADE ïƒ…ï??ï??ï??)\r\nContinuous flow LVAD in comparison to pulsatile flow LVAD (PICO2)\r\nConclusions: Continuous flow LVAD as destination therapy probably increases survival in\r\npatients with terminal left ventricular heart failure in comparison with PF-LVAD (GRADE\r\nïƒ…ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??). While both PF and CF flow devices have been shown to improve quality of life and\r\nfunctional outcome compared to baseline, there is only low quality evidence that CF may improve\r\nquality of life more than PF (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??ï??), and it is uncertain whether the effect on\r\nfunctional capacity differs between CF and PF. (GRADE ïƒ…ï??ï??ï??). \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 6(22)\r\nComplications\r\nLong-term MCS is hampered by several complications such as device malfunction, infections (20\r\nâ€“ 60 \%), bleeding (15 â€“ 30 \%), thromboembolic events (5 â€“ 25 \%) and right ventricular failure\r\n(10 â€“ 40 \%). The rate of adverse events has steadily declined over time with improved techniques.\r\nEthical aspects\r\nIntroduction of a DT program raises several ethical issues. The self-esteem and self-image of the\r\nindividual patient probably vary between subjects, but may be affected in both positive and\r\nnegative ways. The patient will still be dependent on assistance from family members and/or\r\nhealth care providers, and the physical integrity is affected. Without additional economic\r\nresources there is a substantial risk that DT will reallocate current resources from the needs of\r\nother patient categories.\r\nEconomical aspects\r\nThe present cost for the currently most used continuous flow device, the HeartMate II, is 750 000\r\nSEK (about 82 000 â‚¬) with an additional 125 000 SEK (ï‚»14 000 â‚¬) for necessary accessories. At\r\nSahlgrenska University hospital eight patients had a HeartMate II implanted as MCS for 12\r\nmonths or longer during 2010-2012. The average cost per patient for the first year was about 1.5\r\nmillion SEK (about 160 000 â‚¬).\r\nConcluding remark:\r\nTreatment with LVAD as DT increases survival in patients with terminal heart failure. It is costly\r\nand hampered by several serious complications. During the last decade costs have come down\r\nand the rate of complications have started to decline.\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 7(22)\r\nSwedish Summary of the Health Technology Assessment\r\nMekaniskt vÃ¤nsterkammarstÃ¶d som permanent behandling vid terminal hjÃ¤rtsvikt\r\nMetod och mÃ¥lgrupp:\r\nAvancerad hjÃ¤rtsvikt behandlas huvudsakligen farmakologiskt. I utvalda fall kan en automatisk\r\ndefibrillator eller sÃ¥ kallad resynkroneringsterapi sÃ¤ttas in i hjÃ¤rtat.

Parallellt med fÃ¶rbÃ¤ttrad teknik har frekvensen av olika bieffekter\r\nstadigt sjunkit under senare Ã¥r.\r\nEtiska aspekter:\r\nEtt behandlingsprogram med MCS har ett antal etiska konsekvenser. Effekten pÃ¥ individens\r\nsjÃ¤lvkÃ¤nsla och sjÃ¤lvbild varierar sannolikt mellan olika patienter och de kan pÃ¥verkas sÃ¥vÃ¤l\r\npositivt som negativt. Patienten kommer inte vara helt obereoende av andra utan fÃ¶rblir till viss\r\ndel beroende av hjÃ¤lp frÃ¥n familjemedlemmar och hÃ¤lso- och sjukvÃ¥rdspersonal. Den fysiska\r\nintegriteten pÃ¥verkas. Om inte nya ekonomiska resurser tillfÃ¶rs hÃ¤lso- och sjukvÃ¥rden Ã¤r risken\r\nstor att ett program med permanent MCS till patienter med terminal hjÃ¤rtsvikt kommer att ta\r\nresurser fÃ¶r andra patientkategorier.\r\nEkonomiska aspekter:\r\nKostnaden fÃ¶r den idag mest anvÃ¤nda CF-LVAD, HeartMate II, Ã¤r 750 000 SEK. Ytterligare 125\r\n000 SEK tillkommer fÃ¶r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndiga tillbehÃ¶r. PÃ¥ Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset har Ã¥tta\r\npatienter fÃ¥tt en HeartMate II inplanterad som MCS fÃ¶r lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n 12 mÃ¥nader under Ã¥ren 2010-\r\n2012. Den genomsnittliga behandlingskostnaden per patient fÃ¶r det fÃ¶rsta Ã¥ret var cirka 1,5\r\nmiljoner SEK.\r\nSlutsatser:\r\nMekaniskt vÃ¤nsterkammarstÃ¶d som permanent behandling kan fÃ¶rlÃ¤nga Ã¶verlevnaden hos\r\npatienter med terminal hjÃ¤rtsvikt och minska 1-Ã¥rsdÃ¶dligheten med cirka 30 \% . Behandlingen Ã¤r\r\nfÃ¶renad med hÃ¶g kostnad och fÃ¶rsvÃ¥ras av flera allvarliga komplikationer.

The\r\ndysfunctions may have various underlying causes. The heart failure syndrome is multifaceted and\r\nnot readily defined. Below are three definitions that describe heart failure from different\r\nviewpoints.\r\n1. Acute and hemodynamic viewpoint\r\n- a pathological state in which an abnormality of cardiac function is responsible for failure of\r\nthe heart to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing\r\ntissues, or to do so only from an elevated filling pressure. (Braunwald E. 1997)\r\n2. Chronic and neurohumoral viewpoint\r\n- a clinical syndrome characterized by abnormalities of left ventricular function and\r\nneurohormonal regulation, which are accompanied by effort intolerance, fluid retention and\r\nreduced longevity. (Packer M. 1992)\r\n3. Clinical and diagnostic viewpoint\r\n- a clinical syndrome in which patients have the following features: symptoms typical of\r\nheart failure and signs typical of heart failure and objective signs of a structural or functional\r\nabnormality of the heart at rest. (European Society of Cardiology 1995)\r\nThe syndrome is characterized by inability of the heart to maintain adequate blood flow and/or\r\nnormal filling pressures during physical activity or in later stages also at rest. A number of\r\nneurohumoral compensatory mechanisms are activated in order to maintain the circulation. Over\r\ntime they have a deleterious effect on the heart with further deterioration of cardiac function. A\r\nvicious cycle arises. If untreated this leads to a continuous decline of cardiac function and\r\nprogressive worsening of the symptoms. Clinical symptoms consist mainly of fatigue,\r\nbreathlessness and fluid retention. This frequently leads to hospitalisation. Quality of life is\r\nimpaired and mortality is high.\r\nDuring work up of a heart failure patient, it is important to evaluate the underlying cause of\r\ncardiac failure, the degree of cardiac dysfunction and the functional capacity of the patient.\r\nPharmacologic treatment is aimed at reducing the deleterious effects of neurohumoral activation\r\nand to alleviate fluid retention. In selected patients a pacemaker system may improve left\r\nventricular dyssynchrony and an implantable defibrillator can prevent sudden cardiac death. In\r\nterminal heart failure, mechanical circulatory assist devices or heart transplantation can be an\r\nalternative to palliative care.\r\nHeart failure is a serious condition with an increased\r\nï‚· risk of premature death\r\nï‚· risk of permanent illness or damage, or reduced quality of life\r\nï‚· risk of disability and impaired health-related quality of life\r\nThe prevalence and incidence of heart failure\r\nIn a recently published report the prevalence of chronic heart failure in Sweden was estimated to\r\n2 \% (Zarinkoub R et al. 2013). The mean age of heart failure patients was 77 years, and more than\r\n90 \% of the patients were 60 years or older. The estimated incidence rate of chronic heart failure\r\nwas 3.8/1000. The 5-year survival rate from first diagnosis was 48 \%, which is considerably\r\nlower than in the general Swedish population matched for age and sex (95\%).\r\nIn other community-based cohorts the annual survival rate in patients diagnosed with mild heart\r\nfailure (NYHA I-II) has been shown to be around 95 \%, whereas the 1-year survival rate for those\r\ndiagnosed with severe heart failure (NYHA IV) has been reported to below 50 \%. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 11(22)\r\nPresent treatment of heart failure\r\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, optimize cardiac function and increase longevity.\r\nThis can be achieved in most cases with the currently available treatment alternatives. They\r\ninclude different pharmacological, electric, mechanical and surgical options. On the other hand, it\r\nis also important to identify patients in the terminal phase of the disease, who are not suitable for\r\nadvanced treatment with devices, mechanical pumps or heart transplantation. These patients\r\nshould receive supportive and palliative care to provide relief from symptoms and other distress\r\nassociated with end-stage heart failure.\r\nPharmacological intervention is the cornerstone of heart failure treatment. It is well documented\r\nthat neurohumoral blockade of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angotensinaldosteron-system\r\nreduce symptoms, improve cardiac function and increase survival. Four\r\ndifferent pharmaceutical groups are currently recommended for treatment of heart failure; beta\r\nblockers, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralcorticoid receptor\r\nantagonists. Diuretics are frequently used to control fluid retention. Other drugs that sometimes\r\nare used are ivabradin (sinus node inhibitor), digoxin (inotropic agent), hydralazine and\r\nisosorbiddinitrate (vasodilators), and anticoagulant agents (thromboembolic prophylaxis).\r\nAbout one third of all patients with heart failure die suddenly, mainly due to a ventricular\r\ntachyarrhythmia. The implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) reduces mortality in\r\npatients with moderate to severe systolic heart failure. One third of patients with heart failure has\r\nan intraventricular conduction disturbance that can cause left ventricular dyssynchrony with less\r\nefficient ventricular emptying and, often, mitral regurgitation. Cardiac resynchronization therapy\r\n(CRT) can improve cardiac function in these patients, relieve symptoms, improve functional\r\ncapacity, and improve survival. Currently, patients who fulfil the criteria for CRT treatment most\r\noften also receive an ICD.\r\nAlso surgical interventions may be indicated for specific underlying or contributing causes of\r\nheart failure. These include revascularization in patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular\r\nsurgery in patients with valvular disease, and left ventricular reconstruction in patients with\r\nextensive scarring and remodelling of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction. For a small\r\nminority of heart failure patients heart transplantation may be indicated. The indication for heart\r\ntransplantation is terminal heart failure with severe symptoms, poor prognosis, and no remaining\r\ntreatment alternatives. However, due to organ shortage this treatment is only available to a limited\r\nnumber of patients (approximately 50 annually in Sweden).\r\nContraindications to a cardiac transplant are high pulmonary vascular resistance, active infection,\r\nwidespread atherosclerotic disease, drug abuse, malignant disease, recent thromboembolism,\r\nsignificant renal or liver disease, or other serious non-reversible co-morbidies. At Sahlgrenska\r\nUniversity Hospital 20-30 heart transplantations are performed each year including approximately\r\n5-7 recepients from the Region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland.\r\nSelected patients with progressive heart failure in whom pharmacological and/or\r\nresynchronisation therapy are insufficient can be treated with mechanical circulatory support\r\n(MCS). The goal of MCS is to support the circulation until transplantation (bridge to\r\ntransplantation) or until the heart recovers (bridge to recovery), or to offer a permanent treatment\r\noption, which has been called destination therapy (DT). Presently, DT is not available as a\r\ntreatment alternative in routine clinical practice in Region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland, Sweden. In countries\r\nsuch as USA and Germany the number of patients who receive MCS as DT has now exceeded\r\nthat of patients treated with heart transplantation. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 12(22)\r\nNumbers of patients per year who are candidates for LVAD as destination therapy\r\nPotential candidates for DT are patients with end-stage heart failure who are not considered\r\nsuitable for heart transplantation due to advanced age and/or severe co-morbidities.\r\nExamples of customary criteria for identification of end-stage heart failure are the following:\r\nï‚· Left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤ 35\%\r\nï‚· Max VO2 â‰¤ 14 ml/kg/min on cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)\r\nï‚· 6 minute walking distance â‰¤ 300 m\r\nï‚· More than one hospitalisation during 6 months\r\nï‚· Intolerance of ACE-inhibitors and/or beta-blockers\r\nï‚· Low systolic blood pressure (< 90 mmHg)\r\nï‚· Inotrope dependence in-hospital and difficult to wean\r\nï‚· Worsening renal and/or liver function\r\nï‚· Worsening right ventricular function.\r\nApart from advanced age, there are several co-morbidities that render heart failure patients\r\nineligible for heart transplantation, but not for treatment with destination therapy: Examples of\r\nsuch co-morbidities are: BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2\r\n, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, cancer\r\ntreatment within 5 years, and reduced pulmonary, renal and/or liver function. However, only a\r\nsmall fraction of all patients with end-stage heart failure should be considered candidates for DT.\r\nFor example, it is vital that potential DT candidates are emotionally stable and able to comply\r\nwith MCS treatment. Absolute contraindications for MCS include active infection, widespread\r\natherosclerotic disease, terminal disease other than heart failure, dialysis, severe liver cirrhosis,\r\nalcohol or drug abuse, and untreated psychiatric disease.\r\nThus, identification of potential candidates for DT is a highly selective process. It is estimated\r\nthat around 5-10 patients would fulfil the criteria for DT each year in Region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland.\r\nThe normal pathway of patients with terminal heart failure through the health care\r\nsystem\r\nPatients who are considered candidates for heart transplantation undergo a thorough in-hospital\r\nwork-up before they are discussed at a multidisciplinary board. The board consists of\r\ncardiologists, thoracic surgeons, thoracic anaesthesiologists, heart failure nurses and patient\r\ncoordinators. The work-up includes extensive laboratory investigations and a thorough\r\ninvestigation of cardiac function with echocardiography and cardiac catheterisation. Further\r\nfunctional capacity is evaluated with CPET and/or 6-minute walking test. Renal function is\r\nassessed by glomerular filtration rate and pulmonary function is estimated by spirometry. An\r\nodontologist evaluates the dental status.\r\nThe patients who are accepted for transplantation ofte receive MCS as bridge to transplantation.\r\nPatients that are declined heart transplantation due to advanced age or comorbidities continue to\r\nreceive conventional heart failure treatment, often combined with supportive and/or palliative\r\ncare.\r\nThe work-up and decision process for DT is very similar to that used for heart transplantation. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 13(22)\r\nThe New Health Technology â€“ Left Ventricular Assisted Device\r\nDescription of left ventricular assisted device\r\nA ventricular assist device (VAD) is a mechanical circulatory device that is used to partially, or\r\ncompletely, replace the function of a failing heart. It takes blood from a ventricle of the heart and\r\npumps it to the circulation, and thereby secures perfusion of vital organs. A VAD can support the\r\nleft ventricle (LVAD), the right ventricle (RVAD), or both ventricles (BIVAD).\r\nA VAD consists of a small pump, a tube that carries blood from a heart ventricle into the pump,\r\nand another tube that carries the blood from the pump to either the pulmonary artery (RVAD) or\r\nthe aorta (LVAD). It also has a driveline that connects the pump to a power source through a\r\ncontrol unit. The figures illustrate a LVAD (Courtesy of Thoratec corporation).\r\nVADs can be divided into two main categories. Firstly, pulsatile flow (PF) pumps that mimic the\r\nnatural pulsing action of the heart (first generation VADs), and secondly, continuous flow (CF)\r\ndevices that generate continuous blood flow with either a centrifugal or an axial pump (second\r\ngeneration VADs). Patients treated with a VAD require life-long anticoagulation therapy in order\r\nto prevent thrombus formation and thromboembolic complications.\r\nThe groupâ€™s understanding of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy in\r\npatients with terminal heart failure\r\nThe use of LVADs for DT has steadily increased, especially in countries such as Germany,\r\nFrance, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and USA. In 2010 there were 79 destinationtherapy\r\ncentres in USA certified to perform implantation of LVADs. According to the\r\nINTERMACS registry (only including US patients) approximately 1000 patients received LVAD\r\nas DT-therapy in 2012, and another 800 patients received LVAD as bridge-to-transplantation\r\n(BTT).\r\nSome patients that initially have been regarded as excellent BTT candidates will eventually not\r\nbecome eligible for heart transplantation due to progression of co-morbidities or new\r\ncomplications. On the other hand, some patients being identified, as DT-candidates will after\r\nLVAD implantations improve in such a way that they become suitable for a cardiac\r\ntransplantation. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 14(22)\r\nIn 2012 approximately 700 patients had an LVAD implanted in Germany, and only 300 heart\r\ntransplantations were performed. This means that most patients with terminal heart failure receive\r\na LVAD initially, and later it is decided whether they should be listed for transplantation or\r\nremain on DT.\r\nThere is no Swedish VAD registry, but there is some information available on DT in Sweden\r\nfrom a company registry (Vingmed AB, the sales representative for Thoratec and the Heart Mate\r\nII). In total, 25 patients have received a LVAD (Heart Mate II) for DT in Sweden between 2005\r\nand 2013 (survival range 2 - 2216 days, mean age 63 years, 22 males, 18 patients had ischemic\r\ncardiomyopathy). Among these patients, six (24 \%) died within 90 days. The remaining 19\r\npatients have survived for a mean of 815 days (with 9 patients still alive). Six of the patients (24\r\n\%) patients eventually underwent heart transplantation, again underlining that DT patients on\r\nLVAD may improve to such an extent that they become suitable candidates for transplantation. It\r\nseems necessary to have a DT program in order to give all patients a chance to become\r\ntransplanted, even if the majority will remain on LVAD for the rest of their lives. Thus, DTtherapy\r\nas an entity and definition is slowly becoming obsolete. If permanent LVAD treatment is\r\nnot available, patients with transplant precluding comorbidities that might resolve during\r\nmechanical support will not get an opportunity for transplantation.\r\nDuring the last decade, the LVAD technology has progressed to become standard therapy in\r\nsome medical centres. It is important that all centres that provide DT use best-practice guidelines\r\nto maintain outcomes that are comparable to those of existing centres of excellence.\r\nThe ethical concerns raised by DT will require extensive information to patients and their\r\nfamilies, and also a detailed DT program that will meet the needs of patients and other family\r\nmembers. Examples of prerequisite conditions before introducing a program with destination\r\ntherapy include:\r\n1. Participation of a multidisciplinary care team, including palliative care specialists\r\n2. Adopting a concise plan of care for anticipated device-related complications\r\n3. Planning for anticipated end-of-life care and timing of device deactivation\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 15(22)\r\nThe Central Question at Issue\r\nDoes mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) reduce\r\nmorbidity, improve quality of life, and prolong survival in patients with end-stage heart failure\r\nnot eligible for heart transplantation, in comparison to optimal medical treatment?\r\nPICO\r\nP= Patients, I= Intervention, C= Comparison, O=Outcome\r\nPICO 1\r\nP = Patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure despite optimal medical treatment\r\nI = Left ventricular assist device with pulsatile flow (PF-LVAD)\r\nheart transplant\r\nC = Optimal medical treatment (OMT)\r\nO = Survival, quality of life (QoL), functional capacity (NYHA classification, 6 minute walk\r\ntest, exercise test) and biomarkers of heart failure.

The librarians conducted the literature\r\nsearches, selected studies, and independently assessed the obtained abstracts and\r\nmade a first selection of full-text articles for inclusion or exclusion. After reading\r\nthe articles in full text they made a second selection of articles. Any disagreements\r\nwere resolved in consensus. The articles that remained were sent to the other\r\nparticipants in the HTA group, who read the articles independently of one another,\r\nand then decided in a consensus meeting which articles that should be included.\r\nThe literature search identified a total of 1231 articles (after removal of duplicates).\r\nThe librarians then excluded 1095 articles after reading their abstracts. Another 136\r\narticles were excluded by the librarians after reading the articles in full text. The\r\nremaining 56 articles were sent to the group, and 26 of them were finally included\r\nin the report. There were two randomised controlled trials (RCT, four publications)\r\nand three non-randomised controlled studies (three publications). Twelve were case\r\nseries, five were systematic reviews, and two were health economy analyses. The\r\ncontrolled studies have been critically appraised using modified checklists from the\r\nSwedish Council on Health Technology Assessment regarding randomized\r\ncontrolled trials and cohort studies.\r\nThe present knowledge of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy\r\nin patients with terminal heart failure\r\nPICO 1 â€“ comparison of PF-LVAD with OMT\r\nTwo HTA reports have concluded that LVAD with pulsatile flow improves survival\r\nand quality of life. One was published in 2005 by the NIHR Coordinating Centre for\r\nHealth Technology Assessment (NCCHTA) in Southampton, UK (Clegg AJ et al.\r\n2005), and the other in 2007 by the German Agency for HTA of German Institute of\r\nMedical Documentation and Information (Angermayr L et al. 2007).\r\nThe systematic literature search identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT)\r\nand one non-randomised controlled study that have studied the effects of PF-LVAD\r\nin comparison to OMT in patients with end-stage heart failure. In the RCT 61\r\npatients were treated with OMT and 68 patients were treated with the pulsatile\r\nLVAD HeartMate I. The trial had no major problems concerning directness, study\r\nlimitations or precision. The non-randomised study was smaller and the two study\r\ngroups were not balanced with regard to socio-economic status. The patients in the\r\ncontrol group consisted of patients who did not choose, or did not have the financial\r\nresources, to undergo LVAD implantation.\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 17(22)\r\nMortality (Appendix 4a)\r\nThe RCT reported a significantly (p< 0.01) higher one-year survival in the PFLVAD\r\ngroup (52 \%) compared to the OMT group (23 \%). The two-year survival\r\nrates were 23 \%, and 8 \% respectively (ns). In the non-randomised study, the\r\ncorresponding 1-year survival rates were 27 \% and 11\% (p>0.05).\r\nConclusion: Pulsatile LVAD as destination therapy probably increases survival in\r\ncomparison with OMT in patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure.\r\nModerate quality of evidence (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??).\r\nQuality of life (Appendix 4b)\r\nThe RCT analysed quality of life after one year using three different questionnaires.\r\nDue to the high mortality rate QoL-scores were only available in six OMT and 23\r\nPF-LVAD patients. The SF-36 Emotional role and Beck Depression Inventory\r\nscores were significantly better in the PF-LVAD group, but no difference between\r\nthe study groups was seen in Minnesota Living with heart Failure scores.\r\nConclusion: It is uncertain whether PF-LVAD improves the quality of life in\r\ncomparison with OMT in patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure.\r\nVery low quality of evidence (GRADE ïƒ…ï??ï??ï??)\r\nFunctional capacity (Appendix 4c)\r\nBoth the RCT and the non-randomised study analysed functional capacity after oneyear\r\nfollow-up. Due to the high mortality rate only six OMT-patients and 23\r\nLVAD-patients were tested in the RCT. Both the ability to â€œwalk one block without\r\nany physical limitationâ€? and SF-36 physical function score were significantly better\r\nin the PF-LVAD group than in the OMT group. In the non-randomised study 11 of\r\n18 patients in the OMT and 22 of 37 patients in the PF-LVAD group were evaluated\r\nby the NYHA classification. At the last assessment all patients in the OMT were\r\nstill in NYHA class IV, while 85 \% of the patients in the PF-LVAD group had\r\nimproved to NYHA class I-II.\r\nConclusion: PF-LVAD may improve the functional capacity in comparison with\r\nOMT in patients with end-stage left ventricular heart failure.\r\nLow quality of evidence (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??ï??ï??)\r\nPICO 2 â€“ comparison of CF-LVAD with PF-LVAD\r\nTwo published reviews have assessed the effects of the newer continuous flow\r\ndevices (CF-LVAD) in patients with end-stage heart failure. One is a systematic\r\nreview from the Department of Veteran Affairs, US, published in 2011 (Rector TS\r\net al. 2012). It concludes that one single study provides moderate evidence that the\r\nuse of the HeartMate II LVAD increases patient survival, with fewer complications\r\nand fewer hospitalizations compared to the older pulsatile flow LVAD HeartMate I.\r\nThe other review is from Quebec (INESS) published in 2012 (Sas G et al. 2012). It\r\nconcludes that CF-LVAD can be considered a clinically effective therapeutic option\r\ncompared to optimal medical treatment for appropriate patients in both BTT and DT\r\npatients.\r\nThe systematic literature search identified one RCT and two non-randomised\r\ncontrolled studies that have studied the effects of PF-LVAD in comparison to CFLVAD\r\nin patients with end-stage heart failure. In the RCT the patients were\r\nrandomised in a 2:1 ratio. Thus, 134 patients received a continuous flow HeartMate\r\nII and 66 patients received a pulsatile flow HeartMate I. The study had some \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 18(22)\r\nproblems with directness and precision (see Appendix 7, SoF table). The two nonrandomised\r\ntrials had major problems, as most of the pulsatile LVADs were\r\nimplanted some years before the continuous flow devices came in use. Thus, the\r\npatient study groups with PF-LVADs must be regarded as historical controls.\r\nMortality (Appendix 5a)\r\nThe RCT reported a one-year survival of 68 \% in the CF-LVAD group and 55 \% in\r\nthe PF-LVAD group. The survival was significantly better ( p< 0.01) in the CFLVAD\r\ngroup after two years with a survival rate of 58 \% in comparison to 24 \% in\r\nthe PF-LVAD group. Both the non-randomised studies reported significantly higher\r\ntwo-year survival rates in the patients who received a CF-LVAD.\r\nConclusion: Continuous flow LVAD as destination therapy probably increases\r\nsurvival in patients with end-stage heart failure in comparison with pulsatile flow\r\nLVAD.\r\nModerate quality of evidence (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??).\r\nQuality of life (Appendix 5b)\r\nOnly the RCT analysed the quality of life. This was done after one year and two\r\nyears follow-up using two different questionnaires. However, the small numbers of\r\npatients at the two-year follow-up did not allow any meaningful analyses. QoL\r\nimproved in both LVAD groups in comparison to baseline. According to Minnesota\r\nLiving with Heart Failure questionnaire, QoL was significantly better in the CFLVAD\r\ngroup compared to the PF-LVAD group after one year, whereas the\r\ndifference in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire did not reach statistical\r\nsignificance (p = 0.06).\r\nConclusion: PF-LVAD may improve the quality of life in patients with end-stage\r\nleft ventricular heart failure in comparison with PF-LVAD.\r\nLow quality of evidence (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…ï??ï??)\r\nFunctional capacity (Appendix 5c)\r\nOnly the RCT analysed functional capacity. As for the QoL analyses, only the data\r\nat 12-month follow-up allowed a meaningful comparison. Both study groups\r\nexperienced early, and sustained, improvement of functional capacity. However,\r\nthere was no significant difference between the two groups.\r\nConclusion: It is uncertain whether CF-LVAD and PF-LVAD differ in their effects\r\non functional capacity.\r\nVery low quality of evidence (GRADE ïƒ…ï??ï??ï??).\r\nComplications (Appendix 6)\r\nLong-term MCS is hampered by several complications such as device malfunction,\r\ninfections, bleeding, thromboembolic events and right ventricular failure (RVF).\r\nThe rate of adverse events has steadily declined with improved techniques (second\r\ngeneration LVAD vs first generation).\r\nInfections are a significant problem. They often occur at the driveline exit site. The\r\nreported incidence is up to 40 \% per year (events/patient/year). Sepsis is also\r\ncommon with reported incidence rates varying from 20 \% to 60 \% in different\r\nstudies. Infections that involve the pump itself are uncommon, but are serious since\r\nlong-term eradication is nearly impossible.\r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 19(22)\r\nBleeding events are common. Perioperative bleeding occurs, in particular in patients\r\nwith previous cardiac operations and/or coagulopathy related to hepatic dysfunction.\r\nRe-exploration due to a post-operative bleeding has been reported to be required in\r\n15 â€“ 30 \%. Bleeding complications during long-term follow-up are also frequent, in\r\nparticular gastrointestinal bleeding, with incidence rates up to 50 \%\r\n(events/patient/year).\r\nPatients with LVADs may also suffer thromboembolic complications. The reported\r\nincidence of ischemic stroke varies between 5 - 25 \%. Pump thrombus may occur,\r\nand sometimes necessitates pump replacement if aggressive anticoagulation or\r\nthrombolytic therapies are not successful.\r\nIt is essential that the right ventricular function is adequate for an LVAD to function\r\nnormally. Right ventricular failure occurs in10 - 40 \% of patients who receive\r\nLVAD as bridge-to-transplantation.. The incidence of RVF in adequately selected\r\npatients for DT is not known. Treatment includes optimization of the right\r\nventricular function, management of pulmonary vasoconstriction, and in some cases\r\ntemporary support with a right ventricular assist device.\r\nOngoing research?\r\nA search in the ClinicalTrials database (www.clinicaltrials.gov) July 4, 2013, using the\r\nsearch terms (heart-assist device OR left ventricular assist device OR left ventricular\r\nassist system OR ventricular assist device OR VAD OR LVAD OR LVAS) AND\r\n(destination OR permanent OR non-transplant OR long-term OR ineligible OR \"not\r\nassist support devices\r\neligible\" OR \"not candidate\" OR non-candidate) identified 33 studies with regard to\r\nLVADs. Five studies were relevant for the present questions at issue.\r\nTwo studies will compare the CF-LVAD HeartMate II with optimal medical therapy.\r\nBoth of them are being performed in the USA. One of them is an RCT (REVIVE-IT), and\r\nit is currently recruiting patients. The estimated completion date is December 2016. The\r\nother study one is a non-randomised study that is ongoing. Its estimated completion date\r\nis December 2015.\r\nAnother two RCTs are ongoing. They compare either the LVADs Jarvik 2000 with Heart\r\nMate II (estimated completion date December 2016), or the HeartWear LVAD with â€œany\r\nother FDA approved LVADâ€? (estimated completion date May 2017). Both are being\r\nperformed in the USA. The former is still recruiting patients whereas the other is not.\r\nA fifth study is ongoing in Belgium. It is a non-randomised study that will compare the\r\nefficacy of HeartMate II with historical controls.\r\nWhich medical societies or health authorities recommend left ventricular assist devices as\r\ndestination therapy in patients with terminal heart failure?\r\nIn the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and\r\nchronic heart failure 2012 DT it is recommended for highly selected patients, who have end-stage\r\nheart failure despite optimal pharmacological and device therapy, and who are not suitable for\r\nheart transplantation, but are expected to survive over one year with good functional status, to\r\nimprove symptoms, and reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and of premature death\r\n(Eur Soc Cardiol. 2012) \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 20(22)\r\nThe 2013 ACCF/ American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure\r\nalso recommended DT with durable MCS to prolong survival for carefully selected patients with\r\nstage D heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ACCF/AHA 2013).\r\nIn the Swedish National Guidelines for Cardiovascular Diseases from 2008 it is concluded that\r\nDT may improve survival, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with advanced heart\r\nfailure (NYHA IIIB-IV) that receive OMT and are not eligible for heart transplantation\r\n(Socialstyrelsen 2008). However, the ratio of cost to quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was\r\nconsidered to be very high. In these guidelines, which are those available in Sweden today, DT is\r\nnot recommended for routine use. Instead it is advocated that further results from on-going\r\nstudies should be awaited.\r\nEthical Aspects\r\nSee Appendix 8\r\nOrganisation\r\nWhen can left ventricular assist device for destination therapy be put into practice at the\r\nhospital?\r\nImmediately.\r\nIs left ventricular assist device for destination therapy used in other hospitals in Region\r\nVÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland, Sweden?\r\nNo. At the present, DT is not available for patients with end-stage heart failure in Region VÃ¤stra\r\nGÃ¶taland. In the Stockholm Region there is currently a treatment program with DT, and up until\r\nnow a total of 15-20 patients have received this treatment (Dr LH Lund, Karolinska University\r\nHospital, Stockholm, Sweden, personal communication October 2013).\r\nWill there be any consequences of left ventricular assist device for destination therapy for\r\nthe personnel?\r\nCurrently, mechanical circulatory support systems are frequently utilized as BTT, and the\r\nhospital personnel are already familiar with the treatment. Introduction of DT would lead to an\r\nincreased number of patients with long-term follow-up.\r\nWill there be any consequences for other clinics or supporting functions at the hospital or\r\nin the whole Region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland?\r\nYes. Initial, follow-up of the patients will take place at the outpatient clinic of the Department\r\nof Cardiology Sahlgrenska Hospital. Later on follow-up visits will also be necessary at the local\r\nhospitals. However, there will only be a few patients (less than 10) requiring follow-up during\r\nthe first years after the initiation of a DT program. \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 21(22)\r\nEconomy Aspects\r\nPresent costs of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device\r\nThe current cost for the CF-LVAD HeartMate II implant kit is 750,000 SEK\r\n(ï‚»82,000 â‚¬), and for accessories 125,000 SEK (ï‚»14 000 â‚¬).\r\nDuring 2010-2012, 8 patients had an implanted HeartMate II as mechanical circulatory support\r\nfor 12 months or longer. The average cost for the first year was about 1.5 million SEK\r\n(including the cost of the implant kit and accessories) ranging between 1.4-2.7 million SEK\r\n(ï‚»153,000 â€“ 295,000 â‚¬). The cost was related to the number of in-hospital days, especially the\r\nnumber of days in the intensive care unit. The average length of hospital stay was 50.5 days\r\n(range 29-95).\r\nAs a comparison, three patients with terminal heart failure (NYHA class III-IV) who have been\r\nfollowed for more than one year with OMT were identified. The costs for these patients\r\nbetween June 2011 to May 2012, i.e. one year, were 132,000 SEK (ï‚»14,000 â‚¬) , 759,000 SEK\r\n(ï‚»144,000 â‚¬) and 1,909,000 SEK (ï‚»208,000 â‚¬), respectively. Also in these cases the yearly\r\ncosts was directly related to the length of hospital stay (range: 17- 134 days).\r\nIn the calculations of the costs for CF-LVAD and OMT above, the costs of home care are not\r\nincluded (due to different management systems).\r\nIn 2010, the average cost for heart transplantation was approximately 1.25 million SEK\r\n(ï‚»136,000 â‚¬). This includes only the surgical procedure and the postoperative hospital stay. The\r\ncosts of follow-up and later hospitalisations are not included.\r\nExpected costs of left ventricular assist device in patients with terminal heart failure\r\nSee 9a.\r\nTotal change of cost of left ventricular assist device in patients with terminal heart failure\r\nThe cost of 10 patients treated with LVAD (see 2d) during the first year is estimated to be about\r\n15 million SEK. Assuming that the corresponding cost for a patient treated with OMT is\r\n750,000 SEK, the change in cost will be an increase of 7.5 million SEK.\r\nSince patients with LVAD are expected to live longer this will add further increments in the\r\ntotal costs during the following years. It is difficult to estimate this additional cost.\r\nCan the use of left ventricular assist device in patients with terminal heart failure be\r\nadopted and used within the present clinic budget?\r\nNo.\r\nAre there any available analyses of health economy? Cost advantages or disadvantages?\r\nThere is no Swedish cost-effectiveness analysis.\r\nIn the German HTA report (Angermayer 2007), which was based predominately on studies of\r\nthe first generation LVADs, i.e. PF-LVADS, the conclusion was that â€œthe incremental costs per\r\nquality-adjusted life years (QALYs) may be between 200 000 and 600 000 â‚¬ for DTâ€?. Similar \r\n HTA-report: LVAD in heart failure 22(22)\r\nconclusions were made in a British expert review from 2008 that could identify four published\r\ncost-effectiveness studies (Hutchinson 2008). However, they also pointed out that the\r\nmethodological quality in the majority of the studies was poor, as was their generalizability.\r\nA Canadian HTA report published in 2012 concluded that the cost-effectiveness of Heart Mate\r\nII was â€œunfavourableâ€? regardless of the initial indication (Sas 2012). However, the conclusions\r\nwere based predominantly on experiences of HeartMate II and mostly as BTT. Since these\r\npatients relatively soon get a transplant, the real cost benefit of the LVAD is therefore\r\nunderestimated when data are extrapolated to the DT indication.\r\nThere have been no studies that directly have compared CF-LVADS with OMT. Rogers et al.\r\nused data from the REMATCH trial and the Heart Mate II trial to indirectly estimate the costeffectiveness\r\nof using the CF-LVAD Heart Mate II (Rogers 2012). Compared with medical\r\nmanagement the CF-LVAD had higher 5-year costs ($360 407 versus $62 856) and QALYs\r\n(1.87 vs 0.37). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the CF-LVAD was estimated to be\r\n$198 184 per QALY (this corresponds to about 1.2 million SEK/QALY).\r\nUnanswered Questions\r\nImportant gaps in scientific knowledge\r\nThere are no published RCTs that have compared the outcomes of modern CF-LVADs with OMT\r\nwith regard to survival, functional capacity, or quality of life. Such a trial would presently be of\r\ngreat interest, since pharmacological treatment, resynchronization therapy, and the overall\r\nmanagement of heart failure have improved during the last decade (after the publication of the\r\nRCT that initially compared PF-LVAD with OMT). It is of interest to point out that such a trial is\r\npresently considered unethical in the USA.\r\nIs there any interest in your own clinic/research group/organisation to start studies/trials\r\nwithin the research field at issue?\r\nYes. We are interested in starting a prospective, randomized multicentre trial in Sweden\r\nevaluating the HeartMate IIÂ® LVAD versus OMT in patients with severe heart failure (NYHA\r\nIIIb-IV) that are not eligible for heart transplantation. In such a study we would aim to include\r\n100-120 patients and randomize them to HM II or OMT in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome\r\nwould be a composite endpoint of survival, freedom from debilitating stroke and improved\r\nfunctional capacity. Patient recruitment would be expected to take 18 months and each\r\nincluded patient would be followed for 18 months.\r\nThe Departments of Cardiology and Thoracic Surgery at all Swedish University Hospitals have\r\nshown interest in such a study and are willing to participate. A reference group with\r\nparticipants from all university hospitals has been engaged to work on a study protocol. The\r\ninitial response from the LVAD industry (Thoratec) has been positive and negotiations with\r\nrespect to specific terms regarding such a study are ongoing.

From the patient\s perspective, how does destination therapy (DT) affect the patient\s\r\nquality of life and life expectancy?\r\nThe patient will have a longer life expectancy, probably with better quality of life and\r\nfunctional capacity. In addition, DT may resolve the contraindication to heart transplantation\r\nand thereby restore transplant eligibility, with further expected improvement in quality of life\r\nand life expectancy.\r\n2. How severe is the patient\s need that the DT must meet?\r\nThe mortality of end stage heart failure is very high, and it is associated with severely reduced\r\nfunctional capacity, poor quality of life and frequent hospitalisations. The 1-year survival for\r\npatients diagnosed with severe heart failure (NYHA IV) on optimal medical treatment is\r\nbelow 50 \%.\r\n3. Does DT influence the view on humanity or human dignity?\r\nNo, probably not from the view of other individuals. However, to have a mechanical device\r\nimplanted in your own body may affect the subjectâ€™s self-esteem and self-image.\r\n4. Can DT affect the patientâ€™s ability and possibility to be independent?\r\nDT is likely to improve the functional capacity and, thereby, the independency of the patient.\r\nHowever, continuous need for electric power either from a power base unit or from batteries\r\nmay in other ways limit independency. The patient will also need assistance to change the\r\nbandages around the driveline. Thus, total independence will not be achieved.\r\n5. If implemented, does DT require any special steps to not compromise the patient\s\r\nautonomy?\r\nDT is likely to introduce a specific challenge to the patient with respect to autonomy. In this\r\nrespect it is important to inform the patient extensively about the treatment, including\r\npotential benefits and risks. Also, of importance for the patientâ€™s autonomy is that the DT\r\nprogram should include the following:\r\n1. Participation of a multidisciplinary care team, including palliative care specialists\r\n2. Adopting a concise plan of care for anticipated device-related complications\r\n3. Planning for anticipated end-of-life care and timing of device deactivation\r\n6. How does DT affect the patientâ€™s physical, moral and personal integrity?\r\nThe moral and personal integrity will most probably not be negatively affected by DT.\r\nHowever the physical integrity is interrupted by the highly invasive nature of the implantation\r\nprocedure.\r\n7. Is DT cost-effective?\r\nAttempts to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DT have reported that incremental costs per\r\nquality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are very high. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of DT is\r\nquestionable.\r\n8. How does DT affect resources?\r\nDT is a costly treatment. Except for the costs of the device and accessories, DT requires the\r\nuse of operation rooms, beds in the intensive care units (sometimes for long periods of time),\r\nmany days in the hospital wards, and frequent outpatient follow-up visits. DT complications\r\nwill also use resources for clinical work-up and treatment. All of this will compete with the\r\nneeds of other patient categories. Thus, unless additional resources can be provided there is a\r\nsubstantial risk that DT will reallocate current resources from other medical needs. \r\nAppendix 8 Ethical analysis\r\n9. Is DT in conflict with professional values?\r\nIn our opinion, the benefits of DT in highly selected patients will outweigh its risks and,\r\ntherefore, are not in conflict with professional values.\r\n10. Does DT change the role of the professional in relation to the patient?\r\nDT is demanding for patients and their families. The patient must be able to comply with the\r\nsystem, e.g. exchange batteries, and interpret and react to signals from the system monitor.\r\nThe bandages around the driveline exit site must be changed regularly with an aseptic\r\ntechnique.\r\n11. Does DT affect, or does it put any new demands on, a third party?\r\nDT is likely to be challenging for the patientâ€™s family, already from the postoperative phase\r\nand during rehabilitation when the patient is getting accustomed to a new life situation. The\r\ntreatment also demands frequent follow-up visits. Bandage exchanges around the driveline\r\nexit site requires assistance. This is often performed by family members or by professional\r\nhealth care providers.\r\n12. Is there any legislation of relevance with regard to DT?\r\nNo.\r\n13. Is there any risk of conflict between DT and values of the society, or values of\r\ndifferent groups?\r\nTo prolong life with a mechanical device may be in conflict with the beliefs and norms of\r\nsome groups in our society.\r\n14. Is there a risk that an introduction of DT will cause a conflict with particular\r\ninterests?\r\nNo, probably not.\r\n15. Can an introduction of DT influence the trust of the health care system?\r\nDT is a high-risk treatment for severely debilitated patients and may generate several\r\ncomplications. Thus, in order to maintain the credibility of the health care system it is of\r\nutmost importance to inform patients and their families about both the benefits and the risks\r\nof the treatment. Also, prerequisite algorithms for clinical work-up, treatment of possible\r\ncomplications, and other difficult situations that may arise should be established before a DT\r\nprogram is adopted.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nIntroduction of a DT program raises several ethical issues. The self-esteem and self-image of\r\nthe individual patient probably varies between subjects, but may be affected in both positive\r\nand negative ways. The patient will still be dependent on assistance from family members\r\nand/or health care providers, and the physical integrity is affected. Without additional\r\neconomic resources there is a substantial risk that DT will reallocate current resources from\r\nthe needs of other patient categories. \r\nHTA-centrum\r\nSahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset\r\nHTA\r\nHealth technology assessment (HTA) is the systematic\r\nevaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health\r\ncare technologies, i.e. interventions that may be used to\r\npromote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for\r\nrehabilitation or long-term care. It may address the direct,\r\nintended consequences of technologies as well as their\r\nindirect, unintended consequences. Its main purpose is to\r\ninform technology-related policymaking in health care.\r\nTo evaluate the quality of evidence the Centre of Health Technology Assessment in Region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland is\r\ncurrently using the GRADE system, which has been developed by a widely representative group of international\r\nguideline developers. According to GRADE the level of evidence is graded in four categories:\r\nHigh quality of evidence = (GRADEïƒ…ïƒ…ïƒ…ïƒ… )\r\nModerate quality of evidence = (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…ïƒ…O)\r\nLow quality of evidence = (GRADE ïƒ…ïƒ…OO)\r\nVery low quality of evidence = (GRADE ïƒ…OOO)\r\nIn GRADE there is also a system to rate the strength of recommendation of a technology as either â€œstrongâ€? or\r\nâ€œweakâ€?. This is presently not used by the Centre of Health Technology Assessment in Region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland.\r\nHowever, the assessments still offer some guidance to decision makers in the health care system. If the level of\r\nevidence of a positive effect of a technology is of high or moderate quality it most probably qualifies to be used in\r\nroutine medical care. If the level of evidence is of low quality the use of the technology may be motivated\r\nprovided there is an acceptable balance between benefits and risks, cost-effectiveness and ethical considerations.\r\nPromising technologies, but a very low quality of evidence, motivate further research but should not be used in\r\neveryday routine clinical work.\r\nChristina Bergh, Professor, MD.\r\nHead of HTA-centrum\r\nRegion VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland, HTA-centrum\r\nHealth Technology Assessment\r\nRegional activity-based HTA\r\n\r\nFrom operations or activity/management:\r\nQuestion\r\nClinic-based\r\nHTA\r\nâ€¢ Training\r\nâ€¢ Search, sort, and\r\nselect process\r\nâ€¢ Advice, help,\r\nassistance\r\nâ€¢ Feedback\r\nQuality assurance Support process\r\nprocess\r\nMain process\r\nExternal\r\nreview\r\nSummarized\r\nassessment\r\nQuality assured decision rationale\r\nFormally\r\ndesignated\r\ngroup for\r\nquality assurance\r\nSahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, HTA-centrum\r\nRÃ¶da StrÃ¥ket 8, 413 45 GÃ¶teborg\r\nwww.sahlgrenska.se/hta-centrum
