Total cardiac output \r\n      in CF-LVAD patients during exercise is predominantly determined by pump speed,\r\n      the pressure difference across the pump, and in some cases ejection through the\r\n      aortic valve. Fixed pump speed utilized in CF-LVADs may provide insufficient\r\n      support, resulting in a moderate cardiac output increase during increased\r\n      physical strain. Ongoing studies are evaluating whether pump speed changes in\r\n      response to varied loading conditions may enable LVADs to provide sufficient\r\n      support even during strenuous exercise. In the currently used devices, evidence\r\n      suggests that focus on optimizing non-cardiac peripheral parameters is vital.\r\n      Extra-cardiac potentially reversible factors are anemia with low oxygen-carrying \r\n      capacity, obesity and general deconditioning with low muscle mass. In addition,\r\n      exercise training in CF-LVAD patients can improve peak VO2. To design\r\n      interventions to improve functional capacity in patients treated with modern\r\n      durable LVADs, a detailed understanding of exercise physiology in a\r\n      continuous-flow circulatory system is necessary. In this review we address the\r\n      different components of exercise physiology in LVAD patients and point out\r\n      potential solutions or areas of future research.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

If weaning off ECLS is not possible, heart\r\n      transplantation or implantation of long-term mechanical circulatory support\r\n      (LTMCS) is required. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the\r\n      bridge-to-bridge (BTB) concept. METHODS: Between 1 January 2004 and 1 August\r\n      2010, 97 patients were assisted by LTMCS. The implantation was the first-line\r\n      intervention in 48 patients (the bridge group), and was performed after a period \r\n      of ECLS support in 49 others (the BTB group). RESULTS: The long-term survival\r\n      rate was 51.6\%, with a mean follow-up of 30.7 months, and there were no\r\n      differences for biological parameters between the two groups. Patients in the BTB\r\n      group whose condition was initially more severe, improved under ECLS support, and\r\n      those in whom biological parameters did not revert to normal died after LTMCS.\r\n      Risk factors for mortality in the BTB group were total bilirubin and lactate\r\n      before LTMCS, and alkaline phosphatase before ECLS support. CONCLUSIONS: The BTB \r\n      concept allows the implementation of LTMCS in severe patients, for whom it was\r\n      not originally envisaged, with the same long-term survival as in first-line\r\n      settings. ECLS in the evolution of patients is predictive of survival after\r\n      LTMCS.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2015.

They offer several\r\n      advantages over previously used pulsatile-flow LVADs, including improved\r\n      durability, less surgical trauma, higher energy efficiency, and lower\r\n      thrombogenicity. These benefits translate into better survival, lower frequency\r\n      of adverse events, improved quality of life, and higher functional capacity of\r\n      patients. However, mounting evidence shows unanticipated consequences of\r\n      continuous-flow support, such as acquired aortic valve insufficiency and acquired\r\n      von Willebrand syndrome.

Each device has its own technical considerations and the decision which\r\n      device to use depends on several factors, including what is available, the degree\r\n      of support required, and expected duration of support. Additional issues that\r\n      need to be considered in choosing level of support include right heart function, \r\n      respiratory failure, and multi-organ derangements. A widespread availability of\r\n      short-term ventricular assist devices and timely institution for effective\r\n      hemodynamic support will translate into improved patient outcomes whether that is\r\n      successful transfer to a tertiary care facility or recovery of inherent cardiac\r\n      function.

The first device (HeartMate II)\r\n      was implanted as a bridge to transplantation. However, after few months of\r\n      support the patient showed signs of myocardial recovery and the device was\r\n      successfully explanted. After 2 years of uneventful follow-up, the patient\s\r\n      condition deteriorated requiring further mechanical support. Due to the elevated \r\n      risk associated with a redo full-support LVAD implantation, we decided to implant\r\n      a partial support device (Synergy(R) CircuLite). Because of recurrent pump\r\n      thrombosis requiring device exchange, the final weeks to transplantation were\r\n      bridged with CentriMag(R) short-term LVAD. After successful cardiac\r\n      transplantation the patient required further temporary extracorporeal membrane\r\n      oxygenation support which was weaned off and explanted on the fourth\r\n      postoperative day.

At the present time, there are\r\n      only limited means of quantifying disease severity or the concomitant morbidity\r\n      for this population. This study describes the development of a novel pediatric\r\n      treatment intensity score (TIS), designed to quantify the burden of illness and\r\n      clinical trajectory in children on VAD support. METHODS: There were 5 clinical\r\n      domains assessed: nutrition, respiratory support, activity level, cardiovascular \r\n      medications, and care environment. A scale was developed through expert\r\n      consensus. Higher scores indicate greater morbidity as reflected by intensity of \r\n      medical management. To evaluate feasibility and face validity, the TIS was\r\n      applied retrospectively to a subset of pediatric inpatients with VADs. The\r\n      Bland-Altman method was used to assess limits of agreement. RESULTS: The study\r\n      comprised 39 patients with 42 implantations. Bland-Altman interobserver and\r\n      intraobserver comparisons showed good agreement (mean differences in scores of\r\n      0.02, limits of agreement +/-0.12). Trends in TIS were concordant with the\r\n      overall clinical impression of improvement. Scores remained >/=0.6 preceding VAD \r\n      implantation and peaked at 0.71 3 days after VAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: We\r\n      describe a pediatric VAD scoring tool, to assess global patient morbidity and\r\n      clinical recovery.

Hemodynamic,\r\n      clinical, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic variables poorly discriminate\r\n      patients at risk of RVF. We examined the utility of 3-dimensional\r\n      echocardiography (3DE) right ventricular (RV) volumetric assessment to identify\r\n      patients at risk for RVF. METHODS AND RESULTS: RVF was defined as the need for\r\n      inotropic infusion for >14 days after LVAD surgery or the need for biventricular \r\n      assist device support. Preoperative RV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were\r\n      measured, blinded to clinical data, from transthoracic 3DE full volume data sets \r\n      in 26 patients. Baseline variables and 3DE RV indices were compared between\r\n      patients with and without RVF. Twenty-four patients received continuous-flow\r\n      LVADs, and 2 required biventricular support devices. Ten patients required\r\n      prolonged inotropes after LVAD placement. Baseline characteristics associated\r\n      with RVF included higher right atrial pressure, higher right atrial pressure to\r\n      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio, and lower cardiac index and RV stroke\r\n      work index (RVSWI). Echocardiographic indices associated with RVF included 3DE\r\n      indexed RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDVI and RVESVI) and RV\r\n      ejection fraction (RVEF). The relationship between 3DE quantification of RV\r\n      volumes and the development of RVF was independent from RVSWI: RVEDVI: odds ratio\r\n      (OR) 1.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.33 (P = .04); RVESVI: OR 1.14, 95\%\r\n      CI 1.01-1.28 (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 3DE is a promising method for\r\n      pre-LVAD RV assessment. RV volumes assessed by 3DE are predictive of RVF in LVAD \r\n      recipients independently from hemodynamic correlates of RV function.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Innovative counterpulsation\r\n      devices based on the established principle of the intra-aortic balloon pump have \r\n      been developed, and of these, the CardioVad and the C-Pulse System have been\r\n      introduced in clinical practice with convincing evidence of haemodynamic\r\n      efficacy. The evolution from pulsatile to continuous-flow left ventricular assist\r\n      devices has been associated with improved survival rates during the first 2 years\r\n      of support with the potential of matching heart transplantation outcomes.\r\n      However, blood contact with the device remains a significant challenge despite\r\n      the highly sophisticated technology currently available. Innovative\r\n      extra-vascular counterpulsation devices have been shown to overcome the\r\n      limitations of the intra-aortic balloon pump and rend the device suitable for\r\n      prolonged support. Monitoring of the performance of these novel devices is\r\n      essential, and carotid Doppler ultrasonography is of utility in assessing the\r\n      haemodynamic performance of the devices in a clinical setting. Computational\r\n      modelling has played a role in the simulation of these devices and should\r\n      continue to assist with their optimisation and implementation in clinical\r\n      practice.\r\nFAU - Capoccia, M\r\nAU  - Capoccia M\r\nAD  - Cardiothoracic Surgery, Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, UK,\r\n      capoccia@doctors.org.uk.\r\nFAU - Bowles, C T\r\nAU  - Bowles CT\r\nFAU - Pepper, J R\r\nAU  - Pepper JR\r\nFAU - Banner, N R\r\nAU  - Banner NR\r\nFAU - Simon, A R\r\nAU  - Simon AR\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Heart Fail Rev\r\nJT  - Heart failure reviews\r\nJID - 9612481\r\nSB  - IM\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/18 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/18 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1007/s10741-014-9468-1 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2015 May;20(3):323-35. doi: 10.1007/s10741-014-9468-1.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25512901\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141216\r\nDCOM- 20141216\r\nLR  - 20141218\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Nov\r\nTI  - Present and future perspectives on total artificial hearts.\r\nPG  - 595-602\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.09.05 [doi]\r\nAB  - Due to shortages in donor organ availability, advanced heart-failure patients are\r\n      at high risk of further decompensation and often death while awaiting\r\n      transplantation. This shortage has led to the development of effective mechanical\r\n      circulatory support (MCS). Currently, various implantable ventricular-assist\r\n      devices (VADs) are able to provide temporary or long-term circulatory support for\r\n      many end-stage heart-failure patients. Implantation of a total artificial heart\r\n      (TAH) currently represents the surgical treatment option for patients requiring\r\n      biventricular MCS as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT).\r\n      However, the clinical applicability of available versions of positive\r\n      displacement pumps is limited by their size and associated complications.\r\n      Application of advanced technology is aimed at solving some of these issues,\r\n      attempting to develop a new generation of smaller and more effective TAHs to suit\r\n      a wider patient population. Particular targets for improvement include\r\n      modifications to the biocompatibility of device designs and materials in order to\r\n      decrease hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications.

Compared to the first generation pulsatile-flow left ventricular\r\n      assist devices (PFVADs), CFVADs have demonstrated improved reliability and\r\n      durability. However, CFVADs have also been associated with certain complications \r\n      thought to be linked with decreased arterial pulsatility. Previous studies\r\n      comparing CFVADs and PFVADs have presented conflicting results. It is important\r\n      to understand the outcome differences between CFVAD and PFVAD in order to further\r\n      advance the current VAD technology. METHODS: In this review, we compared the\r\n      outcomes of CFVADs and PFVADs and examined the need for arterial pulsatility for \r\n      the future generation of mechanical circulatory support. RESULTS: CVADs offer\r\n      advantages of smaller size, increased reliability and durability, and subsequent \r\n      improvements in survival. However, with the increasing duration of long-term\r\n      support, it appears that CFVADs may have specific complications and a lower rate \r\n      of left ventricular recovery associated with diminished pulsatility, increased\r\n      pressure gradients on the aortic valve and decreased compliance in smaller\r\n      arterial vessels. PFVAD support or pulsatility control algorithms in CFVADs could\r\n      be beneficial and potentially necessary for long term support. CONCLUSIONS: Given\r\n      the relative advantages and disadvantages of CFVADs and PFVADs, the ultimate\r\n      solution may lie in incorporating pulsatility into current and emerging CFVADs\r\n      whilst retaining their existing benefits. Future studies examining physiologic\r\n      responses, end-organ function and LV remodeling at varying degrees of pulsatility\r\n      and device support levels are needed.\r\nFAU - Cheng, Allen\r\nAU  - Cheng A\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,\r\n      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.\r\nFAU - Williamitis, Christine A\r\nAU  - Williamitis CA\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,\r\n      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.\r\nFAU - Slaughter, Mark S\r\nAU  - Slaughter MS\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,\r\n      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4250555\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4250555\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Continuous flow (CF)\r\nOT  - left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nOT  - myocardial recovery\r\nOT  - pulsatile flow (PF)\r\nOT  - pulsatility\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/17 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/06/27 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/23 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-06-573 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Nov;3(6):573-81. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.24.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25512893\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141216\r\nDCOM- 20141216\r\nLR  - 20141218\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Nov\r\nTI  - Durability of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices: a systematic\r\n      review.\r\nPG  - 547-56\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.11.01 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are becoming an increasingly \r\n      viable alternative therapy for heart failure, either as a bridge to heart\r\n      transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy (DT). The latter has become\r\n      increasingly popular in recent years, in the face of a donor organ shortage and a\r\n      rise in elderly patients ineligible for heart transplants. For these patients in \r\n      particular, device durability is a key contributor to survival, morbidity, and\r\n      quality of life. This systematic review aimed to assess the long-term durability \r\n      of current continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched\r\n      from their dates of inception to August 2014 for original studies reporting on\r\n      patients receiving continuous-flow LVADs. LVAD failure was defined as device\r\n      malfunction necessitating exchange or explantation, or causing patient mortality.\r\n      Pooled averages were calculated for outcomes and rates of device failure were\r\n      reconstructed from digitized graph curves using the software, WebPlotDigitizer\r\n      v3.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective observational studies with a total of 5,471\r\n      patients were included for analysis. The mean duration of LVAD support was 504.7 \r\n      (range, 303-568) days, and the overall weighted incidence of device failure was\r\n      3.9\% (range, 1-11.3\%). On average, pump thrombosis was the most common cause of\r\n      device failure (50.5\%), followed by lead or cable damage (21.7\%), mechanical pump\r\n      failure (11.6\%), device-related infection (11.1\%), and surgical complications\r\n      from implantation (2.5\%). Long-term device failure rates at 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and \r\n      24-months post-implantation were 0.5\%, 1.8\%, 2.9\%, 4.5\% and 6.5\%, respectively.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: With the expected rise in LVAD usage for end-stage heart failure,\r\n      particularly as a DT, the steady minority of patients experiencing device failure\r\n      is likely to increase. Further investigation is required into the incidence and\r\n      mechanism of major causes of failure, as well as design improvements that may\r\n      address these complications. There is currently a lack of guidelines and large\r\n      randomized studies reporting on the etiology and outcomes of LVAD failure.\r\nFAU - Xie, Ashleigh\r\nAU  - Xie A\r\nAD  - 1 The Collaborative Research (CORE) Group, Macquarie University, Sydney,\r\n      Australia ; 2 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,\r\n      Sydney, Australia.\r\nFAU - Phan, Kevin\r\nAU  - Phan K\r\nAD  - 1 The Collaborative Research (CORE) Group, Macquarie University, Sydney,\r\n      Australia ; 2 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,\r\n      Sydney, Australia.\r\nFAU - Yan, Tristan D\r\nAU  - Yan TD\r\nAD  - 1 The Collaborative Research (CORE) Group, Macquarie University, Sydney,\r\n      Australia ; 2 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,\r\n      Sydney, Australia.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Review\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4250558\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4250558\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Ventricular assist device (VAD)\r\nOT  - heart failure\r\nOT  - prosthesis failure\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/17 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/10/27 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/11/01 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.11.01 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-06-547 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Nov;3(6):547-56. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.11.01.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25499474\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20150202\r\nDCOM- 20150413\r\nLR  - 20150213\r\nIS  - 1552-6259 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0003-4975 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 99\r\nIP  - 2\r\nDP  - 2015 Feb\r\nTI  - Comparison of outcomes after heart replacement therapy in patients over 65 years \r\n      old.\r\nPG  - 582-8\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.08.044 [doi]\r\nLID - S0003-4975(14)01746-9 [pii]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: There are currently no well-defined, evidence-based guidelines for\r\n      management of end-stage heart failure in patients over 65, and the decisions to\r\n      use mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist device (LVAD),\r\n      either as a bridge to transplantation or destination therapy, or isolated heart\r\n      transplantation (HTx) remain controversial. We aimed to compare the outcomes\r\n      after the implementation of three heart replacement strategies in this high-risk \r\n      population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients\r\n      between the ages of 65 and 72 receiving a continuous-flow LVAD as bridge to\r\n      transplantation or destination therapy or isolated HTx at our center between 2005\r\n      and 2012. The patients were stratified according to treatment strategy into three\r\n      groups: group D (destination LVAD, n = 23), group B (bridge to transplantation\r\n      LVAD, n = 43), and group H (HTx alone, n = 47). The primary outcomes of interest \r\n      were survival to discharge and 2-year overall survival. RESULTS: The patients in \r\n      group D were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of ischemic\r\n      cardiomyopathy, and had a higher pulmonary vascular resistance than did patients \r\n      in groups B or H. There were no significant differences between groups in\r\n      survival to discharge (87\% D vs 83.7\% B vs 87.2\% H, p = 0.88) or 2-year overall\r\n      survival (75.7\% D vs 68.7\% B vs 80.9\% H, log-rank p = 0.47). The incidence rates \r\n      of readmission were 1.1 events/patient.year in group D and 0.5\r\n      events/patient.year in group H. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference \r\n      in perioperative, short-term, and medium-term survival between the treatment\r\n      groups. However, the LVAD patients had a higher incidence of readmission. Larger \r\n      trials are needed to refine differences in long-term survival, quality of life,\r\n      and resource utilization for elderly patients requiring heart replacement\r\n      therapy.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwent\r\n      implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile\r\n      (HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and the\r\n      effect on body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) who\r\n      underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for\r\n      weight change. In the 30-day survivors, end points of the study were continued\r\n      LVAD support, heart transplant, or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass\r\n      surgery and was excluded. RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria,\r\n      BMI was 35.6 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 +/- 5.5\r\n      kg/m(2) (mean BMI change -2.5 kg/m(2); P = .063), with a mean follow-up time of\r\n      301.6 +/- 255.5 days. The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9\r\n      kg/m(2) (P = .016 vs baseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1 kg/m(2)\r\n      increase in BMI. BMI <30 kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\%), 5\r\n      of 19 (26\%) in XVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 \r\n      XVE, 2 HMII) or 50\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was\r\n      4.6 kg/m(2) (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30\r\n      kg/m(2) provided significant weight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in\r\n      recipients of the continuous flow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a\r\n      heart transplant after LVAD insertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6 kg/m(2) (P =\r\n      .003). LVAD implantation provides a period of hemodynamic support for obese\r\n      patients with advanced heart failure, during which time opportunity may be\r\n      available for weight loss. Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater\r\n      weight loss than nonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may\r\n      be necessary to achieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous\r\n      flow LVAD.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: A hermeneutic-phenomenological inquiry guided by van\r\n      Manen\s methods was used to explore the LVAD-DT family caregiving\r\n      experience.Participants/Setting-Seven family caregivers (1 man and 6 women) 50 to\r\n      74 years old who cared for an adult with an LVAD-DT in home settings. Recruitment\r\n      and data collection occurred in an outpatient mechanical circulatory support\r\n      center in the Midwest. METHODS: Data were collected by means of face-to-face\r\n      interviews using open-ended questions and 1 follow-up interview. Interviews were \r\n      audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis consisted of writing, \r\n      rewriting, and reflecting across participants\ data, which produced themes\r\n      illustrating the experience and meaning of caring for an adult with an LVAD-DT.\r\n      Themes were consensually validated. Procedures for trustworthiness are described.\r\n      RESULTS: Five main themes were identified from participants\ experiences: (1)\r\n      advanced heart failure is a life-changing event, (2) self-doubt about LVAD\r\n      caregiving improves over time, (3) lifestyle adjustments come with time, (4)\r\n      persistent worry and stress, and (5) caregiving is not a burden-it\s a part of\r\n      life. These main themes were elucidated by 8 subthemes in which participants\r\n      described a process of adjustment despite persistent worry and stress and\r\n      eventually accepted caregiving as part of their lives. Future studies are needed \r\n      to explore caregiver burden, adaptation, and the effects of caregiving outcomes, \r\n      such as emotional and physical health and overall quality of life.\r\nFAU - Marcuccilli, Linda\r\nAU  - Marcuccilli L\r\nAD  - Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.\r\nFAU - Casida, Jesus Jessie\r\nAU  - Casida JJ\r\nAD  - The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\r\nFAU - Bakas, Tamilynn\r\nAU  - Bakas T\r\nAD  - Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.\r\nFAU - Pagani, Francis D\r\nAU  - Pagani FD\r\nAD  - The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 5T32 NR007066/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Prog Transplant\r\nJT  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)\r\nJID - 100909380\r\nSB  - N\r\nMH  - Aged\r\nMH  - Caregivers/*psychology\r\nMH  - Family/*psychology\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Heart Failure/*nursing/*psychology\r\nMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Interviews as Topic\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Middle Aged\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/10 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/02/13 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/10 06:00\r\nAID - LJH58WH6372L5713 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.7182/pit2014684 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Prog Transplant. 2014 Dec;24(4):332-40. doi: 10.7182/pit2014684.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25487235\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20150214\r\nIS  - 1569-9285 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1569-9285 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 20\r\nIP  - 3\r\nDP  - 2015 Mar\r\nTI  - Post-heart transplantation outcome of HeartMate II-bridged recipients requiring\r\n      unplanned concomitant temporary right ventricular mechanical support.\r\nPG  - 372-8\r\nLID - 10.1093/icvts/ivu408 [doi]\r\nAB  - OBJECTIVES: Second-generation axial-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) \r\n      have become an established therapy in bridging end-stage heart failure patients\r\n      to cardiac transplantation. Despite the proven clinical success of these devices,\r\n      some patients develop right ventricular (RV) failure after LVAD implantation. We \r\n      sought to determine post-heart transplantation outcomes of HeartMate II\r\n      (HMII)-bridged patients who developed postimplantation right ventricular failure \r\n      and received Levitronix CentriMag for RV support in addition to LVAD. METHODS:\r\n      This was a single-centre institutional report of 64 patients transplanted during \r\n      2007-2013 from a HeartMate II device. Patients were divided into two groups\r\n      according to whether they received an isolated LVAD (n = 56) or required\r\n      additional RV mechanical support (n = 8). These two groups were compared for\r\n      early graft loss (death before discharge or retransplantation), major early\r\n      post-transplant complications and 3-year graft survival. RESULTS: Early graft\r\n      loss was 10.7\% in isolated HMII and 25\% in HMII + RVAD patients (P = 0.26). There\r\n      were no observed differences in the rates of primary graft dysfunction (7.3 vs\r\n      0\%, P = NS), renal failure (16.7 vs 12.5\%, P = NS) and stroke (11.1 vs 25\%, P =\r\n      0.273) between the two groups. Pulmonary artery resistance (odds ratio: 3.286,\r\n      95\% confidence interval: 1.063-10.157, P = 0.039) was identified as a significant\r\n      predictor for adverse outcome of mechanically-bridged heart transplant\r\n      recipients. The 3-year graft survival rate was 86 +/- 5\% in isolated HMII and 75 \r\n      +/- 15\% in HMII + RVAD patients, P = 0.326. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate\r\n      that heart transplant recipients who required unplanned RV mechanical support\r\n      after LVAD implantation achieved comparable rates of early graft loss,\r\n      post-transplant renal failure and stroke rate in comparison with patients bridged\r\n      with an isolated HeartMate II assist device. Three-year graft survival was\r\n      equivalent between those two groups. Given the small sample size, further studies\r\n      involving more patients are needed to support or challenge our conclusions.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2014.

Mean age was 50.4 + 12.5 (17-69) years\r\n      for bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) patients and 57.6 + 10.4 (31-81) years for\r\n      destination therapy (DT) patients (p < 0.001). Overall, 38 patients (26\%) were\r\n      female and 58 (41\%) were African American. Etiology of heart failure was ischemic\r\n      in 54 patients (37\%) and nonischemic in 93 patients (63\%). Overall survival at 30\r\n      days, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years was 93\%, 89\%, 84\%, and 81\%, respectively. \r\n      Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) was the most common complication (24\%), followed \r\n      by stroke (18\%), right ventricular (RV) failure (18\%), ventilator-dependent\r\n      respiratory failure (10\%), reoperation for bleeding (10\%), and driveline\r\n      infection (9\%). These data demonstrate excellent survival with low mortality for \r\n      both BTT and DT patients on long-term LVAD support. However, for LVAD therapy to \r\n      become the gold standard for long-term treatment of end-stage heart failure and a\r\n      plausible alternative to heart transplantation, we need to continue to improve\r\n      the incidence of frequent postoperative complications, such as RV failure,\r\n      driveline infections, strokes, and GIB.\r\nFAU - Tsiouris, Athanasios\r\nAU  - Tsiouris A\r\nAD  - From the *Section of Cardiac Surgery, Yale University, School of Medicine, New\r\n      Haven, Connecticut; and daggerDivision of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Henry Ford\r\n      Hospital, Detroit, Michigan.\r\nFAU - Paone, Gaetano\r\nAU  - Paone G\r\nFAU - Nemeh, Hassan W\r\nAU  - Nemeh HW\r\nFAU - Brewer, Robert J\r\nAU  - Brewer RJ\r\nFAU - Borgi, Jamil\r\nAU  - Borgi J\r\nFAU - Hodari, Arielle\r\nAU  - Hodari A\r\nFAU - Morgan, Jeffrey A\r\nAU  - Morgan JA\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - ASAIO J\r\nJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)\r\nJID - 9204109\r\nSB  - IM\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/09 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/09 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/09 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000191 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - ASAIO J. 2015 May-Jun;61(3):266-73. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000191.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25475468\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141205\r\nDCOM- 20150218\r\nIS  - 1916-7075 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0828-282X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 30\r\nIP  - 12\r\nDP  - 2014 Dec\r\nTI  - Multicentre Canadian experience with the HeartWare ventricular assist device:\r\n      concerns about adverse neurological outcomes.\r\nPG  - 1662-7\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.cjca.2014.07.746 [doi]\r\nLID - S0828-282X(14)01255-0 [pii]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare left ventricular assist device (HVAD; HeartWare Inc,\r\n      Framingham, MA) was first implanted in Canada in 2010. We performed a multicentre\r\n      analysis of the real world outcomes associated with its use. METHODS: Between May\r\n      2010 and January 2013, 4 Canadian centres inserted a total of 72 HVADs in 71\r\n      patients. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively for the \r\n      1-year estimate of the principal outcome of transplant, explant for recovery, or \r\n      death in patients who had a bridge to transplantation indication. Adverse event\r\n      rates were estimated as events per patient-year (PPY). RESULTS: In the 67\r\n      patients who received the HVAD with the indication of bridge to transplant, 26\r\n      (38.8\%) received a successful transplant, 2 (3\%) received an explant for\r\n      recovery, and 10 (14.9\%) patients died during support. Median follow-up time with\r\n      the HVAD was 6.9 months (range, 2 days to 30.4 months). Despite having 74\% of the\r\n      patients with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support \r\n      (INTERMACS) scores of level 1 and 2 at the time of implantation, the rate\r\n      estimate for survival at 1 year was 86.3\% (95\% confidence interval, 76.7-93.3).\r\n      With 48.2 total patient years of support, the rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic\r\n      strokes were 0.21 and 0.19 events PPY, respectively. Women made up 40\% of the\r\n      cohort and an adverse neurologic event occurred with an event rate of 0.38 PPY in\r\n      women. CONCLUSIONS: The HVAD adequately supports acutely ill heart failure\r\n      patients until the time of transplant or recovery. A high incidence of adverse\r\n      neurologic outcomes might be related to the large percentage of female patients, \r\n      the high INTERMACS levels, or unknown factors; further surveillance is required.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

METHODS: We provide a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the\r\n      recipients, the donors, the surgical procedure, and results of the heart\r\n      transplantations performed in Spain until 31 December 2013. RESULTS: During 2013,\r\n      a total of 248 transplantation procedures were carried out, bringing the time\r\n      series to a total of 7023 transplantations. The temporal analysis confirms a\r\n      significant deterioration in the clinical profile of the recipients (higher\r\n      percentage of older patients, severe renal failure, insulin-dependent diabetes\r\n      mellitus, previous heart surgery, mechanical ventilation), of the donors (higher \r\n      proportion of older donors and greater weight mismatch), and of the procedure\r\n      (higher percentage of emergency transplantations which, in 2013, reached 49\%, and\r\n      with ischemia times > 240min). There was a marked increase in the use of\r\n      circulatory assist devices prior to transplantation which, in 2013, were employed\r\n      in 25.2\% of all the patients. The survivals at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 76\%,\r\n      65\%, 52\%, and 37\%, respectively, and have remained stable since 1995.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation activity in Spain remains stable in recent\r\n      years, with around 250 procedures a year. Despite the clear deterioration in the \r\n      clinical characteristics of the donors and recipients, and lengthening of the\r\n      operative times, the results in terms of mortality continue to be comparable to\r\n      those reported in our neighboring countries, and a growing use of circulatory\r\n      assist devices prior to transplantation is confirmed.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia.

The conventional LVADs are\r\n      designed to provide full hemodynamic support for the end-stage failing heart.\r\n      However, full-support LVAD implantation requires major surgery, sternotomy and\r\n      cardiopulmonary bypass in majority of cases. The Synergy Micro-pump is the\r\n      smallest implantable LVAD and provides partial flow support up to 3 l/min. It was\r\n      shown that early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits\r\n      to patients with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support\r\n      LVAD. Due the small dimensions it can be implanted without cardiopulmonary bypass\r\n      or a sternotomy.

Nowadays, mechanical\r\n      circulatory support devices (MSCD) are an established therapeutic option for\r\n      terminal heart failure after exhaustion of medical and conventional surgical\r\n      treatment, and are becoming a realistic alternative to heart transplantation\r\n      (HTX). There are a number of different treatment options for these patients, such\r\n      as bridge to transplantation (BTT), bridge to candidacy (BTC), bridge to recovery\r\n      (BTR) and the destination therapy (DT) option. The latter option has become more \r\n      frequent throughout the last years, due to a donor organ shortage and an\r\n      increasing number of older patients with terminal heart failure who are not\r\n      eligible for HTX. These factors have led to a rapidly increasing number of LVAD\r\n      implantations as well as centers which perform these procedures. This has also\r\n      been due to improved LVAD survival rates and quality of life following the\r\n      introduction of smaller, intrapericardial and more durable continuous flow left\r\n      ventricular devices. The most common complications for these patients are\r\n      device-related problems, such as coagulation disorders, gastrointestinal\r\n      bleeding, device related infection, pump thrombosis or cerebrovascular accidents.\r\n      However, some questions still remain unanswered or under debate, such as the\r\n      exact time-point for LVAD implantation. In addition, aspects such as better\r\n      biocompatibility for LVADs remain a major challenge. This review will concentrate\r\n      on DT for terminal heart failure and provide an overview of the current evidence \r\n      for LVAD implantation in this patient group, with particular emphasis on\r\n      indication and time-point of implantation, choice of LVADs, and long term\r\n      outcomes and quality of life.\r\nFAU - Puehler, Thomas\r\nAU  - Puehler T\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Ensminger, Stephan\r\nAU  - Ensminger S\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Schoenbrodt, Michael\r\nAU  - Schoenbrodt M\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Borgermann, Jochen\r\nAU  - Borgermann J\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Rehn, Erik\r\nAU  - Rehn E\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Hakim-Meibodi, Kavous\r\nAU  - Hakim-Meibodi K\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Morshuis, Michiel\r\nAU  - Morshuis M\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nFAU - Gummert, Jan\r\nAU  - Gummert J\r\nAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center Bad \r\n      Oeynhausen, University Hospital of the Rhine University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,\r\n      Germany.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4229463\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4229463\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Heart transplantation (HTX)\r\nOT  - heart insufficiency\r\nOT  - left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory report (MCS)\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/06/20 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/23 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.20 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-05-513 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Sep;3(5):513-24. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.20.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25452912\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141202\r\nDCOM- 20141202\r\nLR  - 20141215\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep\r\nTI  - Mechanical circulatory support in pediatrics.\r\nPG  - 507-12\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.25 [doi]\r\nAB  - There is no reliable published data on the overall prevalence or incidence of\r\n      heart failure (HF) in children. However, the success of mechanical circulatory\r\n      support (MCS) in management of HF has raised the prospect of a previously\r\n      unavailable treatment modality. Orthotopic heart transplant (OHTx) remains the\r\n      gold standard treatment, but the number of patients requiring this treatment far \r\n      outweighs the donor availability. It is therefore not surprising to see the\r\n      popularity of various MCS modalities, with different devices ranging from\r\n      veno-arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) to ventricular\r\n      assist devices (VADs), which are either para-corporeal or intra-corporeal, with\r\n      pulsatile or continuous flow. Indication, timing and the choice of the type of\r\n      mechanical support are crucial so in order to avoid potential lethal\r\n      complications such as hemorrhage, thrombo-embolism and infections. In the\r\n      pediatric population, MCS is used mainly as bridge to transplantation but can be \r\n      used as bridge to recovery in patients with acute myocarditis or following\r\n      open-heart surgery. Active research is currently underway to develop newer and\r\n      more durable devices that will assist the pediatric population across all age\r\n      groups. This research will support different pathologies that have lower\r\n      incidences of major morbidities, particularly as greater durations of MCS are\r\n      expected due to a paucity of donors for OHTx. The combined experience developed\r\n      through the usage of different devices in pediatric and adult populations has led\r\n      to the to the application of MCS in some subgroups of grown-up congenital heart\r\n      diseases (CHDs) patients, particularly those with systemic right ventricular\r\n      failure.\r\nFAU - Gandolfo, Fabrizio\r\nAU  - Gandolfo F\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nFAU - De Rita, Fabrizio\r\nAU  - De Rita F\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nFAU - Hasan, Asif\r\nAU  - Hasan A\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nFAU - Griselli, Massimo\r\nAU  - Griselli M\r\nAD  - Freeman Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4229474\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4229474\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Pediatric heart failure\r\nOT  - congenital\r\nOT  - extra corporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO)\r\nOT  - heart transplantation\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory support (MCS)\r\nOT  - ventricular assist devices (VADs)\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/05/24 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/25 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.25 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-05-507 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Sep;3(5):507-12. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.25.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25452908\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141202\r\nDCOM- 20141202\r\nLR  - 20141215\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Print)\r\nIS  - 2225-319X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 3\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep\r\nTI  - Clinical psychological and neuropsychological issues with left ventricular assist\r\n      devices (LVADs).\r\nPG  - 480-9\r\nLID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.14 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly being used\r\n      to treat patients in end-stage heart failure (HF) as bridge-to-transplantation,\r\n      lifetime support or destination therapy. However, the importance of this newer\r\n      technique for chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still \r\n      open to discussion. To date, there are few studies that extensively explore the\r\n      psychological and cognitive profiles of patient with ventricular assist devices\r\n      (VADs). METHODS: We studied the psychological aspects, quality of life (QOL) and \r\n      cognitive profiles of 19 patients with HF before VAD implantation and then at\r\n      two, five and 16 months post-implantation. RESULTS: Our results showed that after\r\n      VAD implantation, patients did not show any psychopathological problems such as\r\n      anxiety and/or depression. More interestingly, despite the constant risk of\r\n      neurological events determined by the continuous-blood-flow pump (CBFP),\r\n      patients\ cognitive functioning did not worsen. In fact, significant enhancements\r\n      were observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and cognitive deficits are\r\n      common in advanced HF and often worsen over time. Appropriately designed and\r\n      randomized studies are needed to demonstrate whether earlier VAD implantation is \r\n      warranted to arrest cognitive decline and encourage better post-implantation\r\n      adaptation.\r\nFAU - Mapelli, Daniela\r\nAU  - Mapelli D\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Cavazzana, Annachiara\r\nAU  - Cavazzana A\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Cavalli, Chiara\r\nAU  - Cavalli C\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Bottio, Tomaso\r\nAU  - Bottio T\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Tarzia, Vincenzo\r\nAU  - Tarzia V\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Gerosa, Gino\r\nAU  - Gerosa G\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nFAU - Volpe, Bianca Rosa\r\nAU  - Volpe BR\r\nAD  - 1 Department of General Psychology, 2 Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and\r\n      Vascular Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - China\r\nTA  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg\r\nJT  - Annals of cardiothoracic surgery\r\nJID - 101605877\r\nPMC - PMC4229472\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4229472\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\nOT  - cognitive functions\r\nOT  - emotional profile\r\nOT  - heart transplantation\r\nOT  - quality of life (QOL)\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/02/14 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/08/16 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.14 [doi]\r\nAID - acs-03-05-480 [pii]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Sep;3(5):480-9. doi:\r\n      10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.08.14.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25447571\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20141202\r\nLR  - 20150408\r\nIS  - 1557-3117 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1053-2498 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2014 Sep 28\r\nTI  - Ventricular reconditioning and pump explantation in patients supported by\r\n      continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.\r\nLID - S1053-2498(14)01350-3 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.healun.2014.09.015 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The potential for myocardial reconditioning and device explantation\r\n      after long-term continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support\r\n      presents an opportunity to delay or avoid transplantation in select patients.\r\n      METHODS: Thirty of 657 patients with end-stage heart failure supported with\r\n      continuous-flow LVADs were assessed for device explantation. Each patient\r\n      underwent an individualized process of weaning focused on principles of\r\n      ventricular unloading, gradual reconditioning, and transition to medical therapy.\r\n      RESULTS: After varying reconditioning periods, 27 patients (16 men, 11 women;\r\n      age, 39 +/- 12 years) underwent LVAD explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman;\r\n      age, 22 +/- 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. The\r\n      duration of LVAD support was 533 +/- 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for the\r\n      explant cohort and 1,097 +/- 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explant\r\n      cohort. The LV end-diastolic dimension, LV ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary \r\n      artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort were\r\n      significantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). Two late deaths occurred \r\n      after LVAD explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1\r\n      patient required resumption of LVAD support 2.7 years after device removal. The\r\n      remaining explant patients remain in New York Heart Association classes I to II\r\n      with medical management alone (mean survival post-explant, 1,172 +/- 948 days).\r\n      The 3 candidates who could not be weaned ultimately underwent transplantation.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: The potential for recovery of native LV function after long-term\r\n      continuous-flow LVAD support should encourage a more aggressive approach to\r\n      ventricular reconditioning with the goal of device explantation and a return to\r\n      medical management, particularly in young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

Evolution has favored a pulsatile heart\r\n      pump to be able to deliver the maximum flow at different levels of systemic\r\n      vascular resistance, confer kinetic energy to the flow of blood past areas of\r\n      stenosis and generate low shear stress on blood elements. In this perspective, we\r\n      suggest that lack of pulsatility may be one factor that has limited the success\r\n      of continuous flow LVADs and suggest that research needs to focus on methods to\r\n      generate pulsatility either by the native heart or by various speed modulation\r\n      algorithms.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of\r\n      AF on outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD. METHODS: Records of 106 patients\r\n      who underwent HMII implantation at a single center were reviewed. The\r\n      associations of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and persistent atrial\r\n      fibrillation (PeAF) with survival, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, bleeding, \r\n      and thromboembolism were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox\r\n      proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 56.6 +/- 11.4 years, 87.7\%\r\n      of the implants were intended as a bridge to transplantation, and median length\r\n      of support was 217 days (range: 1 to 952 days). AF was present in 55 patients\r\n      (51.9\%); 36 patients (34.0\%) had PAF and 19 (17.9\%) had PeAF. Twenty-one patients\r\n      (19.8\%) died, and 18 (17.0\%) were hospitalized for HF. There were 0.75 major\r\n      bleeding events and 0.28 thromboembolic events per patient year of follow-up. PAF\r\n      was not associated with increased mortality, HF hospitalization, bleeding, or\r\n      thromboembolism. PeAF, however, was an independent predictor of the composite\r\n      endpoint of death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 3.54; 95\% confidence\r\n      interval: 1.52 to 8.25; p < 0.01). Although there was no increase in bleeding or \r\n      thromboembolism, patients with AF had thromboembolic events at higher\r\n      international normalized ratios (INRs). CONCLUSIONS: Although PAF is not\r\n      associated with worse outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD, PeAF may be\r\n      associated with increased mortality and HF hospitalization. Patients with AF also\r\n      may have thromboembolic events at higher INR levels.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by\r\n      Elsevier Inc.

Although the clinical\r\n      use of valves appeared to have remained steady for several decades, the evolving \r\n      demands for the elderly and frail patients typically encountered in the developed\r\n      world, and the needs of much younger and poorer rheumatic heart disease patients \r\n      in the developing world have now necessitated new paradigms for heart valve\r\n      technologies and associated materials. This includes further consideration of\r\n      durable elastomeric materials. The use of polymers to produce flexible leaflet\r\n      valves that have the benefits of current commercial bioprosthetic and mechanical \r\n      valves without any of their deficiencies has been held desirable since the mid\r\n      1950s. Much attention has been focused on thermoplastic polyurethanes in view of \r\n      their generally good physico-chemical properties and versatility in processing,\r\n      coupled with the improving biocompatibility and stability of recent formulations.\r\n      Accelerated in vitro durability of between 600 and 1000 million cycles has been\r\n      achieved using polycarbonate urethanes, and good resistance to degradation,\r\n      calcification and thrombosis in vivo has been shown with some polysiloxane-based \r\n      polyurethanes. Nevertheless, polymeric valves have remained relegated to use in\r\n      temporary ventricular assist devices for bridging heart failure patients to\r\n      transplantation. Some recent studies suggest that there is a greater degree of\r\n      instability in thermoplastic materials than hitherto believed so that significant\r\n      challenges remain in the search for the combination of durability and\r\n      biocompatibility that would allow polymeric valves to become a clinical reality\r\n      for surgical implantation. Perhaps more importantly, they could become candidates\r\n      for use in situations where minimally invasive transcatheter procedures are used \r\n      to replace diseased valves. Being amenable to relatively inexpensive mass\r\n      production techniques, the attainment of this goal could benefit very large\r\n      numbers of patients in developing and emerging countries who currently have no\r\n      access to treatment for rheumatic heart disease that is so prevalent in these\r\n      areas. This review discusses the evolution and current status of polymeric valves\r\n      in wide-ranging circumstances.\r\nFAU - Bezuidenhout, Deon\r\nAU  - Bezuidenhout D\r\nFAU - Williams, David F\r\nAU  - Williams DF\r\nFAU - Zilla, Peter\r\nAU  - Zilla P\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\t\r\nPL  - Netherlands\r\nTA  - Biomaterials\r\nJT  - Biomaterials\r\nJID - 8100316\r\nSB  - IM\r\nEDAT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2014/12/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/07/01 [received]\r\nPHST- 2014/09/12 [accepted]\r\nAID - S0142-9612(14)01011-4 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.09.013 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Biomaterials. 2015 Jan;36:6-25.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25443016\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDA  - 20141203\r\nDCOM- 20150204\r\nIS  - 1552-6259 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0003-4975 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 98\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2014 Dec\r\nTI  - Durable ventricular assist device support for failing systemic morphologic right \r\n      ventricle: early results.\r\nPG  - 2122-9\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.06.054 [doi]\r\nLID - S0003-4975(14)01338-1 [pii]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The systemic morphologic right ventricle (RV) in congenitally\r\n      corrected transposition of the great arteries or after atrial switch for\r\n      transposition of the great arteries is associated with late ventricular failure. \r\n      Although the role of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in supporting the \r\n      failing LV is established, the indications and outcomes of using LVAD in a\r\n      systemic RV remain unclear. We assessed the role of a third-generation LVAD for\r\n      systemic RV support. METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 36 years) received the\r\n      HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA) VAD for systemic RV\r\n      failure (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries in 1 and\r\n      after atrial switch in 6). Four patients (57\%) had severe subpulmonic LV failure,\r\n      and aggressive perioperative diuresis with or without hemofiltration was used to \r\n      offload the subpulmonic LV. The indications of VAD were (1) bridge to transplant \r\n      in 3 and (2) bridge to decision for a high transpulmonary gradient in 4.\r\n      Transplantation outcome was compared with systemic RV failure without VAD bridge \r\n      in 19 patients (years 1989 to 2013). RESULTS: Systemic RV support alone was\r\n      achieved in all patients, with no early deaths (</=30 days). Overall, 6 (86\%)\r\n      returned home, 3 (44\%) received a transplant, 2 (28\%) died of noncardiac causes, \r\n      and 2 (28\%) continue on VAD support (median support, 232 days). Repeat\r\n      catheterization (n = 4) showed an improved median transpulmonary gradient in 3\r\n      patients (median 18.5 mm Hg pre-VAD vs 8.0 mm Hg post-VAD). Two\r\n      bridge-to-decision patients received transplants at 640 and 685 days. The stroke \r\n      rate on VAD support was 43\% (2 thromboembolic and 1 hemorrhagic; 3 with\r\n      satisfactory recovery). De novo aortic regurgitation was 29\% (n = 2; 1 valve\r\n      replacement). All patients (n = 3) survived transplantation (vs 10.5\% early\r\n      mortality without VAD bridge; p = 1.00) and were well at follow-up (range, 53 to \r\n      700 days). CONCLUSIONS: The third-generation VAD provides durable support for\r\n      systemic RV failure as a bridge to transplant and as a strategy to reduce\r\n      pulmonary vascular resistance. Although concomitant subpulmonic LV failure is\r\n      common, systemic RV support alone was achieved in all patients.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

Despite the functional and biologic evidence of reverse cardiac\r\n      remodeling, few patients actually proceed to myocardial recovery, and even fewer \r\n      to the point of having their device explanted. An enhanced understanding of the\r\n      biology and care of the mechanically supported patient has redirected focus on\r\n      the possibility of using ventricular assist devices as a bridge to myocardial\r\n      recovery and removal.
