Gastrointestinal (GI)      bleeding has been frequently reported within this population. METHODS: A      retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from      January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and      management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was      conducted to identify related risk factors. RESULTS: A significant incidence of      GI bleeding (22.8\%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93\%)       population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from       the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54\% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37\% from      ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35\% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI)      tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95\% CI, 2.2-228.6;      p=0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2-12.9;      p=0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98 -0.99; p=0.001) were      independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in      older patients (mean, 70 years; p=0.01). The majority of bleeders (60\%) rebled      from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding      anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide       did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates,      length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct       consequence of GI bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors account for GI bleeding      in patients on CF-VADs. A previous history of bleeding increases risk      significantly and warrants careful monitoring.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
