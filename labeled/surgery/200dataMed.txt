Consequently, more patients with advanced heart failure require a      ventricular assist device (VAD). We report U.K. activity, trends, and outcome for      long-term VAD support as a bridging therapy to HTx. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients      were grouped into three eras: E1, February 2004-March 2006; E2, April 2006-March       2009; and E3, April 2009-March 2011. Exclusions were patients who received      isolated short-term support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation without prior       or subsequent long-term VAD support. A total of 247 patients received VAD      support; 202 left ventricular (LVAD) support alone and 45 both left and right      ventricular support. Activity increased over time, from 36 patients implanted in       E1 to 123 in E3. Overall, 46 patients received a first-generation device, 80 a      second-generation device, and 121 a third-generation device. Use of      third-generation devices increased from <6\% in E1 to 78\% in E3. Median duration      of LVAD support increased from 141 days in E1 to 578 days in E3 (P < 0.001).      Overall survival to 1 year after LVAD implant rose from 58.3\% [95\% confidence      interval (CI) 40.7-72.4\%] in E1 to 72.5\% (95\% CI 63.3-79.8\%) in E3 (P = 0.21),      and improved significantly with device generation; at 1 year, 50\% of patients      with first-generation devices were alive compared with 68.1\% and 76.9\% of      patients with second- and third-generation devices, respectively (P = 0.002).      These differences remained after risk adjustment. HTx following LVAD implant      reduced over time (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: VAD activity and duration of support      have increased. There has been a shift from first- and second- to      third-generation devices, and an associated improvement in survival.FAU - Emin, AkanAU  - Emin AAD  - Clinical Effectiveness Unit, The Royal College of Surgeons of England, London,      UK.FAU - Rogers, Chris AAU  - Rogers CAFAU - Parameshwar, JayanAU  - Parameshwar JFAU - Macgowan, GuyAU  - Macgowan GFAU - Taylor, RhiannonAU  - Taylor RFAU - Yonan, NizarAU  - Yonan NFAU - Simon, AndreAU  - Simon AFAU - Tsui, StevenAU  - Tsui SFAU - Schueler, StephanAU  - Schueler SFAU - Banner, Nicholas RAU  - Banner NRCN  - Steering Group of the UK Cardiothoracic Transplant AuditFAU - UK VAD ForumAU  - UK VAD ForumLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20130730PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Heart Fail. 2013 Oct;15(10):1080-1. - 23901056own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130925dcom- 20140507is  - 1879-0844 (electronic)is  - 1388-9842 (linking)vi  - 15ip  - 10dp  - 2013 octti  - trends in long-term mechanical circulatory support for advanced heart failure in       the uk.pg  - 1185-93lid - 10.1093/eurjhf/hft127 [doi]ab  - aims: heart transplantation (htx) is limited by the scarcity of suitable donor      hearts. consequently, more patients with advanced heart failure require a      ventricular assist device (vad). we report u.k. activity, trends, and outcome for      long-term vad support as a bridging therapy to htx. methods and results: patients      were grouped into three eras: e1, february 2004-march 2006; e2, april 2006-march       2009; and e3, april 2009-march 2011. exclusions were patients who received      isolated short-term support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation without prior       or subsequent long-term vad support. a total of 247 patients received vad      support; 202 left ventricular (lvad) support alone and 45 both left and right      ventricular support. activity increased over time, from 36 patients implanted in       e1 to 123 in e3. overall, 46 patients received a first-generation device, 80 a      second-generation device, and 121 a third-generation device. use of      third-generation devices increased from <6\% in e1 to 78\% in e3. median duration      of lvad support increased from 141 days in e1 to 578 days in e3 (p < 0.001).      overall survival to 1 year after lvad implant rose from 58.3\% [95\% confidence      interval (ci) 40.7-72.4\%] in e1 to 72.5\% (95\% ci 63.3-79.8\%) in e3 (p = 0.21),      and improved significantly with device generation; at 1 year, 50\% of patients      with first-generation devices were alive compared with 68.1\% and 76.9\% of      patients with second- and third-generation devices, respectively (p = 0.002).      these differences remained after risk adjustment. htx following lvad implant      reduced over time (p < 0.001). conclusion: vad activity and duration of support      have increased. there has been a shift from first- and second- to      third-generation devices, and an associated improvement in survival.fau - emin, akanau  - emin aad  - clinical effectiveness unit, the royal college of surgeons of england, london,      uk.fau - rogers, chris aau  - rogers cafau - parameshwar, jayanau  - parameshwar jfau - macgowan, guyau  - macgowan gfau - taylor, rhiannonau  - taylor rfau - yonan, nizarau  - yonan nfau - simon, andreau  - simon afau - tsui, stevenau  - tsui sfau - schueler, stephanau  - schueler sfau - banner, nicholas rau  - banner nrcn  - steering group of the uk cardiothoracic transplant auditfau - uk vad forumau  - uk vad forumla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\tdep - 20130730pl  - netherlandsta  - eur j heart failjt  - european journal of heart failurejid - 100887595sb  - imcin - eur j heart fail. 2013 oct;15(10):1080-1.
