The association      between ECM turnover and right ventricular failure (RVF) development after left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in patients with advanced heart      failure (HF) was investigated. METHODS: Circulating levels of osteopontin,      metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MPP-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and      TIMP-4 were measured in 61 patients at LVAD implantation and explantation and in       10 control subjects. RVF was defined as the need for RVAD, nitric oxide      inhalation > 48 hours and/or inotropic support > 14 days. RESULTS: All ECM      markers were elevated in patients with HF compared with controls (all p < 0.05).       RVF developed in 23 patients (37.7\%) on LVAD support. All ECM markers decreased      on LVAD support in patients without RVF (all p < 0.05), but serum MMP-2, TIMP-1,       TIMP-4, and osteopontin remained elevated in RVF patients. Multivariate analysis       identified that right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI), circulating B-type      natriuretic peptide, and osteopontin were associated with RVF (all p < 0.05).      Osteopontin correlated inversely with RVSWI (r = -0.44, p < 0.001). Osteopontin      levels > 260 ng/ml discriminate patients who develop RVF from those without RVF      (sensitivity, 83\%; specificity, 82\%). CONCLUSIONS: Marked elevation of      osteopontin levels before LVAD placement is associated with RVF development.      Persistent elevation of circulating ECM markers after LVAD implantation      characterizes patients who develop RVF. These novel biomarkers would have a      potential role in the prediction of RVF development in patients undergoing LVAD      implantation.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
