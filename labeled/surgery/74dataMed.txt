METHODS: Between January 2006 and September      2012, 2,196 patients with moderate to severe pre-operative TR from 115      institutions underwent implantation of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist       device (LVAD) as reported by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database.       Of these, 588 (27\%) underwent a concomitant TVP. Inverse probability weighting      based on propensity score was used to adjust for differences between the LVAD      alone and LVAD+TVP groups, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Most patients in       the LVAD+TVP group underwent an annuloplasty alone (81.1\%). Concomitant TVP did      not affect risk of post-operative right VAD insertion (risk ratio [RR], 0.81; 95\%      confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.36; p = 0.4310) or death (RR, 0.95; 95\% CI,      0.68-1.33; p = 0.7658). However, TVP was associated with an increased risk for      post-operative renal failure (RR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.13-2.08; p = 0.0061), dialysis       (RR, 1.49; 95\% CI, 1.03-2.15; p = 0.0339), reoperation (RR, 1.24; 95\% CI,      1.07-1.45; p = 0.0056), greater total transfusion requirement (RR, 1.03; 95\% CI,       1.01-1.05; p = 0.0013), and hospital length of stay > 21 days (RR, 1.29; 95\% CI,       1.16-1.43; p < 0.0001). Time on the ventilator and intensive care unit length of       stay were also significantly prolonged for the LVAD+TVP group. CONCLUSIONS:      Performing a concomitant TVP for continuous-flow LVAD patients with moderate to      severe TR did not reduce early death or right VAD requirement and was associated       with worse early post-operative outcomes. These data caution against routine      concomitant TVP based solely on degree of pre-operative TR and suggest that      additional selection criteria are needed to identify those patients in whom      concomitant TVP may prevent post-operative right ventricular failure.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
