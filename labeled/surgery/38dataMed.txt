BACKGROUND: PH is common in patients      with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) receiving CRT. The impact of PH      subtype on clinical outcome in CRT is unknown. METHODS: The study population      consisted of 101 patients (average age 66 +/- 13 years, left ventricular ejection      fraction 0.23 +/- 0.07, and New York Heart Association functional class 3.2 +/-      0.4) who underwent right heart catheterization in the 6 months before CRT. PH was      defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure >/=25 mm Hg; a significant      pre-capillary contribution to elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure was defined      as a transpulmonary gradient (TPG) >/=12 mm Hg. Clinical endpoints were assessed       at 2 years and included all-cause mortality and a composite of death, left      ventricular assist device, or cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with TPG      >/=12 mm Hg were more likely to experience all-cause mortality (hazard ratio      [HR]: 3.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 7.4; p = 0.009) and the composite      outcome (HR: 3.0; 95\% CI: 1.4 to 6.3; p = 0.004) compared with patients with TPG       <12 mm Hg. After multivariate adjustment for hemodynamic, clinical, and      echocardiographic variables, only TPG >/=12 mm Hg and baseline right ventricular       (RV) dilation (RV end-diastolic dimension >42 mm) were associated with the      composite clinical outcome (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:      High TPG PH and RV dilation are independent predictors of adverse outcomes in      patients with LVSD who are receiving CRT. RV pulmonary vascular dysfunction may      be a therapeutic target in select patients receiving CRT.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by      Elsevier Inc.
