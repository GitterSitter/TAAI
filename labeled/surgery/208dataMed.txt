In this study we       describe the partial unloading effects in ischemic CHF. METHODS: Six weeks after       myocardial infarction, sheep were randomized to partial support (\"pump,\" n = 5),       as provided by the CircuLite Synergy micro-pump, or to no therapy (\"sham,\" n = 6)      for an additional 6 weeks. At baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks after infarction,      pressure-volume (PV) recordings were made. Systolic and diastolic functions were       characterized by the end-systolic volume (ESV) where LV end-systolic pressure      reached 90 mm Hg (V90), and the end-diastolic volume (EDV) where LV end-diastolic      pressure reached 15 mm Hg (V15), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)      was performed 6 and 12 weeks after infarction. During autopsy at 12 weeks,      isolated LVs were weighed. Histologically, the degree of fibrosis in the      non-infarcted area was assessed using systematic randomized sampling, and myocyte      hypertrophy was measured by the mean linear intercept method. RESULTS: At 6      weeks, PV measurements showed a V90 and V15 increase (p = NS between groups). Six      weeks later, V90 and V15 increased in the sham group. In the pump group, V90      decreased but V15 did not change significantly. At 6 weeks, MRI indicated no      significant difference between groups. Six weeks later, in the sham group, EDV      and ESV increased significantly. In the pump group, EDV decreased significantly      and ESV trended to decrease. Sphericity index increased in the sham group and      decreased in the pump group, although not significantly. Explanted LV masses were      significantly higher in the sham group than in the pump group. The pump group had      a decrease in fibrosis and less myocyte hypertrophy.
