Epub 2010 Jun 19.Initial clinical experience with a novel left ventricular assist device with amagnetically levitated rotor in a multi-institutional trial.Wieselthaler GM(1), O Driscoll G, Jansz P, Khaghani A, Strueber M; HVAD Clinical Investigators.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, ViennaGeneral Hospital, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria.georg.wieselthaler@meduniwien.ac.atBACKGROUND: Third-generation rotary blood pumps have magnetically levitatedrotors that eliminate mechanical wear over the years. Together with theirpotential for miniaturization, these pumps seem suitable for long-term support ofpatients with a wide range of body surface areas (BSA). Recently, the novel HVAD pump (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA), a miniaturized centrifugal pump with ahydrodynamic, magnetically levitated rotor, became ready for clinicalapplication.METHODS: In a multi-institutional trial in Europe and Australia, 23 patients(mean age, 47.9 Â± 12 years) in end-stage heart failure were enrolled in 5centers. The primary end point of the bridge-to-transplant study was survival to heart transplant or survival to 180 days on the device, whichever occurred first.Follow-up data at 1 year are presented. The small size of the device allows forintrapericardial placement of the pump.RESULTS: Implant procedures were generally fast and uneventful. Mean duration of support was 167 Â± 143 days (range, 13-425 days), and mean blood flow provided by the pump was 6.1 Â± 1.1 liters/min. At the 180-day end point, 2 patients hadundergone successful transplant at 157 and 175 days, 2 patients died while on thedevice, and 19 patients continued pump support for more than 180 days. Actuarial survival after 6 months was 91\% and was 86\% at the 1-year follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The design of the HVAD pump enables a quick and less invasiveimplantation. The results to date demonstrate satisfactory long-term survivalwith excellent quality of life in this cohort of 23 patients of the initialmulti-institutional ConformitÃ© EuropÃ©ene (CE) mark trial.Copyright Â© 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
