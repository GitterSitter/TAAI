We analyzed our center\s resultsfollowing implantation of a biventricular assist device (BVAD).METHODS: We implanted 39 BVADs between September 2001 and January 2009. Allpatients were qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organavailable at time of BVAD implantation. Fifteen patients without a history ofchronic cardiomyopathy suffered from acute BV failure (group 1), whereas theother 24 suffered from severe chronic cardiomyopathy (group 2). The indicationfor BVAD implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degreeof end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was a candidate for bridge to recovery.RESULTS: Both groups were similar regarding their preoperative hemodynamics,intraoperative and early postoperative findings, and adverse events. Patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37Â±17 years) than those in group 2 (51Â±12 years). Mean duration of support in group 1 was 137Â±109 days, and 65Â±61 days in group 2. In group 1, 33\% (5/15) were weaned off the device and 53\% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24 patients (42\%) in the chronic group weretransplanted. Group 1\s mortality on the device was lower than that of group 2(13\% vs 67\%). Furthermore, 11 patients of group 1 survived for 1 year comparedwith four in group 2 (73\% vs 17\%).CONCLUSION: Implantation of a BVAD in patients with chronic heart failure andacute decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Bycontrast, BVAD implantation can achieve excellent results in patients with acute BV failure without a history of chronic cardiomyopathy, even if they are incardiogenic shock upon admission.PMCID: PMC3241088: 21595723  [pubmed - indexed for medline]791. eur j cardiothorac surg. 2012 jan;41(1):207-12; discussion 212. doi:10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.04.002.thoratec paracorporeal biventricular assist device therapy: the freiburgexperience.brehm k(1), heilmann c, siepe m, benk c, beyersdorf f, schlensak c.author information: (1)department of cardiovascular surgery, university heart center freiburg-badkrozingen, freiburg, germany. kerstin.brehm@uniklinik-freiburg.deobjective: the treatment of severe biventricular (bv) contractile failure usingmechanical circulatory support is challenging. we analyzed our center\s resultsfollowing implantation of a biventricular assist device (bvad).methods: we implanted 39 bvads between september 2001 and january 2009. allpatients were qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organavailable at time of bvad implantation. fifteen patients without a history ofchronic cardiomyopathy suffered from acute bv failure (group 1), whereas theother 24 suffered from severe chronic cardiomyopathy (group 2). the indicationfor bvad implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degreeof end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was a candidate for bridge to recovery.results: both groups were similar regarding their preoperative hemodynamics,intraoperative and early postoperative findings, and adverse events. patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37â±17 years) than those in group 2 (51â±12 years). mean duration of support in group 1 was 137â±109 days, and 65â±61 days in group 2. in group 1, 33\% (5/15) were weaned off the device and 53\% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24 patients (42\%) in the chronic group weretransplanted. group 1\s mortality on the device was lower than that of group 2(13\% vs 67\%). furthermore, 11 patients of group 1 survived for 1 year comparedwith four in group 2 (73\% vs 17\%).conclusion: implantation of a bvad in patients with chronic heart failure andacute decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. bycontrast, bvad implantation can achieve excellent results in patients with acute bv failure without a history of chronic cardiomyopathy, even if they are incardiogenic shock upon admission.pmcid: pmc3241088
