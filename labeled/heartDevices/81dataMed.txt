The TandemHeart initially had been used fortemporary hemodynamic assistance during postcardiotomy heart failure andhigh-risk coronary interventions. More recently, its use in patients withcardiogenic shock from acute myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis, andcritical aortic stenosis has been reported. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reported cases in which the TandemHeart pVAD served as a successful device for support during acute cardiac transplant rejection.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.
