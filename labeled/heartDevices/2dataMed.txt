Epub 2009 Sep 26.Reversal of secondary pulmonary hypertension by axial and pulsatile mechanicalcirculatory support.Torre-Amione G(1), Southard RE, Loebe MM, Youker KA, Bruckner B, Estep JD,Tierney M, Noon GP.Author information: (1)The Department of Cardiology, The Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center,The Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA. gtorres@tmhs.org <gtorres@tmhs.org>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic congestive heartfailure posses a significant risk of morbidity and death after hearttransplantation. Isolated observations suggest that chronic ventricular unloadingmay lead to normalization of pulmonary pressures and thus render a patient likelyto be a heart transplant candidate.METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of 9 heart failure patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (transpulmonary gradient [TPG] > 15 mm/Hg). Two were treated with a pulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 7 with anaxial-flow LVAD.RESULTS: After LVAD support, mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 39 +/-7 to 31 +/- 5 mm Hg, and the TPG decreased from 19 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg (p <0.01). The 1-year Kaplan-Meier survival curve for patients with pre-LVAD TPG > 15mm Hg vs those with TPG < 15 mm Hg showed no difference in survival (p = 0.6).This finding was supported by analysis of a large multi-institutional cohortobtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database, whereno differences in survival were found in the same groups.CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to congestive heartfailure, as defined by a TPG > 15 mm Hg can be reversed by the use of pulsatileand axial-flow LVADs; furthermore, post-transplant survival for patients withsecondary pulmonary hypertension treated with an LVAD was no different than forthose without pulmonary hypertension who received LVAD support.: 19783184  [pubmed - indexed for medline]1043. j heart lung transplant. 2010 feb;29(2):195-200. doi:10.1016/j.healun.2009.05.030. epub 2009 sep 26.reversal of secondary pulmonary hypertension by axial and pulsatile mechanicalcirculatory support.torre-amione g(1), southard re, loebe mm, youker ka, bruckner b, estep jd,tierney m, noon gp.author information: (1)the department of cardiology, the methodist debakey heart & vascular center,the methodist hospital, houston, texas, usa. gtorres@tmhs.org <gtorres@tmhs.org>background: pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic congestive heartfailure posses a significant risk of morbidity and death after hearttransplantation. isolated observations suggest that chronic ventricular unloadingmay lead to normalization of pulmonary pressures and thus render a patient likelyto be a heart transplant candidate.methods: this study is a retrospective analysis of 9 heart failure patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (transpulmonary gradient [tpg] > 15 mm/hg). two were treated with a pulsatile left ventricular assist device (lvad) and 7 with anaxial-flow lvad.results: after lvad support, mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 39 +/-7 to 31 +/- 5 mm hg, and the tpg decreased from 19 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 4 mm hg (p <0.01). the 1-year kaplan-meier survival curve for patients with pre-lvad tpg > 15mm hg vs those with tpg < 15 mm hg showed no difference in survival (p = 0.6).this finding was supported by analysis of a large multi-institutional cohortobtained from the organ procurement and transplantation network database, whereno differences in survival were found in the same groups.conclusions: pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to congestive heartfailure, as defined by a tpg > 15 mm hg can be reversed by the use of pulsatileand axial-flow lvads; furthermore, post-transplant survival for patients withsecondary pulmonary hypertension treated with an lvad was no different than forthose without pulmonary hypertension who received lvad support.
