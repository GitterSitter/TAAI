The purpose of this study was toevaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD inend-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in theNetherlands.METHODS: A third-generation LVAD was implanted in 16 heart failure patients (age 61â€‰Â±â€‰8; 81Â \% male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20â€‰Â±â€‰6Â \%) as destinationtherapy. All patients were ineligible for heart transplant. At baseline, 3 and6Â months, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, quality-of-life andexercise capacity were assessed. Clinical adverse events were registered.RESULTS: Survival at 30Â days and 6Â months was 88 and 75Â \%, respectively. In thepostoperative phase, 6 (38Â \%) patients required continuous veno-venoushaemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13Â \%) patients required extracorporealmembrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure. Duringfollow-up, NYHA functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.1 to2.3â€‰Â±â€‰0.1 and 57â€‰Â±â€‰5 to 23â€‰Â±â€‰3 at 6Â months (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), respectively. The 6Â minwalking distance improved from 168â€‰Â±â€‰42Â m to 291â€‰Â±â€‰29Â m at 6Â months (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001).CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD therapy is a promising treatment for patientswith end-stage heart failure ineligible for heart transplant.PMCID: PMC4315784: 25277608  [pubmed - indexed for medline]106. neth heart j. 2015 feb;23(2):102-8. doi: 10.1007/s12471-014-0602-4.left ventricular assist device for end-stage heart failure: results of the first lvad destination program in the netherlands.haeck ml(1), beeres sl, hã¶ke u, palmen m, couperus le, delgado v, logeman ea,maas jj, klautz rj, schalij mj, verwey hf.author information: (1)department of cardiology, leiden university medical center, albinusdreef 2,2333 za, leiden, the netherlands.purpose: mechanical circulatory support with a continuous-flow left ventricularassist device (lvad) may be a valuable treatment in end-stage heart failurepatients for an extended period of time. the purpose of this study was toevaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow lvad inend-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in thenetherlands.methods: a third-generation lvad was implanted in 16 heart failure patients (age 61â€‰â±â€‰8; 81â \% male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20â€‰â±â€‰6â \%) as destinationtherapy. all patients were ineligible for heart transplant. at baseline, 3 and6â months, new york heart association (nyha) functional class, quality-of-life andexercise capacity were assessed. clinical adverse events were registered.results: survival at 30â days and 6â months was 88 and 75â \%, respectively. in thepostoperative phase, 6 (38â \%) patients required continuous veno-venoushaemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13â \%) patients required extracorporealmembrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure. duringfollow-up, nyha functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7â€‰â±â€‰0.1 to2.3â€‰â±â€‰0.1 and 57â€‰â±â€‰5 to 23â€‰â±â€‰3 at 6â months (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), respectively. the 6â minwalking distance improved from 168â€‰â±â€‰42â m to 291â€‰â±â€‰29â m at 6â months (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001).conclusion: continuous-flow lvad therapy is a promising treatment for patientswith end-stage heart failure ineligible for heart transplant.pmcid: pmc4315784
