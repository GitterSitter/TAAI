The increased use of VADs is paralleledby an increased use of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography to 1)assist in the selection of patients for VAD therapy and VADs to meet patientneeds; 2) identify important anatomic considerations prior to implant; 3) guideplacement of VADs; 4) diagnose the etiology of VAD dysfunction; and 5) guide the weaning from VAD support and the optimization of VAD device settings.
