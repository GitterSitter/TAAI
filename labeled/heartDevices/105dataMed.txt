There aretwo pathologic processes involved in etiology of this type of renalinsufficiency: first is the decrease in end organ perfusion as a result ofreduction in cardiac output of the failing heart, second is the vascularnephrosclerosis resulting from atherosclerosis as part of the underlying disease process. This paper outlines the benefit of mechanical assist device implantationin improving renal function. After a rapid improvement of renal functions afterbiventricular assist device implantation in our patient with dilatedcardiomyopathy we were able to avoid combined heart and kidney transplant andproceed with an isolated heart transplant.: 20430203  [pubmed - indexed for medline]969. cas lek cesk. 2010;149(3):129-32.[impact of mechanical circulatory support on renal function in a patient with endstage heart failure].[article in czech]urban m(1), netuka i, par„≠kov„° a, mal„Ω j, sz„°rszoi o, pirk j.author information: (1)klinika kardiovaskularni chirurgie ikem, praha. maub@ikem.czrenal insufficiency is common in patients with chronic heart failure. there aretwo pathologic processes involved in etiology of this type of renalinsufficiency: first is the decrease in end organ perfusion as a result ofreduction in cardiac output of the failing heart, second is the vascularnephrosclerosis resulting from atherosclerosis as part of the underlying disease process. this paper outlines the benefit of mechanical assist device implantationin improving renal function. after a rapid improvement of renal functions afterbiventricular assist device implantation in our patient with dilatedcardiomyopathy we were able to avoid combined heart and kidney transplant andproceed with an isolated heart transplant.
