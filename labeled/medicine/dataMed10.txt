LOUIS, MISSOURI, USA\r\nLeft Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs):\r\nOverview and Future Directions\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri, USA\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Technology in the U.S.\r\n Largest producer and consumer of medical technology\r\nworldwide: 40\% of the global market\r\n American healthcare is expensive: 17\% of the GDP\r\n $100 billion market in 2010; $38 billion in exports\r\n Electromedical (pacemakers, MRI, ultrasound)\r\n Radiation (CT, diagnostic imaging)\r\n Surgical supplies (orthopedic joints, stents)\r\n Investment in medical device R&D doubled in the 1990s\r\n Focus on: Medical Technology therapies in Heart Failure\r\n Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs)\r\nDefinition and Epidemiology of Heart Failure\r\n Systemic perfusion inadequate to meet the body’s metabolic demands due to impaired cardiac function\r\n Most common cause is left ventricular (LV) dysfunction\r\n Coronary artery disease / Ischemic cardiomyopathy\r\n Dilated cardiomyopathy\r\n Valvular heart disease\r\n Hypertensive heart disease\r\n 5.8 million Americans in 2006 (2\% of the U.S. population)\r\n 550,000 new cases diagnosed annually\r\n 23 million individuals worldwide (est.)\r\n Over time\r\n decreased quality of life and more frequent admissions\r\n One million hospital admissions and $28 billion annually\r\n Cardiac transplant: well-accepted treatment for end-stage heart failure\r\n Severe organ shortage\r\nNormal Anatomy Review\r\nPathophysiology of Heart Failure\r\nLV’s pumping\r\nfunction is\r\nineffective\r\nHeart Failure Signs and Symptoms\r\n As the stage of heart failure progresses (I\r\nIV), mortality\r\nincreases\r\n Treatment options for end-stage heart failure are limited\r\n The significant morbidity and mortality of heart failure led to exploration of mechanical cardiac support devices for end-stage heart failure\r\nHistory of Mechanical Cardiac Support\r\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020\r\nCardiopulmonary\r\nBypass\r\nIntra-aortic\r\nBalloon Pump\r\nExtracorporeal\r\nMembrane\r\nOxygenation\r\nPulsatile VADs:\r\n1st generation\r\nContinuous Flow\r\nVADs: 2nd generation\r\nElectromagnetic\r\nVADs: 3rd\r\ngeneration; Total\r\nartificial hearts\r\n2010: FDA approval:\r\ndestination therapy\r\n2003: FDA approval:\r\nbridge to transplantation\r\nFirst cardiac\r\ntransplant\r\nVentricular Assist Devices (VADs)\r\n A mechanical circulatory device used to partially or completely\r\nreplace cardiac function\r\n Mechanical support and ventricular unloading enables:\r\n Hemodynamic stabilization\r\n Organ recovery (reverse remodeling, normalization of chamber geometry)\r\n Improved contractile performance\r\n May replace the right, left, or both ventricles\r\n Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) most common\r\n Most commonly used in end-stage heart failure\r\n More than 4000 HeartMate II implanted since 2008\r\n 1700 devices per year in the U.S.\r\n 430 per year in Europe\r\nHeart Mate II\r\nLVAD Function\r\n• Inflow cannula\r\nconnected to LV apex\r\n• Outflow cannula\r\nconnected to aorta\r\n• Intracorporeal pump\r\nwith continuous axial\r\nflow rests below\r\ndiaphragm\r\n• Device mechanically\r\npumps blood\r\n• Up to 15,000\r\nrotations/min = 8-\r\n10L/min blood flow\r\nSurgical Implantation\r\nPatient Selection\r\n Bridge to cardiac transplant\r\n Most frequent indication worldwide\r\n Bridge to recovery\r\n Mechanical support during reverse remodeling\r\n Acute MI, graft failure, postpartum cardiomyopathy\r\n Destination therapy\r\n Not a transplant candidate (age, comorbidities, noncompliance)\r\n USA, Canada, Germany, Austria\r\n Bridge to decision (short-term LVAD)\r\n Emergency cardiogenic shock (Acute MI, fulminant myocarditis)\r\n Immediate stabilization for days-weeks during further evaluation\r\n Candidates must:\r\n Be on maximal inotropic support +/- intraortic balloon pump (IABP)\r\nAND\r\n Systolic BP < 80 AND Cardiac index < 2.0 OR PCWP > 20\r\n No irreversible secondary end-organ damage\r\nComplications\r\n Infection: 28\% at 3 mo\r\n Especially of driveline and pocket; Fatal sepsis in 25\%\r\n Bleeding: 42\% at 6 mo\r\n Perioperative\r\n Postoperative anticoagulation: target INR 2.5-3.5\r\n Stroke and peripheral thromboembolism\r\n Incidence lower with newer devices\r\n RV failure\r\n RV function must be optimized prior to implantation\r\n May require postoperative vasopressors\r\n Arrhythmia\r\n Monomorphic VT\r\n Hemolysis\r\n Acquired von Willebrand syndrome\r\n Device failure: 0 at 1 yr; 35\% at 2 yr\r\n Complications limit the ability of the technology to provide indefinite support\r\nREMATCH Trial: NEJM 2001\r\n 129 patients assigned to LVAD vs optimal medical therapy\r\n Survival 52 vs 25\% at 1 yr; 23 vs 8\% at 2 yr = 48\% reduction in mortality\r\n Significantly improved quality of life at one year\r\nHeartMate II: Bridge to Therapy\r\n One study of 133 patients receiving HeartMate II\r\ndemonstrated:\r\n Primary outcome of cardiac recovery, cardiac transplant, or\r\nsurvival occurred in 75\%\r\n 68\% survival at one year\r\n Significant improvements in NYHA functional class, 6 minute\r\nwalk, and quality of life at 3 mo\r\nLVAD: Long-Term Outcomes\r\n Medicare database analysis of 1476 LVAD recipients\r\n 55\% were discharged alive\r\n Of these,\r\n 56\% readmitted within 6 months\r\n 21\% underwent heart transplant at one year\r\n Overall one-year survival 52\%\r\n Mean Medicare payment $ 178,714 for one year\r\n INTERMACS study showed survival 56\% at one year\r\nThe Growing LVAD Market\r\n In the US, 50-60,000 patients annually could benefit from\r\nheart transplant\r\n 1,897 transplants performed in 2003\r\n LVADs designed to fill the gap\r\n Market analysis estimates 54,000 annual LVAD candidates\r\nin the developed world\r\n US: 20,000 destination therapy, 1500 bridge to transplant\r\n Similar rates estimated in Europe\r\n Rates expected to increase as more patients are placed on\r\ntransplant list and eligibility criteria increase in flexibility\r\n\r\nLVAD in Japan\r\n 113 patients underwent cardiac transplant 1999-2011\r\n Longest waiting period of all available countries, > 2. 5 years\r\n Law change regarding brain death in 2010; 30 transplants in 2010\r\n 90\% of transplant candidates require LVAD\r\n Mean wait time 877 days\r\n Internationally, 27\% require LVAD with 50 day wait time\r\n Japan Social Reimbursement System approved Nipro LVAD\r\n(1st gen)\r\n In 2011, approved Evaheart and Duraheart (2nd gen.)\r\n More common LVADs anticipated approval soon\r\nFinancial Considerations\r\n Extensive debate regarding high LVAD costs versus\r\npotential benefits in US healthcare politics\r\n Cost estimates vary\r\n Initial hospitalization costs $200,000\r\n Fully functional HeartMate XVE costs $100,000\r\n Outpatient costs after discharge $13,200\r\n Quality-adjusted life year (QALY)\r\n Initial estimates $800,000 per QALY\r\n More recent analyses estimate $100,000-150,000 per QALY\r\n Assumption that costs will fall over time as technology\r\nbecomes more widespread\r\nFuture Directions\r\n Jarvik 2000: axial flow, continuous flow impeller pump\r\n Transcutaneous Energy Transfer System (TETS)\r\n Avoid driveline infections\r\n Electromagnetic (centrifugal) continuous flow pump\r\n\r\n3rd generation LVAD\r\n Magnetically levitated, more efficient, long lifespan\r\n Total artificial heart\r\n Abiomed TAH currently undergoing clinical trials\r\nJarvik 2000\r\n• Totally implantable,\r\nsilent, unobtrusive\r\n• Encapsulated within\r\nmyocardium\r\n• Decreased risk of\r\ninfection and\r\nhemolysis\r\n• Power cable to RUQ\r\nor base of skull\r\n• Trial underway to\r\ncompare to medical\r\ntherapy\r\n\r\nAbiomed Total\r\nArtificial Heart\r\n• Patient’s heart\r\ntotally excised\r\n• RV + LV\r\nreplacement\r\n• Device entirely within mediastinum\r\n• Energy from low viscosity oil\r\n• Wire in abdomen\r\nprovides connection for transcutaneous\r\nenergy transfer\r\n• Currently under clinical trials\r\nQuestions?\r\nReferences\r\n Rose EA, Gelijns AC, Moskowitz AJ, et al.
