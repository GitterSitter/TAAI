The conventional approach has been to use      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but its lack of feasibility for      long-term use and the major complications associated with the technology have      limited its use, especially in light of lengthy waiting lists for donor hearts.      With the advent of the Berlin Heart EXCOR(R) Pediatric ventricular assist device       (VAD), pediatric heart failure specialists have gained an important tool for      helping this patient population survive until a donor heart can be identified.      The EXCOR Pediatric VAD is designed to support pediatric patients of all age      groups, from newborns to teenagers, and can be used successfully for many months.      This paper describes the early experience with the EXCOR Pediatric VAD and the      challenging journey undertaken to gain U.S. FDA approval, including successful      completion of the first worldwide prospective clinical study of VADs in a      pediatric population.CI  - (c) 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.FAU - Fraser, Charles D JrAU  - Fraser CD JrAD  - Texas Children\s Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. cdfraser@texaschildrens.orgFAU - Jaquiss, Robert D BAU  - Jaquiss RDLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130610PL  - United StatesTA  - Ann N Y Acad SciJT  - Annals of the New York Academy of SciencesJID - 7506858SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Berlin/epidemiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Clinical Trials as Topic/trendsMH  - *Device ApprovalMH  - ForecastingMH  - Heart Failure/*epidemiology/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/trendsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*trendsMH  - HumansMH  - North America/epidemiologyOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Berlin HeartOT  - EXCOROT  - VADOT  - pediatricsEDAT- 2013/06/12 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/12 06:00PHST- 2013/06/10 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/nyas.12144 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2013 Jul;1291:96-105. doi: 10.1111/nyas.12144.
