Recently, VADs have similarly taken a prominent      role in the management of end-stage heart failure in children. The purpose of      this review is to describe the indications for VADs in children, types of devices      available, current outcomes, and future directions of VAD therapy. RECENT      FINDINGS: There has been a dramatic increase in VAD utilization in children over       the last decade. For small children, paracorporeal pneumatic pulsatile pumps      (e.g., Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD, Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin, Germany) are most      commonly utilized for long-term support. In older children, intracorporeal      continuous flow devices (e.g., HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist System,      Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, California, USA and HeartWare Ventricular      Assist System, HeartWare Incorporated, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA) have been       used and allow the possibility of destination therapy. Other devices, such as the      total artificial heart, can be utilized for selected patients. Although overall      outcomes of pediatric VADs are favorable, complication rates remain high. The      utilization of VADs in complex circulations, such as single ventricle patients,      remains infrequent and is associated with a high rate of adverse outcomes.      SUMMARY: VADs are well-established treatment for end-stage heart failure in      children. Further investigation is needed to refine patient selection criteria,      minimize complications, and develop additional pediatric-specific devices.FAU - O\Connor, Matthew JAU  - O\Connor MJAD  - The Cardiac Center, The Children\s Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of      Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania,      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.FAU - Rossano, Joseph WAU  - Rossano JWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin CardiolJT  - Current opinion in cardiologyJID - 8608087SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart, ArtificialMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2013/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/02 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/26 06:00AID - 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000030 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Cardiol. 2014 Jan;29(1):113-21. doi: 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000030.- 24270395own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20131204dcom- 20140801is  - 1531-7080 (electronic)is  - 0268-4705 (linking)vi  - 29ip  - 1dp  - 2014 janti  - ventricular assist devices in children.pg  - 113-21lid - 10.1097/hco.0000000000000030 [doi]ab  - purpose of review: ventricular assist devices (vads) have revolutionized heart      failure management in adults. recently, vads have similarly taken a prominent      role in the management of end-stage heart failure in children. the purpose of      this review is to describe the indications for vads in children, types of devices      available, current outcomes, and future directions of vad therapy. recent      findings: there has been a dramatic increase in vad utilization in children over       the last decade. for small children, paracorporeal pneumatic pulsatile pumps      (e.g., berlin heart excor vad, berlin heart gmbh, berlin, germany) are most      commonly utilized for long-term support. in older children, intracorporeal      continuous flow devices (e.g., heartmate ii left ventricular assist system,      thoratec corporation, pleasanton, california, usa and heartware ventricular      assist system, heartware incorporated, framingham, massachusetts, usa) have been       used and allow the possibility of destination therapy. other devices, such as the      total artificial heart, can be utilized for selected patients. although overall      outcomes of pediatric vads are favorable, complication rates remain high. the      utilization of vads in complex circulations, such as single ventricle patients,      remains infrequent and is associated with a high rate of adverse outcomes.      summary: vads are well-established treatment for end-stage heart failure in      children. further investigation is needed to refine patient selection criteria,      minimize complications, and develop additional pediatric-specific devices.fau - o\connor, matthew jau  - o\connor mjad  - the cardiac center, the children\s hospital of philadelphia, department of      pediatrics, perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania,      philadelphia, pennsylvania, usa.fau - rossano, joseph wau  - rossano jwla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - curr opin cardioljt  - current opinion in cardiologyjid - 8608087sb  - immh  - childmh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - heart, artificialmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - treatment outcomeedat- 2013/11/26 06:00mhda- 2014/08/02 06:00crdt- 2013/11/26 06:00aid - 10.1097/hco.0000000000000030 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - curr opin cardiol. 2014 jan;29(1):113-21. doi: 10.1097/hco.0000000000000030.
