Anthracyclines and newer targeted\r\n      therapies, including trastuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are important\r\n      agents implemented in clinical practice that carry cardiotoxic risk. While acute \r\n      heart failure is often self-limited and reversible, delayed-onset heart failure\r\n      significantly reduces survival. Extremes of age, renal dysfunction, pre-existing \r\n      coronary artery disease, HER2 positivity, and multi-drug therapy are predictors\r\n      of irreversible heart failure after chemotherapy. Left ventricular assist device \r\n      (LVAD) implantation and cardiac transplantation can be performed safely in\r\n      patients with end-stage heart failure (HF) from chemotherapy. However,\r\n      co-existing right ventricular dysfunction, hepatic congestion, and increased risk\r\n      of bleeding make LVAD therapy challenging and dependent on careful patient\r\n      selection. Cardiac transplantation in patients with chemotherapy-induced heart\r\n      failure can be performed with good 10-year survival, but requires 5 years of\r\n      cancer freedom and post-transplant infections remain a problem. Improvements in\r\n      LVAD therapy and the expanding role of the total artificial heart and other\r\n      durable biventricular support devices will likely provide more reliable surgical \r\n      options for the management of end-stage HF after chemotherapy.\r\nFAU - Deo, Salil V\r\nAU  - Deo SV\r\nAD  - Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Center, Harrington Heart and Vascular\r\n      Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve\r\n      University, 11100 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.\r\nFAU - Al-Kindi, Sadeer G\r\nAU  - Al-Kindi SG\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Guilherme H\r\nAU  - Oliveira GH\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med\r\nJT  - Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine\r\nJID - 9815942\r\nEDAT- 2015/05/12 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/05/12 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2015/05/12 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1007/s11936-015-0388-8 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2015 Jun;17(6):388. doi:\r\n      10.1007/s11936-015-0388-8.
