We review our       experience with emergent peripheral cardiopulmonary support as a bridge to      decision in these patients. METHODS: A retrospective review from January 2009      through December 2010 was conducted of 26 consecutive adult patients at a single       institution with acute refractory cardiogenic shock who underwent salvage      peripheral cardiopulmonary support. RESULTS: There were 18 men and 8 women with a      mean age of 54 years (range 18 to 76). Indications for support: acute myocardial       infarction (n = 16), decompensated chronic heart failure (n = 2), refractory      arrhythmic arrest (n = 3), acute valvular pathology (n = 4), and unknown (n = 1).      Patients with primary postcardiotomy shock were excluded. Median duration of      support was 3 days (range 1 to 14). Decisions included: withdraw of support (n =       4), recovery (n = 5), and bridge to a procedure (n = 17). The procedures were      percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 4), left ventricular assist device (n =      9), heart transplantation (n = 1), and miscellaneous cardiac surgery (n = 3).      Overall survival to discharge was 65\%. In the recovery and bridge to a procedure       group, 78\% were discharged from the hospital and survival at three months was      72\%. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage peripheral cardiopulmonary support is a useful tool to       rapidly stabilize acute refractory cardiogenic shock permitting an assessment of       neurologic and end-organ viability.CI  - (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Moraca, Robert JAU  - Moraca RJAD  - Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Allegheny General Hospital,      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. rmoraca@wpahs.orgFAU - Wanamaker, Kelly MAU  - Wanamaker KMFAU - Bailey, Stephen HAU  - Bailey SHFAU - McGregor, Walter EAU  - McGregor WEFAU - Murali, SrinivasAU  - Murali SFAU - Benza, RaymondAU  - Benza RFAU - Sokos, GeorgeAU  - Sokos GFAU - Magovern, George J JrAU  - Magovern GJ JrLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120522PL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - AlgorithmsMH  - Decision Support TechniquesMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/instrumentation/*methods/mortalityMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Oxygenators, MembraneMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Salvage Therapy/instrumentation/*methods/mortalityMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/etiology/mortality/*therapyMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/05/24 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/10 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/24 06:00PHST- 2012/05/22 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01467.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2012 Jul;27(4):521-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01467.x.
