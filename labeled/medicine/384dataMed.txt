We report a child with BTHS      who had an \"undulating cardiac phenotype\" and ultimately developed decompensated       heart failure requiring mechanical circulatory support with a ventricular assist       device as a bridge to transplantation. His course was complicated by acute lung      injury requiring placement of an in-line oxygenator to maintain end-organ      function. Not only was his course complicated by cardiac and respiratory failure       but his BTHS associated comorbidities complicated the management of his therapy      using mechanical assist device support. He was successfully supported and      subsequently was transplanted. Here we discuss the management of a child with      BTHS using mechanical circulatory support and describe the use of an in-line      oxygenator, Quadrox, with the Berlin Excor device.FAU - Hanke, Samuel PAU  - Hanke SPAD  - Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children\s Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet      Avenue-ML 2003, Cincinnati, OH 45213, USA.FAU - Gardner, Aimee BAU  - Gardner ABFAU - Lombardi, John PAU  - Lombardi JPFAU - Manning, Peter BAU  - Manning PBFAU - Nelson, David PAU  - Nelson DPFAU - Towbin, Jeffrey AAU  - Towbin JAFAU - Jefferies, John LAU  - Jefferies JLFAU - Lorts, AngelaAU  - Lorts ALA  - engGR  - UL1 TR000077/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120317PL  - United StatesTA  - Pediatr CardiolJT  - Pediatric cardiologyJID - 8003849SB  - IMMH  - Barth Syndrome/surgery/*therapy/ultrasonographyMH  - EchocardiographyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Infant, NewbornMH  - Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular      Myocardium/surgery/*therapy/ultrasonographyMH  - MaleMH  - PhenotypeEDAT- 2012/03/20 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/29 06:00CRDT- 2012/03/20 06:00PHST- 2011/11/08 [received]PHST- 2012/02/16 [accepted]PHST- 2012/03/17 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00246-012-0258-z [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Cardiol. 2012 Dec;33(8):1430-4. doi: 10.1007/s00246-012-0258-z.
