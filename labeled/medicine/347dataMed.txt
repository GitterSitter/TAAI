Some of these patients will progress to need advanced therapies in       the form of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Over the past few years,      increased attention has been focused on clinical use of existing devices as well       the development of pediatric-specific ventricular assist devices (VADs). As in      adult populations, these devices offer unique opportunities to successfully      support children as a bridge-to-transplant, but increasing data suggest that      bridge-to-recovery and bridge-to-destination are also viable options in select      pediatric populations. Herein, we will review existing approaches as well      describe future potential MCS options.FAU - Jefferies, John LAU  - Jefferies JLAD  - The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children\s Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet      Avenue, MLC 2003, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA. john.jefferies@cchmc.orgFAU - Morales, David LAU  - Morales DLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Heart Fail RepJT  - Current heart failure reportsJID - 101196487SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Assisted Circulation/*methodsMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/methodsMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Quality of LifeEDAT- 2012/07/19 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/28 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/19 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11897-012-0103-y [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2012 Sep;9(3):236-43. doi: 10.1007/s11897-012-0103-y.- 22805892own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120727dcom- 20121227is  - 1546-9549 (electronic)is  - 1546-9530 (linking)vi  - 9ip  - 3dp  - 2012 septi  - mechanical circulatory support in children: bridge to transplant versus recovery.pg  - 236-43lid - 10.1007/s11897-012-0103-y [doi]ab  - the number of children and adolescents suffering from heart failure is increasing      dramatically. some of these patients will progress to need advanced therapies in       the form of mechanical circulatory support (mcs). over the past few years,      increased attention has been focused on clinical use of existing devices as well       the development of pediatric-specific ventricular assist devices (vads). as in      adult populations, these devices offer unique opportunities to successfully      support children as a bridge-to-transplant, but increasing data suggest that      bridge-to-recovery and bridge-to-destination are also viable options in select      pediatric populations. herein, we will review existing approaches as well      describe future potential mcs options.fau - jefferies, john lau  - jefferies jlad  - the heart institute, cincinnati children\s hospital medical center, 3333 burnet      avenue, mlc 2003, cincinnati, oh 45229, usa. john.jefferies@cchmc.orgfau - morales, david lau  - morales dlla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - curr heart fail repjt  - current heart failure reportsjid - 101196487sb  - immh  - adolescentmh  - assisted circulation/*methodsmh  - childmh  - child, preschoolmh  - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/methodsmh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - infantmh  - quality of lifeedat- 2012/07/19 06:00mhda- 2012/12/28 06:00crdt- 2012/07/19 06:00aid - 10.1007/s11897-012-0103-y [doi]pst - ppublishso  - curr heart fail rep. 2012 sep;9(3):236-43. doi: 10.1007/s11897-012-0103-y.
