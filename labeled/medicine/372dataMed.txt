Over       the past decade, left ventricular assist devices have been shown to improve the      survival and quality of life. However, it is quite clear that very sick patients       do not do as well, and it is therefore imperative to select patients at the      proper time. In this article, we review both the indications for considering left      ventricular assist device therapy as well as discuss the considerations and      therapy that should be done pre-operatively to possibly improve post-insertion      outcomes.FAU - Gilotra, Nisha AAU  - Gilotra NAAD  - Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital,      Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.FAU - Russell, Stuart DAU  - Russell SDLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Heart Fail RevJT  - Heart failure reviewsJID - 9612481SB  - IMMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Equipment SafetyMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/methods/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/adverse effects/*utilizationMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Patient SelectionMH  - Postoperative Care/methodsMH  - Postoperative Complications/mortality/physiopathologyMH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Survival RateMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/05/01 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/26 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/01 06:00AID - 10.1007/s10741-012-9316-0 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Heart Fail Rev. 2013 Jan;18(1):27-34. doi: 10.1007/s10741-012-9316-0.- 22544400own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20121231dcom- 20130625is  - 1573-7322 (electronic)is  - 1382-4147 (linking)vi  - 18ip  - 1dp  - 2013 janti  - patient selection for mechanical circulatory support.pg  - 27-34lid - 10.1007/s10741-012-9316-0 [doi]ab  - heart failure continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. over       the past decade, left ventricular assist devices have been shown to improve the      survival and quality of life. however, it is quite clear that very sick patients       do not do as well, and it is therefore imperative to select patients at the      proper time. in this article, we review both the indications for considering left      ventricular assist device therapy as well as discuss the considerations and      therapy that should be done pre-operatively to possibly improve post-insertion      outcomes.fau - gilotra, nisha aau  - gilotra naad  - division of cardiology, department of medicine, johns hopkins hospital,      baltimore, md 21287, usa.fau - russell, stuart dau  - russell sdla  - engpt  - comparative studypt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\tpt  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - heart fail revjt  - heart failure reviewsjid - 9612481sb  - immh  - equipment designmh  - equipment safetymh  - femalemh  - follow-up studiesmh  - heart failure/diagnosis/mortality/*surgerymh  - heart transplantation/methods/statistics & numerical datamh  - heart-assist devices/adverse effects/*utilizationmh  - hemodynamics/physiologymh  - humansmh  - malemh  - *patient selectionmh  - postoperative care/methodsmh  - postoperative complications/mortality/physiopathologymh  - *quality of lifemh  - severity of illness indexmh  - survival ratemh  - time factorsmh  - treatment outcomeedat- 2012/05/01 06:00mhda- 2013/06/26 06:00crdt- 2012/05/01 06:00aid - 10.1007/s10741-012-9316-0 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - heart fail rev. 2013 jan;18(1):27-34. doi: 10.1007/s10741-012-9316-0.
