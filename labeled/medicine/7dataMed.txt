So long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been proposed as an \r\n      alternative treatment option to assist patients scheduled on HTx waiting list\r\n      bridging them for a variable time period to cardiac transplantation-the so-called\r\n      bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) strategy. Nowadays approximately 90\% of patients \r\n      being considered for MCS receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). In\r\n      fact, LVAD experienced several improvements in the last decade and the\r\n      predominance of continuous-flow over pulsatile-flow technology has been evident\r\n      since 2008. The aim of the present report is to give an overview of\r\n      continuous-flow LVAD utilization in the specific setting of the BTT strategy\r\n      taking into consideration the most representative articles of the scientific\r\n      literature and focusing the attention on the evolution, clinical outcomes,\r\n      relevant implications on the HTx strategy and future perspectives of the\r\n      continuous-flow LVAD technology.\r\nFAU - Pozzi, Matteo\r\nAU  - Pozzi M\r\nAD  - 1 Department of Cardiac Surgery, \"Louis Pradel\" Cardiologic Hospital, Hospices\r\n      Civils de Lyon, \"Claude Bernard\" University, Lyon, France ;
