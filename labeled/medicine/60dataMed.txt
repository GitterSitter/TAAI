This rapidly growing therapeutic field has      produced impressive clinical outcomes and has great potential to help thousands      of otherwise terminal patients worldwide. In this review, we examine the state of      the art of mechanical circulatory support: current practice, totally implantable       systems of the future, evolving biventricular support mechanisms, the potential      for myocardial recovery and adjunctive treatment methods, and miniaturized      devices with expanded indications for therapy.FAU - Mallidi, Hari RAU  - Mallidi HRAD  - Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine; and Center for Cardiac      Support, Texas Heart Institute; Houston, Texas 77030.FAU - Anand, JatinAU  - Anand JAD  - Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine; and Center for Cardiac      Support, Texas Heart Institute; Houston, Texas 77030.FAU - Cohn, William EAU  - Cohn WEAD  - Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine; and Center for Cardiac      Support, Texas Heart Institute; Houston, Texas 77030.LA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20140401PL  - United StatesTA  - Tex Heart Inst JJT  - Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke\s      Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children\s HospitalJID - 8214622SB  - IMMH  - *Assisted Circulation/history/instrumentation/methodsMH  - Equipment Design/*historyMH  - *Heart Failure/physiopathology/surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/history/methodsMH  - *Heart-Assist Devices/classification/historyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - HumansMH  - InventionsMH  - Outcome Assessment (Health Care)PMC - PMC4004468OID - NLM: PMC4004468OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Assisted circulation/instrumentationOT  - device removalOT  - equipment designOT  - heart failure/therapyOT  - heart-assist devices/trends/utilizationOT  - patient selectionOT  - recovery of functionOT  - treatment outcomeOT  - ventricular dysfunction, left/therapyOT  - ventricular function/physiologyEDAT- 2014/05/09 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/31 06:00CRDT- 2014/05/09 06:00PHST- 2014/04 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/04/01 [epublish]AID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4143 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Tex Heart Inst J. 2014 Apr 1;41(2):115-20. doi: 10.14503/THIJ-14-4143.      eCollection 2014 Apr.- 24808767own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140508dcom- 20141230is  - 1526-6702 (electronic)is  - 0730-2347 (linking)vi  - 41ip  - 2dp  - 2014 aprti  - state of the art of mechanical circulatory support.pg  - 115-20lid - 10.14503/thij-14-4143 [doi]ab  - mechanical circulatory support of the failing heart has become an important means      of treating end-stage heart disease. this rapidly growing therapeutic field has      produced impressive clinical outcomes and has great potential to help thousands      of otherwise terminal patients worldwide. in this review, we examine the state of      the art of mechanical circulatory support: current practice, totally implantable       systems of the future, evolving biventricular support mechanisms, the potential      for myocardial recovery and adjunctive treatment methods, and miniaturized      devices with expanded indications for therapy.fau - mallidi, hari rau  - mallidi hrad  - department of surgery, baylor college of medicine; and center for cardiac      support, texas heart institute; houston, texas 77030.fau - anand, jatinau  - anand jad  - department of surgery, baylor college of medicine; and center for cardiac      support, texas heart institute; houston, texas 77030.fau - cohn, william eau  - cohn wead  - department of surgery, baylor college of medicine; and center for cardiac      support, texas heart institute; houston, texas 77030.la  - engpt  - historical articlept  - journal articlept  - reviewdep - 20140401pl  - united statesta  - tex heart inst jjt  - texas heart institute journal / from the texas heart institute of st. luke\s      episcopal hospital, texas children\s hospitaljid - 8214622sb  - immh  - *assisted circulation/history/instrumentation/methodsmh  - equipment design/*historymh  - *heart failure/physiopathology/surgerymh  - heart transplantation/history/methodsmh  - *heart-assist devices/classification/historymh  - history, 20th centurymh  - humansmh  - inventionsmh  - outcome assessment (health care)pmc - pmc4004468oid - nlm: pmc4004468oto - notnlmot  - assisted circulation/instrumentationot  - device removalot  - equipment designot  - heart failure/therapyot  - heart-assist devices/trends/utilizationot  - patient selectionot  - recovery of functionot  - treatment outcomeot  - ventricular dysfunction, left/therapyot  - ventricular function/physiologyedat- 2014/05/09 06:00mhda- 2014/12/31 06:00crdt- 2014/05/09 06:00phst- 2014/04 [ecollection]phst- 2014/04/01 [epublish]aid - 10.14503/thij-14-4143 [doi]pst - epublishso  - tex heart inst j. 2014 apr 1;41(2):115-20. doi: 10.14503/thij-14-4143.      ecollection 2014 apr.
