We present our      experiment of HTx using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with Thoratec       pneumatic ventricular assist device (TpVAD). METHODS: From May 1996 to June 2011,      among 410 patients who underwent HTx 23 required mechanical circulatory support      (MCS) with implantation of the TpVAD and 15 (65\%) of them received grafts.      RESULTS: The 23 patients included 4 female and 19 male patients of age range 10      to 80 years. Eighteen (78\%) of them needed ECMO before TpVAD implantation. Twelve      (67\%) were implanted with a TpVAD double bridge to HTx. The demand for MCS among       patients with acute hemodynamic collapse has led to major improvements in the      existing systems such as ECMO with double bridge to TpVAD. CONCLUSION: We used      ECMO as a rescue procedure for acute hemodynamic deterioration. However, during      ECMO support, left ventricular afterload increased. If prolonged support is      required, TpVAD might be required: 15 (65\%) of patients supported by ECMO with      TpVAD needed to a wait a suitable donor. We recommend the application of ECMO for      short-term support (within 1 week), and TpVAD as a bridge for medium- or      long-term support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
