A 27-year old woman with arrhythmogenic right ventricular      cardiomyopathy underwent implantation of two Jarvik 2000s as a left ventricular      assist device and right ventricular assist device. Although several BVAD-related       complications including haemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, heart failure and      pulmonary valve insufficiency developed at a very late stage, she was      successfully bridged to heart transplantation after 1245 days of biventricular      support, which is the longest in the literature. Despite advances in      continuous-flow ventricular assist devices, their long-term use for biventricular      support remains limited. We report a successful case of 1245 days of      biventricular support with dual Jarvik 2000 axial flow pumps in a patient with a       small body surface area.CI  - (c) The Author 2014.
