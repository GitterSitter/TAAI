Since that time, its use has become much more frequent.       With increasing utilization, additional questions have arisen including patient      selection, timing of VAD implantation and device selection. These challenges are       amplified by the uniqueness of each patient, the recent abundance of literature      surrounding VAD use as well as the technological advancements in the devices      themselves. Ideal strategies for device placement must be sought, for not only      improved patient care, but also for optimal resource utilization. Here, we review      the most relevant literature to highlight some of the challenges facing the heart      failure specialist, and any physician, who will care for a child with a VAD.FAU - Miller, Jacob RAU  - Miller JRAD  - Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St.      Louis Children\s Hospital, One Children\s Place, Suite 5 South St. Louis, MO      63110, USA.FAU - Lancaster, Timothy SAU  - Lancaster TSFAU - Eghtesady, PiroozAU  - Eghtesady PLA  - engGR  - T32 HL007776/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralDEP - 20150303PL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Cardiovasc TherJT  - Expert review of cardiovascular therapyJID - 101182328SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Berlin heartOT  - HeartMateOT  - HeartWareOT  - dilated cardiomyopathyOT  - heart failureOT  - mechanical circulatory supportOT  - myocarditisOT  - pediatricOT  - ventricular assist deviceEDAT- 2015/03/04 06:00MHDA- 2015/03/04 06:00CRDT- 2015/03/04 06:00PHST- 2015/03/03 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1586/14779072.2015.1021786 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther. 2015 Apr;13(4):417-27. doi:      10.1586/14779072.2015.1021786.
