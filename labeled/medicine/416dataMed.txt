METHODS AND      RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, we used implantable (n=12) and paracorporeal      (n=91) LVADs in 103 consecutive cardiomyopathy patients as a bridge to      transplantation. Prior to LVAD implantation, all patients received inotropes, and      25 patients (24\%) received PCPS because of cardiogenic shock. Postoperatively,      there were no early mortalities within 30 days after surgery, and patients      survived on LVAD for 560+/-391 days, of whom 9 patients recovered and 32      underwent heart transplantation after 711+/-360 days of LVAD support. More      patients with preoperative PCPS required nitric oxide inhalation and prolonged      inotropic support to maintain adequate LVAD flow. In addition, bilirubin level at      1 month after LVAD implantation was significantly higher in patients with      preoperative PCPS. Cox regression analysis identified preoperative PCPS support      as the only significant predictor for death after LVAD implantation and overall      survival was significantly better in patients without preoperative PCPS.      CONCLUSIONS: Despite adequate hemodynamic support after LVAD implantation,      patients with preoperative PCPS had significantly worse survival. LVAD should be       used for patients with end-stage heart failure, before PCPS is required for      hemodynamic support.FAU - Toda, KoichiAU  - Toda KAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular      Center, Suita, Japan. ktoda2002@yahoo.co.jpFAU - Fujita, TomoyukiAU  - Fujita TFAU - Kobayashi, JunjiroAU  - Kobayashi JFAU - Shimahara, YusukeAU  - Shimahara YFAU - Kitamura, SoichiroAU  - Kitamura SFAU - Seguchi, OsamuAU  - Seguchi OFAU - Murata, YoshihiroAU  - Murata YFAU - Yanase, MasanobuAU  - Yanase MFAU - Nakatani, TakeshiAU  - Nakatani TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20111203PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)RN  - RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)SB  - IMMH  - Bilirubin/bloodMH  - Cardiomyopathies/mortality/*surgeryMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/*therapeutic useMH  - FemaleMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HemodynamicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Oxygenators, Membrane/adverse effectsMH  - *Preoperative PeriodMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Shock, Cardiogenic/*prevention & controlMH  - Survival RateMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2011/12/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/07/04 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/06 06:00PHST- 2011/12/03 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-11-0339 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2012;76(1):88-95.
