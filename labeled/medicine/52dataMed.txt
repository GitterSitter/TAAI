Between January 2006 and December 2012, 228 consecutive adult patients were      supported on RotaFlow (n=213) or CentriMag (n=15) ECMO, at our institutions (155       men; age 58.3+/-10.5 years, range: 19-84 years). Indications for support were:      failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy      (n=118) and primary donor graft failure (n=37); postacute myocardial infarction      CS (n=27); acute myocarditis (n=6); and CS on chronic heart failure (n=40). A      peripheral ECMO setting was established in 126 (55.2\%) patients while it was      established centrally in 102 (44.7\%). Overall mean support time was 10.9+/-9.7      days (range: 1-43 days). Eighty-four (36.8\%) patients died on ECMO. Overall      success rate, in terms of survival on ECMO (n=144), weaning from mechanical      support (n=107; 46.9\%), bridge to mid-long-term ventricular assist device (n=6;      2.6\%), and bridge to heart transplantation (n=31; 13.5\%), was 63.1\%. One hundred       twenty-two (53.5\%) patients were successfully discharged. Stepwise logistic      regression identified blood lactate level and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase      (CK-MB) relative index at 72 h after ECMO initiation, and number of packed red      blood cells (PRBCs) transfused on ECMO as significant predictors of mortality on       ECMO (P=0.010, odds ratio [OR]=2.94; 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-3.14;      P=0.010, OR=2.82, 95\% CI=1.014-3.721; and P=0.011, OR=2.69; 95\% CI=1.06-4.16,      respectively). Central ECMO population had significantly higher rate of      continuous veno-venous hemofiltration need and bleeding requiring surgery events       compared with the peripheral ECMO setting population. No significant differences       were seen by comparing the RotaFlow and CentriMag populations in terms of device       performance. At follow-up, persistent heart failure with left ventricle ejection       fraction (LVEF)</=40\% was a risk factor after hospital discharge. Patients with a      poor hemodynamic status may benefit from rapid central or peripheral insertion of      ECMO. The blood lactate level, CK-MB relative index, and PRBCs transfused should       be strictly monitored during ECMO support. In addition, early ventricular assist       device placement or urgent listing for heart transplant should be considered in      patients with persistent impaired LVEF after ECMO.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Loforte, AntonioAU  - Loforte AAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation, S.
