AIMS: To explore the experiences      and coping strategies of LVAD patients\ close relatives during bridge to      transplantation and to generate theory. METHODS: The study had a qualitative      design using grounded theory and NVivo version 9 to analyse one paired interview       (n=2) and one group interview (n=5) with LVAD patients\ close relatives. RESULTS:      The main finding was the importance of supporting the close relatives who support      the LVAD patient. The core category was support and self-preservation in close      relatives. We constructed the support cascade model illustrating support from      close relatives to the patient (main obligation) and to other family members      (other obligations), and support from personal and professional relations to the       close relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Support from close relatives potentially benefits      patients, family, healthcare providers, and society in general. Our study      highlighted the importance of supporting the close relatives supporting the      patient and we have suggested some modifiable factors to enable social support      and ease transitions in the illness trajectory. We suggest that awareness of      social support systems might be beneficial in comprehensive care planning for      LVAD patients and their close relatives.FAU - Egerod, IngridAU  - Egerod IAD  - University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. ie@ucsf.dkFAU - Overgaard, DortheAU  - Overgaard DLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120418PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Cardiovasc NursJT  - European journal of cardiovascular nursing : journal of the Working Group on      Cardiovascular Nursing of the European Society of CardiologyJID - 101128793SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - Caregivers/*psychologyMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - DenmarkMH  - Family/*psychologyMH  - Family RelationsMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/*surgeryMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Self EfficacyMH  - Self PsychologyMH  - Self-Help GroupsMH  - Waiting ListsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/04/20 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/20 06:00PHST- 2012/04/18 [aheadofprint]AID - 1474515111435609 [pii]AID - 10.1177/1474515111435609 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2012 Dec;11(4):380-7. doi: 10.1177/1474515111435609.
