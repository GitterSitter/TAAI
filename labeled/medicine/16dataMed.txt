The surgical      technique of heart transplantation, popularized by Dr. Norman Shumway, has led to      its success and currently remains the best treatment options for patients with      end-stage. However, with the continued limitation of donor organs and the rapid      development of ventricular assist device technology, the number of patients      bridged to transplant with mechanical circulatory support has increased      significantly. This has created some new technical challenges for heart      transplantation. Therefore, it is now important to be familiar with multiple new       technical challenges associated with the surgical techniques of heart      transplantation with an ultimate goal in reducing donor heart ischemic time,      recipient cardiopulmonary bypass time and post-operative complications. In this      review, we described our technique of heart transplantation including the timing       of the operation, recipient cardiectomy and donor heart implantation.FAU - Cheng, AllenAU  - Cheng AAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.FAU - Slaughter, Mark SAU  - Slaughter MSAD  - Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Louisville,      Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ChinaTA  - J Thorac DisJT  - Journal of thoracic diseaseJID - 101533916PMC - PMC4133541OID - NLM: PMC4133541OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Heart transplantationEDAT- 2014/08/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/19 06:01CRDT- 2014/08/19 06:00PHST- 2014/07/12 [received]PHST- 2014/07/26 [accepted]AID - 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.07.37 [doi]AID - jtd-06-08-1105 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Thorac Dis. 2014 Aug;6(8):1105-9. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.07.37.- 25132977own - nlmstat- pubmed-not-medlineda  - 20140818dcom- 20140818lr  - 20140820is  - 2072-1439 (print)is  - 2072-1439 (linking)vi  - 6ip  - 8dp  - 2014 augti  - heart transplantation.pg  - 1105-9lid - 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.07.37 [doi]ab  - heart failure remains a major global problem with approximately 6 million      individuals suffering from heart failure in the united states alone. the surgical      technique of heart transplantation, popularized by dr. norman shumway, has led to      its success and currently remains the best treatment options for patients with      end-stage. however, with the continued limitation of donor organs and the rapid      development of ventricular assist device technology, the number of patients      bridged to transplant with mechanical circulatory support has increased      significantly. this has created some new technical challenges for heart      transplantation. therefore, it is now important to be familiar with multiple new       technical challenges associated with the surgical techniques of heart      transplantation with an ultimate goal in reducing donor heart ischemic time,      recipient cardiopulmonary bypass time and post-operative complications. in this      review, we described our technique of heart transplantation including the timing       of the operation, recipient cardiectomy and donor heart implantation.fau - cheng, allenau  - cheng aad  - department of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery, university of louisville,      louisville, kentucky 40202, usa.fau - slaughter, mark sau  - slaughter msad  - department of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery, university of louisville,      louisville, kentucky 40202, usa.la  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - chinata  - j thorac disjt  - journal of thoracic diseasejid - 101533916pmc - pmc4133541oid - nlm: pmc4133541oto - notnlmot  - heart transplantationedat- 2014/08/19 06:00mhda- 2014/08/19 06:01crdt- 2014/08/19 06:00phst- 2014/07/12 [received]phst- 2014/07/26 [accepted]aid - 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.07.37 [doi]aid - jtd-06-08-1105 [pii]pst - ppublishso  - j thorac dis. 2014 aug;6(8):1105-9. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.07.37.
