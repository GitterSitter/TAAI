METHODS: We describe three patients who had infections related to a fistula      between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the LVAD pocket and who subsequently       underwent successful heart transplantation without developing sepsis. In no case       did the LVAD-related infection adversely affect the outcome of transplantation.      CONCLUSIONS: For detecting the fistulas, full upper-GI endoscopy and colonoscopy       were superior to other types of diagnostic imaging studies.CI  - (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.FAU - Akay, Mehmet HAU  - Akay MHAD  - Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke\s Episcopal      Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA.FAU - Gregoric, IgorAU  - Gregoric IFAU - Cohn, William EAU  - Cohn WEFAU - Frazier, O HAU  - Frazier OHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Card SurgJT  - Journal of cardiac surgeryJID - 8908809SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Gastric Fistula/*complications/physiopathologyMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/surgeryMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Intestinal Fistula/*complications/physiopathologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/*etiology/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Sampling StudiesMH  - Severity of Illness IndexMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/09/18 06:00MHDA- 2013/03/08 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/18 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01517.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Card Surg. 2012 Sep;27(5):643-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01517.x.- 22978845own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120917dcom- 20130307is  - 1540-8191 (electronic)is  - 0886-0440 (linking)vi  - 27ip  - 5dp  - 2012 septi  - heartmate-ii left ventricular assist device infections resulting from      gastrointestinal-tract fistulas.pg  - 643-5lid - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01517.x [doi]ab  - background: in patients with a left ventricular assist device (lvad),      pump-related infection can cause adverse effects that may result in death.      methods: we describe three patients who had infections related to a fistula      between the gastrointestinal (gi) tract and the lvad pocket and who subsequently       underwent successful heart transplantation without developing sepsis. in no case       did the lvad-related infection adversely affect the outcome of transplantation.      conclusions: for detecting the fistulas, full upper-gi endoscopy and colonoscopy       were superior to other types of diagnostic imaging studies.ci  - (c) 2012 wiley periodicals, inc.fau - akay, mehmet hau  - akay mhad  - center for cardiac support, texas heart institute at st. luke\s episcopal      hospital, houston, texas, usa.fau - gregoric, igorau  - gregoric ifau - cohn, william eau  - cohn wefau - frazier, o hau  - frazier ohla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - j card surgjt  - journal of cardiac surgeryjid - 8908809sb  - immh  - adultmh  - combined modality therapymh  - follow-up studiesmh  - gastric fistula/*complications/physiopathologymh  - heart failure/diagnosis/surgerymh  - *heart transplantationmh  - heart-assist devices/*adverse effectsmh  - humansmh  - intestinal fistula/*complications/physiopathologymh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - prosthesis designmh  - prosthesis-related infections/*etiology/physiopathology/therapymh  - risk assessmentmh  - sampling studiesmh  - severity of illness indexmh  - time factorsmh  - treatment outcomeedat- 2012/09/18 06:00mhda- 2013/03/08 06:00crdt- 2012/09/18 06:00aid - 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01517.x [doi]pst - ppublishso  - j card surg. 2012 sep;27(5):643-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2012.01517.x.
