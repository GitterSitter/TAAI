Assessment of a stable and unchangeable      arrhythmogenic substrate is often difficult. Structural abnormality and      ventricular dysfunction, the two major risk parameters, may recover, and heart      failure symptoms can improve so that ICD therapy may not be indicated. Risk      stratification can take time while the patient continues to be at high risk of      arrhythmic death, and patients may need temporary bridging by a defibrillator in       cases of interrupted ICD therapy. The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD)      combines a long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring system with an external      automatic defibrillator. The LIfeVest(R) (ZOLL, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) is composed       of a garment, containing two defibrillation patch electrodes on the back, and an       elastic belt with a front-defibrillation patch electrode and four non-adhesive      ECG electrodes, connected to a monitoring and defibrillation unit. The WCD is a      safe and effective tool to terminate ventricular tachycardia/ventricular      fibrillation events, unless a conscious patient withholds shock delivery. It may       be used in patients in the early phase after acute myocardial infarction with      poor left ventricular function, after acute coronary revascularization procedures      (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) and      reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (</=35\%), in patients with acute heart      failure in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy of uncertain aetiology and prognosis. The      WCD may be helpful in subjects with syncope of assumed tachyarrhythmia origin or       in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The WCD may replace ICD      implantation in patients waiting for heart transplantation or who need a      ventricular-assist device. This review describes the technical details and      characteristics of the WCD, discusses its various potential applications, and      reports the currently available experience with the wearable defibrillator.FAU - Klein, Helmut UAU  - Klein HUAD  - University of Rochester Medical Center, Heart Research Follow-up Program, Box      653, 265 Crittenden Blvd. Rochester, NY 14620, USA.      helmut.klein@heart.rochester.eduFAU - Goldenberg, IlanAU  - Goldenberg IFAU - Moss, Arthur JAU  - Moss AJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20130531PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263SB  - IMMH  - Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*therapyMH  - Death, Sudden, Cardiac/*prevention & controlMH  - *DefibrillatorsMH  - Defibrillators, ImplantableMH  - *Electric CountershockMH  - ElectrocardiographyMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Preoperative CareMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk ManagementMH  - Syncope/prevention & controlOTO - NOTNLMOT  - ICD therapyOT  - Risk stratificationOT  - Sudden cardiac deathOT  - Wearable cardioverter-defibrillatorEDAT- 2013/06/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/13 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/05 06:00PHST- 2013/05/31 [aheadofprint]AID - eht167 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht167 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Heart J. 2013 Aug;34(29):2230-42. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/eht167.
