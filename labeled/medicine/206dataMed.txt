METHODS: In 535 consecutive individuals with CHF      scheduled for implantation of a CRT device, LVD was assessed by tissue Doppler      imaging (TDI), defined as an electromechanical delay (EMD) difference of >/=40 ms      in 2 opposed left ventricular wall regions (septal vs. lateral, anterior vs.      inferior). All-cause mortality, heart transplantation, or assist device      implantation was defined as combined primary end point. Secondary end points were      measures of reverse LV remodeling and of symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Mean      follow-up was 68 +/- 36 [range: 4-150] months. LVD at baseline was present in 308      patients (61\%). Of these, 24\% reached the combined primary endpoint in contrast      to 58\% of patients without LVD (p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with LVD showed      pronounced improvement of all secondary end point parameters. In our cohort LVD      was an independent predictor for outcome (hazard ratio [95\% CI]: 0.30      [0.21-0.42], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LVD at baseline as assessed by TDI is      associated with a more pronounced clinical improvement and is a predictor for      transplant-free long-term survival in CRT recipients.CI  - (c) 2013.FAU - Prinz, ChristianAU  - Prinz CAD  - Department of Cardiology, Heart and Diabetes Centre of North-Rhine Westphalia,      Ruhr University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany.
