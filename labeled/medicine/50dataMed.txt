The apoptotic cell is not inevitably committed      to death, and appropriate therapy like left ventricular assist device (LVAD)      support could offer a rescue of cellular functions. Literature data regarding the      modulation of the apoptotic process during LVAD support are still controversial.       METHODS: To assess whether LVAD implantation modifies the apoptotic profile in      the heart, cardiac tissue was collected from end-stage HF patients before LVAD      implant (pre-LVAD, n=22) and at LVAD removal (post-LVAD, n=6) and from stable HF       patients on medical therapy without prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at heart      transplantation as control. Caspase (Casp)-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and Hsp72 cardiac mRNA       and protein expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and       Western blotting (WB) in the three groups of patients. Immunohistochemical      analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling      assay, and DNA laddering analysis were performed; cellular size and interstitial       fibrosis content were also determined. RESULTS: All the apoptotic indices were      increased in the post-LVAD group compared to pre-LVAD, specially antiapoptotic      Hsp72 and proapoptotic Bax (Hsp72: 3.27+/-0.41 vs. 0.76+/-0.14, P<.001; Bax:      2.15+/-0.38 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.29, P=.035; post-LVAD vs. pre-LVAD, respectively). The      significant increase in Hsp72 was confirmed by WB and immunohistochemical      analysis. CONCLUSION: LVAD appears to induce an activation of apoptotic      mediators, mainly at the mitochondrial level, while the following activation of      Casp-3 is reduced by the significant increase of Hsp72, whose enhancement could      be an important factor in cardiac remodeling associated with LVAD support.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
