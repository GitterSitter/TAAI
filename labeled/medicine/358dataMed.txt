The median      survival for patients with heart failure on ionotropic support alone is a meager       6 months. Historically, the only option for these patients was to be listed for      heart transplantation. Out of medical necessity, the idea of left ventricular      assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation was born. Since their      approval by the US FDA, LVADs have quadrupled the survival in patients with heart      failure. The increase in survival has also been accompanied by decreased      perioperative morbidity, better biocompatibility and longer device life over      first-generation LVADs. Undoubtedly, LVADs have changed the landscape of heart      failure treatment and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. In this      review, we will highlight the landmark studies that have established LVADs as a      therapeutic option for heart failure, as well as reviewing the current LVADs      available and speculating on the advancements that will be made in the upcoming      years.FAU - Kilic, AhmetAU  - Kilic AAD  - Division of Cardiac Surgery, The Ohio State University, N-831 Doan Hall, 410 W.      10th Avenue, Columbus, OH, USA.FAU - Ailawadi, GoravAU  - Ailawadi GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Expert Rev Cardiovasc TherJT  - Expert review of cardiovascular therapyJID - 101182328RN  - 0 (Biocompatible Materials)SB  - IMMH  - *Biocompatible MaterialsMH  - Device ApprovalMH  - Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Survival RateMH  - Time FactorsMH  - United StatesMH  - United States Food and Drug AdministrationEDAT- 2012/06/02 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/23 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/02 06:00AID - 10.1586/erc.12.17 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther. 2012 May;10(5):649-56. doi: 10.1586/erc.12.17.- 22651840own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120601dcom- 20121022is  - 1744-8344 (electronic)is  - 1477-9072 (linking)vi  - 10ip  - 5dp  - 2012 mayti  - left ventricular assist devices in heart failure.pg  - 649-56lid - 10.1586/erc.12.17 [doi]ab  - end-stage heart failure is an ever-growing and devastating disease. the median      survival for patients with heart failure on ionotropic support alone is a meager       6 months. historically, the only option for these patients was to be listed for      heart transplantation. out of medical necessity, the idea of left ventricular      assist device (lvad) as a bridge to transplantation was born. since their      approval by the us fda, lvads have quadrupled the survival in patients with heart      failure. the increase in survival has also been accompanied by decreased      perioperative morbidity, better biocompatibility and longer device life over      first-generation lvads. undoubtedly, lvads have changed the landscape of heart      failure treatment and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. in this      review, we will highlight the landmark studies that have established lvads as a      therapeutic option for heart failure, as well as reviewing the current lvads      available and speculating on the advancements that will be made in the upcoming      years.fau - kilic, ahmetau  - kilic aad  - division of cardiac surgery, the ohio state university, n-831 doan hall, 410 w.      10th avenue, columbus, oh, usa.fau - ailawadi, goravau  - ailawadi gla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - englandta  - expert rev cardiovasc therjt  - expert review of cardiovascular therapyjid - 101182328rn  - 0 (biocompatible materials)sb  - immh  - *biocompatible materialsmh  - device approvalmh  - heart failure/mortality/physiopathology/*surgerymh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - survival ratemh  - time factorsmh  - united statesmh  - united states food and drug administrationedat- 2012/06/02 06:00mhda- 2012/10/23 06:00crdt- 2012/06/02 06:00aid - 10.1586/erc.12.17 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - expert rev cardiovasc ther. 2012 may;10(5):649-56. doi: 10.1586/erc.12.17.
