However, the specific effects of combined Cl+beta1 blockade      during MU are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the chronic effects (4      weeks) of beta2-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation via Cl (2 mg/kg/day) alone, and in       combination with beta1-AR blockade using metoprolol ((Met), 250 mg/kg/day), on      whole heart/cell structure, function and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in       failing (induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation), and unloaded (induced      by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)) failing rat hearts.      Combined Cl+Met therapy displayed favourable effects in HF: Met enhanced Cl\s      improvement in ejection fraction (EF) whilst preventing Cl-induced hypertrophy      and tachycardia. During MU combined therapy was less beneficial than either      mono-therapy. Met, not Cl, prevented MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with      increased atrophy occurring during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+       transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+      content was enhanced equally by Cl or Met mono-therapy, but these benefits,      together with Cl\s enhancement of sarcomeric contraction speed, and MU-induced      recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency, disappeared during combined therapy.      CONCLUSIONS: Combined Cl+Met therapy shows superior functional effects to      mono-therapy in rodent HF, but appears inferior to either mono-therapy in      enhancing MU-induced recovery of EC coupling. These results suggest that combined      beta2-AR simulation +beta1-AR blockade therapy is likely to be a safe and      beneficial therapeutic HF strategy, but is not as effective as mono-therapy in      enhancing myocardial recovery during LVAD support.FAU -
