METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-eight consecutive New      York Heart Association class III and IV CRT patients with QRS >/=120 ms and      ejection fraction </=35\% were studied. The pre-specified primary endpoint was      death, heart transplant, or left ventricular assist device over 4 years.      Dyssynchrony assessed before CRT included interventricular mechanical delay      (IVMD) and speckle-tracking radial strain using pre-specified cut-offs for each.       Of 254 with baseline quantitative echocardiographic data available, 128 had LBBB,      81 had intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), and 45 had right bundle branch      block (RBBB). Radial dyssynchrony was observed in 85\% of the patients with LBBB,       59\% with IVCD*, and 40\% with RBBB* (*P < 0.01 vs. LBBB). Of 248 (98\%) with      follow-up, LBBB patients had a significantly more favourable long-term survival      than non-LBBB patients. However, non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a more      favourable event-free survival than those without dyssynchrony: radial      dyssynchrony hazard ratio 2.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-4.53 (P =      0.0008) and IVMD hazard ratio 4.9, 95\% CI 2.60-9.16 (P = 0.0007). Right bundle      branch block patients who lacked dyssynchrony had the least favourable outcome.      CONCLUSION: Non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a more favourable long-term      survival than non-LBBB patients who lacked dyssynchrony. Mechanical dyssynchrony       and QRS morphology are associated with outcome following CRT.FAU - Hara, HideyukiAU  - Hara HAD  - The Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Scaife 564, 200 Lothrop      Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2582, USA.FAU - Oyenuga, Olusegun AAU  - Oyenuga OAFAU - Tanaka, HidekazuAU  - Tanaka HFAU - Adelstein, Evan CAU  - Adelstein ECFAU - Onishi, ToshinariAU  - Onishi TFAU - McNamara, Dennis MAU  - McNamara DMFAU - Schwartzman, DavidAU  - Schwartzman DFAU - Saba, SamirAU  - Saba SFAU - Gorcsan, John 3rdAU  - Gorcsan J 3rdLA  - engGR  - K24 HL04503-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20120219PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Heart JJT  - European heart journalJID - 8006263SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Bundle-Branch Block/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - *Cardiac Resynchronization TherapyMH  - Echocardiography, Doppler/methodsMH  - ElectrocardiographyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Stroke Volume/physiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/physiopathology/*therapyPMC - PMC3485574OID - NLM: PMC3485574EDAT- 2012/02/22 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/20 06:00CRDT- 2012/02/22 06:00PHST- 2012/02/19 [aheadofprint]AID - ehs013 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehs013 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Heart J. 2012 Nov;33(21):2680-91. doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehs013.
