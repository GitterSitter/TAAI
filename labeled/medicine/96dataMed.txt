Despite significant advancements in drug therapy,      mortality of the disease remains excessively high, as heart transplant remains      the gold standard treatment for end-stage HF when no contraindications subsist.      Traditionally, implanted Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) have been employed in       order to provide circulatory support to patients who cannot survive the waiting      time to transplantation, reducing the workload imposed on the heart. In many      cases that process could recover its contractility performance. OBJECTIVES: The      SensorART platform focuses on the management and remote treatment of patients      suffering from HF. It provides an interoperable, extendable and VAD-independent      solution, which incorporates various hardware and software components in a      holistic approach, in order to improve the quality of the patients\ treatment and      the workflow of the specialists. This paper focuses on the description and      analysis of Specialist\s Decision Support System (SDSS), an innovative component       of the SensorART platform. METHODS: The SDSS is a Web-based tool that assists      specialists on designing the therapy plan for their patients before and after VAD      implantation, analyzing patients\ data, extracting new knowledge, and making      informative decisions. RESULTS: SDSS offers support to medical and VAD experts      through the different phases of VAD therapy, incorporating several tools covering      all related fields; Statistics, Association Rules, Monitoring, Treatment,      Weaning, Speed and Suction Detection. CONCLUSIONS: SDSS and its modules have been      tested in a number of patients and the results are encouraging.FAU - Karvounis, E CAU  - Karvounis ECFAU - Tsipouras, M GAU  - Tsipouras MGFAU - Tzallas, A TAU  - Tzallas ATFAU - Katertsidis, N SAU  - Katertsidis NSFAU - Stefanou, KAU  - Stefanou KFAU - Goletsis, YAU  - Goletsis YFAU - Frigerio, MAU  - Frigerio MFAU - Verde, AAU  - Verde AFAU - Caruso, RAU  - Caruso RFAU - Meyns, BAU  - Meyns BFAU - Terrovitis, JAU  - Terrovitis JFAU - Trivella, M GAU  - Trivella MGFAU - Fotiadis, D IAU  - Fotiadis DIAD  - Dimitrios I.
