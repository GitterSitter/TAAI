However, the breakthroughs in long-term outcome have seen stagnation in      the past decade. Through advances in genomics and transcriptomics, there is hope       that an era of personalized transplant therapy lies in the future. To see where      heart transplantation truly fits into the long term, searching for and      understanding the alternative approaches for heart failure therapy is both      important and inevitable. The application of mechanical circulatory support has      contributed to the largest advancement in treatment of end stage heart failure.      It has already been approved for destination therapy of heart failure, and      greater portability and ease of use of the device will be the future trend.      Although it is still not prime time for stem cell therapy, clinical experiences      have already suggested its potential therapeutic effects. And finally, whole      organ engineering is on the horizon as new techniques have opened the way for      this to proceed. In the end, progress on alternative therapies largely depends on      our deeper understanding of the mechanisms of heart failure and how to prevent      it.CI  - (c) Copyright 2012 The American Society of Transplantation and the American      Society of Transplant Surgeons.FAU - Kobashigawa, J AAU  - Kobashigawa JAAD  - Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA.
