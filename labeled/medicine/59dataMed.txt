Long-term reliability of VADs will become increasingly vital as      the population of destination therapy patients expands. In this study, eight HVAD      pumps (n = 8) completed a 6-year reliability test in the HeartWare Life Cycle      Testing System, an in-vitro mock circulatory loop that simulated physiologic      pressures and flows. Cumulative runtime for the pumps was 2,408 +/- 60 days.      During this time, no device failures of any type occurred. These results strongly      support the durability of the pump design.FAU - Reyes, CarlosAU  - Reyes CAD  - From the HeartWare, Inc., Pearland, Texas.FAU - Chorpenning, KatherineAU  - Chorpenning KFAU - LaRose, Jeffrey AAU  - LaRose JAFAU - Gomez, RamiroAU  - Gomez RFAU - Tamez, DanielAU  - Tamez DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/05/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/13 06:00CRDT- 2014/05/13 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000100 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 Sep-Oct;60(5):541-4. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000100.- 24814839own - nlmstat- in-processda  - 20140829is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 60ip  - 5dp  - 2014 sep-octti  - six-year in-vitro reliability results of the heartware hvad pump.pg  - 541-4lid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000100 [doi]ab  - as a result of stagnant heart transplantation rates, ventricular assist devices      (vads) have become a widely accepted therapy for the treatment of advanced-stage       heart failure. long-term reliability of vads will become increasingly vital as      the population of destination therapy patients expands. in this study, eight hvad      pumps (n = 8) completed a 6-year reliability test in the heartware life cycle      testing system, an in-vitro mock circulatory loop that simulated physiologic      pressures and flows. cumulative runtime for the pumps was 2,408 +/- 60 days.      during this time, no device failures of any type occurred. these results strongly      support the durability of the pump design.fau - reyes, carlosau  - reyes cad  - from the heartware, inc., pearland, texas.fau - chorpenning, katherineau  - chorpenning kfau - larose, jeffrey aau  - larose jafau - gomez, ramiroau  - gomez rfau - tamez, danielau  - tamez dla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109sb  - imedat- 2014/05/13 06:00mhda- 2014/05/13 06:00crdt- 2014/05/13 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000100 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2014 sep-oct;60(5):541-4. doi: 10.1097/mat.0000000000000100.
