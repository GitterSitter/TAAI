The waiting time for heart transplantation is increasing, and more and      more patients receive the pump for permanent support. We retrospectively analyzed      our database of patients supported with the HeartMate II left ventricular assist       device to identify instances of cable damage. Between May 9, 2006 and May 9,      2012, 161 patients were supported with the HeartMate II. There were 187      cumulative years of HeartMate II support. The documented cable damage occurred in      12 patients (7.5\%), requiring pump exchange in five patients after a mean time of      706 days on support. There was no perioperative mortality. The damage occurred      typically at the \"weak\" place-the feedthrough of the driveline to the pump body.       In some cases, the device alarm history and x-ray may allow diagnosis before pump      stop occurs. However, since the most recent changes in the design of the      connection and modifications made in the implantation technique, no instance of      cable damage has been registered.FAU - Potapov, Evgenij VAU  - Potapov EVAD  - Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Germany. potapov@dhzb.deFAU - Kaufmann, FriedrichAU  - Kaufmann FFAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Hening, EwaldAU  - Hening EFAU - Vierecke, JulianeAU  - Vierecke JFAU - Low, AlexandraAU  - Low AFAU - Lehmkuhl, ElkeAU  - Lehmkuhl EFAU - Dranishnikov, NikolayAU  - Dranishnikov NFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RFAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesEDAT- 2012/10/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/25 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/30 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3182703718 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2012 Nov-Dec;58(6):578-82. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e3182703718.- 23103699own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130107dcom- 20130621is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 58ip  - 6dp  - 2012 nov-decti  - pump exchange for cable damage in patients supported with heartmate ii left      ventricular assist device.pg  - 578-82lid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e3182703718 [doi]ab  - implantable continuous flow pumps are a routine treatment for end-stage heart      failure. the waiting time for heart transplantation is increasing, and more and      more patients receive the pump for permanent support. we retrospectively analyzed      our database of patients supported with the heartmate ii left ventricular assist       device to identify instances of cable damage. between may 9, 2006 and may 9,      2012, 161 patients were supported with the heartmate ii. there were 187      cumulative years of heartmate ii support. the documented cable damage occurred in      12 patients (7.5\%), requiring pump exchange in five patients after a mean time of      706 days on support. there was no perioperative mortality. the damage occurred      typically at the \"weak\" place-the feedthrough of the driveline to the pump body.       in some cases, the device alarm history and x-ray may allow diagnosis before pump      stop occurs. however, since the most recent changes in the design of the      connection and modifications made in the implantation technique, no instance of      cable damage has been registered.fau - potapov, evgenij vau  - potapov evad  - deutsches herzzentrum berlin, germany. potapov@dhzb.defau - kaufmann, friedrichau  - kaufmann ffau - stepanenko, alexanderau  - stepanenko afau - hening, ewaldau  - hening efau - vierecke, julianeau  - vierecke jfau - low, alexandraau  - low afau - lehmkuhl, elkeau  - lehmkuhl efau - dranishnikov, nikolayau  - dranishnikov nfau - hetzer, rolandau  - hetzer rfau - krabatsch, thomasau  - krabatsch tla  - engpt  - journal articlepl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109sb  - immh  - adultmh  - agedmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - heart-assist devices/*adverse effectsmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - middle agedmh  - retrospective studiesedat- 2012/10/30 06:00mhda- 2013/06/25 06:00crdt- 2012/10/30 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e3182703718 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2012 nov-dec;58(6):578-82. doi: 10.1097/mat.0b013e3182703718.
