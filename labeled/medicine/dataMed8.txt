When the\r\nbody is at rest, it needs a certain amount of blood to\r\nachieve this function. During exercise or times when\r\ngreater demands are placed on the body, more blood\r\nis required. To meet these variable demands, the\r\nheartbeat increases or decreases, and blood vessels\r\ndilate to deliver more blood or constrict during times\r\nwhen less blood is required.\r\nWhen a person is diagnosed with heart failure, it\r\nassist support devices \r\ndoes not mean the heart has stopped working, but\r\nassist support devices \r\nrather that it is not working as efficiently as it should.\r\nIn other words, the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“failureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ indicates the heart\r\nis not pumping effectively enough to meet the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\nneeds for oxygen-rich blood, either during exercise\r\nor at rest. The term congestive heart failure (CHF) is\r\noften synonymous with heart failure but also refers\r\nto the state in which decreased heart function is accompanied\r\nby a buildup of body fluid in the lungs\r\nand elsewhere. Heart failure may be reversible, and\r\npeople may live for many years after the diagnosis is\r\nmade. (See box, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Classifications of Heart Failure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½)\r\nHeart failure may occur suddenly, or it may develop\r\ngradually. When heart function deteriorates\r\nover years, one or more conditions may exist, (See\r\nbox, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Effects of Heart Failure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) The strength of muscle\r\ncontractions may be reduced, and the ability of\r\nthe heart chambers to fill with blood may be limited\r\nby mechanical problems, resulting in less blood to\r\npump out to tissues in the body. Conversely, the\r\npumping chambers may enlarge and fill with too\r\nmuch blood when the heart muscle is not strong\r\nenough to pump out all the blood it receives. In addition,\r\nas the architecture of the heart changes as it\r\nenlarges, regurgitation of the mitral valve may develop,\r\nmaking the heart failure even worse.\r\nWHO DEVELOPS HEART FAILURE?\r\nThere are an estimated 2 million people in the United\r\nStates with heart failure. The incidence of chronic\r\ncongestive heart failureÃ¢â‚¬â€?the number of new cases\r\ndeveloping in the given population each yearÃ¢â‚¬â€?has\r\nincreased in recent years. This is possibly a result of\r\nthe overall decline in deaths from coronary (ischemic)\r\nheart disease, an improvement attributed to medical\r\nadvances and the fact that people are living longer.\r\nThe most common cause of congestive failure is\r\ncoronary artery diseaseÃ¢â‚¬â€?narrowing of the arteries\r\nsupplying blood to the heart muscle. Although coronary\r\ndisease often starts at an early age, congestive\r\nfailure occurs most often in the elderly. Among people\r\nmore than 70 years old, about 8 out of 1,000 are\r\ndiagnosed with congestive heart failure each year.\r\nThe majority of these patients are women, probably\r\nbecause men are more likely to die from coronary\r\nartery disease before it progresses to heart failure.\r\nHeart failure is also associated with untreated\r\nhypertension, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse (primarily\r\ncocaine and amphetamines) at any age. Hyperthyroidism\r\nand various abnormalities of the heart\r\nvalves (particularly aortic and mitral) are among the\r\n177\r\nMAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\r\nClassifications of Heart\r\nFailure\r\nThe New York Heart Association developed a\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nsystem that has been used for manyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ years to\r\nprovide a standardized set of criteria for the\r\nclassification of heart failure based on the\r\nseverity of the condition. This is evaluated by\r\nsymptoms and ability to function.\r\nClass I: no undue symptoms associated with\r\nordinary activity and no limitation of physical\r\nactivity\r\nClass II: slight limitation of physical activity;\r\npatient comfortable at rest\r\nClass III: marked limitation of physical activity;\r\npatient comfortable at rest\r\nClass IV: inability to carry on any physical\r\nactivity without discomfort; symptoms of\r\ncardiac insufficiency or chest pain possible\r\neven at rest\r\nEffects of Heart Failure\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Strength of muscle contractions is reduced.\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Ability of the heart chambers to fill with blood\r\nis limited, so there is less blood to pump out to\r\ntissues in the body.\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ The pumping heart chambers fill with too much\r\nblood; the heart muscle is not strong enough to\r\npump out all the blood it receives.\r\nother disorders that can cause heart failure. In addition,\r\nviral infection or inflammation of the heart\r\n(myocarditis) or primary heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy),\r\nand in rare instances, extreme vitamin\r\ndeficiencies, can result in heart failure. (See Chapters\r\n13 and 15.)\r\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\r\nDepending on the underlying causes, heart failure\r\ncan be either acute (intense but not long-lasting) or\r\nchronic (protracted over a long time), When heart\r\nfailure occurs, the forward flow of blood is slowed\r\ndown, the quantity of blood pumped is less than adequate,\r\nand the pressure rises in the chambers of the\r\nheart, causing blood that is returning to the heart to\r\nback up in the lungs or veins. Excessive fatigue may\r\nbean early symptom. (See box, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Symptoms of Heart\r\nFailure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) Some excess fluid may be forced out of the\r\nblood vessels into the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tissues. It then settles\r\nin the feet, ankles, and legs, and sometimes also in\r\nthe abdomen and liver.\r\nDyspnea, or shortness of breath, resulting from\r\nincreased pressure, fluid, or both in the lungs, is a\r\ncommon symptom of congestive heart failure. Although\r\nbreathlessness is most likely to be noticed\r\nduring exercise (known as dyspnea on exertion, or\r\nDOE), it can also be a problem at rest, particularly\r\nwhen the patient is lying down (when it is known as\r\northopnea). Individuals with orthopnea find that the\r\ncondition feels worse when they are in a reclining\r\nposition because the backflow of fluid and buildup in\r\npressure from the heart interferes directly with the\r\nfree flow of oxygen in the lungs.\r\nNormally, oxygen is easily exchanged through the\r\nthin spongy tissue of the lungs. (See Figure 14.1.) If\r\nthis tissue becomes waterlogged, as it does in heart\r\nfailure, less oxygen can be transferred to the blood.\r\nIf there is not enough oxygen, certain reflexes stimulate\r\nfaster breathing. People with lung congestion\r\nas a result of heart failure usually have to prop themselves\r\nup with extra pillows in order to sleep. The\r\nnumber of pillows used may indicate to a physician\r\nthe extent of the heart failure. When an individual\r\nwakes at night because of shortness of breath from\r\nSvmntoms of Heart Failure\r\nShortness of breath (dyspnea)\r\nShortness of breath when lying down\r\n(orthopnea)\r\nShortness of breath while sleeping (paroxysmal\r\nor intermittent nocturnal dyspnea)\r\nBuildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary\r\nedema), frequently causing a person to cough\r\nup blood-tinged sputum\r\nBuildup of excess fluid (edema) in other parts\r\nof the body, causing weight gain, swelling of\r\nthe ankles, legs, and back, and in extreme\r\ncases fluid accumulation in the abdomen\r\n(ascites)\r\nFatigue, weakness, and an inability to exert\r\noneself physically or mentally\r\nBlueness of the skin (cyanosis)\r\nHEART FAILURE\r\nFigure 14.1\r\nThis diagram of an alveolus (air sac) shows the exchange of carbon\r\ndioxide (CO2) and oxygen in the lung.\r\nfluid settling in the lungs, the condition is known as\r\nparoxysmal (intermittent) nocturnal dyspnea. A person\r\nsuffering from this typically will wake up short\r\nof breath about two to three hours after going to\r\nsleep, Standing or sitting often relieves symptoms.\r\nOne of recent history\'s most noted patients with\r\nheart failure was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\r\nHe had severe hypertension that led to an enlarged\r\nheart and eventually to heart failure. For\r\nmonths, he was unable to lie flat in bed, so he slept\r\nin a chair. He was told that he had bronchitis, allergies,\r\nand the flu. Finally, the right diagnosis was made\r\nand treatment started. However, this was before the\r\ndevelopment of effective drugs to lower blood pressure\r\nand to treat advanced heart failure. At the time\r\nof President RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death of a massive stroke on\r\nApril 12, 1945, his blood pressure ranged between\r\n180/110 and 230/130.\r\nThe infiltration of the body with fluid can cause\r\nmore than breathing problems and sleepless nights.\r\nPatients may weigh more, because of the excess\r\nwater retention, and they may have edema (swelling)\r\nof the skin and soft tissues, usually in the feet, ankles,\r\nor legs, and sometimes in the lower back. This swelling\r\nis characterized by a gradual filling out after the\r\narea is depressed with a finger. (See Figure 14.2.) In\r\nextreme cases, fluid will accumulate in the abdomen.\r\nThis is called ascites and is caused when swelling of\r\nthe gastrointestinal tract forces fluid through the capillaries\r\ninto the abdominal cavity. Ascites usually occurs\r\nonly in severe chronic heart failure.\r\nWhen a marked excess of fluid accumulates in the\r\nlungs, it is known as pulmonary (lung) edema. This\r\ncondition is often, but not always, acute and is frequently\r\nassociated with coughing up blood-tinged,\r\npinkish-colored sputum.\r\nInefficient circulation may also manifest itself as\r\nfatigue, weakness, and an inability to exert oneself\r\nphysically or mentally because less blood and oxygen\r\nreach the brain. Older people in particular may suffer\r\nfrom confusion and impaired thinking ability.\r\nLEFT SIDE OR RIGHT SIDE?\r\nThe particular symptoms that an individual experiences\r\nare determined by which side of the heart is\r\ninvolved in the heart failure. (See box, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Symptoms of\r\nLeft-Side and Right-Side Heart Failure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) For example,\r\nthe left atrium (upper chamber) receives oxygenFigure\r\n14.2\r\nEdema is swelling of the extremities caused by excess fluid buildup.\r\nA sign of edema in the ankles is an indentation that remains\r\nmomentarily when a finger is pressed into the skin and then\r\nremoved.\r\n179\r\nMAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\r\nSymptoms of left-side heart failure\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Fatigue\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shortness of breath when lying down (othopnea)\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Paroxysmal (intermittent) nocturnal dyspnea\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary\r\nedema), frequently causing a person to cough\r\nup blood-tinged sputum\r\nSymptoms of right-side heart failure\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Swelling (edema)\r\nDependent edema (edema that travels by\r\ngravity to the lowest portions of the body)\r\nEnlargement or swelling of the liver\r\n(hepatomegaly)\r\nBuildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity\r\n(ascites)\r\nEdema of the skin and soft tissues, causing\r\nswelling of the feet, ankles, and legs\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Excessive urination at night caused by fluid\r\nredistribution while a person is sleeping lying\r\ndown (nocturia)\r\nated blood from the lungs and passes it onto the left\r\nventricle (lower chamber), which pumps it to the rest\r\nof the body. When the left side isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pumping efficiently,\r\nblood backs up in the vessels of the lungs,\r\nand sometimes fluid is forced out of the lung vessels\r\nand into the breathing spaces themselves. This pulmonary\r\ncongestion causes shortness of breath. The\r\nother major symptoms of left-sided heart failure are\r\nfatigue, dyspnea (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal\r\ndyspnea), and the sputum production (sometimes\r\nbloody) that comes from pulmonary congestion.\r\nRight-sided failure occurs when there is resistance\r\nto the flow of blood from the right heart structures\r\n(right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary or lung artery)\r\ninto the lungs or when the tricuspid valve, which\r\nseparates the right atrium from the right ventricle,\r\nfails to work properly. This results in a backup of fluid\r\nand pressure in the veins that empty into the right\r\nside of the heart. Pressure then builds up in the liver\r\nand the veins in the legs. The liver enlarges and may\r\nbecome painful; swelling of the ankles or legs occurs.\r\nThe major symptoms of right-sided heart failure\r\nare edema and nocturia (excessive urination at night\r\ncaused by fluid redistribution while a person is lying\r\ndown). The different types of edema possible are dependent\r\n(edema that travels by gravity to the lowest\r\nportions of the body), edema that results in enlargement\r\nor swelling of the liver (called hepatomegaly),\r\nascites, and edema of the skin or soft tissues (only in\r\nsome cases).\r\nBecause congestive heart failure causes the body\r\nto fill with excess fluids, the kidneys may not be able\r\nto dispose of the extra sodium (a component of salt)\r\nand water, a condition known as kidney failure.\r\n(Again, the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“failureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ implies that the kidneys\r\nhave failed and will not recover. However, as in the\r\ncase of heart failure, the kidney changes maybe temporary,\r\nand proper treatment may correct much of\r\nthe problem.) Sodium that would normally be eliminated\r\nthrough the urine remains in the body, causing\r\nit to retain even more water, thereby aggravating the\r\nproblem of excess fluid associated with congestive\r\nheart failure.\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\nA stethoscope can be used to detect rales, crackling\r\nnoises that are caused by the movement of excess\r\nfluid in the lungs. This can help locate where fluid\r\nhas accumulated. By listening to breathing sounds or\r\nthumping the chest, a physician can usually tell when\r\nfluid from the lungs has leaked (pleural effusion) into\r\nthe chest cavity. The fluid will also appear as a cloudy\r\narea on X-rays. The stethoscope can also detect the\r\nsounds of the heart chambers filling and emptying\r\nand the heart valves opening and closing throughout\r\nthe cardiac cycle. Abnormal variations in these\r\nsounds can aid the physician in diagnosing and monitoring\r\nheart failure, because the condition is associated\r\nwith one or two abnormal sounds in addition\r\nto the two sounds usually heard with the healthy\r\nheart. Another symptom, blueness of the skin (called\r\ncyanosis) accompanied by coolness and moisture,\r\nmost often in the fingers and toes, indicates low levels\r\nof oxygen in the blood (called hypoxia). Edema is\r\ndetected by pressing the finger against the ankle or\r\nskin and noting how long it takes the depression to\r\nrefill. Liver enlargement is felt by examining the abdomen.\r\nThe neck vein may also be distended. (See\r\nbox, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Signs of Heart Failure During an Examination.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½)\r\nA number of sophisticated diagnostic techniques\r\nmay also be employed to diagnose and monitor heart\r\nfailure and heart function. The two main noninvasive\r\nSigns of Heart Failure During\r\nan Examination\r\nIn the heart\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Heart enlargement\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Increased heart rate (tachycardia)\r\nIn the lungs\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Crackling noises (rales) heard through a\r\nstethoscope indicating a buildup of fluid in the\r\nlungs\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½ Leakage of fluid from the lungs (pleural\r\neffusion) into the chest cavity\r\nIn other areas\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nSwelling (edema) of the skin and soft tissues,\r\nusually noted in the feet and ankles\r\nEdema of the lower back (sacral edema)\r\nBuildup of fluid of the abdominal cavity\r\n(ascites)\r\nincreased size of liver (hepatomegaly)\r\nAscites\r\ntechniques for this purpose are the echocardiogram\r\nand the radionuclide angiocardiogram. (See Chapter\r\n10.) Both tests can quantify the level of heart dysfunction\r\nand distinguish between generalized as opposed\r\nto regional dysfunction.\r\nIn cardiac catheterization, a thin tube is introduced\r\nthrough a vein or artery into the heart. The procedure\r\ndetermines whether there are blockages in the blood\r\nvessels and measures pressures in various chambers\r\nof the heart. (See Chapter 10.)\r\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a graphic\r\nrecord of the heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electrical impulses; it can detect\r\nincreased wall thickness (called hypertrophy), heart\r\nenlargement, or various rhythm changes in heart failure.\r\nThe ECG may also be used to monitor the effects\r\nof drug treatments on the heart. Chest X-rays can\r\nalso detect an enlarged heart.\r\nCAUSES\r\nAn array of different problems can cause congestive\r\nheart failure. (See box, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Causes of Congestive Heart\r\nFailure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) Among them is coronary (ischemic) heart\r\ndisease resulting from insufficient blood flow to the\r\nHEART FAILURE\r\nmyocardium, or heart muscle. This is usually caused\r\nby atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty substances or\r\nplaque on the walls of the arteries that carry blood\r\nto the heart muscle. The heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to perform\r\ndecreases because ischemia results in the delivery of\r\nless oxygen and fewer nutrients to the heart muscle.\r\nA heart attack may also cause congestive failure.\r\nDuring a heart attack, the heart muscle is deprived\r\nof oxygen, resulting in tissue death and scarring. The\r\ndevelopment of heart failure depends on the extent\r\nand location of scarring. (See Chapter 15.)\r\nLong-standing high blood pressure is another\r\ncommon cause of heart failure. Because there is\r\ngreater resistance against which the heart must\r\npump, the heart muscle works harder. This results in\r\nan enlargement of the heart muscle, especially of the\r\nleft ventricle, the heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main pumping chamber.\r\nEventually, this enlarged muscle tissue weakens, setting\r\nthe stage for heart failure, especially if the pumping\r\nability of the enlarged chamber greatly decreases.\r\nArrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) can lead to\r\nheart failure, but they usually have to be severe and\r\nprolonged, with a rapid rate of more than 140 beats\r\nper minute, and must often occur in the presence of\r\nan already weakened heart. They change the pattern\r\nof filling and pumping of blood from the heart. This\r\ncondition may also lower output of blood to the point\r\nof heart failure. (See Chapter 16.)\r\nDiseased heart valves are another cause of heart\r\nfailure, which results when a narrowed or leaking\r\nvalve fails to direct blood flow properly through the\r\nheart. The problem may be congenital (inborn) or due\r\nto an infection such as endocarditis or rheumatic fever.\r\nThis increases the heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s workload, thereby inCauses\r\nof Congestive Heart\r\nFailure (CHF)\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½\r\nCoronary (ischemic) heart disease resulting from\r\ninsufficient blood flow to the heart muscle\r\n(myocardium)\r\nA heart attack, resulting in acute damage and\r\nthen scarring of heart muscle tissue\r\nChronic high blood pressure\r\nMajor cardiac arrhythmia\r\nDiseased heart valve(s)\r\nDiseased heart muscle\r\nCongenital heart disease\r\nMAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\r\ncreasing risk of developing heart failure. (See\r\nChapter 13.)\r\nCardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle itself,\r\ncan also lead to heart failure. Causes of cardiomyopathy\r\ninclude infection, alcohol abuse, and\r\ncocaine abuse. When heart failure seems to have no\r\nknown causes, it is known as idiopathic heart failure.\r\n(See Chapter 15.)\r\nHOW THE BODY TRIES\r\nTO PROTECT ITSELF\r\nWhen one system of the body is not functioning optimally,\r\nother systems may attempt to take over to\r\nmake up for the problem. In the case of heart failure,\r\nseveral types of compensation are possible.\r\nFirst, the heart chambers may enlarge, and the\r\nheart may beat more forcefully to pump out more\r\nblood for the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs. In time, the overworked\r\nheart muscle enlarges (much as skeletal muscles grow\r\nlarger during weight muscle training), creating increased\r\nmuscle fibers with which the heart can pump\r\nmore forcefully.\r\nSecond, the heart may be stimulated to pump more\r\noften, thereby increasing its output.\r\nThird, a compensation mechanism called the\r\nrenin-angiotensin system maybe initiated. When the\r\nlack of blood volume coming from the heart (cardiac\r\noutput) results in a decrease in the amount passing\r\nthrough the kidneys, the kidneys respond by stimulating\r\nthe system to secrete hormones that prompt\r\nthe kidneys to retain salt and water, and thereby increase\r\nblood volume. This is an attempt to compensate\r\nfor the decrease in output of the heart. This leads\r\nto a rise in blood pressure as the body attempts to\r\ncirculate the extra fluid volume and also ensures that\r\nadequate oxygen reaches the brain, kidneys, and\r\nother vital organs.\r\nThese compensation mechanisms keep the failing\r\nheart functioning almost normally in the early stages\r\nof heart failure. As the disease progresses, however,\r\ncompensation mechanisms cannot maintain proper\r\ncirculation. It may take years for a heart to go through\r\nthe stages of enlarging, working harder, and finally\r\nbreaking down. In many cases, as when a person has\r\nhypertension, heart failure is preventable if blood\r\npressure is treated adequately.\r\nTREATMENT\r\nWhenever possible, the best treatment of congestive\r\nheart failure is one of prevention. This includes diagnosing\r\nand treating high blood pressure and attempting\r\nto prevent atherosclerosis. Other important\r\npreventive steps include not smoking, using alcohol\r\nin moderation if at all, and abstaining from cocaine\r\nand other illicit drugs. A prudent diet, regular exercise,\r\nand weight control are also important.\r\nWhen a patient is diagnosed as having heart failure,\r\nthe first treatment is often restriction of dietary\r\nsodium. Drugs may be prescribed as well. Diuretics,\r\navailable since the 1950s, are often used to help the\r\nkidneys get rid of excess water and sodium, thereby\r\nreducing blood volume and the heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s workload.\r\n(See Chapter 23.)\r\nDigitalis, a drug that has been used since the 18th\r\ncentury, is still a component of modern therapy. It is\r\nprescribed to strengthen the heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pumping action.\r\nPatients taking both diuretics and digitalis may need\r\nto supplement their levels of potassium.\r\nNewer drugs for the treatment of heart failure include\r\nvasodilators, which cause the peripheral arteries\r\nto dilate, or open up. This reduces the work of the\r\nheart by making it easier for blood to flow. Among\r\nthe newest vasodilators used for heart failure are the\r\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,\r\nwhich may be used, along with diuretics, in patients\r\nwith mild-to-moderate or severe congestive failure.\r\nACE inhibitors, which include captopril (Capoten)\r\nand enalapril (Vasotec), block the production of a substance\r\ncalled angiotensin II, a potent constrictor of\r\nblood vessels. If blood vessels are dilated, the amount\r\nof work needed for the heart to pump blood forward\r\nis decreased.\r\nOther drugs used in the treatment of heart failure\r\ninclude calcium-channel blockers, which dilate blood\r\nvessels; beta blockers, which slow the heart (used\r\nonly in unusual circumstances); and medications that\r\naffect various heartbeat irregularities. Most cases,\r\nhowever, respond to diuretics and digitalis, especially\r\nwhen ACE inhibitors are added.\r\nSometimes, surgery proves effective. When heart\r\nfailure is due to valvular disease, surgical implantation\r\nof an artificial heart valve or valve repair may\r\nalleviate the problem. Surgery may also be helpful in\r\ncorrecting congenital heart defects that can lead to\r\nheart failure. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery\r\nand catheterization using a balloon to flatten fatty\r\nHEART FAILURE\r\ndeposits (called angioplasty) are among the therapeutic\r\ntechniques used to prevent and treat heart failure\r\ncaused by occluded, or blocked, arteries.\r\nHeart transplant are a last resort in treating severe\r\nheart failure caused by diseased heart muscle.\r\nAlthough the success rate of heart transplants has\r\nsignificantly improved, the cost of the operation and\r\nthe shortage of donor organs makes it impractical\r\nexcept as a last resort.\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\nThe outlook for most people with heart failure is dependent\r\nupon the cause of the heart failure and the\r\noverall degree of cardiac dysfunction. An estimated\r\n50 percent survive more than five years after diagnosis.\r\nThat figure, however, is an average of all patients\r\nwith varying levels of severity of the disease.\r\nThe prognosis for a specific person with heart failure\r\ndepends to a large degree on effects of the disease,\r\nsuch as the level of blood output of the left ventricle,\r\nor his or her ability to exercise, as well as other factors,\r\nincluding age, overall health, and other medical\r\nconditions. The sooner heart failure is diagnosed and\r\naction is taken to control the problem, the better.\r\nIn many cases, heart failure can be effectively\r\ntreated to prevent or slow the progression of the disease\r\nand to alleviate its symptoms. Therapy can\r\nachieve several goals: It can improve the performance\r\nof the left ventricle, prevent further deterioration of\r\nheart function, improve a patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to exercise,\r\nand improve quality of life.\r\nIn addition, it is possible that in selected instances,\r\nearly, effective treatment may increase a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\nlikelihood of improved survival.\r\n183'
