METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained      from 183 consecutive patients assigned to stage D heart failure (HF) who were      evaluated by the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo Hospital      and then listed for heart transplantation as status 1 or 2 of the Japan Organ      Transplant Network. Patients with status 2 (n=38) had a prognosis as poor as      those dependent on inotropes (n=54) or MCS (n=91; P=0.615, log-rank test), and      only 4 of them had eventual ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation (10.5\%).      Patients who eventually received VAD (n=92) had better 4-year survival than those      without MCS among status 1 and 2 (P=0.030, log-rank test). On Cox regression      analysis plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >740pg/ml was the only      significant predictor for 4-year survival among the status 2 group (P=0.014;      hazard ratio, 8.267). Ten patients with status 2 died: 6 due to acute hemodynamic      compromise and 4 due to ventricular fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis in      status 2 patients was as poor as that of those dependent on inotrope infusion or       VAD, mostly because of out-of-hospital sudden death without MCS. Status 2      patients with considerably high plasma BNP may be good candidates for continuous       flow VAD therapy.FAU - Imamura, TeruhikoAU  - Imamura TAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of      Tokyo.FAU - Kinugawa, KoichiroAU  - Kinugawa KFAU - Hatano, MasaruAU  - Hatano MFAU - Fujino, TakeoAU  - Fujino TFAU - Inaba, ToshiroAU  - Inaba TFAU - Maki, HisatakaAU  - Maki HFAU - Kinoshita, OsamuAU  - Kinoshita OFAU - Amiya, EisukeAU  - Amiya EFAU - Nawata, KanAU  - Nawata KFAU - Yao, AtsushiAU  - Yao AFAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SFAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MFAU - Komuro, IsseiAU  - Komuro ILA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20140403PL  - JapanTA  - Circ JJT  - Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation SocietyJID - 101137683RN  - 0 (Cardiotonic Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cardiotonic Agents/*administration & dosageMH  - Disease-Free SurvivalMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/blood/*mortality/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Survival RateMH  - Ventricular Fibrillation/blood/*mortality/*therapyEDAT- 2014/04/04 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/13 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/04 06:00PHST- 2014/04/03 [aheadofprint]AID - DN/JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-14-0077 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Circ J. 2014;78(6):1396-404.
