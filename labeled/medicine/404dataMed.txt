Listing for transplant may trigger psychosocial adjustment to the transplantation      as an upcoming critical life-event. We hypothesized that patients could profit      from this adaptation when implantation of a VAD becomes necessary. METHODS: We      arbitrarily chose a cut-off at 30 days after being put on the heart      transplantation (HTX) waiting list. Eighteen patients were listed for HTX for >30      days (referred to as \listed\) and 26 for shorter periods or not at all      (\non-listed\). Survival, the occurrence of mental disorders, the number of      contacts of the patient with the psychologist and times spent on      psychotherapeutic support for both patient groups and for their families were      analysed. RESULTS: Survival after VAD implantation (observation time) and mental       disorders were comparable for listed and non-listed patients. Mental disorders      were developed in 80\% of all patients irrespective of the listing group. The      utilization of supportive psychotherapy did not differ between the listed and the      non-listed group with regard to the number of contacts and to the time needed for      individual therapy. Moreover, the number of families who requested support did      not differ between the groups nor did the time spent on family therapy. However,       the number of contacts and the time for individual psychotherapeutic support      correlated with the observation time, whereas the time spent on family therapy      did not. In contrast, family therapy correlated inversely with age. In addition,       we compared bridge-to-transplantation patients with destination therapy patients.      There were no differences in the occurrence of mental disorders, the number of      contacts or in the time expenses for individual and for family therapy, neither      for all patients nor after stratification for listing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data      indicate that listing for HTX for >30 days before VAD implantation does not      reduce the utilization of psychotherapeutic support by VAD patients. We assume      that structured emotional and psychosocial support by the interdisciplinary VAD      team, including professional supportive psychotherapy, is indispensable for      successful coping of VAD patients and their families.FAU - Heilmann, ClaudiaAU  - Heilmann CAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery Freiburg, University Heart Center      Freiburg-Bad Krozingen, Freiburg, Germany. claudia.heilmann@uniklinik-freiburg.deFAU - Kuijpers, NicolaAU  - Kuijpers NFAU - Beyersdorf, FriedhelmAU  - Beyersdorf FFAU - Trummer, GeorgAU  - Trummer GFAU - Berchtold-Herz, MichaelAU  - Berchtold-Herz MFAU - Zeh, WolfgangAU  - Zeh WFAU - Stroh, Anna LenaAU  - Stroh ALFAU - Fritzsche, KurtAU  - Fritzsche KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20120104PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Family Therapy/statistics & numerical dataMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/psychology/surgeryMH  - Heart Transplantation/*psychologyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Kaplan-Meier EstimateMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/*etiology/therapyMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Psychotherapy/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - *Waiting ListsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/01/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/29 06:00CRDT- 2012/01/06 06:00PHST- 2012/01/04 [aheadofprint]AID - ezr233 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezr233 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Jun;41(6):1371-6; discussion 1376. doi:      10.1093/ejcts/ezr233.
