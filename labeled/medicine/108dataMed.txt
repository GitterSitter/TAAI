The improvement of these devices would benefit many patients,      especially those refractory to maximal pharmacological treatment and ineligible      for heart transplantation. This study examined whether the shape memory alloy      (SMA) fibers, which are fibers that contract when electric current flows through       them and relax passively when that flow is interrupted, can be wrapped around the      failing heart and assist in its pumping action. A band of SMA fibers was wrapped       around a silicon cylindrical chamber which simulated a dilated heart and its      pumping action was tested in a circulatory mockup. This rudimentary device was      innovatively controlled by pulse width modulation. The band was made of only six       fibers but yet produced the considerable pressure of 20 mm Hg and a stroke volume      of 11.8 ml with modest energy demands. A SMA device could assist a severely      failing heart, but there are limiting factors to overcome before designing highly      effective devices.FAU - Kalogerakos, Paris DAU  - Kalogerakos PDAD  - From the *Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Heraklion, Crete,      Greece; and daggerUniversity of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.FAU - Hassoulas, JannieAU  - Hassoulas JFAU - Ladopoulos, Vlassis SAU  - Ladopoulos VSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109RN  - 0 (Alloys)SB  - IMMH  - Alloys/*chemistryMH  - Blood PressureMH  - Heart/physiopathologyMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart RateMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - PressureMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Stroke VolumeEDAT- 2014/01/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/18 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/29 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000054 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2014 May-Jun;60(3):263-8. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000054.- 24469293own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140430dcom- 20141217is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 60ip  - 3dp  - 2014 may-junti  - beyond heart transplantation: potentials and problems of the shape memory alloy      fibers in the treatment of heart failure.pg  - 263-8lid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000054 [doi]ab  - heart failure can be treated with devices that mechanically support the      circulation. the improvement of these devices would benefit many patients,      especially those refractory to maximal pharmacological treatment and ineligible      for heart transplantation. this study examined whether the shape memory alloy      (sma) fibers, which are fibers that contract when electric current flows through       them and relax passively when that flow is interrupted, can be wrapped around the      failing heart and assist in its pumping action. a band of sma fibers was wrapped       around a silicon cylindrical chamber which simulated a dilated heart and its      pumping action was tested in a circulatory mockup. this rudimentary device was      innovatively controlled by pulse width modulation. the band was made of only six       fibers but yet produced the considerable pressure of 20 mm hg and a stroke volume      of 11.8 ml with modest energy demands. a sma device could assist a severely      failing heart, but there are limiting factors to overcome before designing highly      effective devices.fau - kalogerakos, paris dau  - kalogerakos pdad  - from the *foundation for research and technology hellas, heraklion, crete,      greece; and daggeruniversity of crete, heraklion, crete, greece.fau - hassoulas, jannieau  - hassoulas jfau - ladopoulos, vlassis sau  - ladopoulos vsla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\tpl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109rn  - 0 (alloys)sb  - immh  - alloys/*chemistrymh  - blood pressuremh  - heart/physiopathologymh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart ratemh  - heart transplantationmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - pressuremh  - prosthesis designmh  - stroke volumeedat- 2014/01/29 06:00mhda- 2014/12/18 06:00crdt- 2014/01/29 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0000000000000054 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2014 may-jun;60(3):263-8. doi: 10.1097/mat.0000000000000054.
