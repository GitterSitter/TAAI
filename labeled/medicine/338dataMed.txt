However, studies of a large series of      applications are still lacking. We evaluate the safety and efficacy of the      HeartWare pump in 141 patients with end-stage heart failure at a single centre.      METHODS: A total of 141 patients (116 men and 25 women with a mean age of 52      years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV received implantation of the      HeartWare Ventricular Assist System between August 2009 and April 2011 at the      Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin. The outcomes were measured in terms of laboratory      data, adverse events, NYHA functional class and survival during device support.      RESULTS: The HeartWare system provided an adequate haemodynamic support for      patients both inside and outside the hospital. NYHA class improved to I-II. Organ      function and pulmonary vascular resistance improved significantly. In this cohort      of patients, 14 patients underwent heart transplantation, one had had the device       explanted following myocardial recovery, one had changed to another assist      device, 81 were on ongoing support and 44 died. The overall actuarial survival      rates at 6 and 12 months were 70 and 67\%, respectively, and the 3-, 6- and      12-month survival rates on a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support for      bridge to transplantation patients were 82, 81 and 79\%, respectively. Infection      and bleeding were the main adverse events. Four patients underwent an LVAD      exchange for pump thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The HeartWare system provides a safe      and effective circulatory support in a population with a wide range of body      surface areas, with a satisfactory actuarial survival time and an improved      quality of life. It can be used for univentricular or biventricular support,      being implanted into the pericardial space with simplified surgical techniques.FAU - Wu, LongAU  - Wu LAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xiehe Hospital, Tongji Medical College,      Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. wulong72@gmail.comFAU - Weng, Yu-GuoAU  - Weng YGFAU - Dong, Nian-GuoAU  - Dong NGFAU - Krabatsch, ThomasAU  - Krabatsch TFAU - Stepanenko, AlexanderAU  - Stepanenko AFAU - Hennig, EwaldAU  - Hennig EFAU - Hetzer, RolandAU  - Hetzer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120801PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMCIN - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Apr;45(4):765. - 22858453own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130614dcom- 20140501is  - 1873-734x (electronic)is  - 1010-7940 (linking)vi  - 44ip  - 1dp  - 2013 julti  - outcomes of heartware ventricular assist system support in 141 patients: a      single-centre experience.pg  - 139-45lid - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs263 [doi]ab  - objectives: a third-generation ventricular assist device, the heartware      ventricular assist system, has demonstrated its reliability and durability in      animal models and clinical experience. however, studies of a large series of      applications are still lacking. we evaluate the safety and efficacy of the      heartware pump in 141 patients with end-stage heart failure at a single centre.      methods: a total of 141 patients (116 men and 25 women with a mean age of 52      years) in new york heart association (nyha) class iv received implantation of the      heartware ventricular assist system between august 2009 and april 2011 at the      deutsches herzzentrum berlin. the outcomes were measured in terms of laboratory      data, adverse events, nyha functional class and survival during device support.      results: the heartware system provided an adequate haemodynamic support for      patients both inside and outside the hospital. nyha class improved to i-ii. organ      function and pulmonary vascular resistance improved significantly. in this cohort      of patients, 14 patients underwent heart transplantation, one had had the device       explanted following myocardial recovery, one had changed to another assist      device, 81 were on ongoing support and 44 died. the overall actuarial survival      rates at 6 and 12 months were 70 and 67\%, respectively, and the 3-, 6- and      12-month survival rates on a left ventricular assist device (lvad) support for      bridge to transplantation patients were 82, 81 and 79\%, respectively. infection      and bleeding were the main adverse events. four patients underwent an lvad      exchange for pump thrombosis. conclusions: the heartware system provides a safe      and effective circulatory support in a population with a wide range of body      surface areas, with a satisfactory actuarial survival time and an improved      quality of life. it can be used for univentricular or biventricular support,      being implanted into the pericardial space with simplified surgical techniques.fau - wu, longau  - wu lad  - department of cardiovascular surgery, xiehe hospital, tongji medical college,      huazhong university of science and technology, wuhan, china. wulong72@gmail.comfau - weng, yu-guoau  - weng ygfau - dong, nian-guoau  - dong ngfau - krabatsch, thomasau  - krabatsch tfau - stepanenko, alexanderau  - stepanenko afau - hennig, ewaldau  - hennig efau - hetzer, rolandau  - hetzer rla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20120801pl  - germanyta  - eur j cardiothorac surgjt  - european journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the european      association for cardio-thoracic surgeryjid - 8804069sb  - imcin - eur j cardiothorac surg. 2014 apr;45(4):765.
