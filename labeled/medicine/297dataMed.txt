We report on our experiences of these      patients with a follow-up of 132 patient years. METHODS: Seventy-four HeartMate      II axial flow pumps and 41 HeartWare centrifugal pumps were implanted in patients      with non-ischaemic (n = 70) or ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 45). The mean age of      the patients was 50 +/- 13 years. All patients were on inotropic support prior to      implantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used as a bridging      procedure in 21 cases. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 14\%. Hospital      discharge occurred on average after 46 +/- 33 days. Twenty-two patients of this      cohort received a heart transplant 492 +/- 342 days after implantation of the      device. Two patients died after heart transplantation. A 1-year survival of 73\%      and a 2-year survival of 69\% were recorded, despite a low incidence of transplant      procedures. The longest support time was 1686 days. CONCLUSIONS: Modern left      ventricular assist device technology can be used successfully for heart failure.       The scarcity of donor hearts leads to prolonged periods on the device, and      chronic ventricular assist device therapy has become a reality, although bridge      to transplant was intended; therefore, sufficient support services for outpatient      care of these patients are required.FAU - Meyer, Anna LAU  - Meyer ALAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery, Hannover      Medical School, Hannover, Germany.FAU - Malehsa, DorisAU  - Malehsa DFAU - Bara, ChristophAU  - Bara CFAU - Haverich, AxelAU  - Haverich AFAU - Strueber, MartinAU  - Strueber MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121209PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur J Cardiothorac SurgJT  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European      Association for Cardio-thoracic SurgeryJID - 8804069SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Cardiomyopathies/*surgeryMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Length of StayMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - HeartMate IIOT  - HeartWareOT  - Left ventricular assist deviceOT  - OutcomeEDAT- 2012/12/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/07 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/12 06:00PHST- 2012/12/09 [aheadofprint]AID - ezs568 [pii]AID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs568 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Jun;43(6):1233-6. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezs568.
