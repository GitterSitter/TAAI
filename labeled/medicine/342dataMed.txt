The HeartWare Ventricular      Assist System HVAD; HeartWare, Inc.; Miramar, Fla, USA) is a new device that is a      centrifugal, intracorporeal, miniaturized and continuous flow pump that serves      simple patient use and enhanced life quality. This article reports the midterm      results of patients who underwent the heartware support system. MATERIALS AND      METHODS: We retrospectively compiled our data from December 2010, including 10      patients of mean age 51.8 years with 90\% males, 70\% of the overall patient cohort      had dilated cardiomyopathy and remaining ones, ischemic disease. Mean left      ventricular ejection fraction was 20.1\% and mean systolic pulmonary artery      pressure was 49.2 mm Hg. A single patient was grade 1; seven were grade 2; and      remaining ones, grade 3 according to the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) scale. All patients were operated with      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with moderate hypothermia. Tricuspid ring      annuloplasty was performed in 3 (30\%) patients. In one patient we removed a left       ventricular thrombus. In a case with severe aortic regurgitation, we placed a      simple coaptation stitch at the central portion of the three aortic cusps under      the aortic cross clamp. The mean CPB duration was 95.5 minutes. RESULTS: There      was no operative or in-hospital mortality. Mean support time was 250.67 days.      During the early postoperative period, one patient experienced a minor      hemorrhagic neurological event also requiring a tracheostomy due to pneumonia.      This patient has completely healed and on follow-up continues a normal life. All       patients were asymptomatic regarding heart failure. One patient unfortunately      died because of possible pancreatic cancer and sepsis. Two patients underwent      transplantations on days 159 and 172 of support. CONCLUSION: The HVAD system      provided effective circulatory support for patients with end-stage heart failure       with low adverse event rates. Long-term results are needed particularly for      destination therapy candidates.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
