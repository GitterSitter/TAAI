In addition, primary myocardial dysfunction related to       myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy may cause end-stage cardiac failure in      children or infants, although not as frequently as in adults. The need for      mechanical circulatory support may be either temporary until spontaneous      myocardial recovery, as in postcardiotomy cardiac failure, or prolonged until      heart transplantation in the absence of recovery. Two types of mechanical      circulatory devices are suitable for the paediatric population: extracorporeal      membrane oxygenation for short-term support; and ventricular assist devices for      long-term support as a bridge to transplantation. The aim of this review is to      describe the specific issues related to paediatric mechanical circulatory support      and the different types of devices available, to report on their rapidly growing       use worldwide and on the outcomes for each indication and type of device, and to       provide a perspective on the future developments and remaining challenges in this      field.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.
