Severe pulmonary dysfunction      may preclude their use, leaving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as the      most frequently used option for combined cardiac and respiratory failure. There      are few case reports describing the use of an oxygenator in combination with VAD       support, but none that describes long-term utilization. We report the successful       use of a low-resistance oxygenator placed into the right-sided VAD (RVAD) circuit      of an infant with life-threatening respiratory failure. The oxygenator enabled      immediate reversal of hypoxaemia and hypercarbia and recovery of the RVAD      function. The oxygenator remained within the VAD circuit for 15 days,      facilitating complete lung recovery. An oxygenator used in conjunction with a VAD      may be a life-saving therapy, allowing adequate oxygenation and ventilation in      severe respiratory and cardiac failure. Extended use may facilitate the      prevention of ventilator-associated lung injury and organ dysfunction. This      therapy may be an attractive intermediate step in the transition from, or      alternative to ECMO, in patients requiring VAD placement with associated acute      lung injury.FAU - Zaccagni, Hayden JAU  - Zaccagni HJAD  - Division of Pediatric Critical Care, University of Alabama at Birmingham,      Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.FAU - Timpa, Joseph GAU  - Timpa JGFAU - O\Meara, Lawrence CAU  - O\Meara LCFAU - Alten, Jeffrey AAU  - Alten JALA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20130409PL  - EnglandTA  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac SurgJT  - Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgeryJID - 101158399SB  - IMMH  - Acute Lung Injury/diagnosis/etiology/*therapyMH  - Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*adverse effectsMH  - *Extracorporeal Membrane OxygenationMH  - Fatal OutcomeMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Defects, Congenital/*surgeryMH  - Heart Failure/diagnosis/etiology/*therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - Prosthesis DesignMH  - Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/diagnosis/etiology/*therapyMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomePMC - PMC3686397OID - NLM: PMC3686397OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Acute lung injuryOT  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenationOT  - OxygenatorOT  - Ventricular assist devicesEDAT- 2013/04/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/20 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/11 06:00PHST- 2013/04/09 [aheadofprint]AID - ivt131 [pii]AID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt131 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2013 Jul;17(1):196-8. doi: 10.1093/icvts/ivt131.
