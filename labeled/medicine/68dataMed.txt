It is not an etiological diagnosis, but may have different      underlying causes and pathogenetic processes - viral, bacterial, toxic, and      autoreactive. Clinical management of the disease entity at the acute stage      involves hemodynamic monitoring in an intensive care unit or similar setting.      Rapid routine work-up is mandatory with serial EKGs, echocardiography, cardiac      MRI, heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy for histology,      immunohistology, and molecular analysis for the underlying infection and      pathogenesis. Heart failure therapy is warranted in all cases according to      current guidelines. For fulminant autoreactive myocarditis, immunosuppressive      treatment is beneficial; for viral myocarditis, IVIg can resolve the      inflammation, reduce the viral load, and even eradicate the microbial agent.      ECMO, IABP, ventricular assist devices, LifeVest, or ICD implantation can bridge       to recovery or to heart transplantation.FAU - Maisch, BernhardAU  - Maisch BAD  - Medical Faculty of Philipps University Marburg and Cardiovascular Center Marburg,      Erlenring 19, 35037, Marburg, Germany, bermaisch@gmail.com.FAU - Ruppert, VolkerAU  - Ruppert VFAU - Pankuweit, SabineAU  - Pankuweit SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Heart Fail RepJT  - Current heart failure reportsJID - 101196487SB  - IMMH  - AlgorithmsMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cardiomyopathies/diagnosis/etiology/therapyMH  - Disease Models, AnimalMH  - Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - Myocarditis/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/therapyMH  - PhenotypeMH  - Terminology as TopicEDAT- 2014/04/12 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/13 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/12 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11897-014-0196-6 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2014 Jun;11(2):166-77. doi: 10.1007/s11897-014-0196-6.- 24723087own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20140508dcom- 20150109is  - 1546-9549 (electronic)is  - 1546-9530 (linking)vi  - 11ip  - 2dp  - 2014 junti  - management of fulminant myocarditis: a diagnosis in search of its etiology but      with therapeutic options.pg  - 166-77lid - 10.1007/s11897-014-0196-6 [doi]ab  - fulminant myocarditis is a clinical syndrome with signs of acute heart failure,      cardiogenic shock, or life-threating rhythm disturbances in the context of      suspected myocarditis. it is not an etiological diagnosis, but may have different      underlying causes and pathogenetic processes - viral, bacterial, toxic, and      autoreactive. clinical management of the disease entity at the acute stage      involves hemodynamic monitoring in an intensive care unit or similar setting.      rapid routine work-up is mandatory with serial ekgs, echocardiography, cardiac      mri, heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy for histology,      immunohistology, and molecular analysis for the underlying infection and      pathogenesis. heart failure therapy is warranted in all cases according to      current guidelines. for fulminant autoreactive myocarditis, immunosuppressive      treatment is beneficial; for viral myocarditis, ivig can resolve the      inflammation, reduce the viral load, and even eradicate the microbial agent.      ecmo, iabp, ventricular assist devices, lifevest, or icd implantation can bridge       to recovery or to heart transplantation.fau - maisch, bernhardau  - maisch bad  - medical faculty of philipps university marburg and cardiovascular center marburg,      erlenring 19, 35037, marburg, germany, bermaisch@gmail.com.fau - ruppert, volkerau  - ruppert vfau - pankuweit, sabineau  - pankuweit sla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - research support, non-u.s. gov\tpt  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - curr heart fail repjt  - current heart failure reportsjid - 101196487sb  - immh  - algorithmsmh  - animalsmh  - cardiomyopathies/diagnosis/etiology/therapymh  - disease models, animalmh  - heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - incidencemh  - myocarditis/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/therapymh  - phenotypemh  - terminology as topicedat- 2014/04/12 06:00mhda- 2015/01/13 06:00crdt- 2014/04/12 06:00aid - 10.1007/s11897-014-0196-6 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - curr heart fail rep. 2014 jun;11(2):166-77. doi: 10.1007/s11897-014-0196-6.
