However, the importance of this newer      technique for chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still       open to discussion. To date, there are few studies that extensively explore the      psychological and cognitive profiles of patient with ventricular assist devices      (VADs). METHODS: We studied the psychological aspects, quality of life (QOL) and       cognitive profiles of 19 patients with HF before VAD implantation and then at      two, five and 16 months post-implantation. RESULTS: Our results showed that after      VAD implantation, patients did not show any psychopathological problems such as      anxiety and/or depression. More interestingly, despite the constant risk of      neurological events determined by the continuous-blood-flow pump (CBFP),      patients\ cognitive functioning did not worsen. In fact, significant enhancements      were observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and cognitive deficits are      common in advanced HF and often worsen over time. Appropriately designed and      randomized studies are needed to demonstrate whether earlier VAD implantation is       warranted to arrest cognitive decline and encourage better post-implantation      adaptation.FAU -
