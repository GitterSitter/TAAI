In June 2006, the patient arrived at our outpatient clinic with an      acute renal impairment and all manifestations of acute heart failure. He was      already registered on the waiting list for heart transplantation (Eurotransplant)      as a highly urgent request. The patient underwent heart transplantation but the      reperfused allograft was totally akinetic and we decided to place a biventricular      assist device immediately. The patient fully recovered after seven days of      biventricular circulatory support and was discharged on the 38th day after the      transplantation. Three years later, he is in good general condition without any      manifestation of rejection. We conclude that biventricular assist device      implantation is a good indication after post-cardiotomy failure and it should be       started as early as possible before shock and possible irreversible organ damage.FAU - Stefanidis, ConstantinAU  - Stefanidis CAD  - Cardiac Surgery Department, CHU Brugmann, Hopital Erasme, Free University of      Brussels (ULB) Belgium. constantin.stefanidis@chu-brugmann.beFAU - Callebaut, GregoryAU  - Callebaut GFAU - Ngatchou, WilliamAU  - Ngatchou WFAU - Ramadan, Ahmed SeAU  - Ramadan ASFAU - Antoine, MartineAU  - Antoine MFAU - de Canniere, DidierAU  - de Canniere DFAU - Jansens, Jean-LucAU  - Jansens JLLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - GreeceTA  - Hellenic J CardiolJT  - Hellenic journal of cardiology : HJC = Hellenike kardiologike epitheoreseJID - 101257381SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Heart Failure, Systolic/*surgeryMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Myocardial Contraction/*physiologyMH  - Primary Graft Dysfunction/diagnosis/physiopathology/*surgeryMH  - *Recovery of FunctionEDAT- 2012/04/10 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/15 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/10 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Hellenic J Cardiol. 2012 Mar;53(2):160-2.- 22484784own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20120409dcom- 20120814lr  - 20130807is  - 2241-5955 (electronic)is  - 1109-9666 (linking)vi  - 53ip  - 2dp  - 2012 marti  - the role of biventricular assistance in primary graft failure after heart      transplantation.pg  - 160-2ab  - a 37-year-old man suffered from systolic heart failure as a result of idiopathic       dilated cardiomyopathy since 1995 and was followed up in our cardiology      department. in june 2006, the patient arrived at our outpatient clinic with an      acute renal impairment and all manifestations of acute heart failure. he was      already registered on the waiting list for heart transplantation (eurotransplant)      as a highly urgent request. the patient underwent heart transplantation but the      reperfused allograft was totally akinetic and we decided to place a biventricular      assist device immediately. the patient fully recovered after seven days of      biventricular circulatory support and was discharged on the 38th day after the      transplantation. three years later, he is in good general condition without any      manifestation of rejection. we conclude that biventricular assist device      implantation is a good indication after post-cardiotomy failure and it should be       started as early as possible before shock and possible irreversible organ damage.fau - stefanidis, constantinau  - stefanidis cad  - cardiac surgery department, chu brugmann, hopital erasme, free university of      brussels (ulb) belgium. constantin.stefanidis@chu-brugmann.befau - callebaut, gregoryau  - callebaut gfau - ngatchou, williamau  - ngatchou wfau - ramadan, ahmed seau  - ramadan asfau - antoine, martineau  - antoine mfau - de canniere, didierau  - de canniere dfau - jansens, jean-lucau  - jansens jlla  - engpt  - case reportspt  - journal articlepl  - greeceta  - hellenic j cardioljt  - hellenic journal of cardiology : hjc = hellenike kardiologike epitheoresejid - 101257381sb  - immh  - adultmh  - follow-up studiesmh  - heart failure, systolic/*surgerymh  - *heart transplantationmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - malemh  - myocardial contraction/*physiologymh  - primary graft dysfunction/diagnosis/physiopathology/*surgerymh  - *recovery of functionedat- 2012/04/10 06:00mhda- 2012/08/15 06:00crdt- 2012/04/10 06:00pst - ppublishso  - hellenic j cardiol. 2012 mar;53(2):160-2.
