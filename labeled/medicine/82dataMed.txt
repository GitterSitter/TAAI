She was born with a hypoplastic left heart syndrome and underwent      multistage palliation to a Fontan circulation at 2(1/2) years of age. After the      Fontan surgery, she developed PLE, necessitating a Fontan revision, followed by a      Fontan takedown and eventually HTx, which was performed with a blood group B      heart into an O recipient. Right ventricular (RV) failure secondary to increased       pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) evolved immediately after HTx. A temporary      right ventricular assist device (RVAD) was implanted and later switched to a      pneumatic pulsatile RVAD. With the adaption of PVR on the RVAD, the PLE resolved       and the RVAD was explanted. In the following 12 months, she developed multiple      relapses of PLE which eventually resolved after exchange of the calcineurin      inhibitor.CI  - (c) 2014 Steunstichting ESOT.FAU - Seitz, StefanieAU  - Seitz SAD  - Department of Pediatrics, Stollery Children\s Hospital, University of Alberta,      Edmonton, AB, Canada.FAU - Buchholz, HolgerAU  - Buchholz HFAU - Rebeyka, IvanAU  - Rebeyka IFAU - Ross, DavidAU  - Ross DFAU - West, LoriAU  - West LFAU - Urschel, SimonAU  - Urschel SLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140329PL  - EnglandTA  - Transpl IntJT  - Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ      TransplantationJID - 8908516RN  - 0 (ABO Blood-Group System)SB  - IMMH  - *ABO Blood-Group SystemMH  - Blood Group Incompatibility/therapyMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Fontan Procedure/*adverse effectsMH  - Heart Failure/physiopathologyMH  - *Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - Protein-Losing Enteropathies/*etiology/therapyMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/therapyOTO - NOTNLMOT  - ABO incompatibilityOT  - allograft dysfunctionOT  - failed Fontan circulationOT  - heart transplantationOT  - mechanical circulatory supportOT  - protein-losing enteropathyEDAT- 2014/03/19 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/03 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/18 06:00PHST- 2014/01/20 [received]PHST- 2014/02/17 [revised]PHST- 2014/02/25 [accepted]PHST- 2014/03/29 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/tri.12294 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Transpl Int. 2014 Jul;27(7):e54-7. doi: 10.1111/tri.12294.
