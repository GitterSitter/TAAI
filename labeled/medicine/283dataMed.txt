Improvements in the design of ventricular assist devices have been rewarded by a       decrease in adverse events and an increase in survival. Despite significant      progress, even the latest generation left ventricular assist devices are burdened      by a significant long-term adverse events profile that will increasingly      challenge physicians as patients survive longer on implantable mechanical      circulatory support. In this review, we analyze the impact of long-term adverse      events on clinical outcomes in the major trials of continuous flow left      ventricular assist devices. We discuss several of the more pertinent and      interesting adverse events, examine their potential causes, and explore their      future implications.FAU - Adzic, AleksandarAU  - Adzic AAD  - Division of Cardiology, Montefiore Medical Center, 3400 Bainbridge Avenue, Bronx,      NY 10467, USA.FAU - Patel, Snehal RAU  - Patel SRFAU - Maybaum, SimonAU  - Maybaum SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Heart Fail RepJT  - Current heart failure reportsJID - 101196487SB  - IMMH  - Aortic Valve Insufficiency/etiologyMH  - Equipment FailureMH  - Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/etiologyMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Prosthesis-Related Infections/etiologyMH  - Stroke/etiologyMH  - Thrombosis/etiologyEDAT- 2013/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2013/07/11 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/15 06:00AID - 10.1007/s11897-012-0127-3 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2013 Mar;10(1):89-100. doi: 10.1007/s11897-012-0127-3.- 23314865own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130208dcom- 20130710is  - 1546-9549 (electronic)is  - 1546-9530 (linking)vi  - 10ip  - 1dp  - 2013 marti  - impact of adverse events on ventricular assist device outcomes.pg  - 89-100lid - 10.1007/s11897-012-0127-3 [doi]ab  - left ventricular assist devices have been proven to be superior to medical      therapy for advanced heart failure patients awaiting heart transplantation and      viable alternatives to transplantation for destination therapy patients.      improvements in the design of ventricular assist devices have been rewarded by a       decrease in adverse events and an increase in survival. despite significant      progress, even the latest generation left ventricular assist devices are burdened      by a significant long-term adverse events profile that will increasingly      challenge physicians as patients survive longer on implantable mechanical      circulatory support. in this review, we analyze the impact of long-term adverse      events on clinical outcomes in the major trials of continuous flow left      ventricular assist devices. we discuss several of the more pertinent and      interesting adverse events, examine their potential causes, and explore their      future implications.fau - adzic, aleksandarau  - adzic aad  - division of cardiology, montefiore medical center, 3400 bainbridge avenue, bronx,      ny 10467, usa.fau - patel, snehal rau  - patel srfau - maybaum, simonau  - maybaum sla  - engpt  - journal articlept  - reviewpl  - united statesta  - curr heart fail repjt  - current heart failure reportsjid - 101196487sb  - immh  - aortic valve insufficiency/etiologymh  - equipment failuremh  - gastrointestinal hemorrhage/etiologymh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart-assist devices/*adverse effectsmh  - humansmh  - prosthesis-related infections/etiologymh  - stroke/etiologymh  - thrombosis/etiologyedat- 2013/01/15 06:00mhda- 2013/07/11 06:00crdt- 2013/01/15 06:00aid - 10.1007/s11897-012-0127-3 [doi]pst - ppublishso  - curr heart fail rep. 2013 mar;10(1):89-100. doi: 10.1007/s11897-012-0127-3.
