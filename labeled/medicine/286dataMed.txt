We sought to establish the      important haemodynamic determinants of alterations in serum creatinine. METHODS      AND RESULTS: We reviewed data from 443 patients treated for ADHF with      haemodynamic guidance in a single centre. WRF and IRF were defined as a 25\%      increase or decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from time of       admission to pulmonary artery catheter removal, respectively. Of the 443      patients, 46 (10\%) experienced WRF and 127 (29\%) had IRF. Baseline eGFR was lower      in patients with IRF when compared with stable patients or those with WRF (45 +/-      25 vs. 63 +/- 30 vs. 68 +/- 27 mL/min/m(2), respectively, P < 0.0001). In      contrast, the relative decrease in mean blood pressure (BP) was more pronounced      in patients with WRF when compared with stable patients or those with IRF (15 +/-      15 vs. 9 +/- 17 vs. 4 +/- 15\%, respectively, P = 0.003). With larger decreases in      mean BP, there was greater likelihood of experiencing WRF (P = 0.04) but less      likelihood of experiencing IRF (P = 0.01). In contrast, the degree of changes in       right atrial pressure or cardiac index did not affect the propensity for      developing WRF or IRF. There was no difference in adverse clinical outcomes      (death, heart transplantation, LV assist device implantation, or readmission)      between the three groups (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Blood pressure decrease, rather       than alterations in cardiac output or central venous pressure, were associated      with changes in serum creatinine during treatment of ADHF.FAU - Dupont, MatthiasAU  - Dupont MAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland      Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.FAU - Mullens, WilfriedAU  - Mullens WFAU - Finucan, MichaelAU  - Finucan MFAU - Taylor, David OAU  - Taylor DOFAU - Starling, Randall CAU  - Starling RCFAU - Tang, W H WilsonAU  - Tang WHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20130102PL  - NetherlandsTA  - Eur J Heart FailJT  - European journal of heart failureJID - 100887595RN  - AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Blood Pressure/*physiologyMH  - Creatinine/*bloodMH  - FemaleMH  - Glomerular Filtration RateMH  - Heart Failure/*blood/drug therapy/*physiopathologyMH  - Hemodynamics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Kidney/physiopathologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedEDAT- 2013/01/05 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/24 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/05 06:00PHST- 2013/01/02 [aheadofprint]AID - hfs209 [pii]AID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs209 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Heart Fail. 2013 Apr;15(4):433-40. doi: 10.1093/eurjhf/hfs209.
