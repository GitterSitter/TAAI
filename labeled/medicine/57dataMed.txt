METHODS:      Three groups of patients at one hospital were considered for this cost analysis:       (1) patients included in the BENEMACS study starting May 2009 (n = 6); (2) all      patients from May 2009 till May 2010 undergoing heart transplantation (n = 19);      or (iii) undergoing Heartmate II implantation as a bridge to transplant (n = 13).      Patients undergoing bridging were more sick (lower Intermacs class). DT patients       were older (64+/-8 years). Cost was derived from actual hospital invoices,      device, organ procurement and medical cost, and follow-up care during 1 year from      implantation. Costs are presented in euro, by their mean values and standard      deviation. RESULTS: One-year survivals were 83, 84, and 77\%, respectively, for      DT, HTX, and bridging. Costs for initial and re-hospitalizations were not      different between groups. Costs for medical follow-up and medication were      significantly higher for transplanted patients. The 1-year total cost was euro85       531+/-19 823 for HTX, euro125 108+/-32 399 for bridging, and euro137 068+/-29 007      for DT. As 42\% of the transplanted patients were bridged, the cost of the medical      pathway HTX was euro138 076+/-19 823. Assuming a 5-year survival and a similar      yearly follow-up cost, the average cost per year is euro42 153 for HTX, euro53      637 for transplantation including the bridging cost, and euro47 487 for DT.      CONCLUSION: Direct transplantation without bridging is the most cost-efficient      treatment. The cost per patient per year for DT is similar to HTX considering its      bridging activity.FAU - Droogne, WAU  - Droogne WFAU - Jacobs, SAU  - Jacobs SFAU - Van den Bossche, KAU  - Van den Bossche KFAU - Verhoeven, JAU  - Verhoeven JFAU - Bostic, R RAU  - Bostic RRFAU - Vanhaecke, JAU  - Vanhaecke JFAU - Van Cleemput, JAU  - Van Cleemput JFAU - Rega, FAU  - Rega FFAU - Meyns, BAU  - Meyns BLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20140320PL  - EnglandTA  - Acta Clin BelgJT  - Acta clinica BelgicaJID - 0370306SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Care CostsMH  - Heart Failure/*economics/*therapyMH  - Heart Transplantation/*economicsMH  - Heart-Assist Devices/*economicsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Treatment OutcomeOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Cost,OT  - Destination therapy,OT  - Heart transplantationOT  - VAD,EDAT- 2014/05/14 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/05/14 06:00PHST- 2014/03/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1179/2295333714Y.0000000017 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Acta Clin Belg. 2014 Jun;69(3):165-70. doi: 10.1179/2295333714Y.0000000017.
