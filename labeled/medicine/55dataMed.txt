The previous work in cardiac surgery has led      to many excellent surgical techniques for treating cardiac diseases, and these      procedures are now able to prolong the human lifespan. However, surgical      treatment for end-stage heart failure has been under-explored, although left      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and heart transplantation are      options to treat the condition. LVAD can provide powerful circulatory support for      end-stage heart failure patients and improve the survival and quality of life      after implantation compared with the existing medical counterparts. Moreover,      LVADs play a crucial role in the \"bridge to transplantation\", \"bridge to      recovery\" and recently have served as \"destination therapy\". The structural and      molecular changes that improve the cardiac function after LVAD implantation are      called \"reverse remodeling\", which means that patients who have received a LVAD      can be weaned from the LVAD with restoration of their cardiac function. This      strategy is a desirable alternative to heart transplantation in terms of both the      patient quality of life and due to the organ shortage. The mechanism of this      bridge to recovery is interesting, and is different from other treatments for      heart failure. Bridge to recovery therapy is one of the options in regenerative      therapy which only a surgeon can provide. In this review, we pathophysiologically      analyze the reverse remodeling phenomenon induced by LVAD and comment about the      clinical evidence with regard to its impact on the bridge to recovery.FAU - Miyagawa, ShigeruAU  - Miyagawa SAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of      Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.FAU - Toda, KoichiAU  - Toda KFAU - Nakamura, TeruyaAU  - Nakamura TFAU - Yoshikawa, YasushiAU  - Yoshikawa YFAU - Fukushima, SatsukiAU  - Fukushima SFAU - Saito, ShunsukeAU  - Saito SFAU - Yoshioka, DaisukeAU  - Yoshioka DFAU - Saito, TetsuyaAU  - Saito TFAU - Sawa, YoshikiAU  - Sawa YLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150404TA  - Surg TodayJT  - Surgery todayJID - 9204360EDAT- 2015/04/05 06:00MHDA- 2015/04/05 06:00CRDT- 2015/04/05 06:00PHST- 2014/08/11 [received]PHST- 2015/01/20 [accepted]PHST- 2015/04/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00595-015-1149-8 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Surg Today. 2015 Apr 4.- 25840890own - nlmstat- publisherda  - 20150404lr  - 20150405is  - 1436-2813 (electronic)is  - 0941-1291 (linking)dp  - 2015 apr 4ti  - building a bridge to recovery: the pathophysiology of lvad-induced reverse      modeling in heart failure.ab  - heart failure mainly caused by ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy is a      life-threatening disorder worldwide. the previous work in cardiac surgery has led      to many excellent surgical techniques for treating cardiac diseases, and these      procedures are now able to prolong the human lifespan. however, surgical      treatment for end-stage heart failure has been under-explored, although left      ventricular assist device (lvad) implantation and heart transplantation are      options to treat the condition. lvad can provide powerful circulatory support for      end-stage heart failure patients and improve the survival and quality of life      after implantation compared with the existing medical counterparts. moreover,      lvads play a crucial role in the \"bridge to transplantation\", \"bridge to      recovery\" and recently have served as \"destination therapy\". the structural and      molecular changes that improve the cardiac function after lvad implantation are      called \"reverse remodeling\", which means that patients who have received a lvad      can be weaned from the lvad with restoration of their cardiac function. this      strategy is a desirable alternative to heart transplantation in terms of both the      patient quality of life and due to the organ shortage. the mechanism of this      bridge to recovery is interesting, and is different from other treatments for      heart failure. bridge to recovery therapy is one of the options in regenerative      therapy which only a surgeon can provide. in this review, we pathophysiologically      analyze the reverse remodeling phenomenon induced by lvad and comment about the      clinical evidence with regard to its impact on the bridge to recovery.fau - miyagawa, shigeruau  - miyagawa sad  - department of cardiovascular surgery, osaka university graduate school of      medicine, 2-2 yamada-oka, suita, osaka, 565-0871, japan.fau - toda, koichiau  - toda kfau - nakamura, teruyaau  - nakamura tfau - yoshikawa, yasushiau  - yoshikawa yfau - fukushima, satsukiau  - fukushima sfau - saito, shunsukeau  - saito sfau - yoshioka, daisukeau  - yoshioka dfau - saito, tetsuyaau  - saito tfau - sawa, yoshikiau  - sawa yla  - engpt  - journal articledep - 20150404ta  - surg todayjt  - surgery todayjid - 9204360edat- 2015/04/05 06:00mhda- 2015/04/05 06:00crdt- 2015/04/05 06:00phst- 2014/08/11 [received]phst- 2015/01/20 [accepted]phst- 2015/04/04 [aheadofprint]aid - 10.1007/s00595-015-1149-8 [doi]pst - aheadofprintso  - surg today. 2015 apr 4.
