Because of the      insufficient numbers of donor hearts, physicians and engineers are turning to      mechanical circulatory support in the form of ventricular assist devices (VADs).       Their clinical performance and increasing availability of various types, sizes,      and functions are increasing VAD recognition. However, for any implantable      medical device, especially one that is life supporting, performance and safety      must be evaluated both pre- and postmarket. It has been demonstrated that      specific pathology analysis can provide unique and important information to      augment the evaluation of performance and safety. To help ensure the safety and      efficacy of a device, we propose that regulatory agencies include pathology      analysis by experienced, independent pathologists with relevant expertise as an      integral component of device submissions. We believe that this analysis should      include both gross and microscopic components and, when warranted, supplementary       data obtained through radiography, electron microscopy, or both. The pathology      data acquired through these analyses should be correlated with clinical data to      yield a more thorough data set for submission to the governing regulatory body.      Submitting this coordinated analysis of data will demonstrate to regulatory      agencies (United States Food and Drug Administration, Therapeutic Goods      Administration, Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency, etc.) that the device      manufacturer shares their objective: making medical devices as safe and effective      as possible.
