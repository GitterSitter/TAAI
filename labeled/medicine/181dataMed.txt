As more centers adopt this technology, there      may be a need to transport these patients over long distances to facilitate      patient care and organ transplantation. Food and Drug Administration indications       for use state only that the patient must be a candidate for transplantation and      does not place restrictions on the transplant capabilities of the implanting      medical center. Nontransplanting institutions are able to use this technology      with a predetermined agreement to transfer the patient to a partnering transplant      center. We report the first two cases of interhospital air and ground transport      of nonambulatory or intubated pediatric (<13 kg) patients supported by Berlin      Heart EXCOR pediatric VADs and Ikus stationary drivers. We present our protocol      for transporting this delicate patient population. In addition, we discuss      important challenges encountered on these operations regarding vehicle transfers       and the management of vehicle power supply. These two cases demonstrate that the       transportation of pediatric patients on Berlin Heart VADs is feasible and safe      and should be considered a treatment option in certain situations.FAU - Woolley, Joshua RAU  - Woolley JRAD  - Artificial Heart Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh,      PA, USA.FAU - Dady, SarahAU  - Dady SFAU - Spinnato, JeromeAU  - Spinnato JFAU - Sanchez-de-Toledo, JoanAU  - Sanchez-de-Toledo JFAU - Miller, EmilyAU  - Miller EFAU - Morelli, BrianAU  - Morelli BFAU - Winowich, StephenAU  - Winowich SFAU - Wearden, Peter DAU  - Wearden PDLA  - engGR  - R01 HL089456-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32-HL076124/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - ASAIO JJT  - ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)JID - 9204109SB  - IMMH  - Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*therapyMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart TransplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - InfantMH  - *Transportation of PatientsMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/therapyEDAT- 2013/09/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/03 06:00AID - 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829e66d7 [doi]AID - 00002480-201309000-00018 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - ASAIO J. 2013 Sep-Oct;59(5):537-41. doi: 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31829e66d7.- 23995998own - nlmstat- medlineda  - 20130902dcom- 20140425is  - 1538-943x (electronic)is  - 1058-2916 (linking)vi  - 59ip  - 5dp  - 2013 sep-octti  - first berlin heart excor pediatric vad interhospital transports of nonambulatory       patients with the ikus stationary driver.pg  - 537-41lid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e31829e66d7 [doi]ab  - ventricular assist devices (vads) are increasingly being used in pediatric      patients to support cardiac failure. as more centers adopt this technology, there      may be a need to transport these patients over long distances to facilitate      patient care and organ transplantation. food and drug administration indications       for use state only that the patient must be a candidate for transplantation and      does not place restrictions on the transplant capabilities of the implanting      medical center. nontransplanting institutions are able to use this technology      with a predetermined agreement to transfer the patient to a partnering transplant      center. we report the first two cases of interhospital air and ground transport      of nonambulatory or intubated pediatric (<13 kg) patients supported by berlin      heart excor pediatric vads and ikus stationary drivers. we present our protocol      for transporting this delicate patient population. in addition, we discuss      important challenges encountered on these operations regarding vehicle transfers       and the management of vehicle power supply. these two cases demonstrate that the       transportation of pediatric patients on berlin heart vads is feasible and safe      and should be considered a treatment option in certain situations.fau - woolley, joshua rau  - woolley jrad  - artificial heart program, university of pittsburgh medical center, pittsburgh,      pa, usa.fau - dady, sarahau  - dady sfau - spinnato, jeromeau  - spinnato jfau - sanchez-de-toledo, joanau  - sanchez-de-toledo jfau - miller, emilyau  - miller efau - morelli, brianau  - morelli bfau - winowich, stephenau  - winowich sfau - wearden, peter dau  - wearden pdla  - enggr  - r01 hl089456-01/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statesgr  - t32-hl076124/hl/nhlbi nih hhs/united statespt  - case reportspt  - journal articlept  - research support, n.i.h., extramuralpl  - united statesta  - asaio jjt  - asaio journal (american society for artificial internal organs : 1992)jid - 9204109sb  - immh  - cardiomyopathy, dilated/*therapymh  - child, preschoolmh  - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/methodsmh  - femalemh  - heart failure/*therapymh  - heart transplantationmh  - *heart-assist devicesmh  - humansmh  - infantmh  - *transportation of patientsmh  - treatment outcomemh  - ventricular dysfunction, left/therapyedat- 2013/09/03 06:00mhda- 2014/04/26 06:00crdt- 2013/09/03 06:00aid - 10.1097/mat.0b013e31829e66d7 [doi]aid - 00002480-201309000-00018 [pii]pst - ppublishso  - asaio j. 2013 sep-oct;59(5):537-41. doi: 10.1097/mat.0b013e31829e66d7.
