In selected patients, these improvements are\r\n      sufficient to allow ultimate device explantation without requiring\r\n      transplantation; this represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of\r\n      heart failure. Like heart failure itself, LVADs influence multiple biological\r\n      systems. The transverse tubules are a system of membrane invaginations in\r\n      ventricular cardiomyocytes which allow rapid propagation of the action potential \r\n      throughout the cell. Through their dense concentration of L-type Ca2+ channels in\r\n      close proximity with intracellular Ryanodine receptors, the t-tubules enable\r\n      synchronous Ca2+ release throughout the cell. The t-tubules\' structure appears to\r\n      be specifically regulated by mechanical load, such that either the overload of\r\n      heart failure (or the spontaneously hypertensive rat model (Song et al., 2006))\r\n      or the profound unloading in a chronically unloaded heart result in impaired\r\n      t-tubule structure, with ineffective Ca2+ release. While there are multiple\r\n      molecular pathways which underpin t-tubule regulation, Tcap appears to be\r\n      important in regulating the effect of altered loading on the t-tubule system.\r\n      This article is protected by copyright.

The scarcity of the gold\r\n      standard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.\r\n      For patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been of\r\n      great benefit on survival. To allow explantation of the assist device and obviate\r\n      heart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.\r\n      However, explant rates so far are low. Combining mechanical circulatory support\r\n      with regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might \r\n      give rise to improved long-term results. Although synergistic effects are\r\n      suggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in both\r\n      preclinical and clinical setting is lacking. This review focuses on advanced and \r\n      innovative strategies for the treatment of end-stage HF and furthermore appraises\r\n      clinical experience with combined strategies.\r\nFAU - Tseng, Cheyenne C S\r\nAU  - Tseng CC\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands ; Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Ramjankhan, Faiz Z\r\nAU  - Ramjankhan FZ\r\nAD  - Department of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, Division Heart and Lungs, University\r\n      Medical Center , Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nFAU - de Jonge, Nicolaas\r\nAU  - de Jonge N\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Chamuleau, Steven A J\r\nAU  - Chamuleau SA\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center ,\r\n      Utrecht , Netherlands.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Review\r\nDEP - 20150407\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Surg\r\nJT  - Frontiers in surgery\r\nJID - 101645127\r\nPMC - PMC4387859\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4387859\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - cardiac recovery\r\nOT  - cell therapy\r\nOT  - heart failure\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory support\r\nOT  - regenerative therapies\r\nOT  - ventricular-assist device\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/24 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/24 06:01\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/24 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015 [ecollection]\r\nPHST- 2014/11/02 [received]\r\nPHST- 2015/03/07 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/04/07 [epublish]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Surg. 2015 Apr 7;2:10. doi: 10.3389/fsurg.2015.00010. eCollection 2015.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25873821\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Data-Review\r\nDA  - 20150415\r\nLR  - 20150417\r\nIS  - 1526-6702 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0730-2347 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 42\r\nIP  - 2\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr\r\nTI  - Anthracycline treatment and ventricular remodeling in left ventricular assist\r\n      device patients.\r\nPG  - 124-30\r\nLID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509 [doi]\r\nAB  - Nonischemic cardiomyopathy can complicate antineoplastic therapy and lead to\r\n      irreversible heart failure. We evaluated structural changes at the time of left\r\n      ventricular assist device implantation in heart failure patients who had been\r\n      exposed to anthracycline, and we correlated those changes with clinical\r\n      presentation. We retrospectively studied left ventricular core samples taken at\r\n      implantation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device in 12 heart\r\n      failure patients (mean age, 46 +/- 16 yr) who had histories of anthracycline\r\n      exposure. We evaluated those samples for hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and fibrosis.\r\n      Histopathologic findings showed moderate-to-severe myocyte hypertrophy, moderate \r\n      myocytolysis, and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis with areas of\r\n      replacement fibrosis. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked decreases in\r\n      myofibrils, diffuse mitochondrial swelling, and disorganization of the\r\n      sarcoplasmic reticulum. The interval between anthracycline therapy and heart\r\n      failure was a mean of 6.8 +/- 5.7 years; duration of heart failure symptoms, 38\r\n      +/- 47 months; and duration of device support, 414 +/- 266 days. Four patients\r\n      are continuing on device support, 3 have undergone transplantation, 3 have\r\n      undergone device explantation, and 2 have died. The time of heart failure onset\r\n      and the duration of symptoms did not correlate with the severity and extent of\r\n      the histopathologic changes. The histopathologic findings and the clinical course\r\n      varied in heart failure patients with anthracycline exposure. No correlation was \r\n      observed between anthracycline therapy and the development or duration of heart\r\n      failure symptoms, severity of histopathologic changes, or outcomes.\r\nFAU - Segura, Ana Maria\r\nAU  - Segura AM\r\nFAU - Radovancevic, Rajko\r\nAU  - Radovancevic R\r\nFAU - Demirozu, Zumrat T\r\nAU  - Demirozu ZT\r\nFAU - Frazier, O H\r\nAU  - Frazier OH\r\nFAU - Buja, L Maximilian\r\nAU  - Buja LM\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20150401\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Tex Heart Inst J\r\nJT  - Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke\'s\r\n      Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children\'s Hospital\r\nJID - 8214622\r\nSB  - IM\r\nPMC - PMC4382876\r\nOID - NLM: PMC4382876\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Anthracyclines/adverse effects\r\nOT  - antineoplastic agents/adverse effects\r\nOT  - arrhythmias, cardiac/chemically induced\r\nOT  - cardiomyopathies/chemically induced\r\nOT  - congestive heart failure/chemically induced\r\nOT  - doxorubicin/toxicity\r\nOT  - heart-assist devices\r\nOT  - myocardium/pathology\r\nOT  - nonischemic cardiomyopathy\r\nOT  - retrospective studies\r\nOT  - ventricular remodeling\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/16 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/16 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/16 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015/04 [ecollection]\r\nPHST- 2015/04/01 [epublish]\r\nAID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Tex Heart Inst J. 2015 Apr 1;42(2):124-30. doi: 10.14503/THIJ-14-4509.\r\n      eCollection 2015 Apr.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25870363\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Data-Review\r\nDA  - 20150414\r\nIS  - 2150-136X (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2150-1351 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 6\r\nIP  - 2\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr\r\nTI  - Use of HeartWare Ventricular Assist System for Systemic Ventricular Support of a \r\n      Pediatric Patient After Mustard Procedure.\r\nPG  - 339-41\r\nLID - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System is indicated to provide\r\n      mechanical circulatory support of patients with intractable heart failure as a\r\n      bridge to cardiac transplantation. We describe the use of this device to support \r\n      the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York Heart\r\n      Association class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustard\r\n      procedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant. CASE REPORT: A\r\n      HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the left chest of a\r\n      16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presented with edema\r\n      and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia, and\r\n      pulmonary edema. RESULTS: The patient\'s edema and acute kidney injury resolved\r\n      after device placement. She was discharged home and successfully underwent device\r\n      removal with heart transplant five months later. CONCLUSION: The HeartWare device\r\n      may be used for extended support as a systemic RV in a pediatric patient. It is\r\n      feasible to consider using the device in this patient population.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2014.\r\nFAU - Kenleigh, Dorian\r\nAU  - Kenleigh D\r\nAD  - University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA\r\n      dorian-kenleigh@uiowa.edu.\r\nFAU - Edens, R Erik\r\nAU  - Edens RE\r\nAD  - Stead Family Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa Children\'s Hospital,\r\n      Iowa City, IA, USA.\r\nFAU - Bates, Michael J\r\nAU  - Bates MJ\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Ochsner Health System, New Orleans, LA,\r\n      USA.\r\nFAU - Turek, Joseph W\r\nAU  - Turek JW\r\nAD  - Division of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University of Iowa Children\'s Hospital,\r\n      Iowa City, IA, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg\r\nJT  - World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery\r\nJID - 101518415\r\nSB  - IM\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - adult congenital heart disease\r\nOT  - arterial switch operation\r\nOT  - artificial organs\r\nOT  - circulatory assist devices (LVAD, RVAD, BVAD, TAH)\r\nOT  - circulatory hemodynamics\r\nOT  - congenital heart disease\r\nOT  - congenital heart surgery\r\nOT  - heart\r\nOT  - heart failure\r\nOT  - pediatric\r\nOT  - transplantation\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/15 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/15 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/15 06:00\r\nAID - 6/2/339 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1177/2150135114563769 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg. 2015 Apr;6(2):339-41. doi:\r\n      10.1177/2150135114563769.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25865791\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150413\r\nLR  - 20150414\r\nIS  - 1525-1594 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0160-564X (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 10\r\nTI  - Clinical and Molecular Comparison of Pediatric and Adult Reverse Remodeling With \r\n      Ventricular Assist Devices.\r\nLID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]\r\nAB  - Ventricular assist device (VAD) support induces reverse remodeling of failing\r\n      myocardium that leads to occasional functional recovery of the adult heart. While\r\n      there have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage\r\n      cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has\r\n      increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the \r\n      setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardium\r\n      also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to\r\n      its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets \r\n      of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to\r\n      summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery\r\n      following VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric\r\n      myocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients.\r\n      Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions of\r\n      their cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of information\r\n      about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to\r\n      determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or\r\n      just recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult gene\r\n      expression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40\% of genes to be\r\n      oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.\r\n      These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling \r\n      specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical\r\n      strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation\r\n      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Weia, Benjamin C\r\nAU  - Weia BC\r\nAD  - Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.\r\nFAU - Adachi, Iki\r\nAU  - Adachi I\r\nFAU - Jacot, Jeffrey G\r\nAU  - Jacot JG\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150410\r\nTA  - Artif Organs\r\nJT  - Artificial organs\r\nJID - 7802778\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Bridge to recovery\r\nOT  - Gene expression\r\nOT  - Heart failure\r\nOT  - Pediatric cardiomyopathy\r\nOT  - Reverse remodeling\r\nOT  - Ventricular assist device\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1111/aor.12451 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/aor.12451.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25864509\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150413\r\nLR  - 20150414\r\nIS  - 1747-0803 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1747-079X (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 10\r\nTI  - Pediatric Quality of Life while Supported with a Ventricular Assist Device.\r\nLID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]\r\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have emerged as an important\r\n      treatment option for bridging pediatric patients with heart failure to\r\n      transplant. VADs have shown improved survival; however, the pediatric quality of \r\n      life (QoL) while on VAD support is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the QoL of our\r\n      pediatric patients while supported with a VAD. DESIGN: In this prospective study,\r\n      pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement, and their parents, were\r\n      administered a generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 pre-VAD\r\n      implant, when feasible, after the acute postoperative period, and then\r\n      periodically until heart transplant or death. Their final scores while on support\r\n      were compared with three previously reported groups: healthy controls,\r\n      outpatients with severe heart disease, and children after heart transplant.\r\n      RESULTS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 13 pediatric patients required VAD\r\n      support greater than 2 weeks and completed a PedsQL. The mean age at implant was \r\n      10.0 +/- 4.2 years and median duration of support was 1.6 (0.5-19.7) months.\r\n      Eleven (85\%) patients survived to transplant with one (8\%) patient remaining\r\n      alive on support. The median duration of support prior to their final PedsQL was \r\n      1.4 (0.5-11.4) months. Patients self-reported significantly (P < .05) lower total\r\n      and physical QoL scores when compared with all three comparison groups.\r\n      Self-reported psychosocial QoL scores were significantly lower than healthy\r\n      controls only. Parent proxy-reported scores were significantly lower than all\r\n      three comparison groups for all three categories (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A large \r\n      deficit exists in the total QoL of pediatric patients supported by a VAD compared\r\n      with outpatient management of severe heart disease or postheart transplant\r\n      patients; however, VAD patients do represent a group with more severe heart\r\n      failure. Improvements in QoL must be made, as time spent with a VAD will likely\r\n      continue to increase.\r\nCI  - (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Miller, Jacob R\r\nAU  - Miller JR\r\nAD  - Section of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of\r\n      Medicine, St. Louis, Mo, USA.\r\nFAU - Boston, Umar S\r\nAU  - Boston US\r\nFAU - Epstein, Deirdre J\r\nAU  - Epstein DJ\r\nFAU - Henn, Matthew C\r\nAU  - Henn MC\r\nFAU - Lawrance, Christopher P\r\nAU  - Lawrance CP\r\nFAU - Kallenbach, Jacob\r\nAU  - Kallenbach J\r\nFAU - Simpson, Kathleen E\r\nAU  - Simpson KE\r\nFAU - Canter, Charles E\r\nAU  - Canter CE\r\nFAU - Eghtesady, Pirooz\r\nAU  - Eghtesady P\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150410\r\nTA  - Congenit Heart Dis\r\nJT  - Congenital heart disease\r\nJID - 101256510\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Heart Failure\r\nOT  - Pediatric\r\nOT  - Quality of Life\r\nOT  - Ventricular Assist Device\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/14 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015/03/16 [accepted]\r\nAID - 10.1111/chd.12260 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Congenit Heart Dis. 2015 Apr 10. doi: 10.1111/chd.12260.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25841881\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150405\r\nLR  - 20150407\r\nIS  - 1861-0692 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1861-0684 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 5\r\nTI  - A single German center experience with intermittent inotropes for patients on the\r\n      high-urgent heart transplant waiting list.\r\nAB  - AIM: Currently, more than 900 patients with end-stage heart failure are listed\r\n      for heart transplantation in Germany. All patients on the Eurotransplant\r\n      high-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to be\r\n      relisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated with\r\n      tachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospective\r\n      analysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated with\r\n      intermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 117\r\n      consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at our intensive care heart failure \r\n      unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients (12 \%) were stabilized and\r\n      delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103 patients (age 42 +/- 15 years),\r\n      different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, noradrenaline,\r\n      levosimendan) were administered based on the patient\'s specific characteristics. \r\n      After initial recompensation, patients were weaned from inotropes as soon as\r\n      possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days) were given as a\r\n      predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 \%\r\n      of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropic support was necessary\r\n      due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 \%) needed a left- or\r\n      biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 \%) died while waiting and 87 (84 \%) \r\n      received heart transplants after 87 +/- 91 days. Cumulative 3 and 12 months\r\n      survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 \%, respectively. CONCLUSION:\r\n      Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as a bridge to\r\n      transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These data provide the\r\n      basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropes in patients\r\n      on the HU waiting list.\r\nFAU - Hubner, T\r\nAU  - Hubner T\r\nAD  - Medizinische Abteilung, Kliniken der Barmherzigen Schwestern, Krankenhaus\r\n      Neuwittelsbach, Renatastrasse 71a, 80639, Munich, Germany.\r\nFAU - Nickel, T\r\nAU  - Nickel T\r\nFAU - Steinbeck, G\r\nAU  - Steinbeck G\r\nFAU - Massberg, S\r\nAU  - Massberg S\r\nFAU - Schramm, R\r\nAU  - Schramm R\r\nFAU - Reichart, B\r\nAU  - Reichart B\r\nFAU - Hagl, C\r\nAU  - Hagl C\r\nFAU - Kiwi, A\r\nAU  - Kiwi A\r\nFAU - Weis, Michael\r\nAU  - Weis M\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150405\r\nTA  - Clin Res Cardiol\r\nJT  - Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society\r\nJID - 101264123\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/07 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/07 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/06 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015/01/22 [received]\r\nPHST- 2015/03/31 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/04/05 [aheadofprint]\r\nAID - 10.1007/s00392-015-0852-1 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Clin Res Cardiol. 2015 Apr 5.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25832983\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150402\r\nLR  - 20150404\r\nIS  - 1532-6551 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1071-3581 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr 2\r\nTI  - Imaging in patients after cardiac transplantation and in patients with\r\n      ventricular assist devices.\r\nAB  - The field of cardiac imaging and the management of patients with severe heart\r\n      failure have advanced substantially during the past 10 years. Cardiac\r\n      transplantation offers the best long-term survival with high quality of life for \r\n      the patients with end stage heart failure. However, acute cardiac rejection and\r\n      cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) can occur post cardiac transplantation and\r\n      these problems necessitate regular surveillance. The short-term success of\r\n      mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD), such as ventricular assist devices\r\n      (VADs), in improving survival and quality of life has led to a dramatic growth of\r\n      the patient population with these devices. The development of optimal imaging\r\n      techniques and algorithms to evaluate these advanced heart failure patients is\r\n      evolving and multimodality non-invasive imaging approaches and invasive\r\n      techniques are commonly employed. Most of the published studies done in the\r\n      transplant and VAD population are small, and biased based on the strength of the \r\n      particular program, and there is a relative lack of published protocols to\r\n      evaluate these patient groups. Moreover, the techniques of echocardiography,\r\n      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear cardiology have\r\n      all progressed rapidly in recent years. There is thus a knowledge gap for\r\n      cardiologists, radiologists, and clinicians, especially regarding surveillance\r\n      for CAV and ideal imaging approaches for patients with VADs. The purpose of this \r\n      review article is to provide an overview of different noninvasive imaging\r\n      modalities used to evaluate patients after cardiac transplantation and for\r\n      patients with VADs. The review focuses on the role of echocardiography, CT, and\r\n      nuclear imaging in surveillance for CAV and rejection and on the assessment of\r\n      ventricular structure and function, myocardial remodeling and complications for\r\n      VAD patients.\r\nFAU - Gupta, Bhanu\r\nAU  - Gupta B\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, St. Luke\'s Mid America Heart Institute, 4330 Wornall\r\n      Rd, Suite 2000, Kansas City, MO, USA.\r\nFAU - Jacob, Dany\r\nAU  - Jacob D\r\nFAU - Thompson, Randall\r\nAU  - Thompson R\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150402\r\nTA  - J Nucl Cardiol\r\nJT  - Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of\r\n      Nuclear Cardiology\r\nJID - 9423534\r\nEDAT- 2015/04/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/04/03 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/04/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2014/12/08 [received]\r\nPHST- 2015/01/29 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/04/02 [aheadofprint]\r\nAID - 10.1007/s12350-015-0115-6 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - J Nucl Cardiol. 2015 Apr 2.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25824553\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150331\r\nLR  - 20150401\r\nIS  - 1557-3117 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1053-2498 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Jan 16\r\nTI  - Regional differences in use and outcomes of left ventricular assist devices:\r\n      Insights from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory\r\n      Support Registry.\r\nLID - S1053-2498(15)00009-1 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.healun.2015.01.007 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: We examined whether characteristics, implant strategy, and outcomes\r\n      in patients who receive continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD)\r\n      differ across geographic regions in the United States. METHODS: A total of 7,404 \r\n      CF-LVAD patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted\r\n      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) from 134 participating institutions were analyzed\r\n      from 4 distinct regions: Northeast, 2,605 (35\%); Midwest, 2,210 (30\%); West, 973 \r\n      (13\%); and South, 1,616 (22\%). RESULTS: At baseline, patients in the Northeast\r\n      and South were more likely to have INTERMACS risk profiles 1 and 2. A\r\n      bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy was more common in the Northeast (31.7\%;\r\n      West, 18.5\%; South, 26.9\%; Midwest, 25.5\%; p < 0.0001). In contrast, destination \r\n      therapy (DT) was more likely in the South (40.6\%; Northeast, 32.3\%; Midwest,\r\n      27.3\%; West, 27.3\%; p < 0.0001). Although all regions showed a high 1-year\r\n      survival rate, some regional differences in long-term mortality were observed.\r\n      Notably, survival beyond 1 year after LVAD implant was significantly lower in the\r\n      South. However, when stratified by device strategy, no significant differences in\r\n      survival for BTT or DT patients were found among the regions. Finally, with the\r\n      exception of right ventricular failure, which was more common in the South, no\r\n      other significant differences in causes of death were observed among the regions.\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in clinical profile and LVAD strategy exist in \r\n      the United States. Despite an overall high survival rate at 1 year, differences\r\n      in mortality among the regions were noted. The lower survival rate in the South\r\n      may be attributed to patient characteristics and higher use of LVAD as DT.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, it can be used as a\r\n      bridging to myocardial recovery and explantation. The number of implantations of \r\n      left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) has clearly increased in recent years and \r\n      approximately one half of these implantations is already carried out in centers\r\n      not specialized in transplantations.

The aim of this article is to develop and test a\r\n      lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system simulating and comparing the \r\n      VAD effects on failing Fontan. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data of 10\r\n      Fontan patients were used to simulate the baseline patients\' condition using a\r\n      dedicated lumped parameter model. Starting from the simulated baseline and for\r\n      each patient, a systolic dysfunction, a diastolic dysfunction, and an increment\r\n      of the pulmonary vascular resistance were simulated. Then, for each patient and\r\n      for each pathology, the RVAD, LVAD, and BIVAD implantations were simulated. The\r\n      model can reproduce patients\' baseline well. In the case of systolic dysfunction,\r\n      the LVAD unloads the single ventricle and increases the cardiac output (CO) (35\%)\r\n      and the arterial systemic pressure (Pas) (25\%). With RVAD, a decrement of\r\n      inferior vena cava pressure (Pvci) (39\%) was observed with 34\% increment of CO,\r\n      but an increment of the single ventricle external work (SVEW). With the BIVAD, an\r\n      increment of Pas (29\%) and CO (37\%) was observed. In the case of diastolic\r\n      dysfunction, the LVAD increases CO (42\%) and the RVAD decreases the Pvci, while\r\n      both increase the SVEW. In the case of pulmonary vascular resistance increment,\r\n      the highest CO (50\%) and Pas (28\%) increment is obtained with an RVAD with the\r\n      highest decrement of Pvci (53\%) and an increment of the SVEW but with the lowest \r\n      VAD power consumption. The use of numerical models could be helpful in this\r\n      innovative field to evaluate the effect of VAD implantation on Fontan patients to\r\n      support patient and VAD type selection personalizing the assistance.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation\r\n      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Di Molfetta, Arianna\r\nAU  - Di Molfetta A\r\nAD  - Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Clinical Physiology-CNR,\r\n      Rome, Italy.\r\nFAU - Amodeo, Antonio\r\nAU  - Amodeo A\r\nFAU - Fresiello, Libera\r\nAU  - Fresiello L\r\nFAU - Trivella, Maria Giovanna\r\nAU  - Trivella MG\r\nFAU - Iacobelli, Roberta\r\nAU  - Iacobelli R\r\nFAU - Pilati, Mara\r\nAU  - Pilati M\r\nFAU - Ferrari, Gianfranco\r\nAU  - Ferrari G\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150321\r\nTA  - Artif Organs\r\nJT  - Artificial organs\r\nJID - 7802778\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Fontan failure\r\nOT  - Lumped parameter models\r\nOT  - Ventricular assist devices\r\nEDAT- 2015/03/27 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/03/27 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/03/27 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1111/aor.12434 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Mar 21. doi: 10.1111/aor.12434.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25796280\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20150323\r\nIS  - 0030-6002 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0030-6002 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 156\r\nIP  - 13\r\nDP  - 2015 Mar 29\r\nTI  - [Mechanical circulatory support saves lives - three years\' experience of the\r\n      newly established assist device program at Semmelweis University].\r\nPG  - 521-7\r\nLID - 10.1556/OH.2015.30115 [doi]\r\nAB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the first heart\r\n      transplantation in Hungary in 2012 the emerging need for modern heart failure\r\n      management via mechanical circulatory support has evolved. In May 2012 the\r\n      opening of a new heart failure and transplant unit with 9 beds together with the \r\n      procurement of necessary devices at Semmelweis University accomplished this need.\r\n      AIM: The aim of the authors was to report their initial experience obtained in\r\n      this new cardiac assist device program. METHOD: Since May, 2012, mechanical\r\n      circulatory support system was applied in 89 cases in 72 patients. Indication for\r\n      support were end stage heart failure refractory to medical treatment and acute\r\n      left or right heart failure. RESULTS: Treatment was initiated for acute graft\r\n      failure after heart transplantation in 27 cases, for end stage heart failure in\r\n      24 cases, for acute myocardial infarction in 21 cases, for acute postcardiotomy\r\n      heart failure in 14 cases, for severe respiratory insufficiency in 2 cases and\r\n      for drug intoxication in one case. Among the 30 survivor of the whole program 13 \r\n      patients were successfully transplanted. CONCLUSIONS: The available devices can\r\n      cover all modalities of current bridge therapy from short term support through\r\n      medium support to heart transplantation or long term support and destination\r\n      therapy. These conditions made possible the successful start of a new cardiac\r\n      assist device program.\r\nFAU - Fazekas, Levente\r\nAU  - Fazekas L\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Sax, Balazs\r\nAU  - Sax B\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Hartyanszky, Istvan\r\nAU  - Hartyanszky I\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Polos, Miklos\r\nAU  - Polos M\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Horkay, Ferenc\r\nAU  - Horkay F\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Varga, Tamas\r\nAU  - Varga T\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Racz, Kristof\r\nAU  - Racz K\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Nemeth, Endre\r\nAU  - Nemeth E\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Szekely, Andrea\r\nAU  - Szekely A\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Paulovich, Erzsebet\r\nAU  - Paulovich E\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv\r\n      Terapias Klinika Budapest.\r\nFAU - Heltai, Krisztina\r\nAU  - Heltai K\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Zima, Endre\r\nAU  - Zima E\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Szabolcs, Zoltan\r\nAU  - Szabolcs Z\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nFAU - Merkely, Bela\r\nAU  - Merkely B\r\nAD  - Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar Varosmajori Sziv- es\r\n      Ergyogyaszati Klinika Budapest Varosmajor u. 68. 1122.\r\nLA  - hun\r\nPT  - English Abstract\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nTT  - A mechanikus keringestamogatas eletet ment - a muszivprogram elso harom evenek\r\n      tapasztalata a Semmelweis Egyetemen.\r\nPL  - Hungary\r\nTA  - Orv Hetil\r\nJT  - Orvosi hetilap\r\nJID - 0376412\r\nSB  - IM\r\nOAB - Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher.\r\nOABL- hun\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - ECMO\r\nOT  - VAD\r\nOT  - heart transplantation\r\nOT  - mechanical circulatory support\r\nOT  - mechanikus keringestamogatas\r\nOT  - musziv\r\nOT  - szivtranszplantacio\r\nEDAT- 2015/03/23 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/03/23 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/03/23 06:00\r\nAID - 807388U251140873 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1556/OH.2015.30115 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Orv Hetil. 2015 Mar 29;156(13):521-7. doi: 10.1556/OH.2015.30115.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25773536\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nDA  - 20150501\r\nLR  - 20150501\r\nIS  - 1399-0012 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0902-0063 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2015 Mar 13\r\nTI  - Clinical outcomes in sensitized heart transplant patients bridged with\r\n      ventricular assist devices.\r\nLID - 10.1111/ctr.12540 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to transplant\r\n      (BTT) have been known to cause allosensitization, as measured by panel-reactive\r\n      antibody (PRA) levels. The goal of this study was to measure the impact of this\r\n      allosensitization on outcomes. METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed\r\n      in BTT patients, with sensitization defined as peak PRAs >/= 10\%. Baseline\r\n      characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using\r\n      descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. RESULTS:\r\n      Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21\r\n      non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47\% vs. 10\%, p = \r\n      0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular\r\n      rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).\r\n      Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection\r\n      (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier\r\n      log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of \r\n      infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9\% vs. 19.0\%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION:\r\n      Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. This mortality\r\n      appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the\r\n      development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.\r\nCI  - (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, little is known on the impact of\r\n      continuous-flow LVADs on the vascular supply of the colon for anastomoses. In\r\n      this case, a 67-year-old male supported on an LVAD underwent four successful\r\n      noncardiac operations including two intestinal anastomoses; left colon and small \r\n      bowel anastomosis. To the best of our knowledge, no existing literature has\r\n      reported successful colonic anastomosis on a continuous-flow LVAD. This case\r\n      illustrates the plausibility of performing colonic anastomoses with appropriately\r\n      selected patients supported on an LVAD. A 67-year-old male with congestive heart \r\n      failure underwent LVAD placement for decompensated heart failure while awaiting\r\n      orthotopic transplantation. During his recovery, he developed a stage IV sacral\r\n      decubitus ulcer which required a sigmoid loop colostomy placement and a\r\n      rotational flap. Subsequent stoma closure with partial sigmoid colectomy and\r\n      stapled anastomosis was performed, and healed without evidence of anastomotic\r\n      leak. This case illustrates the potential for colonic anastomoses for patients on\r\n      continuous-flow LVAD support. Although oxygenation is known to be an important\r\n      aspect of healing, this patient\'s outcome suggests that intestinal anastomoses\r\n      can be performed on the induced pulseless environment of an LVAD. Further studies\r\n      will be needed to further elucidate the success of longer segment resections and \r\n      appropriate surgical candidates.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015.

As the availability of LVADs for advanced\r\n      heart failure has expanded to nontransplantation mechanical circulatory support\r\n      centers, concerns have been expressed about maintaining good outcomes.\r\n      Demographics and outcomes were evaluated in 276 patients with advanced heart\r\n      failure who underwent implantation of LVADs as bridge to transplantation or\r\n      destination therapy at 27 open-heart centers. Baseline characteristics, operative\r\n      mortality, length of stay, readmission rate, adverse events, quality of life, and\r\n      survival were analyzed. The overall 30-day mortality was 3\% (8 of 276), and\r\n      survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were 92 +/- 2\%, 88 +/- 3\%, \r\n      and 84 +/- 4\% for the bridge-to-transplantation group and 81 +/- 3\%, 70 +/- 5\%,\r\n      and 63 +/- 6\% for the destination therapy group, comparable with results\r\n      published by the national Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted\r\n      Circulatory Support (INTERMACS). The median length of stay for all patients was\r\n      21 days. Bleeding was the most frequent adverse event. Stroke occurred in 4\%\r\n      (bridge to transplantation) and 6\% (destination therapy) of patients.\r\n      Quality-of-life measures and 6-minute walk distances showed sustained\r\n      improvements throughout support. In conclusion, outcomes with LVAD support at\r\n      open-heart centers are acceptable and comparable with results from the INTERMACS \r\n      registry. With appropriate teams, training, center commitment, and certification,\r\n      LVAD therapy is being disseminated in a responsible way to open-heart centers.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: The HMRS has been shown to\r\n      correlate with mortality in the cohort of patients enrolled in the Heartmate II\r\n      trials, but its validity in unselected, \"real world\" populations remains unclear.\r\n      METHODS: This study identified a cohort of 269 consecutive patients who received \r\n      a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device at our institution, the\r\n      Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, between June 2005 and June 2013.\r\n      Ninety-day and 2-year mortality rates, as well as frequency of several morbid\r\n      events, were compared by retrospectively assigned HMRS category groups. The\r\n      analysis was repeated within the subgroup of INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for \r\n      Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) class 1 patients. RESULTS: Receiver\r\n      operating curve analysis showed that the HMRS correlated with 90-day mortality\r\n      with an area under the curve of 0.70. Stratification in low, mid, and high HMRS\r\n      groups identified patients with increasing hazard of 90-day mortality, increasing\r\n      long-term mortality, increasing rate of gastrointestinal bleeding events, and\r\n      increasing median number of days spent in the hospital in the first year post\r\n      implant. Within INTERMACS class 1 patients, those in the highest HMRS group were \r\n      found to have a relative risk of 90-day mortality 5.7 times higher than those in \r\n      the lowest HMRS group (39.1\% vs. 6.9\%, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: HMRS is a valid\r\n      clinical tool to stratify risk of morbidity and mortality after implant of\r\n      Heartmate II devices in unselected patients and can be used to predict short-term\r\n      mortality risk in INTERMACS class 1 patients.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

BACKGROUND: CF-LVADs have become\r\n      mainstream therapy for patients with advanced heart failure. Thromboembolic\r\n      events, device thrombosis, and bleeding continue to be a challenge with this\r\n      technology. Adequate anticoagulation is required to prevent these adverse events.\r\n      METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive patients implanted with a CF-LVAD was\r\n      conducted. Paired samples were considered concordant if aPTT values fell into\r\n      expected ranges for subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic anti-FXa\r\n      levels. Heparin dosing was on the basis of anti-Xa levels. RESULTS: A total of\r\n      340 paired values from 38 patients were evaluated. Anti-FXa and aPTT were\r\n      discordant in 253 samples (74.4\%), with a high degree of variability in aPTT for \r\n      any given anti-FXa level (r(2) = 0.57). Results were discordant in 104 samples\r\n      (63.8\%) from patients undergoing bridging therapy with warfarin and in 149\r\n      samples (84.2\%) from patients with device obstruction and/or hemolysis (p <\r\n      0.001). The most common pattern of discordance was a supratherapeutic aPTT value \r\n      despite a therapeutic anti-FXa level (49.1\% for bridging vs. 75.8\% for device\r\n      obstruction and/or hemolysis; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of aPTT were\r\n      disproportionately prolonged relative to the corresponding anti-FXa levels in\r\n      CF-LVAD patients, particularly those with device obstruction. Hemolysis and\r\n      warfarin administration may falsely elevate aPTT, resulting in overestimation of \r\n      heparin concentration and under-anticoagulation. Use of aPTT and anti-FXa to\r\n      guide heparin therapy may lead to different estimates of heparin concentration in\r\n      the same patient.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were\r\n      implanted with a CF-LVAD between January 2008 and June 2014. Eighty-five patients\r\n      were implanted with the device as a bridge to transplant (BTT); the remaining (n \r\n      = 43) were on destination therapy (DT). Each group was divided into patients <65 \r\n      years old and >/=65 years old at device implantation. Patients were followed up\r\n      for at least 24 months or until transplant or death. RESULTS: Eighty-five\r\n      patients (66\%) received a CF-LVAD as BTT. Patients >/=65 years old (n = 8) had a \r\n      lower preoperative cardiac index and prothrombin time-international normalized\r\n      ratio (P = 0.009), and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (P = 0.008).\r\n      Adverse events including infections, re-exploration for bleeding, ischaemic and\r\n      haemorrhagic stroke, renal failure and right heart failure were comparable in\r\n      both age groups. Eighty-two percent (n = 63) of the young patients and 75\% (n =\r\n      6) of the older patients, who were on LVAD as BTT, underwent heart transplant\r\n      within the first 24 months of LVAD implantation. Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and\r\n      24 months were 95, 95, 77 and 70\%, respectively, post-CF-LVAD implantation as BTT\r\n      for the younger group and 73\% for the older group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P =\r\n      0.35). Forty-three patients (34\%) received a CF-LVAD as DT. Patients >/=65 years \r\n      old (n = 14) on DT had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular disease (P =\r\n      0.048), higher serum sodium (P = 0.004) and serum creatinine values (P = 0.002), \r\n      preoperatively. There were more strokes in the older patients post-LAVD\r\n      implantation (14 vs 0\%; P = 0.048). Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months\r\n      were 85, 79, 75 and 62\%, respectively, for the younger group and 93, 77, 67 and\r\n      34\% for the older group, respectively (P = 0.26). CONCLUSION: This study\r\n      demonstrates that LVAD therapy can be used in the older patients with acceptable \r\n      mortality and morbidity, and age alone should not be used as the sole criterion\r\n      for exclusion from LVAD implantation.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2015.

Although the reference standard for\r\n      treatment of advanced heart failure remains cardiac transplantation, the\r\n      increasing shortage of donor organs and the unsuitability of many patients for\r\n      transplantation surgery has led to a search for alternative therapies. One such\r\n      therapy is mechanical circulatory support, which helps relieve the load on the\r\n      ventricle and thereby allows it to recover function. In addition, there is\r\n      increasing evidence supporting the use of mechanical devices as a bridge to\r\n      recovery in patients with acute refractory heart failure. In this article, the\r\n      imaging evaluation of various commonly used short- and long-term cardiac assist\r\n      devices is discussed, and their relevant mechanisms of action and physiology are \r\n      described. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), plays a crucial role\r\n      in preoperative evaluation for assessment of candidacy for implantation of a left\r\n      ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH). Also,\r\n      echocardiography and CT are indispensable in assessment of complications\r\n      associated with cardiac devices. Complications commonly associated with\r\n      short-term assist devices include bleeding and malpositioning, whereas long-term \r\n      devices such as LVADs may be associated with infection, pump thrombosis, and\r\n      cannula malfunction, as well as bleeding. CT is also commonly performed for\r\n      preoperative planning before LVAD or TAH explantation, replacement of a device or\r\n      one of its components, and cardiac transplantation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2012 through\r\n      July 2013, we conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews with caregivers of\r\n      patients considering DT LVAD. Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and\r\n      deductive approach. We interviewed 17 caregivers: 10 caregivers of patients\r\n      living with DT LVAD, 6 caregivers of patients who had died with DT LVAD, and 1\r\n      caregiver of a patient who had declined DT LVAD. The themes identified, which\r\n      could also be considered dialectical tensions, are broadly interpreted under 3\r\n      domains mapping to decision context, process, and outcome: (1) the stark decision\r\n      context, with tension between hope and reality; (2) the challenging decision\r\n      process, with tension between wanting loved ones to live and wanting to respect\r\n      loved ones\' wishes; and (3) the downstream decision outcome, with tension between\r\n      gratitude and burden. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making surrounding DT LVAD should\r\n      incorporate decision support for patients and caregivers.

The current generation of left ventricular assist devices \r\n      (LVADs), as compared with older devices, is characterized by improved\r\n      technologies and reduced size. The result is that minimally invasive surgery is\r\n      now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange of LVADs. Minimally\r\n      invasive procedures improve surgical outcome; for example, they lower the rates\r\n      of operative complications (such as bleeding or wound infection). The\r\n      miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive techniques\r\n      will be used for most implantations in the future. In this article, we summarize \r\n      and describe minimally invasive state-of-the-art implantation techniques, with a \r\n      focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation\r\n      and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\r\nFAU - Rojas, Sebastian V\r\nAU  - Rojas SV\r\nAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation, and Vascular Surgery, Hannover\r\n      Medical School, Hannover, Germany.\r\nFAU - Avsar, Murat\r\nAU  - Avsar M\r\nFAU - Hanke, Jasmin S\r\nAU  - Hanke JS\r\nFAU - Khalpey, Zain\r\nAU  - Khalpey Z\r\nFAU - Maltais, Simon\r\nAU  - Maltais S\r\nFAU - Haverich, Axel\r\nAU  - Haverich A\r\nFAU - Schmitto, Jan D\r\nAU  - Schmitto JD\r\nLA  - ENG\r\nPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLE\r\nDEP - 20150304\r\nTA  - Artif Organs\r\nJT  - Artificial organs\r\nJID - 7802778\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Cardiac surgery\r\nOT  - Left ventricular assist device\r\nOT  - Minimally invasive surgery\r\nEDAT- 2015/03/05 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/03/05 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2015/03/05 06:00\r\nAID - 10.1111/aor.12422 [doi]\r\nPST - aheadofprint\r\nSO  - Artif Organs. 2015 Mar 4. doi: 10.1111/aor.12422.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25732410\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- In-Process\r\nDA  - 20150323\r\nIS  - 1744-8344 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1477-9072 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 13\r\nIP  - 4\r\nDP  - 2015 Apr\r\nTI  - Current approaches to device implantation in pediatric and congenital heart\r\n      disease patients.\r\nPG  - 417-27\r\nLID - 10.1586/14779072.2015.1021786 [doi]\r\nAB  - The pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) has recently shown substantial\r\n      improvements in survival as a bridge to heart transplant for patients with\r\n      end-stage heart failure.

These challenges are \r\n      amplified by the uniqueness of each patient, the recent abundance of literature\r\n      surrounding VAD use as well as the technological advancements in the devices\r\n      themselves.

As microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in\r\n      remodeling processes, a comparative miRNA profiling in transplanted hearts of HF \r\n      patients with/without LVAD assistance could aid to comprehend underlying\r\n      molecular mechanisms. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze miRNA \r\n      differential expression in left ventricles of HF patients who underwent heart\r\n      transplantation directly (n = 9) or following a period of LVAD support (n = 8).\r\n      After data validation by quantitative real-time PCR, association with functional \r\n      clinical parameters was investigated. Bioinformatics\' tools were then used for\r\n      prediction of putative targets of modulated miRNAs and relative pathway\r\n      enrichment. The analysis revealed 13 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs in\r\n      failing hearts subjected to LVAD assistance. In particular, the expression level \r\n      of some of them (miR-338-3p, miR-142-5p and -3p, miR-216a-5p, miR-223-3p,\r\n      miR-27a-5p, and miR-378g) showed correlation with off-pump cardiac index values. \r\n      Predicted targets of these miRNAs were involved in focal adhesion/integrin\r\n      pathway and in actin cytoskeleton regulation.

Because very few data exist examining the influence of significant\r\n      pre-operative MR on outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\r\n      implantation, we evaluate our experience. METHODS: Between October 1996 and\r\n      August 2013, 756 patients underwent primary LVAD implantation at our\r\n      institutions. Of these, 508 patients received a continuous-flow LVAD and\r\n      represent the contemporary cohort for this analysis. Devices implanted included\r\n      the HeartMate II in 410 patients (81\%) and HeartWare HVAD in 98 patients (19\%).\r\n      Based on availability of pre-operative echocardiography, 491 patients were\r\n      divided into 2 study groups according to degree of pre-operative MR; 189 patients\r\n      (39\%) had moderate to severe or greater MR (MR group), and 302 (61\%) had less\r\n      than moderate to severe MR (less MR group). Median age at operation (60 years in \r\n      MR group vs 58 years in less MR group, p = 0.19), male sex (78\% in MR group vs\r\n      81\% in less MR group, p = 0.42), and ischemic etiology (46\% in MR group vs 51\% in\r\n      less MR group, p = 0.35) were similar between groups. RESULTS: There were 40\r\n      early deaths (7.9\%), and follow-up was available in all 468 early survivors for\r\n      641 patient-years of support. Patients in the MR group had higher late survival\r\n      (2 years, 75\%; 4 years, 65\%) compared with patients in the less MR group (2\r\n      years, 66\%; 4 years, 48\%; p < 0.04). Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the\r\n      independent interaction between MR and late survival (hazard ratio 0.62, p =\r\n      0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was improved survival in patients with severe\r\n      pre-operative MR after continuous-flow LVAD implantation in our cohort. These\r\n      findings may lend insight into the possible lack of value of addressing\r\n      significant MR at the time of LVAD implantation.\r\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\r\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were eligible for HTx, median age 11.7\r\n      years [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 3.0-14.7]. In 18 patients, (42\%) a VAD was\r\n      implanted, 11 (61\%) survived to HTx (n = 9) or recovery (n = 2). Techniques and\r\n      devices used were left ventricular assist device (n = 16, 89\%), in 4 cases\r\n      preceded by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and biventricular assist \r\n      device (n = 2, 11\%), both preceded by ECMO. In the VAD group, median time to\r\n      death (n = 7) was 18 days (IQR 7-75), median time to HTx (n = 9) 66 days (IQR\r\n      33-223) and 2 patients recovered after 30 and 308 days. The main cause of death\r\n      on MCS was neurological injury in 4 patients (22\%) and systemic thrombo-embolic\r\n      events in 2 (11\%). The most common serious adverse events included confirmed\r\n      thrombus requiring pump replacement (in 11 patients, 61\%) and pericardial\r\n      effusion leading to rethoracotomy (in 5 patients, 28\%). Compared with the era\r\n      before MCS (1998-2006), waiting list mortality decreased from 44 to 21\%, and is\r\n      now mainly related to complications of VAD support. CONCLUSIONS: Since the\r\n      introduction of MCS-VAD, waiting list mortality halved and more children with\r\n      end-stage heart failure survived to heart transplantation, thus improving\r\n      outcome. Although there is substantial mortality and morbidity, overall mortality\r\n      decreases, making MCS-VAD an essential therapeutic tool. The need for donor\r\n      organs remains critically urgent.\r\nCI  - (c) The Author 2015.
