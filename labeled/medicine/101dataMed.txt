We sought to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and short- and      long-term all-cause mortality of patients with AKI following VAD implantation.      METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent VAD implantation at the      University of Chicago between January 1, 2008, and January 31, 2012. We evaluated      the incidence of AKI, defined as a >/=50\% increase in serum creatinine over the      first 7 postoperative days (RIFLE Risk-Creatinine). A logistic regression model      was used to identify risk factors for the development of AKI, and a Cox      proportional hazards model was used to examine factors associated with 30-day and      365-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 157 eligible patients had VAD      implantations with 44 (28\%) developing postimplantation AKI. In a multivariate      analysis, only diabetes mellitus [odds ratio = 2.25 (1.03-4.94), p = 0.04] was      identified as a significant predictor of postoperative AKI. Using a multivariable      model censored for heart transplantation, only AKI [hazard ratio, HR = 3.01      (1.15-7.92), p = 0.03] and cardiopulmonary bypass time [HR = 1.01 (1.001-1.02), p      = 0.02] were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Preoperative body mass      index [HR = 0.95 (0.90-0.99), p = 0.03], preoperative diabetes mellitus [HR =      1.89 (1.07-3.35), p = 0.03] and postimplantation AKI [HR = 1.85 (1.06-3.21), p =       0.03] independently predicted 365-day mortality. CONCLUSION: AKI is common      following VAD implantation and is an independent predictor of 30-day and 1-year      all-cause mortality.FAU - Naik, AbhijitAU  - Naik AAD  - Section of Nephrology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill., USA.FAU - Akhter, Shahab AAU  - Akhter SAFAU - Fedson, SavitriAU  - Fedson SFAU - Jeevanandam, ValluvanAU  - Jeevanandam VFAU - Rich, Jonathan DAU  - Rich JDFAU - Koyner, Jay LAU  - Koyner JLLA  - engGR  - K23 DK081616/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K23 DK081616/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - L30 DK084760/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov\tDEP - 20140215PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Am J NephrolJT  - American journal of nephrologyJID - 8109361RN  - AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)SB  - IMMH  - Acute Kidney Injury/*complications/*mortalityMH  - AgedMH  - Cardiopulmonary BypassMH  - Creatinine/bloodMH  - Diabetes MellitusMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart Failure/*complications/*mortality/therapyMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - Kidney Failure, Chronic/*complications/*mortalityMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - Postoperative PeriodMH  - Proportional Hazards ModelsMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Time FactorsPMC - PMC4000722MID - NIHMS559256OID - NLM: NIHMS559256OID - NLM: PMC4000722EDAT- 2014/02/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/02/22 06:00PHST- 2013/08/13 [received]PHST- 2014/01/03 [accepted]PHST- 2014/02/15 [aheadofprint]AID - 000358495 [pii]AID - 10.1159/000358495 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Nephrol. 2014;39(3):195-203. doi: 10.1159/000358495.
