At present, heart transplantation (HTx) is the only definitive therapy known to      save such patients. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been employed      for patients presenting with acute deterioration of chronic heart failure as a      bridge to transplantation when early HTx is not feasible. LVAD implantation in      postoperative cases and/or in patients with dextrocardia is often difficult      because of the complex anatomy. We report the case of a 26-year-old male patient       with CCTGA who presented with heart failure after a conventional Rastelli      operation and in whom paracorporeal LVAD implantation was undertaken for the      management of right (systemic) ventricular failure. The patient recovered from      the heart failure and remained on the HTx list for approximately 4 years with      LVAD support.FAU - Inoue, TakafumiAU  - Inoue TAD  - Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo,      Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan, takainoue-tky@umin.ac.jp.FAU - Nishimura, TakashiAU  - Nishimura TFAU - Murakami, ArataAU  - Murakami AFAU - Kinoshita, OsamuAU  - Kinoshita OFAU - Kyo, ShuneiAU  - Kyo SFAU - Ono, MinoruAU  - Ono MLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130706PL  - JapanTA  - J Artif OrgansJT  - Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for      Artificial OrgansJID - 9815648RN  - Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteriesSB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Heart Failure/*therapyMH  - Heart Valve ProsthesisMH  - Heart Valve Prosthesis ImplantationMH  - *Heart-Assist DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Postoperative Complications/*therapyMH  - Transposition of Great Vessels/*surgeryMH  - Tricuspid ValveMH  - Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency/surgeryEDAT- 2013/07/09 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/09 06:00PHST- 2013/02/17 [received]PHST- 2013/06/18 [accepted]PHST- 2013/07/06 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s10047-013-0720-6 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Artif Organs. 2013 Dec;16(4):501-3. doi: 10.1007/s10047-013-0720-6.
