Continuous-flow pumps are newer types of left ventricular assist devicesdeveloped to overcome some of these limitations.METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter study without a concurrent control group, 133 patients with end-stage heart failure who were on a waiting list for hearttransplantation underwent implantation of a continuous-flow pump. The principaloutcomes were the proportions of patients who, at 180 days, had undergonetransplantation, had cardiac recovery, or had ongoing mechanical support whileremaining eligible for transplantation. We also assessed functional status andquality of life.RESULTS: The principal outcomes occurred in 100 patients (75%). The medianduration of support was 126 days (range, 1 to 600). The survival rate duringsupport was 75% at 6 months and 68% at 12 months. At 3 months, therapy wasassociated with significant improvement in functional status (according to theNew York Heart Association class and results of a 6-minute walk test) and inquality of life (according to the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaires). Major adverse events included postoperative bleeding, stroke, right heart failure, and percutaneous lead infection. Pumpthrombosis occurred in two patients.CONCLUSIONS: A continuous-flow left ventricular assist device can provideeffective hemodynamic support for a period of at least 6 months in patientsawaiting heart transplantation, with improved functional status and quality oflife.
