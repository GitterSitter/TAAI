We reviewed our institutional experience with noncardiac surgicalprocedures (NCPs) in patients supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs, n = 198) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 165) between July 1998 andJune 2010. In total, 64 NCPs were performed in 55 VAD patients and 14 NCPs in 14 ECMO patients. Thirty-day mortality was higher for the VAD compared with the ECMOgroup (25 vs 86%; P < 0.001) and was greater for emergent compared withnonemergent procedures (58 vs 19%; P < 0.001). Excluding tracheostomy, nopatients died within 30 days of a nonemergent procedure. Kaplan-Meier survivalshowed a trend toward worse survival after NCP in ECMO patients, but NCP did not alter survival in VAD patients. Fewer VAD patients were bridged to hearttransplantation when NCP was required, and time from device implantation totransplant was significantly longer than for patients without NCP. In summary,this is the largest series of NCPs on VAD support and the only series on ECMO.Mortality is substantial for ECMO patients. Selected procedures can be performed safely in VAD patients but will delay heart transplantation.
