Not any more.Kettner J(1), Dorazilová Z, Netuka I, Malý J, Al-Hiti H, Melenovský V, Skalský I,Říha H, Málek I, Kautzner J, Pirk J.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine -IKEM, Prague, Czech Republic. jiri.kettner@ikem.czPulmonary hypertension (PH) unresponsive to pharmacological intervention isconsidered a contraindication for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHTX) due to risk of postoperative right-heart failure. In this prospective study, we describeour experience with a treatment strategy of improving severe PH in hearttransplant candidates by means of ventricular assist device (VAD) implantationand subsequent OHTX. In 11 heart transplantation candidates with severe PHunresponsive to pharmacological intervention we implanted VAD with the aim ofachieving PH to values acceptable for OHTX. In all patients we observedsignificant drop in pulmonary pressures, PVR and TPG (p < 0.001 for all) 3 monthsafter VAD implantation to values sufficient to allow OHTX. Seven patientsunderwent transplantation (mean duration of support 216 days) while none ofpatients suffered right-side heart failure in postoperative period. Two patients died after transplantation and five patients are living in very good conditionwith a mean duration of 286 days after OHTX. In our opinion, severe PH is not acontraindication for orthotopic heart transplantation any more.
