Mechanical circulatory support is a promising therapy as both a bridge to transplantation and destination therapy. Elderly patients are frequentlyineligible for heart transplantation because of their age and comorbidities, and the application of mechanical circulatory support for destination therapy in thispopulation is not well defined. A review of the literature was undertaken tobetter characterize our experience to date with mechanical circulatory support inolder heart failure populations. Mechanical circulatory support is being employedincreasingly for destination therapy indications in older patients. The newercontinuous flow devices appear to have disproportionate advantage in elderlypatients, which has translated into marked improvement in 1- and 2-year survival.The rational implementation of MCS devices in elderly heart failure patientsneeds to focus on (1) continuous flow devices that appear to have particularbenefit in this population, (2) extensive pre-MCS assessment including variables relating to frailty, and (3) intervening before these patients developcardiogenic shock. More data are needed on the cost-benefit analysis of routineuse of CF devices as destination therapy in elderly patients with heart failure.
