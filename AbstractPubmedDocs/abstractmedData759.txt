We analyzed theeffects of ventricular decompression by continuous-flow versus pulsatile-flowLVADs on myocardial structure and function in this population.METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-one patients who underwent LVAD implantation asbridge-to-transplant were analyzed (pulsatile-flow LVAD: group P, n=31;continuous-flow LVAD: group C, n=30). Serial echocardiograms, serum levels ofbrain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and extracellular matrix biomarkers (ECM) werecompared between the groups. Myocardial BNP and ECM gene expression wereevaluated in a subset of 18 patients. Postoperative LV ejection fraction wasgreater (33.2±12.6% versus 17.6±8.8%, P<0.0001) and the mitral E/E' was lower(9.9±2.6 versus 13.2±3.8, P=0.0002) in group P versus group C. Postoperativeserum levels of BNP, metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP(TIMP)-4 were significantly lower in group P compared with group C (BNP:552.6±340.6 versus 965.4±805.7 pg/mL, P<0.01; MMP9: 309.0±220.2 versus475.2±336.9 ng/dL, P<0.05; TIMP4: 1490.9±622.4 versus 2014.3±452.4 ng/dL,P<0.001). Myocardial gene expression of ECM markers and BNP decreased in bothgroups; however, expression of TIMP-4 decreased only in group P (P=0.024).CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical unloading of the failing myocardium using pulsatiledevices is more effective as indicated by echocardiographic parameters ofsystolic and diastolic LV function as well as dynamics of BNP and ECM markers.Therefore, specific effects of pulsatile mechanical unloading on the failingmyocardium may have important implications for device selection especially forthe purpose of bridge-to-recovery in patients with advanced HF.PMCID: PMC3178740
