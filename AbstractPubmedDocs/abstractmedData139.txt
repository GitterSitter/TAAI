We evaluated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin Ccompared with established markers of renal function in patients with heartfailure (HF) because they might improve prognostic assessment of patients withHF.METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 40 patients with stable HF (age: 58 ± 8 years, body mass index [BMI]: 28.4 ± 6.4 kg/m(2)), 40 HF patients undergoingventricular assist device (VAD) implantation (age: 53 ± 11 years, BMI: 26.8 ± 5.5kg/m(2)), 40 patients undergoing VAD removal at cardiac transplantation, and 24controls (age: 48 ± 7 years, BMI: 29.4 ± 4.2 kg/m(2)). Clinical data werecollected from institutional medical records. NGAL and cystatin C levels weremeasured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and estimated glomerular filtrationrate (eGFR) calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.RESULTS: Patients with stable HF showed elevated NGAL and cystatin C levelscompared with controls (NGAL: 114.9 ± 48.3 ng/mL vs 72.0 ± 36.6 ng/mL, p <0.0001; cystatin C: 1490.4 ± 576.1 ng/mL vs 954.7 ± 414.2 ng/mL, p = 0.0026).Unlike cystatin C, NGAL increased in advanced HF patients requiring VADimplantation (158.7 ± 74.8 ng/mL, p < 0.001). On VAD support, NGAL levelsdecreased (127.1 ± 80.4 ng/mL, p = 0.034). NGAL was higher in patients whodeveloped right ventricular failure (187.8 ± 66.0 vs 130.9 ± 67.0 ng/mL, p =0.03) and irreversible renal dysfunction (190.0 ± 73.8 ng/mL vs 133.8 ± 54.2ng/mL, p < 0.05), whereas cystatin C, creatinine, and eGFR were not different.NGAL correlated with eGFR (r = -0.2188, p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: NGAL levels correlate with HF severity and hemodynamic improvementafter VAD placement. Our findings suggest a role of this novel biomarker as amarker of severity and prognosis in patients with HF.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
