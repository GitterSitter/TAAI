We tested thehypothesis that cardiac gene expression profiling can distinguish between HFpatients with different disease severity. We obtained tissue samples from bothleft (LV) and right (RV) ventricle of explanted hearts of 44 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist device placement. Gene expressionprofiles were obtained using an in-house microarray containing 4217 muscularorgan-relevant genes. Based on their clinical status, patients were classifiedinto three HF-severity groups: deteriorating (n= 12), intermediate (n= 19) andstable (n= 13). Two-class statistical analysis of gene expression profiles ofdeteriorating and stable patients identified a 170-gene and a 129-gene predictor for LV and RV samples, respectively. The LV molecular predictor identifiedpatients with stable and deteriorating status with a sensitivity of 88% and 92%, and a specificity of 100% and 96%, respectively. The RV molecular predictoridentified patients with stable and deteriorating status with a sensitivity of100% and 96%, and a specificity of 100% and 100%, respectively. The molecularprediction was reproducible across biological replicates in LV and RV samples.Gene expression profiling has the potential to reproducibly detect HF patientswith highest HF severity with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, not only LV but also RV samples could be used for molecular risk stratification with similar predictive power.PMCID: PMC3829011
