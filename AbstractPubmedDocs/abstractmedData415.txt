Reactive oxygen species(ROS) in blood leukocytes and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in erythrocytes weremeasured by flow cytometry/immunofluorescence microscopy and spectrophotometry,respectively. ELISA was used to measure oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL)in plasma. Markers of DNA damage (γ-H2AX) and repairs (Mre11, DNA ligase IV,Ku70, and Ku80) were quantified in blood lymphocytes by immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: Levels of ROS and oxLDL were significantly higher in HF patients withLVAD than baseline as well as the control group; moreover, SOD levels weredecreased with increasing post-operative periods. All the changes indicatedenhanced oxidative stress among LVAD recipients. Significantly higher γ-H2AX fociin lymphocytes confirmed DNA double strand breaks in LVAD recipients. γ-H2AX focinumbers in lymphocytes were positively correlated with the ROS and oxLDL andnegatively with SOD levels (p<0.0001). Expressions of DNA ligase IV, Ku70 andKu80 proteins were highest after one week and Mre11 protein after 3 months ofLVAD transplantation; indicated abnormal DNA repair.CONCLUSIONS: The study, for the first time shows that, continuous flow LVADimplanted HF patients not only exhibit elevated oxidative stress and DNA damagein blood leukocytes but also have abnormalities in DNA repair pathways.PMCID: PMC3675502
