J Am Coll Cardiol. 2010 Apr 27;55(17):1835-6.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the impact of continuous flow leftventricular assist devices (LVADs) on functional capacity and heartfailure-related quality of life.BACKGROUND: Newer continuous-flow LVAD are smaller and quieter thanpulsatile-flow LVADs.METHODS: Data from advanced heart failure patients enrolled in the HeartMate IILVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, California) bridge to transplantation(BTT) (n = 281) and destination therapy (DT) (n = 374) trials were analyzed.Functional status (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, 6-min walkdistance, patient activity scores), and quality of life (Minnesota Living WithHeart Failure [MLWHF] and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires [KCCQ]) were collected before and after LVAD implantation.RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LVAD patients demonstrated early and sustainedimprovements in functional status and quality of life. Most patients had NYHAfunctional class IV symptoms at baseline. Following implant, 82% (BTT) and 80%(DT) of patients at 6 months and 79% (DT) at 24 months improved to NYHAfunctional class I or II. Mean 6-min walk distance in DT patients was 204 m inpatients able to ambulate at baseline, which improved to 350 and 360 m at 6 and24 months. There were also significant and sustained improvements from baselinein both BTT and DT patients in median MLWHF scores (by 40 and 42 U in DTpatients, or 52% and 55%, at 6 and 24 months, respectively), and KCCQ overallsummary scores (by 39 and 41 U, or 170% and 178%).CONCLUSIONS: Use of a continuous flow LVAD in advanced heart failure patientsresults in clinically relevant improvements in functional capacity and heartfailure-related quality of life.Copyright (c) 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
