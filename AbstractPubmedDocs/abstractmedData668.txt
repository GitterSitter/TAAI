A 38-year-oldman with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted in stage D heartfailure. Preoperative computed tomography demonstrated multiple saccularaneurysms of the ascending aorta and sinus of valsalva. We successfully performedcomplex aortic surgery and the implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD (HeartWare HVAD) (HeartWare International, Framingham, MA). The postoperative course wasuneventful. The patient is currently listed for heart transplantation.
