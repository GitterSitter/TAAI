ASAIO J. 2003 Nov-Dec;49(6):727-30.Thoratec ventricular assist devices in children with less than 1.3 m2 of bodysurface area.Reinhartz O(1), Copeland JG, Farrar DJ.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305,USA.This report summarizes the multicenter experience with the Thoratec paracorporealpneumatic ventricular assist device (VAD) (Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA) insmall children. Between October 1988 and August 2001, 19 children (11 male, 8female) with less than 1.3 (mean 1.09, range 0.73-1.29) m2 body surface area(BSA) have been supported with univentricular (9) or biventricular (10) Thoratec VADs in 12 centers in the United States and Germany. Mean patient age was 10(range 7-14) years, mean weight 31 (range 17-41) kg. Indications for support wereend-stage cardiomyopathy in eight patients, myocarditis in three, end-stagecongenital heart disease in seven, and transplant graft failure in one patient.Mean duration of support was 43 (range 0-120) days. In patients withcardiomyopathies and myocarditis, survival through discharge occurred in 8 of 11 (72%) patients; however, only 1 of 7 patients with congenital disease survived.Outcome appeared independent of patient size. Neurologic complications weresignificant and predominant in the congenital disease group. Our experiencesuggests that the Thoratec VAD can be successfully used in these difficultpatients, particularly in children with cardiomyopathies and myocarditis.Congenital disease is associated with increased risk. To reduce thromboembolicrisk, we recommend left ventricular as opposed to left atrial inflow cannulation and higher device rates with partial stroke volumes.
