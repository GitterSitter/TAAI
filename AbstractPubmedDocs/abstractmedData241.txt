Novel cardiac supportstrategies such as pharmacologic agents, mechanical circulatory support (MCS),and cell- or matrix-based therapies are promising for these patients. Theindications, types, and timing of MCS implantation depend to a large extent onthe presentation, clinical status of the patient, underlying etiology, andlong-term prospects. The presence or absence of end-organ damage has asignificant impact on prognosis following MCS initiation. Although many patients with acute AHF may have end-organ damage, their prospect of recovery, onceappropriate therapy is instituted, is better than for patients who had AHF forlonger periods of time. We consider the multidisciplinary approaches used for themanagement of AHF and the novel cardiac support strategies (eg, MCS). Appropriateselection of patient, device, time, and end point is essential for betteroutcomes.Â© The Author(s) 2014.
