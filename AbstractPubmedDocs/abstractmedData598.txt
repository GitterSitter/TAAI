Cardiactransplantation lacks sufficient donors to treat all patients, and there is thus debate about alternative strategies. The use of left ventricular assist devicesfor long-term support is increasing with a positive impact on patient survival.Although there is an ongoing debate regarding the risks and benefits ofmaintaining pulsatile flow during long-term ventricular assist device support,there has been a significant move towards implantation of continuous flow devicesdue to the lower surgical morbidity and better long-term reliability of thesepumps. The following is a review of the literature on continuous and pulsatileflow for long-term support. Starting from the definition of flow, we analyze the current evidence and consider gastrointestinal complications.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
