Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices unload theleft ventricle throughout the cardiac cycle, which narrows pulse pressure andconverts passive left ventricular filling during diastole to active flowthroughout the cardiac cycle. We report the case of a 63-year-old man with severecongestive heart failure who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and wassupported with an axial-flow pump. In this patient, saphenous vein graft flowduring left ventricular assistance provided adequate coronary perfusion.PMCID: PMC1524688
