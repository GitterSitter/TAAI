Epub 2011Oct 2.Who needs an RVAD in addition to an LVAD?Kaczorowski DJ(1), Woo YJ.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.Comment in    Cardiol Clin. 2011 Nov;29(4):607.Mechanical circulatory support using left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) hasbecome an accepted mode of therapy for both bridging patients with end-stageheart failure to transplant and as a destination therapy. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is common after LVAD insertion and is a significant source ofmorbidity and mortality in patients undergoing LVAD placement. Several studieshave identified clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and echocardiographicparameters that may serve as risk factors for RV dysfunction after LVADplacement. Furthermore, scoring systems have been established to helpquantitatively predict the potential need for RV support after LVAD placement.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
