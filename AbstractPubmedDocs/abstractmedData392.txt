These can be classified into heart diseases affecting the liver, liverdiseases affecting the heart, and conditions affecting the heart and the liver atthe same time. In chronic and acute cardiac hepatopathy, owing to cardiacfailure, a combination of reduced arterial perfusion and passive congestion leadsto cardiac cirrhosis and cardiogenic hypoxic hepatitis. These conditions mayimpair the liver function and treatment should be directed towards the primaryheart disease and seek to secure perfusion of vital organs. In patients withadvanced cirrhosis, physical and/or pharmacological stress may reveal a reducedcardiac performance with systolic and diastolic dysfunction and electrophysicalabnormalities termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Electrophysiological abnormalitiesinclude prolonged QT interval, chronotropic incompetance, and electromechanicaluncoupling. No specific therapy can be recommended, but it should be supportiveand directed against the heart failure. Numerous conditions affect both the heartand the liver such as infections, inflammatory and systemic diseases, and chronicalcoholism. The risk and prevalence of coronary artery disease are increasing in cirrhotic patients and since the perioperative mortality is high, a carefulcardiac evaluation of such patients is required prior to orthotopic livertransplantation.
