Epub 2011 May 3.Incomplete recovery of myocyte contractile function despite improvement ofmyocardial architecture with left ventricular assist device support.Ambardekar AV(1), Walker JS, Walker LA, Cleveland JC Jr, Lowes BD, Buttrick PM.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

We hypothesized that evaluation of myocytecontractility and biochemistry at the sarcomere level before and after LVAD mayexplain organ-level changes.METHODS AND RESULTS: Paired LV tissue samples were frozen from 8 patients withnonischemic cardiomyopathy at LVAD implantation (before LVAD) and before cardiac transplantation (after LVAD). These were compared with 8 nonfailing hearts.Isolated skinned myocytes were purified and attached to a force transducer, anddimensions, maximum calcium-saturated force, calcium sensitivity, and myofilamentcooperativity were assessed. Relative isoform abundance and phosphorylationlevels of sarcomeric contractile proteins were measured. With LVAD support, theunloaded EF improved (10.0±1.0% to 25.6±11.0%, P=0.007), LV size decreased (LVinternal dimension at end diastole, 7.6±1.2 to 4.9±1.4 cm; P<0.001), and myocyte dimensions decreased (cross-sectional area, 1247±346 to 638±254 μm(2); P=0.001). Maximum calcium-saturated force improved after LVAD (3.6±0.9 to 7.3±1.8 mN/mm(2),P<0.001) implantation but was still lower than in nonfailing hearts (7.3±1.8versus 17.6±1.8 mN/mm(2), P<0.001). An increase in troponin I (TnI)phosphorylation after LVAD implantation was noted, but protein kinase Cphosphorylation of TnI decreased. Biochemical changes of other sarcomericproteins were not observed after LVAD.CONCLUSIONS: There is significant improvement in LV and myocyte size with LVAD,but there is only partial recovery of EF and myocyte contractility. LVAD support was associated only with biochemical changes in TnI, suggesting that alternatemechanisms might contribute to contractile changes after LVAD and that additionalinterventions may be needed to alter biochemical remodeling of the sarcomere tofurther enhance myofilament and organ-level recovery.PMCID: PMC3407673
