Thetreatment options for patients suffering from this ailment range frompharmacologic to surgical. Heart failure, however, continues to harbor a dismalprognosis despite conventional treatments. The high mortality rate among thispatient population has spawned interest in alternative therapies. Mechanicalcirculatory support has emerged as a treatment option for patients withrefractory heart failure. Over the past years a number of studies havehighlighted the effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD's) inimproving patient's outcomes. The technologies that support these devices haveevolved and provide new opportunities to manage patients suffering from thisdebilitating disease. Heart transplantation continues to generate the mostreproducible survival benefit to patients with advanced heart failure, but islimited by a lack of donors. It is therefore the goal of mechanical assisttherapy to improve patient survival and quality of life in heart failure in lightof the limitations of heart transplantation. In this article we examine theevolving utility of LVAD's in the treatment of heart failure.
