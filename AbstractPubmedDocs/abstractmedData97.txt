J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2015 Jan;149(1):275-8.OBJECTIVE: Although the development of continuous-flow ventricular assist devices(CF-VAD) has improved the reliability of these devices, VAD exchange is stilloccasionally necessary. The focus of this study was to analyze our institution's entire experience with primary CF-VAD implants, evaluate the baseline variables, determine which factors predict the need for exchange, and evaluate the impact ofexchange on survival and event-free survival.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of all patients in a single center who received a primary CF-VAD implant between December 1999 and December 2013.All CF-VAD exchanges were reviewed; demographics, indications, preoperative andoperative data, and clinical outcomes were summarized. Univariate andmultivariable regression analyses were performed to ascertain predictors forexchange. Time-to-event and survival analyses were also performed.RESULTS: We identified 469 patients who underwent 546 CF-VAD implantations. Ofthese patients, 66 (14%) underwent 77 exchanges from one CF-VAD to another. Theprimary indications included hemolysis or thrombosis (n = 49; 63.6%), infection(n = 9; 11.7%), or other causes (n = 19; 24.7%). Survival was not significantlydifferent between the exchange and nonexchange groups. Multivariable regressionanalysis identified a history of cerebrovascular events as a significantpredictor for exchange. Among exchange patients, 11 underwent hearttransplantation, 3 had their CF-VADs explanted, 26 had ongoing support, and 26died during device support.CONCLUSIONS: In our series of contemporary CF-VAD exchanges, a history ofprevious cerebrovascular events was a significant predictor for exchange.Exchange did not affect early or late survival. Our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment of pump-related complications with exchange is safe andjustified.Copyright © 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
