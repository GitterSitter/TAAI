The currentgeneration of devices provides a differentiated spectrum of circulatory support. The major limitations of mechanical circulatory support devices are infection,coagulopathies and device dysfunction. The Scientific Council on MechanicalCirculatory Support of the International Society for Heart and LungTransplantation has established an international database to generate criticaldata to advance knowledge about the effectiveness of mechanical circulatorysupport device therapy for one of the most difficult and costly contemporarymedical problems, the malignant syndrome of advanced heart failure.
