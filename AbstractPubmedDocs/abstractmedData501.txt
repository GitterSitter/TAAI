However, data on long-term post-transplantsurvival for these patients are limited. We evaluated the effect ofcontinuous-flow left ventricular assist devices on postcardiac transplantsurvival in the current era.METHODS: All patients who received a continuous-flow left ventricular assistdevice as a bridge to transplant at a single center from June 2005 to September2011 were evaluated.RESULTS: Of the 167 patients who received a continuous-flow left ventricularassist device as a bridge to transplant, 77 (46%) underwent cardiactransplantation, 27 died before transplantation (16%), and 63 (38%) remain listedfor transplantation and continued with left ventricular assist device support.The mean age of the transplanted patients was 54.5 ± 11.9 years, 57% had anischemic etiology, and 20% were women. The overall mean duration of leftventricular assist device support before transplantation was 310 ± 227 days(range, 67-1230 days). The mean duration of left ventricular assist devicesupport did not change in patients who had received a left ventricular assistdevice in the early period of the study (2005-2008, n = 62) compared with thosewho had received a left ventricular assist device later (2009-2011, n = 78, 373vs 392 days, P = NS). In addition, no difference was seen in survival betweenthose patients supported with a left ventricular assist device for fewer than 180days or longer than 180 days before transplantation (P = NS). The actuarialsurvival after transplantation at 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years by Kaplan-Meieranalysis was 98.7%, 93.0%, 91.1%, and 88.0%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The short- and long-term post-transplant survival for patientsbridged with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device in the current era has been excellent. Furthermore, the duration of left ventricular assist devicesupport did not affect post-transplant survival. The hemodynamic benefits ofventricular unloading with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices, inaddition to their durability and reduced patient morbidity, have contributed toimproved post-transplant survival.Copyright © 2013.
