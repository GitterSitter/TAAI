Survivin initiates cell cycleprogression by increased cyclinD1/cdk4 complexes by abrogation of the inhibitory effect of p16(INK4a) on cdk4. Accordingly, the role of survivin in CHF and after unloading was explored.METHODS: In 20 myocardial samples from patients with terminal CHF (before andafter LVAD), the protein expression of survivin, cyclin D1, cdk4, p16(INK4a), andproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was immunohistochemically investigated and morphometrically quantified by calculating the percentage of positivecardiomyocytes per visual field. These data were correlated with cardiomyocytesize and DNA content.RESULTS: The mean percentage of cardiomyocytes immunoreactive against survivin,cyclin D1, cdk4, p16(INK4a), and PCNA was significantly increased in CHF comparedwith controls and significantly decreased after unloading (57.6% to 26.6%, 42% to18.3%, 45.4% to 15.3%, 73.0% to 60.5%, and 43.5% to 25.2%, respectively; p <0.05). All investigated parameters, in particular survivin and cyclin D1,significantly correlated with cardiomyocyte diameters (r = 0.405; r = 0.563) and DNA content (r = 0.430; r = 0.480), both in CHF (cardiac remodelling) and afterunloading (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that survivin is reversibly regulated byventricular unloading and might be involved in cell size/DNA content regulationand cardiomyocyte proliferation in cardiac remodelling during CHF. It issuggested that after ventricular unloading, decreased survivin protein expressionmight contribute to cardiac hypertrophy decrease by lowering the number of cyclinD1/cdk4 complexes.Copyright Â© 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
