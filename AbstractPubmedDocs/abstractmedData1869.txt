Overview and 12-year experience.Frazier OH(1), Myers TJ, RadovanceviÄ‡ B.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Texas Heart Institute, Houston 77030,USA.Cardiac transplantation has become a widely accepted option for treatingend-stage heart failure. As the waiting time for donor hearts grows, newgenerations of left ventricular assist systems are being developed for patientsawaiting transplantation. Great strides have been made in the study and use ofsuch devices, both as temporary support and (perhaps ultimately) as permanentimplants. The Texas Heart Institute has been involved with the development of theHeartMate left ventricular assist systems, which have been used almostexclusively as a temporary bridge. Herein we review our 12-year clinicalexperience with the HeartMate left ventricular assist systems as a bridge totransplantation and as a long-term circulatory assist device that aids in cardiacrepair. Trials of the HeartMate as a permanent support system for patients withend-stage heart failure who are not suitable candidates for transplantation arecurrently under way.PMCID: PMC325571
