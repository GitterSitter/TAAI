J Card Surg. 2001;16(4):267-71.The Novacor left ventricular assist system: clinical experience from the Novacor registry.Dagenais F(1), Portner PM, Robbins RC, Oyer PE.Author information: (1)Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305-5407, USA.The electrically powered Novacor left ventricular assist (LVAS) system was first used clinically as a bridge to transplant in 1984. The configuration has evolved to the current wearable model used clinically for the first time in 1993. In1998, the inflow conduit was modified, reducing embolic events by 50%. Over 1100 implants have been performed worldwide with cumulative support greater than 300patient years, and only 0.7% requiring replacement. The Novacor is a safe andeffective device for bridge to transplant, bridge to recovery, or potentiallypermanent implant with reliable long-term support for periods as long as 4 years.
