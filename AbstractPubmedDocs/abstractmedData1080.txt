Heart donorsand matched recipients data were prospectively collected. Univariate andmultivariate analyses were used to determine independent predictors for PGF andperi-operative mortality. The donor's high inotrope requirement was defined assustained need for dopamine exceeding 10 microg/kg/min and/or alpha agonistsexceeding 0.06 microg/kg/min. PGF instead was defined as need for immediatepost-HT mechanical circulatory support. Since 2006, we have performed 37 HTs. PGFoccurred in six patients (16.2%). Although four patients (66.6%) were weaned off circulatory support, two of them (33.3%) died on mechanical assistance. Totalin-hospital mortality was 10.8% (4/37). Upon multivariate analysis,pre-harvesting donor high inotrope dosage was the major determinant for PGF(P=0.03, OR=10.8). Given the organ shortage, many centers accepted marginalhearts assuming the donor's pre-harvest hemodynamic managing has a reduced impacton PGF development. As PGF remains the most lethal postoperative complication,the hazards should be carefully considered when using pre-harvesting highinotrope infusion rates.
