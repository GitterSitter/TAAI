Its impact on early and long-term survival after subsequentheart transplantation (HTx) remains to be determined.METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the course of 95 children (median age, 8years; range, 8 days-17 years; body weight, 24 kg; range, 3-110 kg) who underwentHTx. Group A, the elective-HTx group, consists of 33 children who were treated asoutpatients before transplantation. Group B, the emergency-HTx group, has 44children who were critically ill and hospitalized before transplantation butwithout ventricular assist devices, whereas Group C, the VAD-HTx group, consists of 18 children resuscitated and supported with pulsatile pneumatic VADs for amedian time of 20 days.RESULTS: Overall actuarial survival after cardiac transplantation was 86% at 1month, 82% at 1 year, and 78% at 5 years, without significant differences amongthe 3 sub-groups. Group A had the best long-term survival rate, 88% at 1 month,88% at 1 year, and 80% at 5 years. Group B had a survival rate of 88% at 1 month,82% at 1 year, and 79% at 5 years. Group C had a survival rate of 72% at 1 month,72% at 1 year, and 72% at 5 years. We found no differences in neurologic outcome,acute cardiac rejection, or transplant failure. The survival rate wassignificantly better in the children with cardiomyopathy compared with those withcongenital heart defects (p = 0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Bridging to HTx with a pulsatile pneumatic VAD is a safe procedurein pediatric patients. After HTx, overall survival of these children is similarto that of patients who were bridged with inotropes or who were awaiting hearttransplantation electively.
