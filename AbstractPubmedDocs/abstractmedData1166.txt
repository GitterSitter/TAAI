The coarctation wascorrected at the day of admission with a good postoperative result. However,weaning from the respirator failed despite multiple drug support due to leftventricular failure. Consequently, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) wasimplanted 22 days later. The further course was complicated by systemichypertension and ongoing pulmonary hypertension requiring extensiveantihypertensive therapy. The first attempt to wean from LVAD failed and the leftventricle was left completely unloaded for additional 4 weeks. The second weaningattempt, using a very smooth weaning protocol, led to a recovered left ventricle and facilitated the removal of the assist device after a total of 120 days. Thepatient was discharged with normal cardiac function, but he still requiresantihypertensive therapy. We believe that the slow reduction of the LVAD support was the key measure that leads to the successful weaning of the patient, thereby avoiding heart transplantation.
