Although hearttransplantation is the only curative strategy for patients with end-stage heartfailure, the relative shortage of donors has led to a worldwide plateau of thisoption over the past 20 years. The result is an unacceptably high mortality rate among patients with advanced heart failure. Interest in developing alternativecurative strategies based on chronic circulatory support, with the aim ofprolonging and improving quality of life for these patients, has grown. Patients supported with left ventricular assist devices require structured longitudinalcare from a team of providers. An integrated approach using basicechocardiography is critical to patient selection, implantation, and continuedsurveillance and success of patients with left ventricular assist devices.
