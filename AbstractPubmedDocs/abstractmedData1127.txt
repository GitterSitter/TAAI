The primary end point was death (n = 92), urgent transplantation (n = 14), or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation (n = 3); a secondary analysis was performed on mortality alone.RESULTS: Patients were receiving optimal therapy (angiotensin-II modulation92.8%, beta-blockers 91.5%, aldosterone antagonists 46.3%), and 71.0% had animplantable device (defibrillator 30.4%, biventricular pacemaker 3.4%, combined37.3%). During a median follow-up of 21 months, 109 patients (24.5%) had anevent. Although discrimination was adequate (c-statistic >0.7), the SHFM overall underestimated absolute risk (observed vs. predicted event rate: 11.0% vs. 9.2%, 21.0% vs. 16.6%, and 27.9% vs. 22.8% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively). Riskunderprediction was more prominent in patients with an implantable device. TheSHFM had different calibration properties in white versus black patients, leadingto net underestimation of absolute risk in blacks. Race-specific recalibrationimproved the accuracy of predictions. When analysis was restricted to mortality, the SHFM exhibited better performance.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced HF, the SHFM offers adequatediscrimination, but absolute risk is underestimated, especially in blacks and in patients with devices. This is more prominent when including transplantation and LVAD implantation as an end point.
