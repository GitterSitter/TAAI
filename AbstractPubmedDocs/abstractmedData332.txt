In such patients, durable MCS may offer an important chancefor life prolongation. Yet, there are no data to support the use of MCS in thisincreasingly prevalent group of patients.METHODS: We searched 3,812 MCS patients from June 2006 through March 2011 in the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support)database for the diagnosis of CCMP. We compared characteristics, outcomes, andsurvival between CCMP patients and patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy andischemic cardiomyopathy.RESULTS: Compared with patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and ischemiccardiomyopathy, patients with CCMP were overwhelmingly female (72% vs. 24% vs.13%, p = 0.001), had MCS more often implanted as destination therapy (33% vs. 14%vs. 22%, p = 0.03), required more right ventricular assist device support (19%vs. 11% vs. 6%, p = 0.006), and had a higher risk of bleeding (p = 0001).Survival of CCMP patients was similar to that of other groups.CONCLUSIONS: CCMP patients treated with MCS have survival similar to other MCSpatients despite more frequent need for right ventricular assist device supportand increased bleeding risk.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
