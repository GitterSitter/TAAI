Although mostpatients who develop cardiogenic shock can be effectively treated withconventional therapy, including inotropic and vasodilating drugs and intra-aorticballoon pumps, a significant number of patients have ventricular failure that is refractory to conventional therapy. For these patients, the prognosis is poorunless the deleterious effects of cardiogenic shock can be reversed. For some,cardiac revascularization or the repair of mechanical defects reverses thehemodynamic deterioration. However, there are subgroups of patients in whom anadvanced form of mechanical circulatory support is necessary for myocardialrecovery or in whom recovery will never occur, but who may be candidates forcardiac transplantation.
