The relative importance of each ofthese parameters in determining prognosis is unknown.METHODS: In 466 participants with chronic systolic HF, we derived quantitativeechocardiographic measures of EF: cardiac size (end-diastolic volume [EDV]);contractile function (the end-systolic pressure volume relationship slope [Eessb]and intercept [V0]); and VA coupling (arterial elastance [Ea]/Eessb). Wedetermined the association between these parameters and the following adverseoutcomes: 1) the combined endpoint of death, cardiac transplantation, orventricular assist device (VAD) placement; and 2) cardiac hospitalization.RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, there were 76 deaths, 52transplantations, 14 VAD placements, and 684 cardiac hospitalizations. EF wasindependently associated with death, transplantation, and VAD placement (adjustedhazard ratio [HR]: 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 5.0 comparing third and first tertiles), as were EDV (HR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5 to 4.2); V0 (HR: 3.6; 95% CI: 2.1 to 6.1); and Ea/Eessb (HR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.3). EDV, V0, andEa/Eessb were also associated with risk of cardiac hospitalization. Eessb was notsignificantly associated with any adverse outcomes in adjusted analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular size, V0, and VA coupling are associated withprognosis in systolic HF, but end-systolic elastance (Eessb) is not. Assessmentof VA coupling via Ea/Eessb is an additional noninvasively derived metric thatcan be used to gauge prognosis in human HF.Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
