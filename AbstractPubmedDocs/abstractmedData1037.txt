Primary outcome was death(n=101), urgent transplantation (n=14), or ventricular assist device implantation(n=4); secondary outcomes included HF and all-cause hospitalizations. Digoxin usewas evaluated (1) in the original cohort; (2) in a propensity score-matchedsubset (n=322); (3) as a time-dependent covariate; and (4) after adjustment forSeattle Heart Failure Score. Patients were on optimal therapy: angiotensin-IImodulation, 92.5%; beta-blockers, 91.2%; aldosterone antagonists, 45.6%; anddevices, 71.0%. After a median of 27 months, 83 of 277 (36.6%) patients treatedwith digoxin versus 36 of 228 (15.8%) patients without digoxin met primaryoutcome (hazard ratio [HR], 2.28; 95% CI, 1.51 to 3.43; P<0.001). This riskpersisted in the matched subset (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.75; P=0.021) andwith time-varying digoxin use (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.23 to 3.41; P=0.011). Digoxin was associated with higher risk among patients in sinus rhythm compared withatrial fibrillation. Digoxin was not associated with improvement in eitherall-cause or HF hospitalization rates. These results were similar across sex and race and when adjusted for Seattle Heart Failure Score and renal function.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that digoxin therapy may be of no benefit inpatients with advanced HF referred for cardiac transplantation who receivedoptimal medical therapy. Treatment with digoxin should be used cautiously in suchpatients because of risk for adverse outcomes.
