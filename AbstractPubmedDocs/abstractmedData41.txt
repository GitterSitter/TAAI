We report our experience with MCS inchildren eligible for HTx and its effect on waiting list mortality.METHODS: Retrospective single-centre cohort study, National Paediatric HTxProgramme including all children eligible for HTx, since the introduction ofMCS-VAD in 2006.RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were eligible for HTx, median age 11.7 years[Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 3.0-14.7]. In 18 patients, (42%) a VAD was implanted,11 (61%) survived to HTx (n = 9) or recovery (n = 2). Techniques and devices usedwere left ventricular assist device (n = 16, 89%), in 4 cases preceded byextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and biventricular assist device (n = 2, 11%), both preceded by ECMO. In the VAD group, median time to death (n = 7)was 18 days (IQR 7-75), median time to HTx (n = 9) 66 days (IQR 33-223) and 2patients recovered after 30 and 308 days. The main cause of death on MCS wasneurological injury in 4 patients (22%) and systemic thrombo-embolic events in 2 (11%). The most common serious adverse events included confirmed thrombusrequiring pump replacement (in 11 patients, 61%) and pericardial effusion leadingto rethoracotomy (in 5 patients, 28%). Compared with the era before MCS(1998-2006), waiting list mortality decreased from 44 to 21%, and is now mainlyrelated to complications of VAD support.CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of MCS-VAD, waiting list mortality halved andmore children with end-stage heart failure survived to heart transplantation,thus improving outcome. Although there is substantial mortality and morbidity,overall mortality decreases, making MCS-VAD an essential therapeutic tool. Theneed for donor organs remains critically urgent.© The Author 2015.
