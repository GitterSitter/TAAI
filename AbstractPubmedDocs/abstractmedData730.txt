We report ourexperience with the short-term left ventricular axial pump Impella LP5.0 in nine patients with severe ischaemic heart failure.METHODS: Six patients (group 1) presented with cardiogenic shock at the acutephase of an ST elevation myocardial infarction. Three patients (group 2) hadsevere ischaemic cardiomyopathy with temporary contra-indication to LVAD ortransplantation. We measured haemodynamic and metabolic variables up to 96hoursand recorded morbidity, mechanical pump failures, and mortality up to one yearpostimplantation.RESULTS: In all patients the Impella LP5.0 was safely placed through the rightsubclavian artery. Cardiac power output increased from 0.64 (0.07) W to 0.94(0.44) W and 1.02 (0.30) W at 24 and 72hours, respectively. The Impella LP5.0remained in place for 12 (7.2) days. In group 1, five patients were in INTERMACS Profile 3 at the time of pump insertion. Three could be weaned and survived. One patient in INTERMACS Profile 1 died of intractable heart failure within hours. Ingroup 2, two of three patients underwent heart transplantation. Haemorrhagerequiring transfusions was observed in four patients but only one case wasdirectly related to the Impella LP5.0.CONCLUSION: Left ventricular assistance with the Impella LP5.0 appears to be welltolerated. It may be especially useful in patients with acute myocardialinfarction complicated by cardiogenic shock who achieve INTERMACS Profile 3 with initial treatment.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.
