Preoperative patient conditions, such as durationof symptoms (> 9 vs < 3 years; p = 0.001), New York Heart Association (NYHA)class (Class IV vs < Class IV; p = 0.002), depressed contractility (fractionalshortening [FS] < 5% vs > 12%; p = 0.001), and refractory decompensation thatrequired emergency procedure (p < 0.001) were associated with reduced event-free survival. Five or more cases in each hospital led to significantly betteroutcomes than the initial four cases. Rescue procedures for 14 patientsnonsignificantly improved patient survival (2-year survival 52%) over event-free survival (2-year survival 48%; p = 0.49), with improved NYHA class amongsurvivors (3.6 to 1.8; p < 0.001). Outcome was better in 1999 than in all series before 1999 (p = 0.02) most likely due to patient selection, which was refined toavoid known risk factors such as reduced proportion of patients in NYHA Class IV,FS < 5%, and hospitals with experience in 10 or less cases. A combination ofthese risk factors could have stratified 17 high-risk patients with 0% 1-yearsurvival and 26 low-risk patients with 75% 2-year event-free survival.CONCLUSION: Avoidance of risk factors appears to improve survival and might help stratify high- or low-risk patients. Although less symptomatic patients withpreserved contractility had better results after PLV, change of indicationrequires prospective randomized comparison with medical therapies or otherapproaches.
