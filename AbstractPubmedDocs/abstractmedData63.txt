The latter has becomeincreasingly popular in recent years, in the face of a donor organ shortage and arise in elderly patients ineligible for heart transplants. For these patients in particular, device durability is a key contributor to survival, morbidity, andquality of life. This systematic review aimed to assess the long-term durability of current continuous-flow LVADs.METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched from their dates of inception to August 2014 for original studies reporting on patients receiving continuous-flow LVADs. LVAD failure was defined as device malfunction necessitating exchange orexplantation, or causing patient mortality. Pooled averages were calculated foroutcomes and rates of device failure were reconstructed from digitized graphcurves using the software, WebPlotDigitizer v3.3.RESULTS: Twelve retrospective observational studies with a total of 5,471patients were included for analysis. The mean duration of LVAD support was 504.7 (range, 303-568) days, and the overall weighted incidence of device failure was3.9% (range, 1-11.3%). On average, pump thrombosis was the most common cause ofdevice failure (50.5%), followed by lead or cable damage (21.7%), mechanical pumpfailure (11.6%), device-related infection (11.1%), and surgical complicationsfrom implantation (2.5%). Long-term device failure rates at 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months post-implantation were 0.5%, 1.8%, 2.9%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: With the expected rise in LVAD usage for end-stage heart failure,particularly as a DT, the steady minority of patients experiencing device failureis likely to increase. Further investigation is required into the incidence andmechanism of major causes of failure, as well as design improvements that mayaddress these complications. There is currently a lack of guidelines and largerandomized studies reporting on the etiology and outcomes of LVAD failure.PMCID: PMC4250558
