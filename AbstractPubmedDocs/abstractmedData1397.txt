We studied the mechanical reliability of the Jarvik 2000 Heart, an axialflow pump with ceramic bearings designed to provide more than 10 years'durability.METHODS: The Jarvik 2000 Heart was implanted in 102 patients between April 2000and December 2004. Eighty-three pumps with an abdominal driveline were implanted as a bridge-to-transplantation, and 19 with postauricular power supply aslifetime therapy. Eighteen pumps were recovered intact after clinical use and runcontinuously on the bench to further assess durability.RESULTS: No implantable component failure occurred either in patients or duringbench testing. The cumulative pump run-time was 110 years: 59 years overall invivo and 51 years in vitro. The mean support time for bridge-to-transplantrecipients was 159 days, and for discharged lifetime-therapy recipients 551 days.Six recipients were supported moer than 2 years, with the longest ongoingapproaching 5 years. External cables caused three system failures, with a 95%freedom from system failure at 4 years. Device malfunctions, related to external cables (9) and lack of a backup battery (1), caused no adverse consequences.Before introduction of noncorrosive, gold-plated stainless steel connectors,corrosion was observed on three connectors to the retroauricular power supply.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 Heart has had no implantable component failure.Meaningful durability data and failure mode can only be established by real-time testing in patients. The reliability and dependability of this device, inaddition to the exchangeability of external components, give promise forlong-term circulatory support in critically ill heart failure patients.
