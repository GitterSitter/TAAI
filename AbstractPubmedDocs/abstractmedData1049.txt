They were divided intotwo groups: those who underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplant (n = 31) and those treated with inotropic agents without the support of LVAD (n =149). They were compared in terms of demographics and clinical outcome.RESULTS: Both groups were similar in terms of patient and donor demographics.Relative to the inotrope group, the LVAD group did have a longer ischemic time (p= 0.032), a greater incidence of pretransplant transfusion (p < 0.00001), and agreater maximum level of pretransplant panel reactive antibodies (p < 0.001).Creatinine at listing significantly improved in LVAD patients awaitingtransplantation (p < 0.0001). Comparisons of 5-year survival in addition tofreedom from posttransplant infection, malignancy, revascularization, and acuterejection did not show significant difference between the two groups. The LVADgroup did benefit from increased freedom from chronic rejection compared to theinotrope group (p = 0.049). Stepwise Cox Regression did not identify anyindependent factors affecting patient survival during the first 5 years aftertransplant.CONCLUSIONS: Status 1 patients successfully bridged to heart transplantation withLVADs had similar long-term clinical outcomes compared to those treated withinotropic agents.
