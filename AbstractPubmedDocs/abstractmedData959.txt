However, littleis known on individual transcriptome changes during VAD support and itsrelationship to nonfailing hearts (NF). In addition no data are available for thetranscriptome regulation during nonpulsatile VAD support. Therefore we analyzedthe gene expression patterns of 30 paired samples from VAD-supported (including 8nonpulsatile VADs) and 8 nonfailing control hearts (NF) using the first totalhuman genome array available. Transmural myocardial samples were collected forRNA isolation. RNA was isolated by commercial methods and processed according to chip-manufacturer recommendations. cRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix HG-U133Plus 2.0 arrays, providing coverage of the whole human genome Array. Data wereanalyzed using Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) and clustered byExpressionist software (Genedata). We found 352 transcripts were differentiallyregulated between samples from VAD implantation and NF, whereas 510 weresignificantly regulated between VAD transplantation and NF (paired t-test P <0.001, fold change >or=1.6). Remarkably, only a minor fraction of 111 transcriptswas regulated in heart failure (HF) and during VAD support. Unsupervisedhierarchical clustering of paired VAD and NF samples revealed separation of HFand NF samples; however, individual differentiation of VAD implantation and VADtransplantation was not accomplished. Clustering of pulsatile and nonpulsatileVAD did not lead to robust separation of gene expression patterns. During VADsupport myocardial gene expression changes do not indicate reversal of the HFphenotype but reveal a distinct HF-related pattern. Transcriptome analysis ofpulsatile and nonpulsatile VAD-supported hearts did not provide evidence for apump mode-specific transcriptome pattern.
