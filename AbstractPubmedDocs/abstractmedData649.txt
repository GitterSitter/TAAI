Epub 2012 Mar 28.Liver dysfunction as a predictor of outcomes in patients with advanced heartfailure requiring ventricular assist device support: Use of the Model ofEnd-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and MELD eXcluding INR (MELD-XI) scoring system.Yang JA(1), Kato TS, Shulman BP, Takayama H, Farr M, Jorde UP, Mancini DM, NakaY, Schulze PC.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia UniversityMedical Center, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.BACKGROUND: Liver dysfunction increases post-surgical morbidity and mortality.The Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) estimates liver function but can beinaccurate in patients receiving oral anti-coagulation. We evaluated the effectof liver dysfunction on outcomes after ventricular assist device (VAD)implantation and the dynamic changes in liver dysfunction that occur during VADsupport.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 255 patients (147 with pulsatile devices and108 with continuous-flow devices) who received a long-term VAD between 2000 and2010. Liver dysfunction was estimated by MELD and MELD-eXcluding INR (MELD-XI),with patients grouped by a score of ≥ 17 or < 17. Primary outcomes were on-VAD,after transplant, and overall survival.RESULTS: MELD and MELD-XI correlated highly (R ≥ 0.901, p < 0.0001) in patientsnot on oral anti-coagulation. Patients with MELD or MELD-XI < 17 had improvedon-VAD and overall survival (p < 0.05) with a higher predictive power forMELD-XI. During VAD support, cholestasis initially worsened but eventuallyimproved. Patients with pre-VAD liver dysfunction who survived to transplant had lower post-transplant survival (p = 0.0193). However, if MELD-XI normalizedduring VAD support, post-transplant survival improved and was similar to that of patients with low MELD-XI scores.CONCLUSIONS: MELD-XI is a viable alternative for assessing liver dysfunction inheart failure patients on oral anti-coagulation. Liver dysfunction is associated with worse survival. However, if MELD-XI improves during VAD support,post-transplant survival is similar to those without prior liver dysfunction,suggesting an important prognostic role. We also found evidence of a transientcholestatic state after LVAD implantation that deserves further examination.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
