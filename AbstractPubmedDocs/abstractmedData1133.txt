This study identifiespredictors for death and transplantation based on initial results from INTERMACS.METHODS: From June 23, 2006 to December 31, 2007, 420 patients from 75institutions were prospectively entered into the INTERMACS database in whichpre-implant data, indication for MCS device use, adverse events, demographics,hemodynamics, laboratory values and outcomes were recorded. Using competingoutcomes methodology, risk factors were identified for the events of death andtransplantation.RESULTS: The devices included 314 left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), 5right VADs (RVADs), 77 biventricular VADs (biVADs) and 24 total artificial hearts(TAHs) for a total of 497 pumps in 420 patients. Among the BTT patients at 6months, 33% were alive with a device in place, 42% were transplanted, 22% haddied, and 3% were explanted for recovery. Among the DT patients at 6 months, 68% were alive with a device in place, 5% were transplanted, 25% had died, and 2%were explanted for recovery. The risk factors identified for death across allpatient groups include older age (relative risk [RR] = 1.41, p < 0.001), ascites (RR = 2.04, p = 0.003), increased bilirubin (RR = 1.49, p < 0.05) and INTERMACSLevel 1 (cardiogenic shock) (RR = 1.59, p = 0.02). The most common causes ofdeath were central nervous system (CNS) event (18.3% of deaths), multiple-organfailure (16.4%) and cardiac cause (right ventricular failure and arrhythmias,15.4%).CONCLUSIONS: Cardiogenic shock, advanced age and severe right heart failuremanifested as ascites or increased bilirubin are risk factors for death after MCStherapy. BTT patients who require biVAD support have a transplant rate similar tothat of LVAD-only patients, but their mortality at 6 and 12 months exceeds thatof LVAD-only patients. Consideration should be given to MCS referral before thesequelae of right ventricular failure dominate the advanced heart failuresyndrome.
