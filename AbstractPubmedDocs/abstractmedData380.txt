We describe apatient in whom disseminated malignancy was revealed by means of the apical core biopsy after extracorporeal life support and left ventricular assist deviceimplantation as a bridge to transplantation. This case emphasizes the importance of thorough oncological screening before VAD implantation and the possibleconsequences of circulating tumour cells in this device-assisted circulation.PMCID: PMC3805212
