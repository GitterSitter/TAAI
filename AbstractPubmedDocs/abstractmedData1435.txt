Although left ventricular assist devices may represent the futureof therapy for this disease, the first generation of these pumps are limited by anumber of factors that restrict their use to only the sickest of patients. Thedevelopment and clinical use of the MicroMed DeBakey VAD represents a paradigmshift in the field of heart disease, supporting the notion that mechanicalassistance can be achieved with continuous flow pumps. Axial flow devices, suchas the DeBakey VAD, may open new doors for smaller patients and children, as wellas improve the current standard of care for adults who require long-termcirculatory support.
