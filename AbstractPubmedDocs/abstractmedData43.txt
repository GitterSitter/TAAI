Experience withventricular assist device support for these patients as a bridge to hearttransplantation has been limited and often not resulted in successful hospitaldischarge. We report the successful use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart, The Woodlands, TX) ventricular assist device in bridging a child with Fontancirculation and systolic dysfunction to heart transplantation and discharge home.Copyright Â© 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
