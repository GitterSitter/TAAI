Our aim was to determine the impact of the type of LVAD and implant era on post-transplant survival.METHODS: In this study we included 8,557 patients from the registry of theInternational Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. We examinedpost-transplant outcomes in 1,100 patients bridged to transplant withpulsatile-flow LVADs between January 2000 and June 2004 (first era), 880 patientsbridged with pulsatile-flow LVADs between July 2004 and May 2008 (second era),and 417 patients bridged with continuous-flow LVADs in the second era. Patientswho required intravenous inotropes but not LVAD support (n = 2,728) and patients who did not require either LVAD or inotropes (n = 3,432) served as controls.RESULTS: Post-transplant survival of patients bridged with pulsatile LVADsimproved significantly between the first and the second era (p = 0.03). In thesecond era, there was no significant difference in post-transplant survival ofpatients bridged with pulsatile- vs continuous-flow LVADs (p = 0.26), andsurvival rates in the 2 groups were not statistically different from that of the non-LVAD group. Graft rejection was similar in patients bridged with LVADscompared to those without LVADs.CONCLUSIONS: In the most recent era, the use of either pulsatile- orcontinuous-flow LVADs did not result in increased post-transplant mortality. Thisfinding is important as the proportion of patients with LVADs at the time oftransplant has been rising.Published by Elsevier Inc.
