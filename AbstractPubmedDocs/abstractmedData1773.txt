Today, however, the majority of these devices are usedas a mechanical bridge in patients awaiting heart transplantation. With thisindication, important information on using mechanical assist devices has beenassembled. We present our experience, which has been gained since 1987 in thearea of patient selection, post-implant patient care and device maintenance. Morethan 450 patients have since been implanted with assist devices at ourinstitution. Mechanical circulatory support may not only lead to recovery fromsecondary organ failure, but also to myocardial remodeling and recovery of theheart function in some patients. Additionally we report our experience with anewly developed implantable axial flow pump and discuss the possibility and costsof permanent support in some patients.
