Epub 2011 Sep 27.Adjuvant Use of Ivabradine in Acute Heart Failure due to Myocarditis.Franke J(1), Schmahl D, Lehrke S, Pribe R, Bekeredjian R, Doesch AO, Ehlermann P,Schnabel P, Katus HA, Zugck C.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410,69120 Heidelberg, Germany.We report two cases of young men in whom acute heart failure due to myocarditiswas diagnosed. The patients had been transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU)with commencing symptoms of acute heart failure and consecutive multiorganfailure for further treatment and to evaluate the indication for implantation of a ventricular assist device or for high urgent orthotopic heart transplantation. In both patients, the I(f)-channel inhibitor ivabradine was administeredoff-label to provide selective heart rate reduction, and thus support hemodynamicstabilization. Though currently considered off-label use in patients sufferingfrom severe hypotension and acute heart failure, the use of ivabradine maybeneficially influence outcome by allowing optimization of the patient's heartrate concomitant to initial measures of clinical stabilization.PMCID: PMC3180827
