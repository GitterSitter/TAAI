Ann Thorac Surg. 1994 Mar;57(3):634-7; discussion 637-8.Preperitoneal insertion of the HeartMate 1000 IP implantable left ventricularassist device.McCarthy PM(1), Wang N, Vargo R.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cleveland ClinicFoundation, Ohio 44195.During a 16-month period, 12 consecutive patients underwent insertion of aHeartMate 1000 IP left ventricular assist device in a preperitoneal pocket thatseparated the device from the abdomen. All patients were in cardiogenic shockawaiting heart transplantation. Preoperatively, the mean cardiac index was 1.6L.min-1.m-2, with 11 patients on intraaortic balloon pump support and 2 onextracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The pocket was formed below the rectusabdominis and internal oblique muscles and above the posterior rectus sheath. Thepump fit easily in all patients. One patient died of progressive multiorganfailure. Four patients are still on support. Seven patients underwent successful transplantation after a mean duration of 55 days of support (mean pump index was 3.1 L.min-1.m-2 during support). One patient had driveline revision because of anexit site infection but had successful transplantation. The pump was explantedwithout difficulty at each transplant operation. All patients havingtransplantation are alive and well. Preperitoneal insertion of the HeartMate leftventricular assist device can be safely performed and may avoid problems posed byintraabdominal left ventricular assist device insertion.
