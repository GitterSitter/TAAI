However, ECLS istypically not used as a bridge to heart transplantation because of the limitedduration of ECLS. In France, high-urgency priority heart transplantation remains a possibility for transplant patients who are on ECLS. In this article, wepresent our experience with high-urgency priority heart transplantation afterECLS. From July 2004 to December 2009, 242 patients underwent emergent ECLS.Heart transplantation was performed in eight of these patients. Time of ECLS was 6.3 ± 4.6 d. Before heart transplantation, all patients on ECLS had decreasedorgan dysfunctions and four were conscious. Despite frequent post-operativecomplications, no death occurred during the first year after transplantation. In our experience, ECLS is a valid method of supporting patients awaitinghigh-urgency heart transplantation and can be used as a short-term bridge toheart transplantation.© 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
