The aim of this study is to report our clinical experience with theLevitronix CentriMag for uni- and biventricular support.METHODS: Between July 2004 and December 2006, 27 patients were supported usingthe Levitronix CentriMag device. Nineteen were male. Mean age was 47.9 (range 19 to 72) years. Indications for support at implantation were cardiogenic shock thatincluded: end-stage heart failure and too ill to undergo transplantation, withquestionable neurologic status (9 subjects); right ventricular failure after leftVAD (LVAD) implantation (5 subjects); post-cardiotomy status (7 subjects); andacute donor graft failure after heart transplantation (6 subjects).RESULTS: Post-VAD 30-day survival was 30% (8 patients). Mean support time was 11 days for all patients (range 1 to 51 days). Mean support time for 14 Levitronixbiventricular VADs was 11 (range 1 to 51) days. Mean support time for 7Levitronix LVADs was 13.7 (range 1 to 30) days. The highest survival rates after Levitronix support were after donor graft failure (50%) and after cardiotomy(42%). Levitronix right VAD (RVAD) support after long-term LVAD insertionincurred 100% hospital mortality. Of those who survived, 8 patients weredischarged home after VAD support and remain alive to date. Two patients werebridged to primary and another bridged to repeat heart transplantation. Fivepatients were weaned to recovery. Re-operation for bleeding occurred in 8patients, clinical evidence of cerebral thromboembolism in 3, overwhelming sepsisin 1, and aortic thrombus formation in 1. Clot formation in the tubing wasobserved in 1 patient, necessitating emergent replacement at bedside, which wassuccessful.CONCLUSIONS: The Levitronix CentriMag system is a reliable and facile temporarycirculatory support system as a bridge to decision in patients with refractoryacute cardiogenic shock.
