In order toidentify more severe patients, BNP values and changes at 6 months weredichotomized according to their upper tertile (>1100 and >or=70 pg/ml,respectively).RESULTS: Median baseline BNP was 719 pg/ml. After a median of 45 months, 40events were observed (three cardiac assist device implants, 16 urgent hearttransplantations, 13 sudden deaths and eight deaths from heart failure). Theevent rate was 10.0 and 32.3 per 100 person-years in patients with low and highBNP, respectively. In a bivariable Cox regression, BNP at entry in the list andchange in BNP at 6 months were independent predictors of events, with hazardratios of 4.10 (95% confidence interval 2.14-7.88, P<0.001) and 4.55 (95%confidence interval 2.36-8.80, P<0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the riskincreased from neither BNP/BNP change, to one of them and to both of thempresent.CONCLUSION: Both high baseline and further increase in BNP levels during midterm follow-up are strong predictors of events in patients with advanced heart failureawaiting heart transplantation.
