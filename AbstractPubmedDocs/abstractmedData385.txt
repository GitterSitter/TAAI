Wereport the case of a patient who was supported with the same Levitronix CentriMagpump for 119 days without changing any components of the circuit or the pump headbecause of an anatomical condition which precluded the feasibility of pumpexchange and who did not experience any mechanical failure of the impeller buteventually died due to the rupture of the cannulae. This is the first report offailure of paracorporeal short-term LVAD due to disruption of one cannula with a properly functioning pump.Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
