Long-term reliability of VADs will become increasingly vital asthe population of destination therapy patients expands. In this study, eight HVADpumps (n = 8) completed a 6-year reliability test in the HeartWare Life CycleTesting System, an in-vitro mock circulatory loop that simulated physiologicpressures and flows. Cumulative runtime for the pumps was 2,408 Â± 60 days. Duringthis time, no device failures of any type occurred. These results stronglysupport the durability of the pump design.
