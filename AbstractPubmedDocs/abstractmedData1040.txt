Despite its success, the clinical course for patientsrequiring noncardiac surgery (NCS) during VAD support is not well described. The objective of this study was to identify VAD patients requiring NCS (+NCS) andcompare outcomes with those not requiring NCS (-NCS).METHODS: Patients undergoing VAD implant from 2000 to 2007 were reviewed. NCSprocedures, survival, and complications were collected. Survival at 1 year fromimplant, overall survival at the study conclusion, survival time from implant,and outcome of VAD therapy were compared between groups.RESULTS: We enrolled 142 subjects. Demographics did not differ between groups.Twenty-five subjects (18%) underwent 27 NCS procedures. Perioperative survivalwas 100% and 28-day survival was 64%. Survival to discharge was 56%. Bleedingoccurred in 48%. Infection occurred in 33%. Estimated blood loss was 355 mL, and the international normalized ratio at time of NCS was 1.9. Laparoscopy wasperformed in 3 cases. There was no difference in 1-year survival (59% vs 54%),survival at study conclusion (44% vs 46%) or survival time (517 vs 523 days)between +NCS subjects and -NCS subjects. There were similar causes of death inboth groups. The +NCS group was on VAD support longer (245 vs 87 days; P < .01), and less likely to undergo heart transplantation (12% vs 35%; P < .01).CONCLUSION: NCS is not uncommon during VAD therapy. Bleeding and infection werecommon complications. Despite this, NCS seems to be feasible and safe and doesnot seem to increase mortality in the VAD population.
