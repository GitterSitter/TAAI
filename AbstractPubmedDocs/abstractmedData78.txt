Of these, 122 (63%) successfully bridged patients were retrospectivelyreviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to their waiting time with CF-LVAD support of <1 year or ≥1 year.RESULTS: The study cohort was a mean age of 54 ± 13 years, 79% were male, and 35%had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of CF-LVAD support beforetransplantation was 296 days (range, 27-1,413 days). The overall 30-day mortalitywas 4.1%. Overall post-transplant survival was 88%, 84%, 78% at 1, 3, and 5years, respectively. The 32 patients (26%) with ≥1 year of CF-LVAD support (mean,635 days) were more likely to have blood type O, a larger body size, and to have been readmitted due to recurrent heart failure and device failure requiringexchange than those with <1 year of CF-LVAD support. Patients who requiredprolonged support time also had worse in-hospital mortality (16% vs 6.7%, p =0.12) and significantly lower survival at 3 years after transplantation (68% vs88%, p = 0.049).CONCLUSIONS: The overall short-term and long-term cardiac transplant outcomes of patients supported with CF-LVAD are satisfactory. However, patients who requireprolonged CF-LVAD support may have diminished post-transplant survival due toadverse events occurring during device support.Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc.
