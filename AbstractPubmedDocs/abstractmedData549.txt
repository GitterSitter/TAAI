The risk of profound GF has not declined in the past decade, as the consequence of the liberalisation of donor acceptance criteria because of the scarcity of donors. It is thereforeimportant to try to diagnose graft failure and recognise the mechanisms of early graft dysfunction.AIM: To establish haemodynamic and echocardiographic criteria of early GF todefine patients who should be considered for assist device support orre-transplantation.METHODS: Between January 2000 and March 2009, 116 HTx patients were studied. Onthe basis of echocardiography and continuous invasive monitoring, three groupswere identified: (1) The true graft failure group (GF) consisted of 46 patients; (2) The latent right ventricular (RV) dysfunction group (RV-D) consisted of 25patients with small left ventricular (LV) chamber (〈 39 mm) and RV ejectionfraction (RVEF) 〈 50%; (3) The control group consisted of 45 consecutive HTxpatients without any haemodynamic complications.RESULTS: Postoperatively, only the GF group required large doses ofnorepinephrine (〉 0.3 μmg/kg/min) and inhalative NO (40 ppm). Nevertheless, rightand left filling pressures were significantly higher than in the controls (right 12 ± 3.6 vs. 9.0 ± 2 and left atrial pressure 13.0 ± 3.2 vs. 9.6 ± 2 mm Hg, both p 〈 0.001). Cardiac index was significantly smaller (2.9 ± 0.7 vs. 3.7 ± 0.9, p 〈0.001) but neither pulmonary artery pressure (29.5 ± 6 vs. 29.7 ± 7 mm Hg) nortranspulmonary gradient (6 ± 5 vs. 5.1 ± 5 mm Hg) nor pulmonary vascularresistance (273 ± 97 vs. 287 ± 144 dyn × s × cm-5) differed significantly fromthose of the control group. In the GF group, LV end diastolic dimension (LVEDD)was significantly smaller and function poorer than in controls (39.8 ± 5 vs. 44.4± 5 mm, respectively, p = 0.001). RV function was also significantly worse (RVEF 42.2 ± 14% vs. 56.0 ± 9%), respectively, p = 0.001), whereas RV dimension did notdiffer significantly. Mechanical support after failure of the initial medicaltreatment was necessary in 37% of patients; 29 (63.0%) patients from the GF groupdied, the cause of death being sepsis with multi-organ failure. In the RV-Dgroup, remodelling was quite similar but LVEF was excellent and maximal systolic velocity from the posterior wall was significantly higher than in GF. No deathoccurred.CONCLUSIONS: True early GF represents a grave haemodynamic situation with highmortality. Bedside echocardiography helps to distinguish between latent RVdysfunction and true GF.
