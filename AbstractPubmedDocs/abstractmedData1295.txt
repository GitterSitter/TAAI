Initially developed as a 'bridge to transplantation', theyare now implanted permanently in patients who need cardiac replacement but arenot candidates for cardiac transplantation ('destination therapy'). Furthermore, observations from expert centers indicate that a significant proportion ofpatients under long-term mechanical assistance can be weaned from mechanicalcirculatory support after significant functional recovery of their native heart('bridge to recovery'). This review discusses the emerging roles of mechanicalcirculatory support and their direct implications in clinical practice. Evolutionof devices, important aspects of candidate selection, challenging issues in themanagement of ventricular-assist device patients (infection, device malfunction, anticoagulation-thromboembolic complications, psychosocial issues and cost) andongoing research targeting sustained myocardial recovery are discussed.
