Epub 2014 Jan 13.Short-term mechanical circulatory support by veno-arterial extracorporealmembrane oxygenation in the management of cardiogenic shock and end-stage heartfailure.Brugts JJ(1), Caliskan K.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, Erasmus MC Thoraxcenter, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.Despite modern treatment modalities, cardiogenic shock is associated with a very high risk of mortality and morbidity. The short- and long-term survival inpatients with cardiogenic shock or end-stage heart failure has improvedconsiderably by recent technological advances in short and long-term mechanicalcirculatory support devices. For short-term mechanical support, veno-arterialextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has been increasingly used asbridge-to-decision and bridge-to-recovery in cardiogenic shock patients.Long-term mechanical circulatory support devices such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are widely available and play a central role inbridge-to-transplantation in those eligible for heart transplantation (HTX) andas destination therapy (DT) in those not eligible for heart transplantation.Nevertheless, patients with critical cardiogenic shock show a deleterious outcomeafter LVAD-implantation or HTX with higher mortality, more complications andhigher burden on financial resources. These considerations underscore theimportance of optimal timing and appropriate patient selection for eventual LVAD therapy. The current report will focus on the immediate management of patientswith cardiogenic shock with inotropes, discuss the use of IABP and focus mainlyon pivotal choices to be made in the period spanned by short term mechanicalcirculatory support in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock.
