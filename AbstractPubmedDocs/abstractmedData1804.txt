Prog Cardiovasc Dis. 2000 Jul-Aug;43(1):27-36.Clinically available extracorporeal assist devices.Dowling RD(1), Etoch SW.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Jewish Hospital Heart and Lung Institute, University ofLouisville, KY, USA. rddowl01@athena.louisville.eduMechanical circulatory support has been shown to be of benefit to allow recovery after conventional heart surgery and as a successful bridge to hearttransplantation. Recent clinical trials with implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been completed with these devices showing restoration ofnormal hemodynamics and successful bridge to transplantation. A major advantageof the implantable devices is the ability for the patient to be discharged andfollowed up at an outpatient setting. However, multiple advantages toextracorporeal devices still remain, which are the focus of this review. Oneadvantage of the extracorporeal devices is that they can be placed in muchsmaller patients than currently available implantable LVADs. Also, because ofdifferences in design of the assist devices, the extracorporeal devices can beplaced without the need for the cardiopulmonary bypass and with decreasedoperative time and dissection. Perhaps the biggest advantage of theextracorporeal devices is that they can provide a support for both the right and left side of the heart as opposed to the implantable LVADs, which are only usedas left ventricular assist devices. This article describes in detail theadvantages and disadvantages of the extracorporeal devices as well as theoperative techniques used to implant them. As the number of patients with heartfailure continues to rise, so will the need for mechanical circulatory support.Though the majority of these patients will be served by a long-term implantabledevice, there will remain a subset of patients that will be best suited fortreatment with extracorporeal devices.
