The purpose of this study was to compare the gene expression profilesof recovered and non-recovered LVAD patients in order to identify mechanismsunderlying the recovery process and differences which may determine outcome.Myocardial expression of 54 genes chosen for their potential role in heartfailure and tissue repair was measured using quantitative PCR at the time of LVADimplantation and again at explantation (recovery, n = 13) or transplantation(non-recovery, n = 5). Patients who went on to recover had higher levels of Giα2,EPAC2 and lower levels of IGF2 at the time of LVAD implant compared to patientswho failed to recover. During recovery, expression of BNP, IL-1β, VWF and SFRP1was decreased whilst RGS4 increased. Expression of IGF1 and pro-fibrotic geneswas coordinated during recovery. Correlation analysis identified a novelco-regulation of SFRP1 and βMHC in myocardium. In summary, the gene expressionprofile underlying recovery is complex and comprises both regression andexacerbation of elements of the pathological gene program. Modulation of Giα2,EPAC2, RGS4 and SFRP1 indicates that inhibition of cAMP signalling may potentiaterecovery prior to treatment whilst enhanced cAMP and Wnt signalling may underlie recovery during LVAD support.
