J Heart Lung Transplant. 2003 Dec;22(12):1304-13.Non-invasive assessment of myocardial recovery on chronic left ventricular assistdevice: results associated with successful device removal.Gorcsan J 3rd(1), Severyn D, Murali S, Kormos RL.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, University of Pittsburgh, S564 Scaife Hall, 200Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. gorcsanj@msx.upmc.eduBACKGROUND: Myocardial recovery may occur in patients with heart failure who are receiving left ventricular assist-device support, but identification ofcandidates for device removal remains challenging. We hypothesized that on-linequantitative echocardiography during trials of decreased device support alone or in combination with exercise cardiopulmonary testing can assess cardiac recovery to predict successful device removal.METHODS: We studied 18 patients with severe heart failure, aged 45 +/- 19 years, who received 234 +/- 169 days of assist-device support as a bridge totransplantation. We used echocardiographic automated border detection frommid-ventricular short-axis images and non-invasive arterial pressure to measurebeat-to-beat responses in 2 to 5 minute trials of decreased device flow. We also assessed maximal oxygen consumption in 14 patients who could exercise.RESULTS: Six patients experienced myocardial recovery and underwent successfuldevice removal; 12 remained device dependent. With transient, low assist-deviceflow, patients with device removal had increased echocardiographic stroke area of27% +/- 36% vs -24% +/- 12% (p < 0.05) and fractional area change of 51% +/- 13% vs 23% +/- 11% (p < 0.05) in the patients who were device dependent. Estimates ofpre-load-adjusted maximal power, a relatively load-independent index, were 6.7+/- 2.1 mW/cm(4) in patients with successful device removal vs 1.2 +/- 1.2mW/cm(4) in patients who were device dependent (p < 0.005). Maximal oxygenconsumption was 17.2 +/- 1.4 ml/kg/min in patients with myocardial recovery vs13.1 +/- 1.9 ml/kg/min in patients who were device dependent (p < 0.005) andcorrelated with pre-load-adjusted maximal power (r = 0.89, p < 0.001). Maximaloxygen consumption >16 ml/kg/min, increased stroke area, >40% increase infractional area change, or pre-load-adjusted maximal power >4.0 mW/cm(4) with lowdevice flow were associated with successful device removal (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: On-line quantitative echocardiography alone or combined withexercise cardiopulmonary testing can assess myocardial recovery of patientsreceiving left ventricular assist-device support and has the potential toidentify patients who are clinical candidates for device removal.
