In the near future, more and more cardiologists will encounterVAD patients in their clinical practice and need to know how to handle theinherent risks associated with VAD use. The emergency care of a VAD patientdiffers from that of conventional practice and specific expertise is required to avoid inappropriate management that could lead to inefficient treatment and/ordangerous consequences. Here, we describe two emergency scenarios in VADpatients, two paradigmatic clinical in-hospital situations, in differentsettings. Following a brief overview of the role of cardiopulmonary resuscitationmaneuvers in VAD patients, we propose a working algorithm that might help toensure a timely and efficient response to acute demands in this setting.© 2013.
