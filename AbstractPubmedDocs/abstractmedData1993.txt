Timone, Marseille, France.Use of cardiopulmonary support (CPS) by peripheral access with a membraneoxygenator has made considerable progress as a result of the development ofcentrifugal pumps, percutaneous cannulation, and preheparinized circuits. We haveused CPS for resuscitation in 3 cases, for recovery after cardiotomy in 6 cases(myocardial insufficiency, 4; pulmonary arterial hypertension, 1; respiratoryinsufficiency, 1), and after heart transplantation in 1 case. Of these 10patients, 3 died during CPS, 5 were successfully weaned, and 2 underwent hearttransplantation. Use of CPS is expanding for emergency cardiac assistance.Installation is simple and rapid. It allows recovery of organs pending moreinvasive and costly techniques.
