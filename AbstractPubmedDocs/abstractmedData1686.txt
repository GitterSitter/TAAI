There were five perioperative deaths (13%), two due toright ventricular failure, two as a result of bleeding and one probably due toseptic shock at the time of LVAD implantation. Three patients (9%) died late inthe postoperative period due to septic shock, mechanical failure of the deviceand a cerebral embolus resulting from LVAD endocarditis, initiated by an acutecholecystitis. Twelve patients (32%) had one or more infectious episodes duringlong-term assist, of which one patient died. Four patients are still on thedevice, waiting for a heart transplantation. Twenty-six patients (76%) underwent HTx after 206±129 days of support.CONCLUSION: These results show the efficacy of LVAD support as a bridge to heart transplantation in patients with end-stage heart failure. Major long-termcomplications are infections and mechanical failure of the device.PMCID: PMC2499769
