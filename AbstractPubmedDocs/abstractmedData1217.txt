We present ourexperience since 1987.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between July 1987 and December 2006, 1026 VADs wereimplanted in 970 patients. Most of them were men (81.9%). The indications were:cardiomyopathy (n = 708), postcardiotomy heart failure (n = 173), acutemyocardial infarction (n = 36), acute graft failure (n = 45), a VAD problem (n = 6), and others (n = 2). Mean age was 46.1 (range 3 days to 78) years. In 50.5% ofthe patients the VAD implanted was left ventricular, in 47.9% biventricular, and in 1.5% right ventricular. There were 14 different types of VAD. A totalartificial heart was implanted in 14 patients.RESULTS: Survival analysis showed higher early mortality (p < 0.05) in thepostcardiotomy group (50.9%) than in patients with preoperative profoundcardiogenic shock (31.1%) and patients with preoperative end-stage heart failure without severe shock (28.9%). A total of 270 patients were successfully bridgedto heart transplantation (HTx). There were no significant differences inlong-term survival after HTx among patients with and without previous VAD. In 76 patients the device could be explanted after myocardial recovery. In 72 patients the aim of implantation was permanent support. During the study period 114patients were discharged home. Currently, 54 patients are on a device.CONCLUSIONS: VAD implantation may lead to recovery from secondary organ failure. Patients should be considered for VAD implantation before profound, possiblyirreversible, cardiogenic shock occurs. In patients with postcardiotomy heartfailure, a more efficient algorithm should be developed to improve survival. Withincreased experience, more VAD patients can participate in out-patient programs.
