As support duration for VADscontinues to rise, patient management and device maintenance will play anincreasingly crucial role. The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System has currently been implanted in >4,000 patients worldwide. The HeartWare controller storesapproximately 30 days of VAD data including pump rotational speed, powerconsumption, and estimated VAD flow. Routine assessment of controller log filescan serve as a pump performance tool and clinical management aid, assisting theclinician to make accurate and timely diagnoses. Here, we discuss thecontroller's data collection system as well as present the process for evaluationand reporting of controller log files to clinicians.
