Recovery of dilated cardiomyopathies with thecombination left ventricular decompression with a VAD and treatment with maximal medical therapy has been possible in some adults, and may be more feasible ininfants and children. We used pulsatile and continuous flow VADs and the totalartificial heart (TAH) as bridges to transplantation or to recovery. Candidatesfor native heart recovery were treated with maximal medical therapy forcongestive heart failure and short-term dobutamine prior to weaning off devicesupport. Since 1997, 28 infants and children, ages 1 month to 16 years, wereimplanted for durations of 3-107 days (mean 27). Eighteen received left VADs(LVAD), seven biventricular assist devices (BiVADs), and three TAHs.Device-related mortality was 7/28 (25%), leaving 21/28 (75%) surviving totransplantation or weaning from device support and 20/28 (71%) discharged fromthe hospital and currently surviving for 2 months to 9 years. Ten of 11transplant recipients (90%) have survived 2 to 9 years. All 10 with recoveredhearts are alive and well for 2 months to 5 years. Eight of 12 (67%) LVADpatients with dilated hearts recovered. None of the recovery patients were over 6years old. Infants and children who have failed inotropic therapy may be treated with an LVAD and medical therapy for congestive heart failure anticipating nativeheart recovery. A variety of devices have been tried. All small LVADs yieldedcomparable results. Larger and older children also have a chance of recovery, butour experience with them is too small except to note that they do well withlarger devices and transplantation.© 2010, Copyright the Authors.
