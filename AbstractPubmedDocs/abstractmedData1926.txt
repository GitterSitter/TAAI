Seven potentialtransplant candidates (six male, one female, mean age 26 years) with such heartfailure, following desferrioxamine application subcutaneously over a number ofyears, and intravenously during their hospitalization before transplantation,were retrospectively analysed. Five were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV, three experienced one or more resuscitations immediately beforetransplantation could be performed. Continuous, high-volume, veno-venoushaemofiltration was necessary in two patients. One of these two candidatesadditionally had to be bridged, first with a right ventricular, then with abiventricular assist device. Five of the seven patients survived, two withhaemochromatosis, one with beta-thalassaemia major and one with Diamond-Blackfan syndrome following transplantation. One non-transplanted candidate withbeta-thalassaemia major has been recompensated for 5 years. Survival was 14-74months. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and indication of transplantationin patients with such heart failure and the satisfying outcome ofimmunosuppression is described.
