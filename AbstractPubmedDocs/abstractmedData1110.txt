The different flow characteristics of this new technique lead to alteration in shear stress on blood components, which may affect the coagulation system. Repeated vonWillebrand factor analyses were performed in a patient who first was implantedwith a pulsatile ventricular assist device (Thoratec HeartMate XVE), which had tobe replaced after 405 days with an axial flow device (HeartMate II). Duringsupport with the pulsatile ventricular assist device there was no sign of anycoagulation disorder. However, on the axial flow device acquired von Willebrandsyndrome Type 2 developed. Inhibition of platelet function was also observed,which may be in part due to the von Willebrand syndrome. The HeartMate II axialflow device may induce von Willebrand syndrome, which was not observed inHeartMate XVE pulsatile ventricular assist device. Patients put on continuousflow devices should be screened for acquired von Willebrand syndrome.
