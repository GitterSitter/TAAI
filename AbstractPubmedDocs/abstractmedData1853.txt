Theprognostic significance of AF remains controversial. To determine the relation ofAF to survival in patients with advanced heart failure, 234 consecutive patients referred for heart transplantation evaluation from January 1993 to June 1996 werestudied to determine the effect of AF on event-free survival (freedom from death,heart transplantation, or placement of a left ventricular assist device).Clinical characteristics of the study population included: age, 51 +/- 17 years; maximum exercise oxygen consumption, 14.2 +/- 5.3 ml/kg/min; left ventricularejection fraction, 24 +/- 11%; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 23 +/- 9 mmHg; and ischemic etiology, 52%. Medical therapy included: diuretics (86%),angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (80%), digoxin (80%), andanticoagulation therapy (72%). Mean duration of follow-up was 1.1 +/- 1.0 years. Sixty-two patients (27.4%) had AF. One-year event-free survival of the studypopulation was 48%. No difference in event-free survival between patients withand without AF was observed. Univariate predictors of decreased event-freesurvival included: (1) advanced New York Heart Association class; (2) higherpulmonary capillary wedge pressure; (3) lower cardiac index; (4) lower maximumexercise oxygen consumption; (5) use of inotropic therapy; and (6) greaterpulmonary artery systolic pressure. By multivariate analysis, independentpredictors of decreased event-free survival included advanced New York HeartAssociation class (p <0.002) and higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p =0.02). Thus, AF in patients with advanced heart failure is not associated withdecreased event-free survival.
