The aim of this study is to report on the first clinical application of the system and to evaluate the thrombotic risk with theuse of the biomarker prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 and scanning electron microscopyof the blood contacting surface.METHODS AND RESULTS: This device worked without any failure for 462 hours, and a sufficient output of 5.2 to 6 L was observed. No activation of the procoagulatorysystem occurred during pumping until the occurrence of the septicemia. Preseptic F1 + 2 levels were normal, at about 1 nmol/L. The blood contacting surfaces ofthe pump and the polyurethane valves were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy, and the surfaces were found to have smooth fibrin layers with nothrombogenic deposits. This fibrin layer is considered to prevent thromboticadhesions, thereby minimizing the risk of thromboembolic complications. Postmortem examinations after pneumonia with septic shock showed no thrombusformation in this support system and around the inserted cannulas.CONCLUSIONS: The low risk for thromboembolic complications, no measurableactivation of the coagulation system, and the excellent surface characteristicsencourage further use of this inexpensive working device.
