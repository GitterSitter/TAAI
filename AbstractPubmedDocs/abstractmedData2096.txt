Z Kardiol. 1991;80 Suppl 4:27-33.[Enoximone as pharmacologic "bridging" to heart transplantation].[Article in German]Friedel N(1), Teebken M, Lemme A, Sch√ºler S, Hetzer R.Author information: (1)Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin.The efficacy of enoximone (EN), a new phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was studied in24 patients (pts.) with end-stage cardiac disease due to dilative cardiomyopathy (21 pts.) or coronary heart disease (3 pts.). All pts. admitted for urgenttransplantation or mechanical circulatory support demonstrated advanced cardiacfailure unresponsive to conventional pharmacotherapy. Despite maximalcatecholamine and vasodilator therapy the cardiac index averaged 2.08 l/min perm2, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 24 mmHg, and the systemicvascular resistance (SVR) 1450 dyn* s* cm-5. In addition to the previoussympathomimetic medication EN was administered as a bolus injection of 1 mg/kgfollowed by a continuous infusion of 4 to 10 micrograms/kg/min. In all but 4non-responding pts., who eventually died, clinical and hemodynamic conditionsimproved significantly within 4 h: CI increased from 2.08 to 3.1 l/min/m2, PCWPdropped from 24 to 17 mmHg, and SVR decreased from 1450 to 950 dyn* s* cm-5 (all p less than 0.05). After initial improvement, 9 pts. experienced acutehemodynamic and clinical deterioration leading to implantation of abiventricular-assist device (Berlin Heart) in 6 pts., while 3 pts. died ofirreversible cardiogenic shock. However, of the remaining 15 pts., whodemonstrated sustained hemodynamic improvement, 11 could be weaned off theiradrenergic medication and remained on oral EN (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg TID). Three pts. received heart transplants within 8 to 12 weeks; 7 pts. were still on the waitinglist at the end of the study, and 1 pt. died after withdrawal of oral EN.2
