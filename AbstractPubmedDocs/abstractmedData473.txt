"Bridging-to-recovery" byimplantation of a percutaneous cardiac assist device].[Article in German]Wilde J(1), Klingel K, Kandolf R, Schuler G, Sandri M.Author information: (1)Klinik für Innere Medizin/ Kardiologie, Herzzentrum Leipzig GmbH derUniversität Leipzig. johannes_wilde@web.deHISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 27-year-old man presented with acute dyspneaand a previous respiratory tract infection with progressive dyspnoea and chestpain over 2 weeks. Clinical findings revealed severe cardiac failure withdevelopment of cardiogenic shock and need for adrenergic drug therapy forcirculatory support.INVESTIGATIONS: The electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia with unspecific T-wave-inversions, the echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle andseverely reduced systolic LV-function. An acute coronary syndrome could beexcluded by coronary angiogram.TREATMENT AND COURSE: A myocardial biopsy was taken to exclude giant cellmyocarditis. The immediate initiation of a mechanical circulatory support by anExtracorporal Membrane Oxygenator (ECMO) facilitated rapid hemodynamicstabilization and recovery of organ function.CONCLUSIONS: A drug-only circulatory support very often does not enablestabilization of a patient in progressive cardiogenic shock and cannot preventmultiorgan dysfunction. Therefore implantation of an assist device facilitates a "bridging-to-recovery" or a "bridging-to transplant" concept in critically illpatients presenting with cardiogenic shock. The bridging also allows forreviewing etiology and evaluation of further treatment options. In case ofrecovery continuous care in a specialized Heart Failure Clinic can help tomaintain the clinical status and offer frequent reevaluation of cardiac statusand therapeutic concepts.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
