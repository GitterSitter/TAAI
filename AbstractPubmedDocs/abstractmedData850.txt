Kristin-olsen@uiowa.eduApproximately 5 million Americans experience heart failure, which affects 10 inevery 1000 people older than 65 years. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are atype of mechanical circulatory support that aids in systemic perfusion bymaintaining unidirectional flow while reducing the oxygen demand of the failingventricle. There are 3 generations of VADs in circulation used as a bridge totransplantation, a bridge to recovery, or as destination therapy. Due to theincreasing use of these devices, it is likely that anesthetists will encounterpatients with these devices more frequently, which requires adequate preoperativediscussion with the care team. Intraoperatively, it is important to realize that patients with VADs are at higher risk for aspiration, to recognizeelectromagnetic interference from surgical devices, to maintain hemodynamicstability, and to monitor coagulation status. With proper knowledge, and adequatepreoperative preparation and intraoperative care, anesthetists should be able to achieve safe and successful patient outcomes through anesthesia care.
