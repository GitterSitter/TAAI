ASAIO J. 2003 Jul-Aug;49(4):355-64.Axial flow blood pumps.Song X(1), Throckmorton AL, Untaroiu A, Patel S, Allaire PE, Wood HG, Olsen DB.Author information: (1)Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, Virginia Artificial HeartInstitute University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.Each year, thousands of cardiac patients await healthy donor hearts fortransplantation. Due to the current shortage of donor hearts (approximately 2300 per year), these patients often require supplemental circulatory support until a transplant becomes available. This supplemental support is often provided by amechanical heart pump or left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This articleexplores one type of LVAD, specifically the design and development of axial flow ventricular assist devices (VAD). We discuss the design details, and experimentalor clinical experience with the following axial flow support systems: Hemopump,MicroMed DeBakey VAD, Jarvik 2000, HeartMate II, Streamliner, Impella, BerlinINCOR I, Valvo pump, and IVAP. All of these devices demonstrate promise inproviding bridge-to-transplant and ultimately destination therapy for adultcardiac failure patients.
