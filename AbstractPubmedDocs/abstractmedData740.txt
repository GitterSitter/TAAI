However, risk factors for post-VAD survival inchildren are still not clearly understood.METHODS: From June 1996 to December 2009, 92 children underwent implantation of along-term VAD at Germany Heart Institute Berlin. Data on all these patients were retrospectively analyzed, and pre-operative risk factors for in-hospital survivalafter VAD implantation were identified by multivariate logistic regression.RESULTS: Of the 92 subjects, the median age at implantation was 7 years (range 12days to 18 years), and the median support time was 35 days (range 1 to 591 days).The overall survival rate to transplantation or recovery of ventricular function was 63%. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in children includedcongenital etiology (odds ratio [OR]: 11.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 to 47.5), norepinephrine requirement (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 1.4 to 31), C-reactiveprotein level >6.3 mg/dl (OR: 4.9; 95% CI: 1.1 to 22.1), and central venouspressure >17 mm Hg (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 20).CONCLUSIONS: Congenital etiology, pre-operative norepinephrine requirement,higher serum C-reactive protein, and central venous pressure were associated withincreased in-hospital mortality in children with VAD support. Optimal candidateselection and timing of VAD insertion may be of great importance for improvedoutcomes in children with advanced heart failure.Copyright Â© 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
