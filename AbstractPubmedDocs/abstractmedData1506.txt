These device performance measures, however, have beeninadequately characterized in the bridge-to-transplantation literature.METHODS: REMATCH is a randomized trial that compares optimal medical managementwith LVAD implantation for patients with end-stage heart failure. An independent committee adjudicated patient outcomes. The primary endpoint--survival--wasanalyzed by intention to treat using the log-rank statistic. Frequency of eventoccurrence was analyzed by Poisson regression. The time to first event wasanalyzed by the product limit method. Device performance was disaggregated intoconfirmed malfunctions and system failures. The latter were events in whichpatients could not be rescued with backup circulatory support measures.RESULTS: The 1-year survival rate was 52% (95% confidence limit [CL]; 40%-63%)for LVAD patients versus 28% (95% CL; 17%-39%) for medical patients and the2-year survival rate was 29% (95% CL; 19%-40%) for LVAD patients versus 13% (95% CL; 5%-22%) for medical patients. System failure was 0.13 per patient per yearand the confirmed LVAD malfunction rate was 0.90. Freedom from device replacementwas 87% at 1 year and 37% at 2 years.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the observed rates of device malfunction and replacement,LVAD implantation confers clinically significant improvement with regard tosurvival as compared with medical management. Device modifications andinnovations for infection management exhibit great promise of improving deviceperformance in the near future.
