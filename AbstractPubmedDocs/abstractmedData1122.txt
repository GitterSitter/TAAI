In this study we analyzed ECM gene expression in patients with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy who did and did not develop sustained myocardial recovery after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) unloading combined with pharmacologictherapy.METHODS: Myocardial gene expression of collagens (COL1A1 and COL3A1), fibronectin(FN), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs 1 to 14), tissue inhibitors ofmetalloproteinases (TIMPs 1 to 4), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and THY1 was measured by real-timereverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at LVAD implantation andagain at explantation (recovery, n = 11) or transplantation (non-recovery, n =5).RESULTS: The non-recovery group had higher levels of pro-fibrotic markers(COL1A1, TGF-beta1 and THY1) at implantation compared with the recovery group(1.82 +/- 0.74-, 1.81 +/- 0.69- and 3.01 +/- 1.70-fold, respectively; p <or=0.05). Both recovery and non-recovery groups showed no significant difference in gene expression after treatment, but levels of pro-fibrotic genes (COL1A1,COL3A1, FN and THY1) correlated negatively with post-explant ejection fraction inthe recovery group. Of all genes analyzed only TIMP4 showed a significant change,with expression reduced during recovery (0.55 +/- 0.25-fold at explant vsimplant, p = 0.001). All other genes showed complex patterns between individuals with both increased and decreased expression of pro-fibrotic markers, MMPs andTIMPs in recovery patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who did not recover had higher myocardial expression ofpro-fibrotic genes at LVAD implantation, and in recovered patients higher levels at explant were negatively associated with subsequent ejection fraction. However,individual patients showed complex expression patterns and a decrease inpro-fibrotic markers was not required for recovery.
