With theadvent of continuous-flow LVADs, safe and effective long-term circulatory supportis available for properly identified candidates.RECENT FINDINGS: The highest mortality following LVAD implant is observed in the sickest patients (INTERMACS profile 1); therefore, there is an increasing trendtoward selecting patients with INTERMACS profiles 2-5. The less-ill patients willbe studied in the planned REVIVE-IT trial. The Heart Failure Survival Score,Seattle Heart Failure Model, and Destination Therapy Risk Score may provideguidance for patient selection and preoperative optimization therapy, but thesetools need to be updated for current LVAD technology. The current 1-year survivalrate for patients supported for destination therapy with a continuous-flow LVADis 74%, which represents an increase of 6% since the clinical trial was completed2 years ago.SUMMARY: Substantial progress has been made concerning survival and quality oflife since destination therapy was first introduced 10 years ago. Advances inpatient selection, improved LVAD technology, and optimized treatment strategiesprovide much optimism for the treatment of more heart failure patients in thefuture.
