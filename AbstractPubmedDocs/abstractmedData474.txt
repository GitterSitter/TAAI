Thesecarry significant cost and quality of life implications. We sought to describethe etiology and pattern of readmission among patients receiving CF-LVADs.METHODS: Frequency, reason, urgency, and duration of readmission as well asfreedom from readmission were examined in a retrospective review of ourinstitutional experience. As an indirect means of quality of life, the ratio ofdays out of hospital (OOH)/days alive with device was calculated.RESULTS: From 2006 to 2011, 71 adult patients implanted with a CF device wereincluded. Indication for device implantation was bridge to transplant (n=19),potential bridge to transplant (n=25), or destination therapy (n=27). Length ofsupport averaged 359 days. Total support time was 69.7 patient years. One hundredfifty-five readmissions accounted for a total of 1,659 hospital days. Fifty-sixpatients were readmitted during the study period. Median time to firstreadmission was 48 days (range 2 to 663 days). Median length of stay was 5 days. The single most common etiology for readmission was gastrointestinal bleedingaccounting for 14% of readmissions. Readmissions were urgent (87%), elective(10%), or life-threatening (3%). Patients on the average enjoyed 92% of theirtime OOH.CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing CF-LVAD support are often readmitted within 6months of discharge. Readmissions tend to be of short duration and the mostcommon reason is for gastrointestinal bleeding. Importantly, following discharge after implant procedure, 51 patients spent at least 90% of days OOH.Copyright Â© 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc. Allrights reserved.
