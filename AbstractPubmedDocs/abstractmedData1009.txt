Epub 2010Jan 12.Emerging ventricular assist devices for long-term cardiac support.Krishnamani R(1), DeNofrio D, Konstam MA.Author information: (1)The Cardiovascular Center, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, USA.Despite major advances in the treatment of heart failure over the past 2 decades improving the natural history of this condition, heart failure continues to be a major source of morbidity and mortality. Although availability of donor heartsfor transplantation has declined over the past several years, innovations inventricular assist device (VAD) technology has provided an alternativetherapeutic option for patients with advanced heart failure. Initiated as amechanical option to 'bridge' critically ill patients awaiting transplantation,VADs are being increasingly deployed as 'destination' devices to providelong-term support. With technical advances resulting in improved mechanicalreliability, reduced postoperative morbidity and greater likelihood of patientacceptance, there is interest in expanding the applicability for destination VAD treatment beyond the current indication of severely ill patients who are notcandidates for transplant. This Review examines the newer, third-generation VADs for mechanical cardiac support. These devices are at various stages ofdevelopment and clinical investigation. One or more of these newer devices islikely to emerge as an important development in the treatment of patients withadvanced heart failure.
