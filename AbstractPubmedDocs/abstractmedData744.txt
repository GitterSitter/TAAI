Nkapur@tuftsmedicalcenter.orgBACKGROUND: Medically refractory right ventricular failure (MR-RVF) is associatedwith high in-hospital mortality and is managed with surgical assist devices,atrial septostomy, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This study exploredthe hemodynamic effect associated with a percutaneous RV support device (pRVSD)for MR-RVF.METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, 9 patients with MR-RVF, defined as cardiogenicshock despite maximal medical therapy, were treated with a pRVSD. Medical recordswere reviewed for demographics, hemodynamic and laboratory data, and details ofpRVSD implantation.RESULTS: MR-RVF was due to severe sepsis in 1 patient (11.1%), post-cardiotomysyndrome in 2 (22.2%), and acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (IWMI) in 6 (66.7%). Five patients underwent right internal jugular-to-femoral cannulation,and 4 required bifemoral cannulation. No intra-procedural deaths or majorvascular complications requiring surgical or peripheral intervention occurred.Time from admission to pRVSD implantation was 2.9 ± 3.3 days, with an average of 6516 ± 698 rotations/min, providing flow at 3.3 ± 0.4 liters/min. Mean durationof pRVSD activation was 3.1 ± 1.8 days. Compared with pre-procedural values, meanarterial pressure (57 ± 7 vs 75 ± 19 mm Hg, p < 0.05), right atrial pressure (22 ± 3 vs 15 ± 6 mm Hg, p < 0.05), cardiac index (1.5 ± 0.4 vs 2.3 ± 0.5liters/min/m(2), p < 0.05), mixed venous oxygen saturation (40 ± 14 vs 58 ± 4percent, p < 0.05), and RV stroke work (3.4 ± 3.9 vs 9.7 ± 6.8 g · m/beat, p <0.05) improved significantly within 24 hours of pRVSD implantation. In-hospitalmortality was 44% (n = 4). Time from admission to pRVSD placement was lower inpatients who survived to hospital discharge (0.9 ± 0.8 days) vs non-survivors(4.8 ± 3.5 days; p = 0.04). All survivors presented with IWMI.CONCLUSION: Use of a pRVSD for MR-RVF is feasible and associated with improvedhemodynamics. Algorithms promoting earlier pRVSD use in MR-RVF warrant furtherinvestigation.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
