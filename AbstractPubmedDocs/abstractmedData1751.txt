Although these devices have high unit costs, they are the only hope for survival for a large group of terminally ill patients and are likely to have anexpansion in indications for use.METHODS: We calculated the costs associated with long-term LVAD implantation. We used the ratio of cost-to-charges method to calculate hospital costs per resourcecategory, market prices for drugs and device, and payments for physicianservices.RESULTS: Based on our experience with "bridge-to-transplantation" patients, weestimated average first-year costs to be $222,460 including professional fees and$192,154 excluding professional fees. The latter figure is comparable to average first-year costs for cardiac transplantation, which is $176,605 withoutprofessional fees at our institution.CONCLUSIONS: The costs of LVAD therapy will change after the first year ofimplantation, and device reliability and longevity will be important factors indetermining these costs. Should the costs of LVAD therapy continue to track thoseof cardiac transplantation, devices will be cost-effective only if they offersimilar efficacy to cardiac transplantation.
