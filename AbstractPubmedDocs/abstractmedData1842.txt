Class I were patient-relatednonblood infections, class II were blood-borne infections, class III werepercutaneous site infections, and class IV were infections of intracorporeal VAD components.RESULTS: The cumulative number and incidence of infections were higher during theearly VAD experience than in more recent patients (p < 0.05), although thecumulative number and incidence of class II and IV infections were similar inearlier and later patients. There were 28 serious (ie, class II and IV)infections in 9 patients who died, and 35 serious infections in 11 patients whosurvived until transplantation. Three of 4 patients with class IV infectionsdied. A larger cumulative number of infections (ie, total class I-IV) wasassociated with more fungal isolates (p < 0.001) and more class II and IVinfections (p < 0.02). Positive fungal cultures were obtained in 16 patients, butthere were only 3 class III and 1 class IV fungal isolates.CONCLUSIONS: Infection remains an important problem for patients with VADs.Bloodstream infections (class II) can often be controlled by appropriate therapy.However, intracorporeal device infections (class IV) are associated withsubstantial morbidity and mortality. Optimal implant techniques together withoptimal wound care, appropriate use of prophylactic antibiotics, and avoidance ofinfection in indwelling catheters remain the most practical means for minimizing the risk of VAD infection.
