This study examined effect of a left ventricular assist device on human neurophysiology.METHODS: This study evaluated the time course change of cardiac autonomicactivity of 3 patients during support with a left ventricular assist devicebefore cardiac transplantation. Cardiac autonomic activity was determined bypower spectral analysis of short-term heart rate variability. The heart ratevariability before cardiac transplantation was compared with that on the daybefore left ventricular assist device implantation.RESULTS: The standard deviation of the mean of the R-R intervals of theelectrocardiogram, an index of vagal activity, increased to 27 +/- 7 ms from 8+/- 0.6 ms. The modulus of power spectral components increased. Low frequency(sympathetic activity) and high frequency power (vagal activity) increased by amean of 9 and 22 times of each baseline value (low frequency power, 5.2 +/- 3.0ms2; high frequency power, 2.1 +/- 0.7 ms2). The low over high frequency powerratio decreased substantially, indicating an improvement of cardiacsympatho-vagal balance.CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that left ventricular assist devicesupport before cardiac transplantation may exert a favorable effect on cardiacautonomic control in patients with severe heart failure.
