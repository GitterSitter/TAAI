It consists of twopneumatic pumps with four mechanical valves that replace nearly the entiremyocardium, thus also making it effective therapy for heart failure fromalternative (ALT) anatomical and pathophysiological causes that preclude leftventricular assist device (LVAD). This report reviews the clinical indicationsand outcomes for TAH implantation at our institution from 2006 to 2012. We soughtto characterize and compare survival to transplant for patients with BiVHF tothose with ALT indications. The overall survival to transplant for all patientswas 86% (57/66). There was a trend towards decreased survival to transplantation in the ALT group compared with the BiVHF group (77% vs. 93%, HR 0.42 [95%confidence interval 0.1, 1.7], log-rank test: p = 0.2). This was likely driven bycertain high risk subgroups of allograft failure, LVAD failure, and acutepostinfarct shock.
