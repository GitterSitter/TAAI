This protocol permitted the rendering of safe and effective dentalcare in this setting and did not result in near-term (1-30 days) excessivehemorrhage, local and systemic infection, or contamination of the VAD.STUDY DESIGN: This descriptive cross-sectional study by the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles, Hospital Dental Service examined the dental care of 9patients (mean age, 50 ± 12.9 years) with class IV stage D heart failure.RESULTS: Nine patients, 22 days (mean) after VAD placement, received dentaltreatment after intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and maintenance of prioranticoagulation, antiplatelet, or antithrombin regimen. Eight patients hadextractions (mean, 4; range, 1-12), and one of them also required scaling androot planing (SRP) of the remaining teeth. A ninth individual only required SRPof 4 quadrants. No adverse outcomes developed.CONCLUSIONS: Emergent removal of active dental disease in patients with VADawaiting heart transplant can be safely accomplished using established protocols with extended vigilance.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
