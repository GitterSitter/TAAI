Circ J. 2004 Apr;68(4):383-4.Left ventricular mobile thrombus associated with ventricular assist device:diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography.Miyake Y(1), Sugioka K, Bussey CD, Di Tullio M, Homma S.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York,NY 10032, USA.Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been used as a bridge to cardiactransplantation in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure. Despiteadequate anticoagulation, thromboembolism is a major complication and inparticular, a left ventricular (LV) thrombus associated with VADs has beenreported as an important cause of thromboembolic complications. The frequency of LV thrombus formation in the patients with VAD support using LV apicalcannulation is reported to be low. A 61-year-old woman supported with VAD with LVapical cannulation had a mobile LV thrombus adjacent to the inflow cannuladiagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography.
