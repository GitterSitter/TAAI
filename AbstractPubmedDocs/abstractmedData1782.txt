Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2000 Jul;12(3):243-50.The thoratec ventricular assist device: a paracorporeal pump for treating acuteand chronic heart failure.Farrar DJ(1).Author information: (1)Thoratec Laboratories Corporation, Pleasanton, CA 94588, USA.The Thoratec Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) System (Thoratec Laboratories,Pleasanton, CA) is a paracorporeal pump that can provide univentricular orbiventricular assistance for patients with heart failure. The system consists of a prosthetic ventricle that has a blood-pumping chamber of Thoralon (ThoratecLaboratories) polyurethane, cannulas for univentricular or biventricular support,and either a hospital-based pneumatic drive console or a portable battery-powereddrive unit. For biventricular assistance, 2 pumps are used. The Thoratecvoluntary registry indicates that, as of May 2000, this system had been implantedin 1,376 patients, mainly for bridging to transplantation (828 patients) orpostcardiotomy support (195 patients); the remaining 353 patients received ahybrid configuration of the device or had incomplete information, so they are notincluded in this analysis. In the 828 bridge-to-transplant patients, the Thoratecsystem provided biventricular assistance in 472 cases, left ventricularassistance in 326 cases, and right ventricular assistance in 30 cases for up to515 days. During the support period, the cardiac index increased significantlyfrom 1.4 +/- 0.8 L/min/m2 to 3.0 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2 (with biventricular assistance and left ventricular cannulation). Sixty percent of the 828 patients underwenttransplantation, and the posttransplant survival rate was 86%. In the 195patients who needed postcardiotomy support, VADs were used for up to 80 days for cardiac recovery. Thirty-eight percent of the patients were weaned from the VAD, and 59% of the weaned group were discharged from the hospital. In addition, 49postcardiotomy patients were considered for transplantation; of these, 32received a transplant and 23 were discharged. Patient mobility is being improved by the use of a portable driver. The Thoratec VAD is suitable for a wide range ofapplications, and efforts are underway to facilitate patient mobility and allowhospital discharge. An intracorporeal version of the VAD, which is currentlyunder development, will help achieve these goals.
