ASAIO Trans. 1989 Jul-Sep;35(3):728-30.Anatomic considerations for abdominally placed permanent left ventricular assist devices.Parnis SM(1), McGee MG, Igo SR, Dasse K, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Cullen Cardiovascular Surgical Research Laboratories, Texas Heart Institute,Houston 77225.To determine anatomic parameters for a permanent, electrically actuated leftventricular assist device (LVAD), the effects of abdominal placement of pneumaticLVADs used as temporary support for patients awaiting heart transplantation wasstudied. Understanding the anatomic constraints imposed by the abdominal viscera in LVAD placement is crucial, because improper placement can result incompression or obstruction of adjacent structures. Anatomic compatibility wasassessed in four men (age 22-48 years) who were supported by the LVAD for over 1 month (range 35-132 days). The pump was intraperitoneally placed in the leftupper quadrant. Radiographic techniques were employed, including CT scanning(with patients supine) and contrast imaging (patients in anatomical position),and the pump and conduits appeared to be properly positioned, with minimalcompression of the body of the stomach, and no obstruction of adjacent organs.Three patients returned to a solid food diet and exercised daily by stationarycycling and walking. No signs of migration or erosion of the pump were present atthe time of LVAD removal and cardiac transplantation. Successful clinicalexperience with short-term use of the LVAD suggests that the electricallyactuated device can be well tolerated in patients requiring permanent leftventricular assistance.
