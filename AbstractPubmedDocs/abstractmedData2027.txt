This study was intended to assess whether cellular immune parameters have a predictive value for the clinical result of VAD-support.Various cellular immune markers were monitored by multiparameter cytofluorometry in 30 patients who received a VAD system (Berlin Heart). We did not findsignificant differences in preoperative values of immune parameters betweengroups of survivors (n = 14) and non-survivors (n = 16). All 9 patients who died of septic multiple organ failure (MOF) had shown increased levels of T-cellactivation (CD 71, CD 25, HLA-DR) as well as leukocytosis and 7 patients who diedof noninfectious complications (mostly hemorrhage or cerebral complications) had exhibited T-lymphopenia. Seven of 9 patients who died of septic MOF had extremelydecreased levels of HLA-DR+ monocytes (< 30%) while all 14 survivors and all 7patients who died of noninfectious complications showed almost normal monocyticHLA-DR antigen expression, antigen-presenting capacity and cytokine secretion.These observations point to the reduced antimicrobial immunity("immunoparalysis") in the non-survivors and may explain the fatal course ofinfection in these individuals. The in vitro results of restitution experimentscall for new therapeutic strategies to improve the survival of VAD-patients.
