Wesought to determine pre-operative right heart echocardiographic predictors ofpost-LVAD severe RV failure.METHODS: RV failure, defined as the need for inotropic support or pulmonaryvasodilators for >or=14 days post-operatively, was evaluated in 33 patients (age 54 +/- 13 years) with LVADs. Preoperative RV systolic and diastolicechocardiographic parameters, including RV fractional area change, tricuspidannular motion, right atrial volume index, RV index of myocardial performance,hepatic vein Doppler velocities, tricuspid regurgitation severity, and RVsystolic pressures (RVSPs) in patients with and without RV failure were compared.RESULTS: Of the 33 patients evaluated, 11 (33%) had post-LVAD RV failure (2needed RVAD support). Patients with post-LVAD RV failure had significantly lower pre-operative tricuspid annular motion (8 +/- 4 vs 15 +/- 6 mm, p < 0.01) andhigher RVSPs (60 +/- 14 vs 46 +/- 11 mm Hg, p = 0.02). In 13 patients (39%) with moderate tricuspid regurgitation, pre-operative tricuspid annular motion remainedsignificantly reduced (6.0 +/- 0.5 vs 13.5 +/- 5.0 mm, p = 0.045). Otherechocardiographic parameters were not significantly different between patients.Tricuspid annular motion of <7.5 mm provides 91% specificity and 46% sensitivity in predicting post-LVAD RV failure.CONCLUSION: Tricuspid annular motion is a predictor of post-LVAD RV failure.Using tricuspid annular motion in addition to conventional criteria may aid inearly identification of patients with prolonged inotropic support or severe RVfailure and allow for better pre-operative planning.
