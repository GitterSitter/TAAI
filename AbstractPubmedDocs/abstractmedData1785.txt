However, over thepast 40 years, a number of mechanical assist systems have been developed with thegoal of treating and rehabilitating patients with severe circulatory compromise. Today, a wide array of devices is available to provide increasing levels ofcirculatory support. When used as bridges to heart transplantation, long-termcirculatory support systems are a reliable means of keeping heart-failurepatients alive as they await suitable donor hearts. Initially, transplantcandidates who were receiving this type of support were unable to leave thehospital; today, however, because of advances in mechanical support technologyand the portability of the current systems, these patients may return to theirhomes and even to their jobs while awaiting transplantation. Although hearttransplantation may now be considered a routine procedure, the demand for donorhearts will always outweigh the supply, creating a definite need for long-termmechanical circulatory support. Already, clinical trials are underway to test theeffectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as long-term support. Assmaller, more effective cardiac assist devices become available, they shouldbenefit even more the number of patients who may need permanent circulatorysupport. The fact that myocardial function can improve enough with chronicventricular unloading to allow removal of the device may further broaden the use of this technology.
