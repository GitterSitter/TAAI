This study was designed tocharacterize the cytokine profile in patients with acute circulatory collapse.METHODS: Blood drawn from 14 consecutive patients within 24 hours beforeundergoing left ventricular assist device placement and after at least 30 days ofmechanical assistance or before transplantation was assayed for levels ofinterleukin 6, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.RESULTS: Interleukin 6 level was elevated in 11 (79%), interleukin 8 in 10 (71%),and tumor necrosis factor in 2 (14%) of the 14 patients. After hemodynamicrecovery, interleukin 6 levels decreased from 33.6 +/- 9 pg/mL to 11.3 +/- 4pg/mL (p = 0.05) and interleukin 8 levels decreased from 122 +/- 34 pg/mL to 19.7+/- 8 pg/mL (p = 0.005). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels did not varysignificantly; they were associated with infection in 2 left ventricular assistdevice recipients and normalized after left ventricular assist device support.All patients had resolution of circulatory shock after mechanical support and hadimprovement in parameters of end-organ function.CONCLUSIONS: Circulatory shock treated with left ventricular assist deviceplacement is associated with a proinflammatory response similar to that seen inseptic shock. The decrease in cytokine serum levels that follows hemodynamicrecovery suggests that these cytokines may be markers of tissue damage and maymodulate cardiac dysfunction.
