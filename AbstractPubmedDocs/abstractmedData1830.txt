We report on our experience with patients receiving ambulatorycare after LVAD implantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Since July 1995, 46 patients with a mean age of 45+/-11years underwent implantation of an electrically driven LVAD with portablecontroller and batteries. Sixteen (35%) patients bridged >30 days were treated inpart on an outpatient basis. After LVAD implantation, they were treated in thehospital for 86+/-32 days (range 40 to 153 days). Afterward, they receivedambulatory care for 74+/-76 days (range 2 to 301 days, total experience 1206days). In 13 cases, the outpatient treatment was interrupted by 1.7+/-1.7readmissions, for a total of 32+/-42 days (median 19 days). Reasons forreadmission included systemic or drive line infections (incidence 0.0066 peroutpatient day), suspected or true thromboembolic events (incidence 0.0066 peroutpatient day), and suspected malfunction of the LVAD. One patient supported as alternative to transplantation died after cerebral bleeding after 244 days, 1patient with a history of acute myocarditis had ventricular fibrillation duringLVAD assist while being at home for 177 days and died in a low output state, 10patients were given transplantation after a mean support interval of 206+/-88days, and 4 patients currently await heart transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient treatment after LVAD implantation is feasible, and severecomplications are uncommon.
