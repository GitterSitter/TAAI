The indications for device use,types of available pumps and centres performing these procedures are presented. Areview of the results of use of these devices in Canada indicates that they maybe a reasonable alternative for patients who might otherwise die withoutintervention. The cost implications of more widespread use of these pumps are notinsignificant and must be compared with other life-saving technologies.
