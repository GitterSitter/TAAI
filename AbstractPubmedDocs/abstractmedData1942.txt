The aim of the study was to evaluate theexperience with this therapeutic approach for end-stage heart failure at a singlecenter.METHODS: Between April 1986 and January 1996, 1,413 patients were accepted ascandidates for heart transplantation. Ventricular assist devices were used as abridge to transplantation in 173 patients (biventricular assist device in 141patients and left ventricular assist device in 32 patients). The longest durationof support was 572 days (average, 46 days).RESULTS: Of the 1,413 patients, 891 underwent heart transplantation (65children/adolescents and 826 adults; 522 (36%) patients died awaiting a donorheart. The average time spent on the waiting list was 107 days. The averagerecipient age was 44 years, and the age of donors was extended up to 69 years.Eighty-three patients with ventricular assist devices (48%) subsequentlyunderwent heart transplantation. Twenty-five patients (2.7%) underwentretransplantation. The 30-day mortality rate was 14%, and the overall actualsurvival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 80%, 59%, and 50%, respectively. Ninety-fourpercent of patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or IIat 1 year, and 44% returned to work after transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the broadening of the selection criteria for both recipientsand donors, heart transplantation remains an effective treatment for end-stageheart failure. Nevertheless, this therapeutic approach is severely limited by aconsiderable disparity between the need and availability of donor organs.
