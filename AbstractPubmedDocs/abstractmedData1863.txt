Artif Organs. 1999 Mar;23(3):286-9.Clinical experience of left ventricular assist systems at the Heart Institute of Japan.Kitamura M(1), Kawai A, Hachida M, Nishida H, Endo M, Koyanagi H.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart Institute of Japan, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Japan.The main indications for left ventricular assist system (LVAS) support arepostcardiotomy ventricular failure as temporary circulatory support and end-stagecardiomyopathy as chronic circulatory support. To clarify the efficacy of LVASsupport, we assessed the clinical outcome of a pneumatic LVAS and anelectromagnetic LVAS for patients with severe ventricular failure. As of March1998, 5 patients with postcardiotomy ventricular failure had received thepneumatic LVAS support, and 2 other patients with end-stage idiopathiccardiomyopathy had undergone implantation of the electromagnetic LVAS. The drive control of the LVAS was mainly counterpulsation in the diastole of the nativeheart. In the 5 postcardiotomy patients, the duration of pneumatic LVAS supportranged from 30 to 312 h (mean, 109.2). All 3 patients with more than 72 h supportwere successfully weaned, and 2 of them survived. The other 2 patients withcardiogenic shock and less than 36 h support could not be weaned from the LVAS.In the 2 cardiomyopathy patients, 1 patient was well maintained by theelectromagnetic LVAS support and underwent successful heart transplantation 7months later. The other patient has been chronically supported by the LVAS for 2 months and is doing well so far. These results suggest that selective applicationof the pneumatic LVAS as a temporary support and the electromagnetic LVAS as achronic support might be appropriate for maximizing the effectiveness of LVAStreatment for profound cardiac failure.
