Circ Heart Fail. 2014 Mar 1;7(2):380.BACKGROUND: Risk stratification is an integral component of clinical decisionmaking in heart failure (HF). Women with HF have unique characteristics compared with men, and it is unknown whether common prognostic factors are equally useful in both populations. We aimed to investigate whether sex-specific risk models aremore accurate for risk prediction in patients with advanced HF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with advanced HF referred to University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA; n=2255), were stratified by sex into derivation(referred in 2000-2007) and validation (referred in 2008-2011) cohorts. Coxregression analysis was used to ascertain key variables predictive of the primaryend point of death/urgent transplantation/ventricular assist device in thederivation cohorts and confirmed in the validation cohorts in men, women, and thetotal population. Women were younger, with higher ejection fraction and betterevent-free survival. Despite differences in baseline characteristics, the 4strongest predictors of outcome in both women and men, as well as in the totalcohort, were B-type natriuretic peptide, peak oxygen consumption bycardiopulmonary exercise testing (pkVO2), New York Heart Association (NYHA)classification, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensinreceptor blocker. In addition, the UCLA model performed better than the SeattleHeart Failure Model (SHFM) and the Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) in ourcohort (c-indices of 0.791[UCLA] versus 0.758 [SHFM], 0.607 [noninvasive HFSS],and 0.625 [invasive HFSS]).CONCLUSIONS: A simple risk model assessing 4 clinical variables-B-typenatriuretic peptide, pkVO2, NYHA, and angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use-is well suited to provide prognosticinformation in both men and women with advanced HF.
