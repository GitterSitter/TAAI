Int J Artif Organs. 1991 May;14(5):270-5.Timing for implantation and transplantation in mechanical bridge totransplantation.Moritz A(1), Rokitansky A, Trubel W, Laufer G, Schima H, Prodinger A, Laczkovics A, Wolner E.Author information: (1)II Chirurgische Universit√§tsklinik Wien, Austria.The implantation of a mechanical blood pump in a deteriorating candidate forheart transplantation is indicated in general if the cardiac index is less than1.9 L/min/m2 despite maximal inotropic support. Deterioration of end organfunction may be taken as a second factor indicating the need for mechanicalsupport as patients with acute onset of shock may react differently from patientswith chronic deterioration. Preoperative need for dialysis largely reduces thechances of long-term survival. The time on support should be long enough tonormalize or at least improve secondarily damaged organ systems, but with timeinfectious and thromboembolic complications will increase. So optimal periods forartificial heart support range between two days and four weeks. Age less than 40 years is a positive predictor for outcome in TAH bridging. The generalguidelines, however, do not preclude a favourable outcome in complicated cases,as we show in our own series.
