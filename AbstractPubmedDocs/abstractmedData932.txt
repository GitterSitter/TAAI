Epub 2010Jul 15.The use of percutaneous ECMO support as a 'bridge to bridge' in heart failurepatients: a case report.Fitzgerald D(1), Ging A, Burton N, Desai S, Elliott T, Edwards L.Author information: (1)The INOVA Heart and Vascular Institute, Falls Church, VA, USA.David.Fitzgerald@inova.orgA 65-year-old male with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy was admittedto the intensive care unit in cardiogenic shock. Cardiac catheterization revealedbi-ventricular hypokinesis, with an estimated ejection fraction of 15%. Despitemoderate inotropic support, the patient's liver enzymes, internationalnormalization ratio (INR), and creatinine became grossly elevated, indicatingmulti-organ injury from hypoperfusion. Due to the patient's state of shock andprobable bleeding complications, a full sternotomy and emergent biventricularassist device insertion was deemed very high risk. In order to achievehemodynamic stability, a decision was made for extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (ECMO) support. ECMO support was quickly initiated by percutaneouscannulation of the femoral vein and artery. The ECMO circuit was comprised of aCentrimag blood pump and Quadrox-D Safeline-coated membrane oxygenator. Withsuccessful perfusion and organ resuscitation, abnormal liver function tests, INR,and creatinine all returned to normal in less than one week. With normal organfunction, especially the liver, the patient successfully underwent an implantableleft ventricular assist device, HeartMate II LVAD, without requiring mechanicalright heart support. Prior to ECMO, the patient was at very high risk of needing biventricular support. Thus, the temporary use of ECMO allowed for a safer andmore durable bridge to transplantation. The use of percutaneous ECMO has manyadvantages, including improving the patient condition and allowing for time toevaluate fully the LVAD patient.
