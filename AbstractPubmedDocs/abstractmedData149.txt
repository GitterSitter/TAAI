NT-proBNPconcentrations >2000 pg/mL, gal-3 concentrations >25.9 ng/mL, and sST2concentrations >35 ng/mL were considered positive on the basis of established PV cut points for identifying "high-risk" individuals with HF. CRT response wasadjudicated by the HF Clinical Composite Score. A major adverse cardiovascularevent (MACE) was defined as the composite end point of death, cardiac transplant,left ventricular assist device, and HF hospitalization at 2 years.RESULTS: NT-proBNP concentrations were 20% higher in the CS than in theperiphery, while gal-3 and sST2 concentrations were 10% higher in the peripherythan in the CS (all P < .001). There were 45% CRT nonresponders at 6 months and16 (22%) patients with MACE. Triple-positive CS values yielded the highestspecificity of 95% for predicting CRT nonresponse. Consistently, CS strategiesidentified patients at higher risk of developing MACE, with >11-fold adjustedincrease for triple-positive CS patients compared to triple-negative patients(all P ≤ .04). PV strategies were not predictive of MACE.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CS sampling of HF biomarkers may be better than PV sampling for predicting CRT outcomes. Larger studies are needed toconfirm our findings.Copyright © 2014 Heart Rhythm Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rightsreserved.PMCID: PMC4254015 [Available on 2015-12-01]
