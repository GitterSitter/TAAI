The average age at VAD implantation was 41 years.The implanted VADs included 1 HeartMate XVE, 3 HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp,Pleasanton, CA), 1 Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, New York, NY), and 1 HeartWare HVAD(HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA). In-hospital outcomes included no sub-pulmonicventricular failure, no VAD thrombosis or mechanical failure, 30-day mortality in1 patient, non-fatal sub-arachnoid hemorrhage in 1 patient, and sustainedventricular tachycardia requiring unsynchronized direct current cardioversion in 1 patient. Of the 5 patients who survived to discharge, 1 patient received 171days of VAD support before cardiac transplantation and survived for 1,484 daysafter transplantation; 1 patient received 262 days of VAD support beforeout-of-hospital death of unknown etiology; 1 patient had received VAD support for988 days as of December 1, 2012, while awaiting a transplant; and 2 patients who received VADs as destination therapy had received 577 and 493 days of VADsupport, respectively, and were still alive as of December 1, 2012.CONCLUSIONS: This case series characterizes important post-operative managementchallenges and clinical outcomes associated with VAD implantation as abridge-to-transplant or as destination therapy in adult patients with complexCHD.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
