Activation of the G alpha q signalingpathway, including protein kinase C, appears to be involved in the progression ofheart failure. Similarly down-regulation of Ca2+ cycling proteins may contribute to contractile depression in this clinical syndrome. Thus we examined whetherprotein kinase C activation and decreased Ca2+ cycling protein levels could bereversed by left ventricular assist device support.METHODS: Left ventricular myocardial specimens were obtained from seven patients during placement of left ventricular assist device and heart transplantation. We examined changes in protein levels of G alpha q, phospholipase C beta 1,regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase,phospholamban and translocation of protein kinase C isoforms (alpha, beta 1, and beta 2).RESULTS: The paired pre- and post-left ventricular assist device samples revealedthat RGS2, a selective inhibitor of G alpha q, was decreased (P < 0.01), whilethe status of G alpha q, phospholipase C beta 1, RGS3 and RGS4 were unchangedafter left ventricular assist device implantation. Translocation of proteinkinase C isoforms remained unchanged. Left ventricular assist device supportincreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase protein level (P < 0.01), whilephospholamban abundance was unchanged.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that altered protein expression and stoichiometry of themajor cardiomyocyte Ca2+ cycling proteins rather than reduced phospholipase Cbeta 1 activation may contribute to improved mechanical function produced by leftventricular assist device support in human heart failure.
