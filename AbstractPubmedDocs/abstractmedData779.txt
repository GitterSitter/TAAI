Although implantation of a left ventricular assist device alone is often the preferred configuration, patients with biventricular failure andsignificant end-organ dysfunction often require biventricular assistance.METHODS: Between January 2000 and September 2008, 80 patients with severebiventricular failure were accepted for heart transplantation and received apneumatic biventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplant. Patients wereretrospectively divided into 2 groups: those successfully bridged to transplant(Group A) and those who died (Group B). Patients were also divided into 2 periodsof implantation: Group X (2000-2005) and Group Y (2006-2008, which used amultidiscipline selection process).RESULTS: Overall success rate to transplantation was 71.3%, with Group Ydemonstrating an 82% success to transplant rate vs 63% in Group X. One-yearactuarial survival after transplant was 89% compared with 92% in patients withouta ventricular assist device. There were no statistically significant laboratoryparameters between Groups A and B identifying potential risk factors for pooroutcome.CONCLUSION: Biventricular assist device therapy represents an effective andreliable means of supporting selected Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support profile 1 patients as a bridge to transplantation,with excellent success to transplant rates and post-transplant survival.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
