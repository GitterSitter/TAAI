Our effort involves a consortium consisting of UoP, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP), Carnegie MellonUniversity, World Heart Corporation, and LaunchPoint Technologies, Inc. Theoverall aim of our program is to develop a highly reliable, biocompatibleventricular assist device (VAD) for chronic support (6 months) of the unique and high-risk population of children between 3 and 15 kg (patients from birth to 2years of age). The innovative pediatric ventricular assist device we aredeveloping is based on a miniature mixed flow turbodynamic pump featuringmagnetic levitation, to assure minimal blood trauma and risk of thrombosis. This review article discusses the limitations of current pediatric cardiac assisttreatment options and the work to date by our consortium toward the developmentof a pediatric VAD.
