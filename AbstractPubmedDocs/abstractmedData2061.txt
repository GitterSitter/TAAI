J Heart Lung Transplant. 1992 Jul-Aug;11(4 Pt 2):S175-81.Mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation.Hetzer R(1), Hennig E, Schiessler A, Friedel N, Warnecke H, Adt M.Author information: (1)Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Germany.Mechanical circulatory support systems are currently in clinical use to keeppatients alive with the aim of either cardiac recovery after open heart surgery, myocardial infarction and after heart transplantation with acute graft failure,or as a bridge to transplantation in heart transplant candidates. At the GermanHeart Institute the "Berlin Heart" mechanical circulatory support system has beenused invariably since 1987. Up to 1991 there were 22 patients in the "recovery"group. Four patients could be weaned from the system, but only one patient wasdischarged from the hospital. In 65 patients mechanical circulatory supportsystems were implanted as a bridge to transplantation, 39 patients hadtransplants, and 22 patients left the hospital. Risk factor analysis in thebridging group revealed that previous heart surgery, infective pneumonia,shock-related coagulation disorders, and an age greater than 50 years had anunfavorable influence on patient survival. It is concluded that patients may bekept alive for weeks and months after any kind of cardiogenic shock. Completecardiac recovery may be achieved in the case of early posttransplant graftfailure. Reliable prediction of outcome in the bridge to transplantation grouprequires further experience.
