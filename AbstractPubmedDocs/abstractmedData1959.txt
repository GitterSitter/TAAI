J Heart Lung Transplant. 1996 Aug;15(8):840-2.Transient normalization of systolic and diastolic function after support with aleft ventricular assist device in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy.Levin HR(1), Oz MC, Catanese KA, Rose EA, Burkhoff D.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY10032, USA.A 19-year-old man who had fulminant heart failure caused by an idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy was supported with a left ventricular assist device for 183 daysas a bridge to heart transplantation. At the time of intended transplantation it was noted that the patient's heart had returned to normal size, had a normalejection fraction, and was able to maintain normal pressures and flows. In viewof the apparent recovery of cardiac properties, the left ventricular assistdevice was explanted and the transplantation was not performed. However, theheart dilated, ejection fraction worsened, and the patient died of heart failure exacerbated acutely by a systemic viral illness. Although such recovery ofsystolic function is uncommon, as use of the left ventricular assist devicesbecomes more widespread other physicians might encounter similar findings and, inthis regard, they might find our experience useful as they contemplate theirtreatment options.
