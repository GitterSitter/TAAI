The outcome of additionalprocedures to the aortic valve at the time of VAD placement is unclear.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 712 VAD patients from 1995 to 2009 wasperformed.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were identified who underwent aortic valveprocedures in addition to VAD placement. Indication for VAD placement was bridge to transplant in 23 patients, destination therapy in 4, and postcardiotomy shock in 1. Aortic valve procedures were performed for preexisting mechanical aorticprosthesis in 8 (7 closure and 1 aortic valve replacement with biologicalprosthesis), and for moderate or severe aortic insufficiency in 20 patients (10repair, 9 closure, and 1 aortic valve replacement with biological prosthesis). Atthe last follow-up, 16 patients had undergone heart transplant, 6 remained on VADsupport, and 5 had died. While on VAD support, no adverse events related to theaortic valve procedures occurred. The 30-day operative mortality was 0.4%. Noclinical thromboembolic events were observed. In 2 patients, there was evidenceof thrombus formation in the explanted heart. Four patients had bleedingcomplications. Of the 9 patients who received aortic valve repair, 2 hadrecurrent aortic insufficiency on echocardiograms during an average follow-up of 118 days.CONCLUSIONS: Additional procedures to the aortic valve at the time of VADplacement are feasible. Overall outcomes are comparable to those seen in patientswithout the need for aortic valve manipulation at the time of VAD placement.Copyright Â© 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
