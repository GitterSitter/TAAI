Improved myocardial responsiveness to catecholamines after ventricular assist device (VAD)support is associated with upregulation of β1-adrenergic receptors (β1-ARs).Little is known about the regulation of AC and β2-AR coupling after VAD; moreoverβ2-AR stimulation during VAD was claimed to induce myocardial recovery.METHODS: We analyzed in VAD-supported human myocardium the regulation of ACactivity upon β1-AR and selective β2-AR stimulation in 8 non-failing hearts (NF) and 17 paired samples of VAD patients. AC messenger RNA was measured by TaqMan.AC was stimulated via β2-AR using clenbuterol (β2-AR agonist) and bisoprolol(β1-AR blocker). Organ bath experiments were done with trabeculae from bothventricles. Samples were stratified according to chronic or acute heart failurehistory.RESULTS: Isoprenaline-induced AC activity was downregulated (p < 0.001) pre-VADand increased significantly (p < 0.05) after unloading (mean ± standard deviationpmole/mg/min) in NF (47.9 ± 14.9), pre-VAD (24.35 ± 13.3), and post-VAD (50.04 ± 50.25). Forskolin stimulation revealed significant (p < 0.05) upregulation of AC activity during VAD, especially in acutely failing hearts (NF, 192.1 ± 68.7;pre-VAD, 191.1 ± 60.4; post-VAD, 281.5 ± 133). However, forskolin stimulationrelative to isoprenaline-induced inotropy remained reduced before and after VADcompared with NF. The selective stimulation of β2-AR did not reveal influence of VAD support on β2-AR-AC coupling. Stimulation of ventricular trabeculae by > 100 μmole/liter clenbuterol revealed negative inotropic responses.CONCLUSIONS: VAD does not influence β2-AR coupling to AC stimulation. Elevatedresponse to catecholamines after VAD support is influenced by β1-AR upregulation and modulation of AC activity. Restoration of β-adrenergic responsiveness wasrestricted to acutely failing hearts.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
