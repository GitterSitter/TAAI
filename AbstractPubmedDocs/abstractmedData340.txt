Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a majorrole in the clinical decision making during insertion of the devices and in thepost-operative management of these patients. The detection of structural anddevice-related mechanical abnormalities is critical for optimal functioning ofassist device. In this review article, we describe the usefulness of TEE foroptimal perioperative management of patients presenting for HeartWare LVADinsertion.
