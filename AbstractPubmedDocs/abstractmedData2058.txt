Ten healthy human subjects served as controls (C).Cutaneous blood flow was measured before, during, and after external brachialartery occlusion to evaluate the post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) as astandardized response. To examine microvascular responses to macrohemodynamicchanges, the cardiac output (CO) was decreased by a 20% reduction in BVAD pumprate. No significant differences in baseline LDF measurements (in millivolts)were observed among the three groups (C, 470.7 mV +/- 177.3; BVAD pts, 328.0 mV+/- 122.7; BVAD nor pts, 360.0 mV +/- 160.0). After cuff pressure release (1 min later), a significant (p < 0.004) three-fold to four-fold blood flow increase(PORH) occurred in each group (C, 1113.6 mV +/- 469.2; BVAD pts, 813.0 mV +/-190.1; BVAD nor pts, 498.0 mV +/- 191.8). The difference in PORH between the BVADpts and BVAD nor pts was significant (p < 0.01), and the time to peak PORH valueswas different (p < 0.05) among the three groups (C, 22.2 s +/- 10.7; BVAD pts,11.3 s +/- 12.5; BVAD nor pts, 7.0 s +/- 5.8). A markedly delayed return tobaseline occurred in the BVAD pts. The 20% reduction in BVAD pump rate decreased CO significantly (p < 0.05) and increased (p < 0.01) systemic vascular resistance(SVR).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
