Curr Opin Cardiol. 2004 Nov;19(6):613-8.Left ventricular assist devices: evolving devices and indications for use inischemic heart disease.Lietz K(1), Miller LW.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Division, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota55455, USA.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The mortality with end-stage heart failure is extremely high, especially when patients become refractory to conventional medical therapy andrequire frequent hospitalization. Ischemic heart disease remains the primarycause of advanced heart failure. Mechanical pumps or devices have been developed called ventricular assist devices and are being used to support an increasingnumber of patients with refractory heart failure.RECENT FINDINGS: The use of ventricular assist devices has evolved from initiallyonly support of patients unable to be weaned from a heart-lung machine aftercardiac surgery to use now as a bridge to a heart transplant, including patients with acute myocardial infarction and shock and severe pulmonary hypertension.More recently, they have been proven as a definitive alternative for patients noteligible for heart transplantation. There are new devices being examined inclinical trials, including a change from pusher-plate to devices with axial flow technology that are much smaller and easier to implant. Outcomes with their useare improving rapidly as the devices become more reliable and more is learnedabout the importance of candidate selection.SUMMARY: This review describes current indications for the use of these devices, the types of pumps now available, criteria for initiating ventricular assistdevice support, complications of their use, and new applications such as aplatform for stem cell therapy for treatment of end-stage heart failure.
