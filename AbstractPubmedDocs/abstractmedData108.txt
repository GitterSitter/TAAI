Epub 2014 Sep 18.Predictors and outcome of sustained improvement in left ventricular function indilated cardiomyopathy.Blechman I(1), Arad M, Nussbaum T, Goldenberg I, Freimark D.Author information: (1)Heart Failure Institute and Leviev Heart Center, Sheba Medical Center andSackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.BACKGROUND: Improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) mayoccur in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).HYPOTHESIS: There are different implications of persistent versus transientimprovement in LVEF among DCM patients receiving contemporary therapy.METHODS: We studied 188 patients with nonischemic DCM. Persistent improvement in LVEF (PIEF) was defined as LVEF increase by at least 10% compared to baseline,and found in 2 separate echo-Doppler exams performed at least 12 months apart.Increased LVEF in echo 2, which was not sustained in echo 3, was defined astransient improvement in LVEF (TIEF).RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 6.8 years, PIEF occurred in 61 (33%)patients, predicting a better long-term outcome (P < 0.001) in a combinedend-point comprising death, heart transplantation, or the need for a ventricular assist device. The TIEF group had an intermediate course and were closer tononimprovers (P = 0.003 vs PIEF). Multivariate logistic regression identified thefollowing independent predictors of PIEF: shorter disease duration,pregnancy-associated disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baseline LVEF ≤25%. A score to predict PIEF assigned 1 point to each of the following: diseaseduration < 3 years and no familial cardiomyopathy; pregnancy-associatedpresentation; basal LVEF ≤ 25%; and left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 12. A scoreof ≥ 3 was present in 44% of the patients, reliably predicting PIEF in 91% (P =0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Persistent improvement in LVEF is associated with improved long-termprognosis. Baseline clinical parameters can be used to identify patients likelyto demonstrate PIEF, thereby allowing tailored management in this population.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
