Epub 2013 Aug 22.Remote monitoring of left ventricular assist device parameters afterHeartAssist-5 implantation.Pektok E(1), Demirozu ZT, Arat N, Yildiz O, Oklu E, Eker D, Ece F, Ciftci C,Yazicioglu N, Bayindir O, Kucukaksu DS.Author information: (1)Heart Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support Center, SisliFlorence Nightingale Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.Although several left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been used widely,remote monitoring of LVAD parameters has been available only recently. We presentour remote monitoring experience with an axial-flow LVAD (HeartAssist-5, MicroMedCardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA). Five consecutive patients who wereimplanted a HeartAssist-5 LVAD because of end-stage heart failure due to ischemic(n=4) or idiopathic (n=1) cardiomyopathy, and discharged from hospital betweenDecember 2011 and January 2013 were analyzed. The data (pump speed, pump flow,power consumption) obtained from clinical visits and remote monitoring werestudied. During a median follow-up of 253 (range: 80-394) days, fine tuning ofLVADs was performed at clinical visits. All patients are doing well and are inNew York Heart Association Class-I/II. A total of 39 alarms were received fromthree patients. One patient was hospitalized for suspected thrombosis and wassubjected to physical examinations as well as laboratory and echocardiographicevaluations; however, no evidence of thrombus washout or pump thrombus was found.The patient was treated conservatively. Remaining alarms were due to insufficientwater intake and were resolved by increased water consumption at night and summertimes, and fine tuning of pump speed. No alarms were received from the remaining two patients. We believe that remote monitoring is a useful technology for early detection and treatment of serious problems occurring out of hospital therebyimproving patient care. Future developments may ease troubleshooting, providemore data from the patient and the pump, and eventually increase physician andpatient satisfaction. Despite all potential clinical benefits, remote monitoring should be taken as a supplement to rather than a substitute for routine clinical visits for patient follow-up.Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs andTransplantation.
