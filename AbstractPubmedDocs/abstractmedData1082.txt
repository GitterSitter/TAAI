Smaller, less-invasive devices could expand VAD use to alarger pool of less-sick patients but would pump less blood, providing onlypartial support.METHODS: The Synergy Pocket Micro-pump device (CircuLite, Inc., Saddle Brook, NewJersey) pumps approximately 3.0 l/min, is implanted (off pump) via amini-thoracotomy, and is positioned in a right subclavicular subcutaneous pocket (like a pacemaker). The inflow cannula inserts into the left atrium; the outflow graft connects to the right subclavian artery.RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (14 men), age 53 +/- 9 years with ejectionfraction 21 +/- 6%, mean arterial pressure 73 +/- 7 mm Hg, pulmonary capillarywedge pressure 29 +/- 6 mm Hg, and cardiac index 1.9 +/- 0.4 l/min/m(2) received an implant. Duration of support ranged from 6 to 213 (median 81) days. Inaddition to demonstration of significant acute hemodynamic improvements in thefirst day of support, 9 patients underwent follow-up right heart catheterization at 10.6 +/- 6 weeks. These patients showed significant increases in arterialpressure (67 +/- 8 mm Hg vs. 80 +/- 9 mm Hg, p = 0.01) and cardiac index (2.0 +/-0.4 l/min/m(2) vs. 2.8 +/- 0.6 l/min/m(2), p = 0.01) with large reductions inpulmonary capillary wedge pressure (30 +/- 5 mm Hg vs. 18 +/- 5 mm Hg, p =0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Partial support appears to interrupt the progressive hemodynamicdeterioration typical of late-stage heart failure. If proven safe and durable,this device could be used in a relatively large population of patients withsevere heart failure who are not sick enough to justify use of currentlyavailable full support VADs.
