Transplantation of thefailing heart remains the most effective treatment currently employed, but demandfar exceeds donor supply. In a bid to address this imbalance, the use ofmechanical circulatory support has been explored since the mid-1960s. This paper utilizes one such device, which achieves assistance by mechanically compressingthe epicardial surface of the failing heart. The circumferential normal loadingof the device is investigated, showing how frictional effects inherent to thedevice's operation affect localized surface pressure. Results showed that asdistance from the device's actuator increased, assistive systolic force reduced, whilst device constriction to ventricular filling detrimentally increased. Activedevice relaxation was shown to limit the diastolic effect outlined above,providing the simulated diseased heart with an improved cardiac output. Theresults also raise questions concerning device in-vivo positioning andshort-comings with the current heart simulator.
