We report two cases of mechanical assistance inpatients with SV physiology: a 2-year old male with hypoplastic left heartsyndrome who underwent Norwood Stage I and II followed by HF and a 4-year oldfemale with a univentricular heart who developed a severe right ventriculardysfunction 2 years after a cavopulmonary shunt. Mechanical support utilizingventricular assist devices (VADs) is considered a valid tool to bridge patientswith congestive heart failure to either OHT or to recovery. Increasing experienceand improved outcomes utilizing this technology in children with biventricularhearts have led to considering employing these devices in failing SV treatment.We present 2 cases of terminally ill children with SV who were assisted with aVAD.PMCID: PMC3598047
