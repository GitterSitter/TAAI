However, there arequestions about posttransplantation effects of VADs.METHODS: Seventy-four patients with end-stage heart failure who underwent HTx in our clinic between February 2007 and July 2011 were divided into two groups; abridge cohort (n = 28) and a nonbridge group comprising 46 who underwent HTxwithout mechanical circulatory support. There mean ages were 39.89 ± 15.66 and38.33 ± 16.23 years respectively. Significantly more patients in the bridgegroup, were man displayed anemia, were treated with anticoagulation therapy, and underwent a resternotomy. In the nonbridge group, more patients neededpreoperative inotropic support.RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative renalfailure (P = .007, odds ratio [OR] 27) and inotropic support (P = .006, OR:10,222) as well as longer cardiopulmonary bypasses (≥ 130 minutes, P = .001, OR: 11,24) to be risk factors for in-hospital mortality, which was 15.2% in nonbridgeand 10.7% in bridge subjects, P = .733). Major adverse events, such as renalfailure, pulmonary failure, right ventricular failure, neurological event, andreoperation due to bleeding, shown similar incidences between the groups. Theamount of blood transfusion was significantly higher in the bridge group (2.34 U versus 3.56 U, P = .037). The preoperative incidence of human leukocyte antigensensitization (panel reactive antibody ≥ 10%) and grade 2R were rejectionepisodes in the early period were similar.CONCLUSION: Early posttransplant results were not adversely or beneficiallyinfluenced by the use of VADs. Similar to other types of cardiac surgery, apatients preoperative condition seemed to be the major factor affectingmortality.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
