Experimental and clinical experience atThe Pennsylvania State University.Davis PK(1), Pae WE Jr, Pierce WS.Author information: (1)College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey 17033.The number of patients who would be candidates for replacement of their failingnative heart with an artificial device increases every year. A multidisciplinary group at The Pennsylvania State University is working toward the development of areliable, totally implantable artificial heart. Initial work resulted in apneumatic total artificial heart that has performed well in animal implants andhas been used clinically in three patients as a temporary bridge to cardiactransplantation. Although pneumatic total artificial hearts have demonstratedutility as temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, attempts atpermanent implantation by other groups have been fraught with complications.Because of the suboptimal performance of the pneumatic devices used for permanentimplantation, the authors' groups at Penn State is developing n electricmotor-driven total artificial heart with encouraging results in calf implants.This artificial heart of the future will use a transcutaneous energy transmissionsystem that will obviate the need for percutaneous lines. Thus, the patient will be provided with as near a normal life-style as possible. At present thetechnology is at hand to implant an electric blood pump system that shouldprovide a reasonable life-style and function reliably with minimal care. Ongoing cooperative experimental efforts will help to provide the answers necessary tomake this system ready for clinical use.
