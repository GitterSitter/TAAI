J Heart Lung Transplant. 2005 Jun;24(6):764-8.Emergent mechanical support in the community: improvement with early transplantcenter referral.Morris RJ(1), Pochettino A, O'Hara M, Gardner TJ, Acker MA.Author information: (1)John Rhea Barton Surgical Associates, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.morrisrj@mail.med.upenn.eduEmergent mechanical support for the failing ventricle, with eventual transfer fordefinitive care, is often required at non-transplant centers. Transfer fordefinitive care, in terms of bridge to transplant, may require ventricular assistdevice (VAD) placement at the primary institution or at the transplant center.Review of consecutive single transplant center referrals was conducted todecipher optimal management. From January 1997 to December 2000, 104 patientswere transferred to the University of Pennsylvania Heart Failure/TransplantService. Most were transferred from active cardiac surgical programs, with 56patients having post-cardiotomy failure at the primary site. A VAD was placed in procedures done at the outside hospital (OSH) in 28 patients, most commonly (60%)an Abiomed device. Of the 76 patients that received a VAD at the transplantcenter (TxpC), 86% received a TCI or Thoratec device. Biventricular support wasrequired in 34 patients. Overall survival was 57%, with 54 patients bridged totransplantation and 5 patients undergoing recovery. Patients having a VAD placed at the OSH had a 32% (9 of 28) survival, whereas at the TxpC survival was 65% (45of 76) (p < 0.05). Mid-term follow-up showed that all 5 patients weaned arepresently alive, and 52 patients are alive at >1-year post-transplant. The mostcommon cause of death was multi-system organ failure (19 of 45), followed bymajor neurologic event (15 of 45). Infection was the cause of death in only 6patients. Left ventricular failure can be treated by emergent VAD placement.Overall survival is substantial if these patients are referred to a transplantcenter with multiple options. In contrast to previous reports, survival rates maybe improved by earlier referral, before VAD placement at non-transplant centersand use of a VAD with longer-term capability.
