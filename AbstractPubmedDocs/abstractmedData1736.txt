Tex Heart Inst J. 2001;28(2):139-41.A reliable test to detect impending pump failure during long-term support on the Novacor N100 Left Ventricular Assist System.Dohmen PM(1), Laube H, de Jonge K, Konertz W.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Charit√©, Humboldt University Berlin,Germany.The Durastudy is a new surveillance protocol to detect impending pump failure in Novacor N100 Left Ventricular Assist Systems implanted for the long term. Ourpatient, a 54-year-old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy andcontraindications for heart transplantation, received a Novacor pump in May 1995 and did not experience sustainable ventricular recovery during the subsequent 3years. After more than 3 years of support, symptoms of pump wear were detected inthis patient, through application of the Durastudy protocol. This enabled us toelectively exchange the pump at 3.8 years. Our patient remained in New York HeartAssociation functional class I until he died in July 1999 of causes unrelated to the pump, after some 1,514 days of support. This, we believe, still constitutes aworld record.PMCID: PMC101155
