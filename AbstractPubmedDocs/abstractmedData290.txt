Am J Transplant. 2014 Jan;14 Suppl 1:113-38. doi: 10.1111/ajt.12583.OPTN/SRTR 2012 Annual Data Report: heart.Colvin-Adams M(1), Smithy JM, Heubner BM, Skeans MA, Edwards LB, Waller C,Schnitzler MA, Snyder JJ, Israni AK, Kasiske BL.Author information: (1)Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Minneapolis Medical ResearchFoundation, Minneapolis, MN; Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology,University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.The number of heart transplants performed annually continues to increasegradually, and the number of adult candidates on the waiting list increased by25% from 2004 to 2012. The heart transplant rate among active adult candidatespeaked at 149 per 100 wait-list years in 2007 and has been declining since; in2012, the rate was 93 heart transplants per 100 active wait-list years. Increasedwaiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase inwait-list mortality. Since 2007, the proportion of patients on life supportbefore transplant increased from 48.6% to 62.7% in 2012. Medical urgencycategories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgencycategories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list each year; the number of transplants performed each year increased from 274 in1998 to 372 in 2012. Graft survival in pediatric recipients continues to improve;5-year graft survival for transplants performed in 2007 was 78.5%. Medicare paid for some or all of the care for nearly 40% of heart transplant recipients in2010. Heart transplant appears to be more expensive than ventricular assistdevices for managing end-stage heart failure, but is more effective and likelymore cost-effective.Â© Copyright 2013 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Societyof Transplant Surgeons.
