The focus of this studywas to ascertain whether early implantation (< 24 hours) of a right ventricularassist device (RVAD) in patients with severe RVF improved survival and whethersevere RVF adversely affected post-transplant survival.METHODS: We conducted a 10-year review of our bridge to transplant experienceusing the Heartmate device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA), studying patients whorequired an Abiomed RVAD (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA).RESULTS: There were 243 patients who underwent LVAD implantation, of which 17(7.0%) required an RVAD. Ten patients underwent early RVAD insertion (< 24 hours)while 7 underwent delayed insertion (> 24 hours). Bridging to transplant wassuccessful in 11 (64.7%) RVAD patients versus 163 (72.1%) non-RVAD patients (p = 0.046). Of the 10 patients who underwent early RVAD insertion, 7 (70.0%) weresuccessfully bridged. Of the 7 patients who underwent delayed RVAD insertion, 4(57.1%) were successfully bridged (p < 0.001). There was no significantdifference in post-transplant 1, 5, and 10-year survival between RVAD andnon-RVAD patients (71.4%, 71.4%, and 71.4% for RVAD patients, vs 90.5%, 80.4%,and 78.5%, respectively, for non-RVAD patients; p = 0.366). Pretransplant RVADsupport was not a risk factor for post-transplant mortality (p = 0.864).CONCLUSIONS: Severe RVF adversely impacted bridging to transplant, althoughsurvival was improved with early RVAD insertion. The trend toward worsepost-transplant survival in the RVAD cohort raises the possibility that ifadditional patients were evaluated, a difference in survival might be observed,suggesting the need for a multicenter analysis.
