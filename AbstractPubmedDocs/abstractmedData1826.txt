Continuous-flow rotary blood pumps offer exciting new perspectives.METHODS AND RESULTS: Two male patients (ages 44 and 65 years) suffering fromend-stage left heart failure were implanted with a DeBakey VAD axial-flow pumpfor use as a bridge to transplant. In the initial postoperative period, the mean pump flow was 3.9+/-0.5 L/min, which equals a mean cardiac index (CI) of2.3+/-0.2 L. min(-1). m(-2). In both patients, the early postoperative phase was characterized by a completely nonpulsatile flow profile. However, with therecovery of heart function 8 to 12 days after implantation, increasing pulsepressures became evident, and net flow rose to 4.5+/-0.6 L/min, causing anincrease of mean CI up to 2.7+/-0.2 L. min(-1). m(-2). Patients were mobilizedand put through regular physical training. Hemolysis stayed in the physiological range and increased only slightly from 2. 1+/-0.8 mg/dL before surgery to3.3+/-1.8 mg/dL 6 weeks after implantation.CONCLUSIONS: The first clinical implants of the DeBakey VAD axial-flow pump have demonstrated the device to be a promising measure of bridge-to-transplantmechanical support.
