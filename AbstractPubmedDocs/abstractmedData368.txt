Patients (pts) may need to be bridged with a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) while on the transplant list aslogistic factors like organ availability are unknown. Cardiac transplantationpost-LVAD can be a surgically challenging procedure and outcome in these pts isperceived to be poorer based on experience with earlier generation pulsatile flowpumps. Data from a single institution comparing these pts with those undergoingdirect transplantation in the present era of continuous flow device therapy arelimited.AIM: Evaluate results of cardiac transplantation in pts bridged with a CF-LVAD(BTx) and compare outcomes with pts undergoing direct transplantation (Tx) in asingle institution.RESULTS: From June 2007 till January 2012, 106 pts underwent cardiactransplantation. Among these, 37 (35%) pts (51±11 years; 85% male) were bridgedwith a CF-LVAD (BTx), while 70 (65%) comprised the Tx group (53±12 years; 72%males). The median duration of LVAD support was 227 (153,327) days. During theperiod of LVAD support, 10/37 (27%) pts were upgraded to status 1A and all weresuccessfully transplanted. Median hospital stay in the BTx (14 days) was slightlylonger than the Tx group (12 days) but not statistically significant (p=0.21).In-hospital mortality in the BTx (5%) and Tx (1%) were comparable (p=0.25).Estimated late survival in the BTx cohort was 94±7, 90±10 and 83±16% at the endof one, two and three years, respectively which was comparable to 97±4%, 93±6%and 89±9% for the Tx group (p=0.50).CONCLUSION: Cardiac transplantation after LVAD implant can be performed withexcellent results. Patients can be supported on the left ventricular assistdevice even for periods close to a year with good outcome after cardiactransplantation.Copyright © 2013 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and ThoracicSurgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ).
