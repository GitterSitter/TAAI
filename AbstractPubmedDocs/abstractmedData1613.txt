Recent changes in protocol have resulted in adecreased incidence of infections, thromboembolism, and mortality.METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all 43 patients who receivedimplantable LVADs at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. After 1998, a number ofprotocol modifications were instituted. Vascular grafts were changed from alow-porosity, woven polyester (Cooley) to a gelatin-sealed, knitted polyestergraft (Vascutek), the devices were implanted pre-peritoneally rather than in the posterior rectus sheath, and extensive drainage of the chest and pre-peritonealpocket was used. The following anti-coagulation regimen was used:low-molecular-weight Dextran for 1 day, initiated after chest tube drainage <50cc/hour; then IV heparin for 10 to 14 days, beginning at 500 U/hour, slowlyincreasing partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2 x control; and finallyCoumadin, maintaining the international normalized ratio at 2.5 to 3.5. Dailyaspirin, 325 mg, was begun on post-operative Day 7. We compared 22 patients whoelectively underwent surgery before the changes, Group I, with 18 patientstreated thereafter, Group II.RESULTS: Groups I and II were well matched with regard to age (47 vs 44 years);cause of heart failure (idiopathic, 50% vs 44%; ischemic, 50% vs 56%), andduration of support (79 vs 76 days). The incidence of thromboemboliccerebrovascular events was significantly less in Group II (6%) than in Group I(23%), p = 0.025. The incidence of bleeding increased mildly in Group I. Pocketinfections occurred in 27% of Group I patients vs 11% of Group II patients, p =0.018. Only 2 patients (11%) in Group II died while receiving device support, vs 7 (32%) in Group I, p = 0.019.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that pre-peritoneal implantation, use of a new generation of vascular grafts, extensive drainage, and a more restrictedanti-coagulation regimen improve outcome after Novacor LVAD implantation foradvanced heart failure.
