Although cardiactransplantation is the most effective treatment in patients with end-stage heart failure, its availability is limited. While waiting for transplantation, somepatients become refractory to treatment and deteriorate progressively. Secondary multi-organ damage could highly compromise the transplant success and also could contraindicate it. Mechanical ventricular assist devices allow reestablishingnormal cardiac output and they have been used as a bridge to recovery andtransplantation. We report four patients that underwent mechanical ventricularsupport using the ABIOMED BVS 5000 system as a bridge for transplantation. Twopatients were connected to biventricular assistance; a third patient wasconnected to a left ventricular support and the fourth to a right ventricularsupport. Three were successfully transplanted and one died of refractorynon-cardiogenic shock. There were no complications related to the support system,such as infection, hemorrhage or stroke. In our experience, the ABIOMED BVS 5000 was an effective strategy as a bridge to heart transplant in patients incardiogenic shock.
