Each patientunderwent an individualized process of weaning focused on principles ofventricular unloading, gradual reconditioning, and transition to medical therapy.RESULTS: After varying reconditioning periods, 27 patients (16 men, 11 women;age, 39 ± 12 years) underwent LVAD explant, and 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman; age, 22 ± 6 years) were evaluated for explantation but could not be weaned. Theduration of LVAD support was 533 ± 424 days (range, 42-1,937 days) for theexplant cohort and 1,097 ± 424 days (range, 643-1,483) for the non-explantcohort. The LV end-diastolic dimension, LV ejection fraction, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index in the explant cohort weresignificantly improved at explantation (all, p < 0.05). Two late deaths occurred after LVAD explantation despite satisfactory native cardiac function, and 1patient required resumption of LVAD support 2.7 years after device removal. Theremaining explant patients remain in New York Heart Association classes I to IIwith medical management alone (mean survival post-explant, 1,172 ± 948 days). The3 candidates who could not be weaned ultimately underwent transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: The potential for recovery of native LV function after long-termcontinuous-flow LVAD support should encourage a more aggressive approach toventricular reconditioning with the goal of device explantation and a return tomedical management, particularly in young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
