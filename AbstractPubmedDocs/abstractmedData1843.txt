The pump is placed anterior to the left posterior rectussheath with the percutaneous drive line positioned in the right lower abdominalwall. The seamless polyurethane blood sac is compressed by two solenoid-drivenpusher plates. The inflow and outflow valves are porcine prostheses. The use ofwearable external power packs facilitate patient mobility and rehabilitationbefore transplantation and may provide long-term support to selected patients as an alternative to transplantation.
