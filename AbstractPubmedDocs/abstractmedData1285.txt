The Jarvik 2000 is distinctive in beingintracardiac. We report our experience in 22 patients.METHODS: The Jarvik 2000 was implanted in 15 men and 7 women. Mean age was 38.8(range 23-59) years, preoperative diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathy in 16,postpartum cardiomyopathy in 3, ischemic heart disease in 2, and chronicallograft failure in 1. Twenty-one patients were in New York Heart Associationclass IV, and 1 patient was in class III. Nineteen patients were on inotropicsupport, 6 were supported with an intra-aortic balloon pump, and 2 patients hadbeen salvaged with a Centrimag (Levitronix) ventricular assist device. The medianpulmonary vascular resistance was 3 Wood units; median pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 26.6 mm Hg; and mean Cardiac Index was 1.5 L/min/m2.RESULTS: There were 2 early deaths and 6 late deaths. The average postoperativeventilation time and Intensive Treatment Unit stay was 2.2 and 10 days,respectively. One patient required a right ventricular assist device forshort-term support and another for medium-term support. Seven patients werebridged to transplant, 3 had myocardial recovery, and 4 are ongoing. Mean andtotal duration of support was 280.5 and 6172 days, respectively. Drivelinefailures were noted in 3, but there were no pump infections or failure.CONCLUSION: The Jarvik 2000 provides satisfactory intermediate-term results as a bridge to transplant or recovery. It appears to be associated with a low rate of serious driveline or pump infections and technical failure. However, bleedingcomplications due to the required anticoagulation treatment frequently occurred.
