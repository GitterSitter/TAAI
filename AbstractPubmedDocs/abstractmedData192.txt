The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that mechanical dyssynchrony after CRT-D isa risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias.METHODS: A total of 266 consecutive CRT-D patients with class III or IV heartfailure, QRS duration ≥120 msec, and ejection fractions ≤ 35% were prospectively studied. Dyssynchrony was assessed before and 6 months after CRT-D usingspeckle-tracking radial strain anteroseptal-to-posterior wall delay, predefinedas ≥130 msec. Ventricular arrhythmias were predefined as appropriateantitachycardia pacing or shock, and the combined end point of ventriculararrhythmias, death, transplantation, or left ventricular assist deviceimplantation was followed over 2 years.RESULTS: Of the initial 266 patients, 11 died, five underwent transplantation,three received left ventricular assist devices before their 6-monthechocardiographic examinations, 19 (7%) had inadequate speckle-tracking at6-month follow-up, and 27 (10%) were lost to follow-up. Accordingly, the studygroup consisted of 201 patients. Dyssynchrony after CRT-D was observed in 79(39%) and was associated with a significantly higher ventricular arrhythmic eventrate: 21% (P < .001) with persistent dyssynchrony and 35% (P < .001) with newdyssynchrony, compared with 8% with no dyssynchrony after CRT-D. The combined endpoint of ventricular arrhythmias, death, transplantation, or left ventricularassist device implantation was significantly associated with dyssynchrony afterCRT-D (hazard ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-4.28; P = .001).Dyssynchrony after CRT-D was associated with ventricular arrhythmias or death in patient subgroups by cardiomyopathy type, QRS width, and morphology (P < .05 for all).CONCLUSIONS: Persistent or new radial dyssynchrony after CRT-D in severelysymptomatic patients with heart failure with widened QRS complexes and reducedejection fractions was associated with an increased rate of ventriculararrhythmias or death and appears to be a marker for a less favorable prognosis.Copyright © 2014.
