If weaning from ECMO is impossible, the implantation of a ventricular assist device (VAD) is required.Patients either go for recovery of myocardial function (bridge to recovery) orfor heart transplantation (bridge to transplant).METHODS: One hundred thirty-one patients were supported with ECMO between March1995 and November 2005. Reasons for ECMO implantation were acute heart failure,acute or chronic heart failure, and postcardiotomy heart failure. In 28 patients,subsequent VAD implantation was necessary (bridge to bridge concept).RESULTS: Fourteen bridge to bridge patients (50%) became long-time survivors witha mean follow-up of 39 months. Risk factors for mortality were statuspost-cardiopulmonary resuscitation and elevated lactate and bilirubin levelsbefore VAD implantation. Complications after ECMO and VAD implantation werebleeding and thromboembolic events. The most common cause of death was multiorganfailure.CONCLUSIONS: Bridge to bridge is a successful concept for selected patients with cardiogenic shock. During ECMO support, patients can be evaluated forcomorbidities. For patients with a combination of risk factors (statuspost-cardiopulmonary resuscitation, elevated lactate levels, and impaired liverfunction), VAD implantation should be considered very carefully.
