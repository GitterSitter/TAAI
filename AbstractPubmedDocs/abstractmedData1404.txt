Between 1994 and 2004, sevenchildren and adolescents (aged 7-18 years, mean age 13.5 years) were treated withVADs (5 Thoratec, 1 Medos, 1 Novacor) for circulatory support. Three patientsunderwent left ventricular support; biventricular support was necessary in fourpatients. Four patients (three left VADs, one bi-VAD) could be successfullybridged to heart transplantation after a mean support time of 163 days (56-258days). One 7-year-old girl (Medos-BVAD) died after a support time of 11 daysbecause of irreversible multiorgan failure. One 18-year-old patient wassuccessfully weaned from Thoratec BVAD after 66 days with complete recovery ofleft ventricular function. As good markers, atrial and brain natriuretic peptideswere found which reached normal values after recovery of myocardial function. A15-year-old girl is still on the device. In children or adolescents withirreversible shock in fulminant myocarditis with an anticipated mortality of100%, both successful bridging to heart transplantation and successful bridgingto recovery are possible. Young patients with fulminant myocarditis should berapidly transferred to a clinic with a mechanical circulatory support program to offer this life-saving option.
