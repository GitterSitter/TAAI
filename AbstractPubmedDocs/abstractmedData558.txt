The prolonged time for patients awaiting HTx on the high-urgency (HU) status leads mostly to serious medical complications.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the trend of changes in thefrequency of ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation in patients on the HUstatus.METHODS: A total of 22 adult patients awaiting transplantation on the HU statusat our hospital between January 2011 and December 2011 were analyzed, assessingrisk profile, blood group, and complication rates in terms of VAD implantation ordeath. Results were compared with 16 consecutive patients who were on transplant list with the HU status between January 2010 and December 2010 at ourinstitution.RESULTS: Mean age was 49.5 ± 12.1 (2010 group) years and 51.4 ± 10.7 years (2011 group; p = 0.62). Mean logEuroSCORES raised not significantly from 9.1 ± 6.3%(2010 group) to 10.7 ± 14.7% (2011 group; p = 0.68). Six patients died on the HU status and seven patients had to be supplied with a VAD in 2011. In comparisonwith the preceding year, only two patients died in 2010 and none of our patients on the HU status had to be provided with mechanical circulatory support.CONCLUSION: Because of the prolonged waiting time on the HU list, theearlier-mentioned data demonstrate a negative trend in transplant medicine.Especially when taking into consideration that five of seven patients who needed a VAD implantation during the HU waiting period had blood group O. Furthermore,the data derived from Eurotransplant show that the waiting period for patientswith blood group O was considerably longer when compared with patients of thesame average body height and weight but with other blood groups.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
