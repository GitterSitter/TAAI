We report a 69-year-olddepressed patient who committed suicide by disconnecting the driveline of hisleft ventricular assist device almost 3 years after implantation. We provide the medical, psychologic, and psychiatric background of this unique case. This reporthighlights the importance of pre-implant psychologic screening, the need forregular and long-term psychologic support for this vulnerable patient population,and the need for more qualitative research on patients' views on living with aleft ventricular assist device, together with research exploring risk profilesfor depression and suicide.Copyright 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
