To determine whether patients with impairedrenal and hepatic function improve over time with continuous-flow leftventricular assist device support or whether there are any detrimental effects inpatients with normal organ function, we divided patients into those withabove-normal and normal laboratory values before implantation and measured blood chemistry over time during left ventricular assist device support. There weresignificant improvements over 6 months in all parameters in the above-normalgroups, with values in the normal groups remaining in the normal range over time.Mean blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in the above-normal groupsdecreased significantly from 37+/-14 to 23+/-10 mg/dL (P<0.0001) and from1.8+/-0.4 to 1.4+/-0.8 mg/dL (P<0.01), respectively. There were decreases inaspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase in the above-normal groups from121+/-206 and 171+/-348 to 36+/-19 and 31+/-22 IU (P<0.001), respectively. Total bilirubin for the above-normal group was 2.1+/-0.9 mg/dL at baseline; after anacute increase at week 1, it decreased to 0.9+/-0.5 mg/dL by 6 months (P<0.0001).Both renal and liver values from patients in the normal groups remained normalduring support with the left ventricular assist device.CONCLUSIONS: The HeartMate II continuous-flow left ventricular assist deviceimproves renal and hepatic function in advanced heart failure patients who arebeing bridged to transplantation, without evidence of detrimental effects fromreduced pulsatility over a 6-month time period.
