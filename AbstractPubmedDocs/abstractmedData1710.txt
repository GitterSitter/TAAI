Medical and surgical therapy have helpedmany patients but when these options fail, heart transplantation remains the onlyother treatment available to help improve their condition. Heart transplantation suffers from the lack of a sufficient number of suitable donor organs, thecomplications of chronic immunosuppression, and many patients die while on thewaiting list. A number of pulsatile and nonpulsatile cardiac assist devices arebeing developed to provide chronic support for patients with heart failure and tobe an alternative to heart transplantation. It is estimated that as many as60,000 patients with heart failure could be helped by mechanical devices used forchronic support. For these devices to be effective they must provide sufficientcardiac output to allow patients to perform their daily activities, have a lowrisk of thromboemboli, be fully implantable thereby reducing the risk ofinfection, and have a low incidence of device malfunction requiring part or allof the device to be replaced. In this article, we will review several new deviceswhich have been developed over the past 5 years or so and will be in humanclinical trials in the United States soon, either as a bridge or as analternative to heart transplantation.
