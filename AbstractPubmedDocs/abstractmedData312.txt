Epub 2013Nov 28.Five-week use of a monopivot centrifugal blood pump as a right ventricular assistdevice in severe dilated cardiomyopathy.Inoue T(1), Kitamura T, Torii S, Hanayama N, Oka N, Itatani K, Tomoyasu T,Irisawa Y, Shibata M, Hayashi H, Ono M, Miyaji K.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kitasato University School of Medicine, 1-15-1 Kitasato, Minami Ku, Sagamihara, 252-0374, Kanagawa, Japan,takaino0308@gmail.com.Right heart failure is a critical complication in patients requiring mechanicalventricular support. However, it is often difficult to provide adequate rightventricular support in the acute phase. A 41-year-old woman diagnosed withdilated cardiomyopathy with severe right heart failure underwent implantation of a paracorporeal pulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD, NiproCorporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a MERA monopivot centrifugal pump (Senko MedicalInstrument Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as a right ventricular assistdevice (RVAD). The patient developed ischemic enteritis 3 weeks after surgery,necessitating fasting and reversal of anticoagulation therapy. A targetinternational normalized ratio of 1.5 was selected, and aspirin administrationwas discontinued. Following recovery without thromboembolic events, the patientfailed the RVAD discontinuation test. Five weeks after surgery, the monopivotcentrifugal pump was exchanged for a pulsatile pump. No thrombus was evident onthe centrifugal pump. The patient was undergoing cardiac rehabilitation at thetime of this writing and awaiting heart transplantation.
