Epub 2011 Jan 6.Diaphragmatic implantation of the HeartWare ventricular assist device.Gregoric ID(1), Cohn WE, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's EpiscopalHospital, Houston, TX, USA.The HeartWare (HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA) ventricular assist device (HVAD)is designed to be implanted with the pump in the pericardial space and itsintegrally attached inflow cannula in the left ventricle. The uniquelyincorporated inflow cannula was originally designed to be inserted into thediaphragmatic surface of the heart, allowing the pump to sit on the flatteneddiaphragmatic surface. Commonly, however, the inflow cannula is placed throughthe usual left ventricular assist device insertion site, anterolateral to theleft ventricular apex. We describe the original, intended technique for inflowcannula insertion and HVAD placement on the diaphragmatic surface of the leftventricle. Our experience has confirmed that this placement results in theoptimal left ventricular position, with orientation of the inlet cannula parallelto the short axis of the left ventricle and anterior to the papillary muscleinsertion. This approach should protect against inflow obstruction andendocardial contact, with resulting arrhythmias. In addition, this positionresults in lateral placement of the outflow graft, avoiding the anterior andretrosternal surface of the right ventricle.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
