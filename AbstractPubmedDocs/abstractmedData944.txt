However, their survival is limited if multiorganfailure (MOF) proves to be irreversible. Although ventricular assist devices(VADs) have been shown to reverse end-organ failure in some patients, thepathophysiological mechanisms of end-organ failure and its regression are notfully understood, and clinical markers and thresholds for the "point of noreturn" are lacking. We investigated predictors of 30-day survival in patientssupported with a biventricular assist device (BVAD). We studied 157 patientsimplanted with a Berlin Heart EXCOR BVAD between 1987 and 2006. Children younger than 10 years and cases with postcardiotomy syndrome and transplant failure were excluded from the analysis as well as patients with technical or bleedingproblems requiring rethoracotomy. In total, 69 clinical, hemodynamic,echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Most of the patientssuffered from ischemic cardiomyopathy or acute myocardial infarction. Inaddition, the preoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and thesequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated. The patientswere divided into two groups regarding procedural success: group I-survival >30days or heart transplantation or weaning from device (n = 105) and group II-deathon system <30 days after surgery (n = 52). The 30-day procedural success rate was67%. The patients in group I had higher systolic blood pressure (96.7 vs. 90.1 mmHg, p = 0.027), lower serum creatinine (1.96 vs. 2.4 mg/dl, p = 0.001), andhigher arterial pH (7.43 vs. 7.37, p = 0.02). The multivariate analysisrecognized age, body temperature, systolic blood pressure, MODS score, and higherarterial pH as significant predictors for 30-day mortality. Standard markers for severity of cardiogenic shock and MOF do not predict survival on BVAD. Asexpected, older patients are at higher risk for death on BVAD. Acidosis and high MODS score predict unfavorable outcome. However, the prediction of clinicaloutcome in patients in severe cardiogenic shock supported by BVAD is possible in extreme situations only.
