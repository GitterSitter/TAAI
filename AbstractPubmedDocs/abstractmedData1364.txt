We investigated whether prophylactictreatment with low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), analogous to the useof IgG anti-D (anti-Rh) in preventing Rh immunization, can abrogate HLAallosensitization after left ventricular assist device implantation.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data from 84 consecutive heart failurepatients who underwent implantation of a left ventricular assist device as abridge to transplantation. After implantation, panel reactive antibody (PRA) was measured biweekly to assess sensitization (defined by PRA > 10%). Patients whowere sensitized before left ventricular assist device implantation were excluded from further analysis (n = 12). Patients who either did not requireperioperatively transfusions of cellular blood products or received otherimmunomodifying regimens were also excluded from further analysis (n = 21). Therest of the patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received IVIG, 10 g daily for 3 days (IVIG group, n = 26; non-IVIG group, n = 25). Thedecision as to whether patients received IVIG was not randomized but was based onsurgeon preference.RESULTS: The sensitization rates (expressed as ratio of sensitized patients tototal patients at risk) in the two groups were similar at consecutive time points(2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20 weeks) after left ventricular assist device implantation.Also, mean PRA at the same time points did not differ between the two groups.Overall, 34.6% (9 of 26) of the IVIG group became sensitized during mechanicalsupport, compared with 32% (8 of 25) of the non-IVIG group (p = 1.0). A PRA of90% or greater (high-degree sensitization) occurred in 15.3% (4 of 26) of theIVIG group and 12.0% (3 of 25) of the non-IVIG group (p = 0.5).CONCLUSIONS: The use of low-dose prophylactic IVIG after left ventricular assist device implantation affects neither the incidence nor the severity of HLAallosensitization.
