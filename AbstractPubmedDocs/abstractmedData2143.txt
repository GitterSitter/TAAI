ASAIO Trans. 1988 Jul-Sep;34(3):455-9.Cumulative clinical experience with the Symbion J7 TAH.Gaykowski R(1), Taylor KD, Yates WG.Author information: (1)Symbion, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah 84103.As of March 1, 1988, 92 patients have received the Symbion J7 pneumatic TAH as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. All implantee's were Category 6 (Urgent Need) patients, exhibiting functional Class IV symptoms or facing imminent death, inthe judgment of their physician prior to obtaining a suitable cardiac allograft. Sixty-three of these patients, (68%) were transplanted. Of the 56 transplants 35 (56%) patients are currently alive, with most returning home and back to work.Implant duration ranged from 1 to 243 days of support, with an average of 24days. Implantee average age was 42 years, with a range of 15-60 years.Male/female distribution was 80/12, with the females requiring longer periods of pump support and exhibiting lower survival rates. Several main implant categorieshave surfaced during the study, with the collective disease category ofcardiomyopathy constituting 66% of the study population. This broad category may be subdivided into ischemic cardiomyopathy 52%, idiopathic 25%, viral 7%, andmiscellaneous 16%. Acute rejection of donor organ (17%) and unweanable patients(11%) constitute the other major implant categories. Postoperative complications observed in a population cohort of 70 patients include bleeding in 44%, infectionin 34%, reoperation in 27%, neurologic dysfunction in 13%, and device failure in none. Standardized device explant analysis results indicate a trend in thrombusreduction concurrent with increased investigator experience and improved patient management techniques. The concept of bridging in a specific group of patients inwhich the prognosis is otherwise hopeless continues to demonstrate therapeuticvalue.
