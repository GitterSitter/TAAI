Epub 2012Mar 10.Young patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy have higher likelihood of leftventricular recovery during left ventricular assist device support.Goldstein DJ(1), Maybaum S, MacGillivray TE, Moore SA, Bogaev R, Farrar DJ,Frazier OH; HeartMate II Clinical Investigators.Author information: (1)Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, USA. dgoldste@montefiore.orgBACKGROUND: Recovery of ventricular function during left ventricular assistdevice (LVAD) support allowing device explantation occurs infrequently. Weexplored the hypothesis that certain patient profiles are more likely to exhibit LV recovery during LVAD support.METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of data from the HeartMate IIbridge to transplant (BTT) and destination therapy (DT) trials was conducted,including 490 BTT, 600 DT, and 18 compassionate-use patients. Of the 1,108patients, 20 (1.8%; 10 BTT, 10 DT) were explanted owing to LV recovery. Themedian age was 33 years, and 12 patients (60%) were <40 years of age. History of heart failure was <1 year for 11 patients (61%), and the primary etiology wasnonischemic (90%). Of the patients with nonischemic etiologies and <1-yearhistory of heart failure, 13% were explanted. Three patients required LVADreimplantation; of the remaining 17, 16 remain alive. At follow-up (median 510days), the mean ejection fraction was 42% (20%-67%) and the mean left ventricularend-diastolic diameter was 55 ± 8 mm. At the 2-year follow-up (n = 13), patients were New York Heart Association functional class I or II and overall survivalrate was 85 ± 11%.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that LV recovery is most likely tooccur in young patients (<40 years) with nonischemic cardiomyopathy of <1 yearduration. Two-year postexplant survival was excellent.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
