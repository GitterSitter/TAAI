Martin@ch11.ukl.uni-freiburg.deThe clinical use of mechanical circulatory assist devices as bridge totransplantation has been proved as life-saving therapy in a large population ofpatients. Learning from the clinical experience the construction of the bloodpumps has been markedly improved over the last years. The better outcome of thepatients has enabled a broader use of ventricular assist devices. The novel axialpumps are designed for long-term circulatory support. After further reduction of device related complications (first of all thromboembolic events) these systemsmay provide a future alternative to heart transplantation.
