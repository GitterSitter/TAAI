We evaluated renal function andintrarenal blood flow in five advanced heart failure patients who had beensupported with a Toyobo LVAS for bridge to heart transplantation. Renal function expressed as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using themodified formula of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease. Mean blood velocities in the bilateral segmental arteries during systolic and diastolic perfusion were measured using duplex Doppler sonography, and renal vascular resistance(resistive index [RI]) of the segmental arteries was defined as (peak systolicvelocity [PSV]-end-diastolic velocity [EDV])/PSV. All studies were performedbefore and after implantation (mean duration of support, 15.6±10.9 months). LVAS implantation significantly improved eGFR (42.7±7.9 to 64.1±16.3mL/min, P<0.05).Beat-by-beat measurements of heart rate did not change significantly. Mean PSVdecreased significantly (38.2±8.9 to 28.3±2.2cm/s, P<0.05), and mean EDVincreased significantly (8.3±3.2 to 11.3±1.3cm/s, P<0.05), and thus, mean RI was significantly improved (0.79±0.06 to 0.60±0.04, P<0.01). In conclusion, inadvanced heart failure patients, pulsatile LVAS implantation is associated withimproved renal function, and this improvement may be mediated in part through an improvement of intrarenal hemodynamics.© 2011, Copyright the Authors.
