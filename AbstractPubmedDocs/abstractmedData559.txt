Most patients are diagnosed late in their life, undergoessurgical repairs, eventually leading to systemic ventricular failure needingheart transplant or mechanical circulatory assistance. As, aorta is locatedanterior to and left of the PA (Transposition of great arteries), the outflowgraft of ventricular assist device traverse across pulmonary artery to reachaorta which poses challenge during further surgical explorations.PMCID: PMC3504508
