Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and thirdgeneration LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimatecomparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flowLVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS.METHODS AND RESULTS: A semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHScosts data and patient data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database(BTDB). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY werecalculated for patients receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotropesupported medical management. LVADs cost £80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices anddelivered greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilisticincremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95%CI:£31,802-£94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates weresensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the device cost by15% decreased the ICER to £50,106 ($79,533)/QALY.CONCLUSIONS: Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefitsat higher costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK thresholdof £20,000 to £30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now beginsto approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently recommended by the British NHS. Cost-effectiveness estimates are hampered by the lack ofrandomized trials.Copyright © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.. All rightsreserved.
