Hearttransplantation is the most effective therapy, but the number of eligiblepatients far outweighs the number of available donor hearts. The left mechanical ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been developed as a successful substitution therapy that aids the failing ventricle while a patient is waiting for the donor heart. We obtained genomics data from paired human heart samples harvested at thetime of LVAD implant and explant. The heart failure patients in our study weresupported by the LVAD for various periods of time. The goal of this study is tomodel the relationship between the time of LVAD support and gene expressionchanges.RESULTS: To serve the purpose, we propose a novel penalized partial least squares(PPLS) method to build a regression model. Compared with partial least squaresand Breiman's random forest method, PPLS gives the best prediction results forthe LVAD data.
