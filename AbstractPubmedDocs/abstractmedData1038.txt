We tested the hypothesis that when PH persists after adequate left ventricle unloading via recent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy,phosphodiesterase type 5A inhibition would decrease PH in this population.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an open-label clinical trial using controlpatients not receiving therapy. Between 1999 and 2007, 138 consecutive patientsundergoing cardiac transplantation evaluation with advanced left ventriculardysfunction, an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and PH (defined by apulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >3 Woods Units), were treated with LVADtherapy. Fifty-eight of these patients reduced their pulmonary capillary wedgepressure to a value <15 mm Hg (11.8+/-2.0 mm Hg from baseline 23.2+/-6.2 mm Hg) 1to 2 weeks after LVAD implantation, but despite this improvement, the PVR ofthese patients was only minimally affected (5.65+/-3.00 to 5.39+/-1.78 WoodUnits). Twenty-six consecutive patients from this group with persistentlyelevated PVR were started on oral phosphodiesterase type 5A inhibition withsildenafil and titrated to an average of dose of 51.9 mg by mouth 3 times perday. The average PVR in the sildenafil-treated group fell from 5.87+/-1.93 to2.96+/-0.92 Wood Units (P<0.001) and the mean pulmonary artery pressure fell from36.5+/-8.6 to 24.3+/-3.6 mm Hg (P<0.0001) and was significantly lower whencompared with the 32 LVAD recipients not receiving sildenafil at weeks 12 to 15after the initial post-LVAD hemodynamic measurements (13 to 17 weeks post-LVADimplantation). In addition, hemodynamic measurements of right ventricularfunction in sildenafil-treated patients was also improved compared with patients not receiving sildenafil.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent PH after recent LVAD placement,phosphodiesterase type 5A inhibition in this open-label trial resulted in asignificant decrease in PVR when compared with control patients.PMCID: PMC4001820
