Understanding the neurohormonal, inflammatory andmolecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology of this syndrome has led tothe development of effective and widely used pharmacological treatments. Despite this, mortality and hospitalization rates associated with this condition remainhigh. The natural course of this illness is usually progressive, often leadinginexorably to end stage heart failure, for which orthotopic heart transplant is atreatment option but one with limited resource. In the past decade, mechanicalcirculatory support has emerged as a potential therapy for certain patients with advanced heart failure. This article reviews the published data regardingbiomarkers in the setting of mechanical circulatory support, and highlights areasof ongoing work and potential future areas of interest.
