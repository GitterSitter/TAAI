Smaller studies have suggested that advanced age should not be a contraindication to bridge to transplantation (BTT) LVAD placement. The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes in patients 60 years and older undergoing BTT with continuous-flow LVADs.METHODS: The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was reviewed toidentify first-time OHT recipients 60 years of age and older (2005-2010).Patients were stratified by preoperative support: continuous-flow LVAD,intravenous inotropic agents, and direct transplantation. Survival after OHT was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier method. All-cause mortality was examined usingmultivariable Cox proportional hazard regression.RESULTS: Of 2,554 patients, 1,142 (44.7%) underwent direct transplantation, 264(10.3%) had LVAD BTT, and 1,148 (45.0%) had BTT with inotropic agents. The meanage was 64±3 years, and 460 (18.0%) patients were women. Mean follow-up was 29±19months. Survival differed significantly among the 3 groups. Patients with LVADBTT had significantly lower survival after OHT compared with the other groups at 30 days and 1 year. This survival difference was no longer significant at 2 yearsafter OHT or when deaths in the first 30 days were censored. LVAD BTT increasedthe hazard of death at 1 year by 50% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 1.05-2.15; p=0.03), compared with patients who underwent directtransplantation.CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest modern cohort in which survivalafter OHT has been evaluated in patients 60 years or older who received BTT.Older patients have lower short-term survival after OHT when BTT is carried outwith a continuous-flow LVAD compared with inotropic agents or directtransplantation.Copyright © 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
