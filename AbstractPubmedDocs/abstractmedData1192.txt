We retrospectively reviewed the short-term andlong-term outcomes after cardiac retransplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight cases (18 males, 7 females; mean age, 50.3 +/- 13.5 years) underwent cardiac retransplantation: 25 first retransplantations and 3 second retransplantations. The indications for retransplantation were primarygraft failure (PGF) in 11 patients (39.3%), intractable acute cardiac rejection(IACR) in 4 patients (14.3%), and coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in 13patients (46.4%). The patients had been supported as follows: prolongedcardiopulmonary bypass (CPB; n = 3), intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP; n = 1), intravenous inotropic support (n = 7), extracorporeal membranoxygenator (ECMO; n = 3), ventricular assist device (VAD; n = 4), and no inotropic support (n = 10). There were 8 deaths within 30 days after retransplantation (28.6%). The overall1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 46.4%, 40.6%, 32.5%, and 32.5%,respectively. Acute cardiac rejection was the most common cause of death (43.8%).Thirty-day and 1-year survival rates of IACR, PGF, and CAV were 50.0%/0%,63.6%/45.5%, and 84.6%/68.4%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival after retransplantation was acceptable forpatients with CAV and PGF; however, we must select patients for retransplantationcarefully if the indication is IACR, because of the poor outcome.
