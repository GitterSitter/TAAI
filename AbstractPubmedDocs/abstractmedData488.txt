Primarily owing to the presenceof a driveline that connects the device to an external battery through an openskin incision, the rates of LVAD-related infections (LVADRIs) are high, rangingfrom 30 to 50%. LVADRIs can be broadly classified into driveline infection, pump pocket infection, bloodstream infection and endocarditis/pump or cannulainfection. Diagnostic evaluation and management of these complicated infectionscan be quite challenging for clinicians involved in the care of these patients.Here, the authors summarize the current epidemiology, microbiology, diagnosticapproach and management strategies for each type of LVADRI. The authors alsoreview current concepts regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for LVAD implantation.Finally, the authors highlight the gaps in the knowledge of LVADRI and providedirections for future studies.
