San Vicente Boulevard, Suite A3600, LosAngeles, CA 90048, USA.The medical/surgical management of advanced heart failure has evolved rapidlyover the last few decades. With better understanding of heart failurepathophysiology, new pharmacological agents have been introduced that haveresulted in improvements in survival. For those patients that fail to improve,mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices and totalartificial hearts (TAHs) have served as a beneficial bridge to transplantation.The TAH has continued to play a significant role as a bridge to transplantationin patients with biventricular failure and more selected indications that couldnot be completely helped with left ventricular assist devices. Improved survival with the TAH has resulted in more patients benefiting from this technology.Improvements will eventually lead to a totally implantable device that willpermanently replace the failing human heart.
