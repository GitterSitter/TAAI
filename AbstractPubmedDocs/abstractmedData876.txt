As the populationof patients with severe heart failure has grown, the utilization of MCSDs hasincreased considerably. That trend is expected to continue, especially in lightof dramatic advances in MCSD technology. This review outlines the current status and future directions of mechanical circulatory support therapy in the setting ofa constantly evolving field of supportive devices and adjuvant therapies.
