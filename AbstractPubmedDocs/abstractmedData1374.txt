Recententhusiasm has developed for the role of mechanical circulatory support for this ever-growing population of sick patients. Although much attention has beendirected toward ventricular assist devices, less information is availableregarding the role of the total artificial heart. Indeed, efforts in this latter technology have allowed the relatively recent deployment of a variety of completecirculatory assist devices. The purpose of this article is to review thehistorical development, current use, and future role of total artificial hearts.
