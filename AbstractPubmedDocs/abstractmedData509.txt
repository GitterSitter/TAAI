We sought to establish theimportant haemodynamic determinants of alterations in serum creatinine.METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed data from 443 patients treated for ADHF withhaemodynamic guidance in a single centre. WRF and IRF were defined as a 25%increase or decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from time of admission to pulmonary artery catheter removal, respectively. Of the 443patients, 46 (10%) experienced WRF and 127 (29%) had IRF. Baseline eGFR was lowerin patients with IRF when compared with stable patients or those with WRF (45 ±25 vs. 63 ± 30 vs. 68 ± 27 mL/min/m(2), respectively, P < 0.0001). In contrast,the relative decrease in mean blood pressure (BP) was more pronounced in patientswith WRF when compared with stable patients or those with IRF (15 ± 15 vs. 9 ± 17vs. 4 ± 15%, respectively, P = 0.003). With larger decreases in mean BP, therewas greater likelihood of experiencing WRF (P = 0.04) but less likelihood ofexperiencing IRF (P = 0.01). In contrast, the degree of changes in right atrialpressure or cardiac index did not affect the propensity for developing WRF orIRF. There was no difference in adverse clinical outcomes (death, hearttransplantation, LV assist device implantation, or readmission) between the threegroups (P = 0.56).CONCLUSION: Blood pressure decrease, rather than alterations in cardiac output orcentral venous pressure, were associated with changes in serum creatinine during treatment of ADHF.
