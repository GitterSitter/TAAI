We investigated theoutcome of 20 patients (15 men, and 5 women, aged between 15 and 66 years) eachsupported for more than 100 days between September 1987 and August 1996. Theindications for implantation were bridging in 17 patients, myocarditis in 2patients, and postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock in one patient. 12 patientsreceived the Novacor IVAD, 4 patients the Thoratec system, 3 patients theHeartMate device and one patient both Novacor and Thoratec. Mean duration ofsupport was 178.1 days, 15 patients were transplanted, 14 of them could bedischarged, 2 patients died, 4 patients are still waiting. The most frequentcomplication was device-related infection in 11 patients. The results have shown that all three systems are safe and reliable devices for supporting patients for more than 100 days.
