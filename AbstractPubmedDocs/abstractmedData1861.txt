One of the devices available is the ThoratecVAD, which can be applied for univentricular or biventricular support. BetweenMarch 1992 and June 1997, 74 patients were bridged with Thoratec VAD to cardiactransplantation. In 67 patients the system was applied exclusively (26 LVAD, 38BVAD, 3 TAH), in 7 patients subsequently or in combination with another MCSdevice. 71.6% with exclusive Thoratec application underwent transplantation with a post-transplant survival rate of 90%, 4 patients are still waiting. Transplant rate in LVAD and BVAD patients was 84% and 71.4%, respectively, posttransplantsurvival 95.2% and 88%, respectively. 28.6% with a combined application ofThoratec and another MCS device survived to be discharged from hospital. Maincomplications were bleeding, liver failure, multiple organ failure, andinfections. In terms of reliability and efficacy the Thoratec VAD is the systemof choice for mid-term application in patients bridged to cardiactransplantation.
