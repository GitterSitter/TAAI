We present a case of LVAD insertion ina 46-year-old man with cyanotic complex congenital heart disease and an extensivesurgical history who presented with failure of his systemic ventricle. Theinsertion of an LVAD in our patient restored cardiac output and improved cyanosisand native ventricular function. As the number of patients with congenital heart defects surviving to adulthood increases, destination LVAD therapy may beincreasingly considered as an alternative.
