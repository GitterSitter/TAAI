The waiting time for heart transplantation is increasing, and more andmore patients receive the pump for permanent support. We retrospectively analyzedour database of patients supported with the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device to identify instances of cable damage. Between May 9, 2006 and May 9,2012, 161 patients were supported with the HeartMate II. There were 187cumulative years of HeartMate II support. The documented cable damage occurred in12 patients (7.5%), requiring pump exchange in five patients after a mean time of706 days on support. There was no perioperative mortality. The damage occurredtypically at the "weak" place-the feedthrough of the driveline to the pump body. In some cases, the device alarm history and x-ray may allow diagnosis before pumpstop occurs. However, since the most recent changes in the design of theconnection and modifications made in the implantation technique, no instance ofcable damage has been registered.
