These policies have been based onalgorithms that allocate a higher priority status to those patients who are themost infirm, and would thereby benefit patients in the most dire ofcircumstances. Over the last 2 decades, the increased use of LVADs as a bridge totransplantation has had a major impact on lowering the mortality among those onthe heart transplant waiting list. Given the constant risk of potentialcomplications related to these devices, early UNOS policies were implemented tospecifically allocate higher priority status to patients on LVADs. However,recent advances in LVAD technology coupled with refinements in patient selection and management have dramatically improved patient survival and led to a reductionin complications. It is inevitable that favorable experiences with the currentgeneration of LVADs coupled with continued improvements in technology will leadto increased use of these devices as a bridge to transplantation or to candidacy.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
