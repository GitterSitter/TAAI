The Berlin Heart EXCORventricular assist device (VAD) was recently introduced into practice in NorthAmerica to address this deficiency. We report a preliminary single centerexperience with the EXCOR in 17 children, 13 who received only a left-sided pump and four who required biventricular support. Before EXCOR placement, six patientswere on ECMO, and one was on a centrifugal VAD. Eleven children were bridged totransplantation, one was bridged to recovery, and one remains on support. Threechildren died during support and one died after explantation. There was one late death nearly 2 years after transplant. Complications included stroke in sevenpatients, two of which were ultimately fatal. Five patients requiredre-operations for bleeding or evacuation of hematoma. Despite a disappointingrate of neurologic morbidity, our preliminary experience with the EXCOR has been very encouraging.
