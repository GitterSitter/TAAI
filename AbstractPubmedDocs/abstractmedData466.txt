Published data are limited to 1 in 4 children who receivedthe device as part of the US clinical trial. We analyzed outcomes for all USchildren who received the EXCOR to characterize device outcomes in an unselected cohort and to identify risk factors for mortality to facilitate patientselection.METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study involved allchildren implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assistdevice at 47 centers from May 2007 through December 2010. Multiphasenonproportional hazards modeling was used to identify risk factors for early (<2 months) and late mortality. Of 204 children supported with the EXCOR, the median duration of support was 40 days (range, 1-435 days). Survival at 12 months was75%, including 64% who reached transplantation, 6% who recovered, and 5% who werealive on the device. Multivariable analysis identified lower weight,biventricular assist device support, and elevated bilirubin as risk factors forearly mortality and bilirubin extremes and renal dysfunction as risk factors for late mortality. Neurological dysfunction occurred in 29% and was the leadingcause of death.CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR has risen dramatically over the pastdecade. The EXCOR has emerged as a new treatment standard in the United Statesfor pediatric bridge to transplantation. Three-quarters of children survived totransplantation or recovery; an important fraction experienced neurologicaldysfunction. Smaller patient size, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, andbiventricular assist device use were associated with mortality, whereasextracorporeal membrane oxygenation before implantation and congenital heartdisease were not.
