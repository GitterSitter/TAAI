Circulation. 1997 Feb 18;95(4):814-7.Left ventricular assist device infection is associated with increased mortalitybut is not a contraindication to transplantation.Herrmann M(1), Weyand M, Greshake B, von Eiff C, Proctor RA, Scheld HH, Peters G.Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Muenster Hospital, Germany.herrmam@uni-muenster.deBACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used as abridge to transplantation. Infection is a frequent and major complicationassociated with the use of these devices, however, the correlation of infectionand outcome has not yet been evaluated in a prospective fashion.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (24 male, 1 female) with end-stagecardiac failure and resulting organ dysfunction were included. Patients werebridged with the Novacor N100 portable LVAD (median duration of support, 55 days)and were evaluated prospectively by device surface cultures on explantation,molecular typing of isolates, and correlation of infection with survival totransplant. Twelve (48%) of 25 patients had LVAD infection as defined by recoveryof multiple isolates of identical genotype from the device surface. Whereas only 5 (42%) of 12 patients with LVAD infection survived until transplantation, 11(85%) of 13 patients without infection were successfully transplanted (P < .05). Death of the 7 patients with proven LVAD infection was associated with multipleorgan failure or other signs of acute infection.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD infection is associated with a significantly decreased survivalprobability. It does not preclude successful bridging but rather may pose anindication for urgent transplantation.
