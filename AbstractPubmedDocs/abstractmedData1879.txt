During short-term follow-up of 40 days, 12 patients had undergone emergent implantation of a ventricular assist device (range 1-27 days, mean 5days), 4 died (range 14-38 days, mean 26 days), and 5 were alive and receivingonly medical therapy while waiting for a transplantation. In addition, fivepatients had undergone transplantation (range 5-29 days, mean 18 days, excludedfrom further analysis). Survival curves were constructed by comparing theincidence of death and the implantation of an emergent ventricular assist device in patients with values of a variable above or below the mean value (or medianfor nonnormally distributed data). There was a significantly greater incidence ofdeath or need for a ventricular assist device in patients with higher levels oftumor necrosis factor-alpha (P = .008), lower levels of serum sodium andhemoglobin (P = .02 and P = .03, respectively), higher heart rates (P = .03), andhigher plasma norepinephrine levels (P = .01). The Cox proportional hazards modeldemonstrated that only serum sodium (P = .03) independently predicted thosepatients who died or who required emergent left ventricular assist device.CONCLUSION: Numerous variables, particularly serum sodium, need to be considered when evaluating which patients on the transplant list require early assist deviceimplantation or urgent transplantation. These preliminary observations meritconfirmation in a larger patient population.
