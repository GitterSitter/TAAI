If severe respiratory failure occurs,extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is currently the treatment of choice. ECMO has the potential for severe complications. Interventional lung assist (iLA)devices, e.g., the Novalung, are used in patients with isolated lung failure.This study aimed to show the feasibility of the combined use of the EXCOR VAD (10ml and 30 ml blood pumps) and the Novalung. There were two separate experimentswithin this study. First, a bench test was carried out to analyze pressure andflow through both devices. Second, 10 kg and 30 kg pigs received support with theVAD and iLA in series. Pressures and flow were measured systemically before andafter the iLA. Flow was unaffected by the iLA. The mean arterial pressure wasreduced (mean of 13 mm Hg) by the iLA. There were no obvious difficultiesobserved within the interaction of VAD and iLA. The combined use of both devices is feasible and able to provide sufficient perfusion pressures. Oxygenation andCO2 clearance was effectively supported by the iLA. Patients with myocardial and respiratory failure may benefit from this setup.
