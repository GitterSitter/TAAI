Between July 2009and March 2011, 46 patients with advanced heart failure had implantation of theHVAD. Of these patients, 30 had subsequent assessments for transplantation andthese patients formed the study cohort. Thirty patients had assessments at a meanof 201±86 days and 13 went on to have a second assessment at 351±86 days. Therewere marked improvements in hemodynamics and exercise capacity at bothassessments, with significant decreases in right and left heart fillingpressures; increases in cardiac index, New York Heart Association class, and peakexercise oxygen consumption; and reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (all P<.05). Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were unchangedat the first assessment, although there was a significant reduction inend-diastolic diameter at the second assessment (P<.01). There were nosignificant changes in a visual grade of right ventricular function. After up to 1 year of support, the HVAD system results in significant benefits in overallheart failure status, with improved hemodynamics and exercise capacity. Thisoccurs in the absence of marked changes in left ventricular size or rightventricular function.© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
