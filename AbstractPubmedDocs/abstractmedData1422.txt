Despite successful cardioversion and optimal medical therapy, the patient deteriorated and was supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO). Two days after initiating ECMO support, we implanted the DeBakey VADChild ventricular assist device (MicroMed Technology, Inc., Houston, TX) underthe Humanitarian Device Exemption program. Later, he was able to pursue normaldaily activities including physical rehabilitation and ambulation in thehospital. After 56 days, he underwent a successful cardiac transplantation. After3 months, he had good cardiac function and no evidence of rejection. The DeBakey VAD Child device is a valuable option for cardiac support as a bridge totransplantation.
