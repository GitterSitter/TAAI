However, despite continuous improvement in VAD technology, there remains a significant early postoperative morbidity andmortality in this extreme patient group. The aim of the current study was toexplore the short-term outcomes and predictors for 90 day mortality in thepatients after implantation of continuous-flow LVAD. Perioperative clinical,echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and laboratory data of 90 day survivors andnonsurvivors were collected and compared retrospectively. Multivariate logisticregression analysis was performed on univariate predictors for 90 day mortalitywith an entry criterion of p < 0.1. Between July 2006 and May 2012, 117 patients underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD as a bridge to transplantation: 71 (60.7%) HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) and 46 (39.3%) HVAD(HeartWare International, Framingham, MA). All-cause 90 day mortality was 17.1%. Multivariate analysis revealed higher preoperative central venous pressure (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.014-1.378; p = 0.033) andhigher age (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38; p = 0.045) as the only independentpredictors for 90 day mortality. Optimization of preoperative volume status,preload, and right heart function as well as age-based selection of candidatesfor LVAD support are the critical factors influencing early outcome aftercontinuous-flow LVAD implantation.PMCID: PMC3942348
