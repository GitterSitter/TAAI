J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1997 Sep;114(3):467-74.The Jarvik 2000 Oxford system: increasing the scope of mechanical circulatorysupport.Westaby S(1), Katsumata T, Evans R, Pigott D, Taggart DP, Jarvik RK.Author information: (1)Oxford Heart Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom.METHODS: We developed a system for mechanical circulatory support based on theJarvik 2000 intraventricular axial flow impeller pump (Jarvik Research, Inc., NewYork, N.Y.) and percutaneous electric power. The adult pump provides flow at arate up to 10 L/min with an energy requirement of 7 to 10 watts. The device wasimplanted into the apex of the left ventricle through a left thoracotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass. A Dacron graft conveyed blood to the descending thoracic aorta. In patients, we will use a skull-mounted carbon pedestal to transmit fine electric wires through the scalp skin. Being highly vascular, the scalp skin isresistant to infection.RESULTS: We tested 16 adult systems and one pediatric system in 17 adult ewesweighing between 60 and 90 kg. Five died of perioperative complications. Twelvesurvived between 3 and 198 days (mean 44 days) with a functioning device. None ofthe sheep could receive adequate anticoagulation with warfarin (INR 1.0 to 1.5). Acute thrombotic occlusion occurred after a 3-hour power loss in one device (46days) but was cleared with streptokinase. In a second animal with endocarditis,the pump inflow became occluded with vegetations. No other device-relatedproblems or important hemolysis developed despite pump speeds between 10,000 and 18,000 rpm. Renal function remained normal in all animals. Autopsy studies showedno pannus ingrowth at the device inflow despite the restrictive left ventricular cavity size. No sign of thromboembolism could be detected in the brains orkidneys.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the Jarvik 2000 Oxford System to be a safe and effective circulatory assist device. Potential uses include permanent circulatorysupport, bridge to transplantation, or bridge to myocardial recovery in acute or chronic left ventricular failure.
