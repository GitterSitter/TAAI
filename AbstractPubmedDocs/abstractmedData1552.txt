The indications for this therapeutic option ranges frombridging to cardiac transplantation, the application of the most recent systemsas an alternative to transplantation, as well as in cardiogenic shock followingopen-heart surgery, acute myocardial infarction of fulminant myocarditis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1987 and November 2002, 670 implantationsof 11 different mechanical circulatory support systems were performed in 607patients (125 women, 482 men, age 1 month - 82 years). 255 patients received the device as a bridge to recovery (BTR) of their native organ, 276 patients as abridge to cardiac transplantation (BTT), 49 patients as an emergency measure inlife-threatening cardiogenic shock (bridge-to-bridge, BTB), and 27 patients as analternative to transplantation (ATT).RESULTS: 38% of the BTR group, 56% of the BTT group, 34% of the BTB group and 27%of the ATT group underwent successful cardiac transplantation or could bedischarged from hospital. Infections and thromboembolic events were the mostfrequent complications but decreased with increasing experience andsophistication of devices. Some systems offer the possibility of dischargingpatients home while on the device. In our cohort, 90 patients left the hospitalon support for a mean duration of 204 days. Readmission rate after 200 days was50% and was system-related in less than 6%.CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a still considerable morbidity associated with theemployment of mechanical circulatory support, the results are encouraging andjustify the high economic burden.
