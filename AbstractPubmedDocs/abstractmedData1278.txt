We review our experience with the use of the CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, Mass) circulatory support system in such patients whose neurologicstatus was uncertain.METHODS: From January 2004 to June 2006, 30 patients underwent CentriMagcirculatory support system placement at the University of Minnesota. Of thesepatients, 12 were transferred from an outside hospital with refractory acutecardiogenic shock requiring biventricular support; they are the focus of thisstudy.RESULTS: Of our 12 study patients, 8 underwent successful bridging to theHeartMate XVE (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif) ventricular assist device after biventricular support (mean support time of 9.4 days, range: 5-22 days). Another 2 patients underwent successful explantation (after 8 and 9 days); the remaining 2 patients died (after 4 days). Thus, the survival on CentriMag support, toeither bridge or recovery, was 83% (10/12). Of the 8 patients who subsequentlyunderwent HeartMate implantation, 5 also underwent a heart transplant within 6.9 months (range, 4.5-10 months), another 2 are still awaiting a transplant, and 1died of sepsis and right ventricular failure 3 days after HeartMate implantation.Thus, for our 12 study patients, long-term survival was 75% at 1 month and 62.5% at 1 year.CONCLUSIONS: Our aggressive strategy in this group of patients involved earlyoperative intervention and implantation of biventricular support. By using thisstrategy, we avoided the urgent placement of expensive long-term ventricularassist devices in hemodynamically unstable patients with multisystem organfailure whose neurologic status was uncertain until end-organ recovery andexcellent hemodynamic stability were achieved with the relatively inexpensiveshort-term CentriMag circulatory support system. The excellent midterm outcomesin this group of patients whose original prognosis was poor justify thistherapeutic strategy.
