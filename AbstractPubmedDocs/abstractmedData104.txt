Despite the clinical importance and significant cost of short-termmechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, the state of their present use has not been analyzed on a national scale.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the demographics,treatment practices, survival rates, and cost of short-term MCS.METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed all adult patientsreceiving short-term MCS in the United States from 2004 to 2011 by using theNationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, use of percutaneous devices for short-term MCSincreased by 1,511% compared with a 101% increase in nonpercutaneous devices.Mortality rates declined over this period (p for trend = 0.027) from 41.1% in2004 to 2007 to 33.4% in 2008 to 2011. A similar trend was observed for thesubset of patients with cardiogenic shock, decreasing from 51.6% to 43.1% (p for trend = 0.012). Hospital costs also declined over this period (p for trend =0.011). Multivariable analysis revealed balloon pumps (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 2.52), coagulopathy (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.88 to 2.94), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR: 3.50; 95% CI: 2.20 to 5.57) before short-term MCS were among the most significant predictors of mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-term MCS in the United States has increased rapidly,whereas rates of in-hospital mortality have decreased. These changes have takenplace in the context of declining hospital costs associated with short-term MCS.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by ElsevierInc.
