As shown previously, clenbuterol increased the power ofelectrically conditioned SMVs wrapped around a mock system. Theseclenbuterol-supported SMVs pumped successfully from construction to severalmonths against a pressure of 60-70 mm Hg. Due to these successful formerexperiments, a muscular blood pump has been employed via a one-step procedure,trained within the circulation under the support of clenbuterol. It appeared tobe hemodynamically relevant and is expected to become clinically practicable for the treatment of end-stage heart failure.
