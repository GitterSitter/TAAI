Thesedevices are mainly used in patients with late stage heart failure (HF). We aredeveloping a novel percutaneous intra-aortic micro-axial fluid entrainment pumpintended for long-term MCS in patients with earlier stage HF. This study examinedthe pump's hemodynamic effects in a porcine model of acute HF. In three porcineexperiments, the pump was deployed in the thoracic aorta by standard cardiaccatheterization techniques and was anchored with self-expanding struts. Acutecardiac dysfunction was induced by infusing esmolol continuously. Pump supportincreased cardiac output (+10.4%), stroke volume (+8.9%), and ejection fraction(+10.8%) while decreasing cardiac stroke work (-10.8%) and afterload (-22.7%).Furthermore, pump support significantly enhanced renal perfusion throughsustained increases in both renal artery flow (+36.4%) and pressure (+73.6%). In a porcine model of acute HF, the catheter-based intra-aortic fluid entrainmentpump improved hemodynamics and renal perfusion. These results suggest that thepump could improve HF outcomes and patients' quality of life by resting theheart, promoting reverse remodeling, and augmenting end-organ perfusion.Furthermore, the enhanced renal perfusion may help disrupt the cardiorenalsyndrome cycle and improve HF treatment.
