A decision tool will be necessary to aid in the selectionof patients for destination left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as thetechnology progresses for implantation in ambulatory Stage D heart failurepatients. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether the Seattle HeartFailure Model (SHFM) can be used to risk-stratify heart failure patients forpotential LVAD therapy.METHODS: The SHFM was applied to REMATCH patients with the prospective additionof inotropic agents and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) +/- ventilator.RESULTS: The SHFM was highly predictive of survival (p = 0.0004). One-yearSHFM-predicted survival was similar to actual survival for both the REMATCHmedical (30% vs 28%) and LVAD (49% vs 52%) groups. The estimated 1-year survival with medical therapy for patients in REMATCH was 30 +/- 21%, but with a range of 0% to 74%. The 1- and 2-year estimated survival was </=50% for 81% and 98% ofpatients, respectively. There was no evidence that the benefit of the LVAD variedin the lower vs higher risk patients.CONCLUSIONS: The SHFM can be used to risk-stratify end-stage heart failurepatients, provided known markers of increased risk are included such inotrope useand IABP +/- ventilator support. The SHFM may facilitate identification ofhigh-risk patients to evaluate for potential LVAD implantation by providing anestimate of 1-year survival with medical therapy.
