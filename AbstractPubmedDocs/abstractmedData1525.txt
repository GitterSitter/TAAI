As a result, the demographic profile of patients presentingfor LVAD support has changed over time. We reviewed our institutional experience to identify emerging risk factors and changing trends in patients who receivedthe HeartMate VE LVAD.METHODS: The clinical records were reviewed of 131 consecutive LVAD recipientsbetween 1996 and 2001. All perioperative data were collected prospectively andentered into an institutional database. All patients received a preoperative riskstratification score based upon published criteria. The cohort was arbitrarilydivided into early (n = 45), mid (n = 45), and late groups (n = 41).RESULTS: Overall operative mortality was 25% with no difference between groups.The mean risk score increased significantly over time (early 3.5 +/- 0.4 vs. late5.3 +/- 0.3, p < 0.05). The proportion of patients at high risk for mortality(score >5) was significantly higher in the late group (51% vs. 29%, p < 0.05).Although ventilation time and ICU stay was similar for all groups, hospital stay was longer in the late group (43 days vs. 23 days, p < 0.05). Mean duration ofsupport fell from 90 to 59 days, but this failed to achieve statisticalsignificance. Out-patient therapy decreased from 73% in the early group to 15% inthe late group (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified right heart failure (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 2-11) and risk score (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6) asindependent predictors of death.CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increasingly high risk patient population, the mortality associated with LVAD therapy has remained constant. Duration of LVAD support has decreased with a trend toward transplantation before hospital discharge. Thesedata continue to support the aggressive institution of mechanical assistance for acute or chronic heart failure.
