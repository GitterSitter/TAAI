Cardiol Clin. 1992 Feb;10(1):185-92.Right ventricular assist devices and the surgical treatment of right ventricular failure.Higgins RS(1), Elefteriades JA.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.Treatment of patients with severe right ventricular dysfunction follows acontinuum of progressive therapies. If optimization of volume status andinotropic support do not adequately improve right ventricular function, higherlevels of mechanical circulatory support are required. A right-sided intraaortic balloon pump has been helpful in such circumstances. The centrifugal pump and theartificial ventricle provide the most effective long-term circulatory support forpatients with right ventricular or biventricular failure after cardiopulmonarybypass, myocardial infarctions, or as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. All ofthese support measures still carry a high morbidity and mortality. Survival inapproximately one third of these high-risk patients can be expected with the use of right ventricular assist devices. Cardiopulmonary bypass has also beeneffective for circulatory support of patients with massive pulmonary emboli.
