Between 1984 and 1987, 104 orthotopic heart transplantations were performed at Loyola University MedicalCenter. During the same period, 25 patients died while awaiting a donor organ. Toreduce the mortality, we began using the total artificial heart (TAH) and aventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to transplantation in 1988. Of 29patients who underwent transplantation, 15 patients required a TAH and threepatients required a VAD as a bridge. The underlying heart conditions wereischemic cardiomyopathy (11 patients), dilated cardiomyopathy (5 patients), giantcell myocarditis (1 patient), and allograft failure (1 patient). The averageduration of mechanical support was 10 days (range, 1 to 35 days). Of the 17patients who successfully underwent transplantation, 1 patient died at 17 daysbecause of acute rejection of the transplanted heart, and another patient died at14 days because of a cerebral vascular event. Fifteen patients (83%) werelong-term survivors. Nine patients required reoperation for bleeding. While themechanical device was in place, the activated clotting time was maintainedbetween 170 and 200 seconds with heparin. Dipyridamole was given. We concludethat the TAH and VAD are excellent mechanical bridges to transplantation.
