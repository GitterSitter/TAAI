In time-to-event analysis for all available follow-up using health status as a continuous variable, thepre-operative KCCQ score did not correlate with overall mortality after LVADimplantation (p = 0.178). Small absolute differences were seen between thepre-operative KCCQ quartile and 30-day survival (Q4 95% vs. Q1 89% vs. missing87%; p = 0.0009 for trend), 180-day survival (Q4 83% vs. Q1 76% vs missing 79%; p= 0.060 for trend), and days hospitalized at 180 days (Q4 29.8 ± 25.6 vs. Q1 34.1± 27.1 vs. missing 36.5 ± 29.9 days; p = 0.009 for trend).CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that pre-operative health status has limitedassociation with outcomes after LVAD implantation. Although these data requirefurther study in a diverse population, mechanical circulatory support mayrepresent a relatively unique clinical situation, distinct from heart failure andother cardiac surgeries, in which heart failure-specific health status measuresmay be largely reversed.© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published byInternational Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.PMCID: PMC3838487
