Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2013 Mar;10(1):101-7. doi: 10.1007/s11897-012-0123-7.Ventricular assist devices: is destination therapy a viable alternative in thenon-transplant candidate?Hrobowski T(1), Lanfear DE.Author information: (1)Henry Ford Heart and Vascular Institute, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI,USA.The topic of this article, stated a more familiar way, is whether leftventricular assist devices (LVADs) are ready for 'Primetime' as a therapeuticoption in and of themselves. In order to provide an update and insight on thisquestion, we briefly review from where the field has come, and in more detaildescribe its current state and where we are heading. We believe the short answer to this question is 'Yes', but like many things, a short answer is not adequate. Here we attempt to deliver a more comprehensive answer, providing some historicalcontext, outlining the great achievements that have been made, as well as themany challenges that still remain before LVADs become a truly mainstream therapy.PMCID: PMC3568259
