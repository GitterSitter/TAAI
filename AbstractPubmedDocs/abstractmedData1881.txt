From various kinds of clinical views, these cases were estimated andevaluated retrospectively according to the weaning results, long-term survivalrate and cause of death. Based upon our experiences and clinical results, analternate strategy of mechanical cardiac assistance for severe heart failure issuggested as follows. In the case of post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock or lowoutput syndrome, PCPS system should be applied firstly under intra-aortic balloonpumping (IABP) assist for a maximum of 2-3 days. If the native cardiac functiondoes not recover and more long-term support is needed, several types of VAD,which are more powerful and durable devices should be introduced, according toend organ function and expected support duration. In order to obtain betterclinical results, we have to select an appropriate device depending on thelimited availability of supporting duration. Generally speaking, centrifugalpumps can support in short-term duration, while pulsatile devices cover the broadspectrum of the supporting period. Pneumatic VADs can cover short-term tolong-term support up to a year, and electric VADs can cover over 1 year, and can be used as a bridge to heart transplantation.
