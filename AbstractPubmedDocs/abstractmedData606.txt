Parents mayfeel overwhelmed with the VAD regimes responsibility and be affected from thisprocess beside children. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the depressive andanxiety symptoms of mothers of the first eight children equipped with a VAD inTurkey. The mothers of eight pediatric patients living with VADs were filled BDI and STAI at first month of VAD implantation (E.I) and secondly six months aftertheir first evaluation (E.II). In E.I, the BDI mean score of mothers was 20.87,in E.II 14.37. STAI-S mean score was 53.37 in E.I and 43.62 in E.II. The Wilcoxonnonparametric-paired t-test revealed significant difference between baseline and end-point STAI-S scores (Z: -2.035; p: 0.042), and for BDI scores (Z, -1.965; p, 0.049). Prolonged usage of VAD may increase distress in parents. Psychiatricevaluation and support of the primary caregiver is important for the well-beingof the pediatric patients.Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
