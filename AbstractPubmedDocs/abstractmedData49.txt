[Epub aheadof print]HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device Placement in a Patient With CorrectedDextro-Transposition of Great Arteries: A Case Report and Its ClinicalChallenges.Sehgal S(1), Ramachandran S(2), Leff JD(2).Author information: (1)Hahnemann University Hospital/Drexel University College of Medicine,Philadelphia, PA, USA sehgal_sankalp@yahoo.com.

It is important to understand the management and complications observed in thispopulation that eventually progresses to systemic ventricular failure requiringcardiac transplantation. Our case focuses on the rapid right ventricle (RV)deterioration of a patient with corrected D-TGA following a surgical procedurerequiring systemic support. With such patients awaiting heart transplantation,there are limited assist devices available for RV support and no rightventricular assist device is approved for destination therapy yet. Currentindications for implantation of the HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD)are limited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the left ventriclesupport as a bridge to transplantation. However, its use in the United States forright-sided support has rarely been described for adult congenital defects. Inthis case, a HeartWare assist device was used to provide systemic support as abridge to cardiac transplant. The size and implantation design of the HVAD makes it a promising option for patients with this challenging patient population andRV failure as a late complication.Â© The Author(s) 2015.
