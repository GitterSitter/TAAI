Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 1990;4(1):54-6.The use of an implantable left ventricular assist device following irreversibleventricular fibrillation secondary to massive myocardial infarction.Lewis CT(1), Graham TR, Marrinan MT, Chalmers JA, Colvin MP, Withington PS,Coumbe A.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, London Hospital, Whitechapel, UK.A TCI1 rough surface left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was implanted in a47-year-old man who had sustained a recent massive myocardial infarctioncomplicated by ventricular failure which remained unresponsive to intra-aorticballoon pump therapy and which was further complicated by irreversibleventricular fibrillation. Following implantation of the device and while awaitinga suitable donor organ for transplantation, further extension of the previousinfarct resulted in left ventricular rupture and massive haemorrhage which led tohis death. We report the successful use of the device in providing haemodynamicsupport, but caution against inordinate delay in bridging to transplantationpatients who are at risk of extension of infarction.
