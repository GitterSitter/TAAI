Aperceived increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis in the HeartMate II (HMII)LVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) by clinicians prompted this analysis of theInteragency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)database.METHODS: Between 2006 and June 2013, 8,988 United States patients aged older than18 years received a durable LVAD. Of these, 6,910 adult patients from 132institutions who received a HMII LVAD were entered in the INTERMACS database and constitute the study group for this analysis.RESULTS: Overall survival (with censoring at transplant or explant for recovery) with the HMII LVAD was 80% at 1 year and 69% at 2 years and was not significantlydifferent when stratified by era of implant. Freedom from device exchange ordeath due to thrombosis decreased from 99% at 6 months in 2009 to 94% in 2012 (p < 0.0001). Multivariable hazard function analysis showed risk factors for pumpthrombosis included later implant year (p < 0.0001), younger age (p < 0.0001),higher creatinine (p = 0.002), larger body mass index (p = 0.004), white race (p = 0.0004), left ventricular ejection fraction above 20% (p = 0.02), and higherlactate dehydrogenase level at 1 month (p < 0.0001). Survival (p < 0.0001) andfreedom from infection (p = 0.008) and cerebrovascular accident (p < 0.0001) werelower after pump exchange than after primary implant.CONCLUSIONS: Pump exchange or death due to pump thrombosis increased during 2011 and 2012, but the magnitude of the increase remained relatively small. Survivalremains high (80% at 1 year) with the HMII LVAD. Risk factor analysis suggeststhat a number of patient-related factors contribute to the risk of thrombosis.Markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase in the first month is a predictor of pumpthrombosis. This analysis could not examine the potential role of technicalfactors during implant, such as sub-optimal pump or graft positioning, changes inpatient management paradigms with pump speed settings, improved recognition andchange in the threshold for pump exchange, or design or production changes withthe pump, as contributors to the risk of pump thrombosis.Â© 2013 Published by International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation on behalf of International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
