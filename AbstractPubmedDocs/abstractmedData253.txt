Epub 2014Feb 2.Conversion from long-term AB-5000 to EVAHEART using a combined left thoracotomyand sternotomy approach.Akiyama M(1), Motoyoshi N, Kawamoto S, Saito S, Yamazaki K, Saiki Y.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School ofMedicine, 1-1Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan,akiyamam@med.tohoku.ac.jp.Because of the extreme donor shortage in Japan, waiting times for hearttransplantation exceed 2Â years. Since 1980s in Japan, device availability hasalso been an issue, with only a few paracorporeal ventricular assist devices(VADs) available as a bridge to transplantation or recovery. However, twoimplantable VADs became commercially available in 2011. Given these constraintsin our healthcare system, we report a relatively rare case of bridge-to-bridgeuse of an implanted EVAHEART after having used a paracorporeal AB-5000 supportfor an extended period of time. We successfully employed a combined leftthoracotomy and median sternotomy approach as a conversion technique.
