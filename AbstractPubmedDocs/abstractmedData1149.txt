Left ventricular assist devices(LVADs) are used both for bridge to transplantation and for long term support in patients ineligible for transplant. Both cardiac transplantation and long termLVAD therapy are limited by the complications of immunosuppression and devicemalfunction. Currently, a major focus of investigation in advanced heart failure is the temporary use of LVADs as a bridge to recovery of the native heart. While end-stage heart failure was once thought to be irreversible, research nowsuggests that LVAD support may lead to both cellular and functional recovery.Ultimately, patients with advanced cardiac disease might be managed withtemporary mechanical support combined with pharmacological and cellulartherapies, in place of cardiac transplantation or long term LVAD support. In thispaper we review the evidence demonstrating the impact of LVAD support on thepathophysiology of end stage heart failure. Furthermore, we outline the clinical evidence for cardiac recovery seen in LVAD patients. Finally, we describetechniques to measure cardiac function during LVAD support and the criteria that have been suggested to select patients for device explantation for recovery.
