Recently, continuous-axial-flow pumps have been introduced in theclinical practice and have led to new perspectives.METHODS: Four patients suffering from end-stage heart failure were implanted witha DeBakey ventricular assist device (VAD) continuous-flow pump as a bridge toheart transplant. The DeBakey VAD is smaller than the pulsatile devices commonly employed, the pump is totally implantable and is connected to a small controller and two batteries by a transcutaneous drive line.RESULTS: One patient died of multiorgan failure during assistance; 3 patientswere fully rehabilitated and were successfully transplanted after 55, 42 and 141 days respectively. In the early postoperative period the mean pump flow was 4.27 +/- 0.55 l/min, after 1 week of assistance the flow rose to 5.32 +/- 0.57 l/minand then progressively increased to 5.83 +/- 0.57 l/min.CONCLUSIONS: This experience demonstrated the possibility of continuous-flow leftventricular support with the DeBakey VAD for mid-term mechanical ventricularassistance. This pump presents new interesting aspects and opens new perspectivesfor the future of left ventricular mechanical assistance. Increasing experiencewill define the role of this device in the scenario of heart failure.
