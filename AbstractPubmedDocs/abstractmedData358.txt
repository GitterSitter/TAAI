CentriMag(Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) is an extracorporeal short-term circulatoryassist device Conformité Européenne-marked in Europe for use up to 30 days.METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 41 patients with advanced heart failure who,from 2003 to 2011, were supported with CentriMag for >30 days as a bridge torecovery, long-term VAD or transplantation.RESULTS: Forty-one adult patients were supported with 46 CentriMag devices for a total of 2695 days with a mean support time of 59 (range: 31-167) days.Indications were post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PC = 4), primary graftfailure (PGF = 7) and refractory heart failure (RHF = 35). Six devices were used to support the left ventricle, 19 to support the right ventricle and 21 tosupport both the ventricles (biventricular support considered as single deviceunit). In the PC cohort, 3 (75%) patients were weaned from support, while 4 (57%)were weaned from support in the PGF cohort. In the RHF cohort, 8 patients werebridged to long-term VAD and 5 were bridged to transplantation; heart functionrecovered and device explanted in 14, while 8 patients died on support. Therewere no device failures. Overall, 34 (74%) patients were recovered or bridged,with a 1-year survival of 54%.CONCLUSIONS: CentriMag proved to be a versatile, safe and effective short-termcirculatory support for patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge tosolution. Its use over 30 days is associated with acceptable survival and doesnot increase device-related complications.
