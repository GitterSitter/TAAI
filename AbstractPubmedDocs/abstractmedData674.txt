Ann Thorac Surg. 2012 Mar;93(3):815.BACKGROUND: The gold standard treatment for end-stage heart failure is cardiactransplantation. Because of the increasing number of heart failure patients andthe limited supply of donor hearts, a ventricular assist device (VAD) is used as a bridge to transplantation, recovery, or decision. Newer generation VADs havelower risk of fatal adverse events and are also smaller in size. We present ourexperience with the intrapericardial HeartWare VAD (HeartWare, Framingham, MA)and its clinical outcome.METHODS: The clinical outcome of HeartWare VAD implantations for end-stage heart failure patients performed at Harefield Hospital from March 2007 to June 2011 wasstudied. The study design was a retrospective review of the prospectivelycollected data.RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with a mean age of 51±10 years were included inthis study. Twenty-nine patients were male (85%). The mean duration of mechanicalsupport was 261±64 days. Five patients (15%) were successfully bridged to hearttransplantation. The overall mortality was 24% (8 patients). There were 1 case ofmechanical device failure (2%) and 3 cases of device failure due to thrombusformation (8%). Postoperative complications included 5 reoperations for bleeding (15%), 12 acute renal failures (36%), 7 respiratory failures (21%), 2 hepaticdysfunctions (6%), 3 neurologic dysfunctions (9%), 7 right-side heart failures(21%), and 5 driveline infections (15%).CONCLUSIONS: Although cardiac transplantation remains the gold standard fortreatment of end-stage heart failure patients, the HeartWare VAD can be used as asafe alternative with a satisfactory clinical outcome.Copyright © 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
