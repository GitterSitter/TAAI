Optimal flow control forcontinuous flow LVADs has not been defined and calls for an implantable pressure sensor integrated with the LVAD for real-time feedback control of pump speedbased on ventricular pressure. A MEMS pressure sensor prototype is designed,fabricated and seamlessly integrated with LVAD to enable real-time control,optimize its performance and reduce its risks. The pressure sensing mechanism is based on Fabry-Pérot interferometer principle. A biocompatible parylene diaphragmwith a silicon mirror at the center is fabricated directly on the inlet shell of the LVAD to sense pressure changes. The sensitivity, range and response time ofthe pressure sensor are measured and validated to meet the requirements of LVADpressure sensing.
