The newXVE model is the result of recent technical improvements. The aim of this studywas to compare the clinical performance and durability of the new and earlierHeartMate versions.METHODS: We analyzed the incidence of device failure and of other device-specificcomplications (infections, bleeding) in 9 VE and 17 XVE patients. Explanted pumpswere examined and biologic valve damage classified according to a score rangingfrom 0 (no visible damage) to 3 (severe destruction).RESULTS: Mean support time was 145 +/- 92 and 267 +/- 195 days in the VE and XVE groups, respectively (difference not significant [NS]). Survival was 89% (VE) vs 75% (XVE). The incidence of device failure requiring urgent heart transplantationor device replacement was 44% (VE) vs 31% (XVE) (NS). Device failure occurredsignificantly later in the XVE group (200 +/- 34 vs 487 +/- 53 days, p < 0.01).Causes of device failure were inflow valve incompetence (n = 6) and motor failure(n = 3). Acute device failure caused 1 death in the XVE group. One XVE patienthas been on mechanical support for > 483 days. Macroscopic inflow valve damagescore after explantation of the devices was 2.2 +/- 1.1 in the VE group and 2.0+/- 0.8 in the XVE group (NS).CONCLUSIONS: The novel HeartMate XVE offers greater durability and providesreliable mechanical support in the first year. However, there is a high risk oflife-threatening device failure in the second year. Further technical refinementsare necessary to meet the challenges of safe long-term circulatory assistance.
