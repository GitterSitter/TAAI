We describe a case of a 44-year-old lady who developed subarachnoidhemorrhage and cerebral edema on second postoperative day after left ventricular assist device implantation. She was declared brain stem dead 2 days later, andher organs were transplanted to suitable recipients on the waiting list for lung,liver and kidney transplantation.
