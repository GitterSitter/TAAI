We investigated whether this scoring system also predicts clinicaloutcomes after eventual heart transplantation in LVAD recipients.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 153 consecutive patients whoreceived an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation at 2 large-volume centers from1996 to 2003. The scoring system was used to designate low- and high-scoringgroups.RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality and 5-year survival after transplantation wereequivalent between groups (4.46% versus 7.32% and 76% versus 70%, respectively). No difference was seen in length of posttransplantation ventilator dependence(2.83 +/- 0.49 versus 3.3 +/- 0.72 days) or intensive care unit monitoring (6.38 +/- 0.77 versus 6.97 +/- 1.1 days). However, low-scoring patients had asignificantly decreased duration of inotrope support (5.57 +/- 0.45 versus 7.74+/- 1.0 days, P = .035).CONCLUSION: A risk factor summation score may predict which LVAD patients willrequire prolonged inotropic support following heart transplantation. However,survival in high-risk (elevated score) LVAD patients following hearttransplantation is comparable to low-risk groups, favoring the continued practiceof LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation even in high-risk patients.
