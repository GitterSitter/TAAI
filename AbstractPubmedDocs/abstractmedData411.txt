The pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocols trials haveenrolled patients with advanced heart failure in a bridge-to-transplantindication.METHODS: The primary outcome, success, was defined as survival on the originally implanted device, transplant, or explant for ventricular recovery at 180 days.Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of survival, functional and quality of life outcomes, and adverse events.RESULTS: A total of 332 patients in the pivotal bridge to transplant andcontinued access protocols trial have completed their 180-day primary end-pointassessment. Survival in patients receiving the HeartWare pump was 91% at 180 daysand 84% at 360 days. Quality of life scores improved significantly, and adverseevent rates remain low.CONCLUSIONS: The use of the HeartWare pump as a bridge to transplant continues todemonstrate a high 180-day survival rate despite a low rate of transplant.Adverse event rates are similar or better than those observed in historicalbridge-to-transplant trials, despite longer exposure times due to longer survivaland lower transplant rates.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
