Forboth transplant-eligible and noneligible patients, advances in mechanicalcirculatory support have revolutionized the options for the management ofend-stage heart failure, and this technology continues to bring us closer to atrue alternative to heart transplantation. This review provides a perspective on the past, present and future of mechanical circulatory support and addresses the changes in technology, patient selection and management strategies needed to havethis therapy fully embraced by the heart failure community, and perhaps replaceheart transplantation either as the therapy of choice or as a strategy by whichto delay transplantation in younger patients.
