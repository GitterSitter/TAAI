Based on 13years' experience, we have developed specific protocols for patient selection andmanagement for different devices.METHODS: The principal systems applied in the bridge-to-transplant cohort are theThoratec ventricular assist device (n = 144, mean duration of support 53 +/- 57days), the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS) (n = 85, mean durationof support 154 +/- 15 days), and the HeartMate LVAS (n = 54, mean duration ofsupport 143 +/- 142 days). The Thoratec device is used for biventricularassistance or if the duration of support is expected to be less than 6 months.For long-term support, either the Novacor or HeartMate LVAS are preferred.RESULTS: Despite careful postoperative patient management, this group of patientsis prone to a variety of complications. Bleeding occurred in 22% to 35%, rightheart failure in 15% to 26%, neurologic disorders in 7% to 28%, infection in 7%to 30%, and liver failure in 11% to 20% of patients. Complications varied withthe device applied and the patient's preoperative condition. A total of 73patients were discharged from hospital for a mean period of 184 days; thiscumulative experience amounted to 37.5 patient-years.CONCLUSIONS: The Novacor and the HeartMate systems offer the additionalpossibility of discharging patients during support if they fulfill certaincriteria. The main reasons for rehospitalization were thromboembolic andinfectious complications.
