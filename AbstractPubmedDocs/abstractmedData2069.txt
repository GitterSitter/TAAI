Ann Thorac Surg. 1992 Feb;53(2):282-8.Experience with the symbion total artificial heart as a bridge totransplantation.Emery RW(1), Joyce LD, Prieto M, Johnson K, Goldenberg IF, Pritzker MR.Author information: (1)Division of Mechanical Circulatory Support, Minneapolis Heart Institute,Minnesota.From December 1985 through January 1991, 9 patients underwent bridging totransplantation using a Symbion J-7-70 total artificial heart. There were 4female and 5 male patients aged 31 +/- 14 years (range, 15 to 52 years). Fivepatients were supported on an intraaortic balloon pump before total artificialheart support, and 2 had biventricular assist devices as well. Total artificialheart support was maintained for 17 +/- 12 days (range, 4 to 44 days); allpatients underwent transplantation. Three patients died after transplantation on day 0 (primary donor organ failure), 25 (acute rejection), and 256 (multiorganfailure). The remainder were discharged at 41 +/- 32 days (range, 13 to 101days). One patient died 28 months after transplantation of late acute rejection. Actuarial 1-year and 3-year survival is 67% and 55%. There were no surgical woundinfections. Problems encountered in the J-7-70 period and the period aftertransplantation were for the most part related to patient condition in the periodbefore implantation. The Symbion J-7-70 total artificial heart is an effectivedevice for total circulatory support in patients with end-stage cardiogenic shockwhen an organ donor is not available. Organ system failure and infection beforeimplantation may persist into the transplantation period resulting in long-termcomplications, increased mortality, and prolonged hospital stay; therefore, earlyimplantation of the device when indicated should be applied.
