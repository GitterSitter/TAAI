LVAD patients were activated on the waiting list assoon as they were in suitable clinical status.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of introducing the Thoratec LVAD in the hearttransplantation program at the Montreal Heart Institute.METHODS: The results of 16 LVAD patients and 20 patients who underwent hearttransplantation without LVAD support between January 2000 and February 2002 were reviewed.RESULTS: Sixteen patients in cardiogenic shock underwent emergency implantationof a Thoratec LVAD following acute myocardial infarction (five patients), acuteviral cardiomyopathy (five patients), idiopathic cardiomyopathy (three patients),postpartum cardiomyopathy (two patients) and failure to wean from cardiopulmonarybypass (one patient). Thirteen of 16 (81%) LVAD patients underwent hearttransplantation, and three LVAD patients were not listed and died from multiorganfailure. The wait for transplantation averaged 17+/-19 days in LVAD patientscompared with 87+/-66 days for the 20 patients undergoing transplantation withoutLVAD support (P=0.01). Survival 12 months following transplantation averaged84+/-10% in LVAD supported patients and 90+/-7% in those without LVAD support(P=0.6).CONCLUSION: The use of Thoratec LVAD as a bridge to transplantation did notprolong the wait for a donor of patients without LVAD support (United NetworkOrgan Sharing status II). Moreover, listing patients as soon as they appearsuitable for transplantation resulted in a short period of LVAD support and agood rate of survival one year after transplantation.
