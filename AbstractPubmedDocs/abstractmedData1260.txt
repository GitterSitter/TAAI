Currently, twopercutaneous left ventricular assist devices are available for clinical use: the TandemHeart and the Impella Recover LP system. Compared with the intraaorticballoon pump, the TandemHeart has been shown to significantly reduce preload and to augment cardiac output. In a randomized comparison between the TandemHeart andintraaortic balloon pump support in patients with cardiogenic shock, the improvedcardiac index afforded by the left ventricular assist device resulted in a morerapid decrease in serum lactate and improved renal function. There were, however,no significant differences with respect to 30-day mortality, and complicationsincluding limb ischemia and severe bleeding were more frequent with leftventricular assist devices than intraaortic balloon pump support.SUMMARY: The advent of percutaneous left ventricular assist devices constitutesan important advance in the management of patients with severe cardiogenic shock and may serve as bridge to recovery or heart transplantation in carefullyselected patients. While improvement of hemodynamic parameters appears promising,it remains to be determined whether this benefit translates into improvedclinical outcome.
