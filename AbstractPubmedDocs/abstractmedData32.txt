(3)Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, VanderbiltUniversity Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn., USA.Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used increasingly as a bridge totransplantation or as destination therapy in end-stage heart failure patients whodo not respond to optimal medical therapy. Many of these patients have end-organ dysfunction, including advanced kidney dysfunction, before and after LVADimplantation. Kidney dysfunction is a marker of adverse outcomes, such asincreased morbidity and mortality. This review discusses kidney dysfunction andassociated management strategies during the dynamic perioperative time period of LVAD implantation. Furthermore, we suggest potential future research directionsto better understand the complex relationship between renal pathophysiology andmechanical circulatory support.PMCID: PMC4327330
