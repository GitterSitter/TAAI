These patients were separated into 2 erascentered on the July 12, 2006 UNOS policy change. Pre- and post-transplantationcharacteristics were compared by UNOS regions.RESULTS: Waitlist mortality decreased nationally (up to 180 days: 13.3% vs. 7.9% after the UNOS policy change, p < 0.001) and within each region. Similarly,2-year post-transplant mortality decreased nationally (2-year mortality: 17.3%vs. 14.6%; p < 0.001) as well as regionally. Waitlist time for UNOS status 1A and1B candidates increased nationally 17.8 days on average (p < 0.001) withvariability between the regions. The greatest increases were in Region 9(59.2-day increase, p < 0.001) and Region 4 (41.2-day increase, p < 0.001).Although the use of mechanical circulatory support increased nearly 2.3-foldnationally in Era 2, significant differences were present on a regional basis. InRegions 6, 7, and 10, nearly 40% of those transplanted required left ventricular assist device bridging, whereas only 19.6%, 22.3%, and 15.5% required a leftventricular assist device in regions 3, 4, and 5, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The 2006 UNOS policy change has resulted in significant regionalheterogeneity with respect to waitlist time and reliance on mechanicalcirculatory support as a bridge to transplantation, although overall bothwaitlist mortality and post-transplant survival are improved.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
