A possibleoption to mechanical cardiac support, in patients unsuitable for hearttransplant.Kaul TK(1), Kahn DR.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Baptist Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama,USA.BACKGROUND: Postbypass refractory right ventricle (RRV) may develop due to right ventricular (RV) ischemia or infarction. In cases with RV infarction, recovery isoften prolonged and salvage rate is extremely poor. In this retrospective study, we have examined the role of right ventricular exclusion (RVE), as a possibleoption to conventional weaning or bridging to heart transplant (B-HTX), inpatients who were unsuitable for heart transplant.METHODS: During last 5 years, cumulative incidence of postbypass refractorycirculatory failure (RCF) in our adult patients was 0.39% (26/6542). This problemwas caused by a RRV in 17 (65%) patients. After CABG, these patients developed a grossly distended and poorly contracting RV (RVEDV: 330-400 ml, RVEF: 0-10%),high central venous pressure (> or =18 mmHg) and an inadequate aortic pressurefor weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. Three patients, who were unacceptable forHTX under UNOS program (age >65 years), were weaned off bypass after RVE, andremaining patients with RVAD (n=3) or BiVAD support, depending upon theirconcomitant moderate or poor left ventricular performance.RESULTS: The significant predictors of RRV by univariate analysis were; 2nd or3rd redo CABG for a recent myocardial infarction, and failed graft angioplasty.Hospital mortality (14-60 days) was 0/3, 3/3 and 3/11 for the patients weaned offwith RVE, RVAD and BiVAD respectively. At 3 years, overall salvage rate was 9/17 (RVE: 3/3, BiVAD B-HTX 4/6 + 2 weaned with BiVAD support).CONCLUSION: Right ventricular exclusion is a possible option to conventionalB-HTX with mechanical support, in patients who develop postinfarct RRV and areunsuitable for transplant.
