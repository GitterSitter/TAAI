[Epub ahead of print]Minimally Invasive Ventricular Assist Device Surgery.Rojas SV(1), Avsar M, Hanke JS, Khalpey Z, Maltais S, Haverich A, Schmitto JD.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation, and Vascular Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.The use of mechanical circulatory support to treat patients with congestive heartfailure has grown enormously, recently surpassing the number of annual hearttransplants worldwide. The current generation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), as compared with older devices, is characterized by improvedtechnologies and reduced size. The result is that minimally invasive surgery isnow possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchange of LVADs. Minimallyinvasive procedures improve surgical outcome; for example, they lower the ratesof operative complications (such as bleeding or wound infection). Theminiaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasive techniqueswill be used for most implantations in the future. In this article, we summarize and describe minimally invasive state-of-the-art implantation techniques, with a focus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.Copyright Â© 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantationand Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
