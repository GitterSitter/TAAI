Clenbuterol (Clen), a beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) agonist,has been used as a part of this strategy. In this study, we investigated thedirect effects of clenbuterol on unloaded myocardium in HF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Left coronary artery ligation or sham operation wasperformed in male Lewis rats. After 4-6 weeks, heterotopic abdominaltransplantation of the failing hearts into normal recipients was performed toinduce LV unloading (UN). Recipient rats were treated with saline (Sal) orclenbuterol (2 mg/kg/day) via osmotic minipumps (HF + UN + Sal or HF + UN + Clen)for 7 days. Non-transplanted HF animals were treated with Sal (Sham + Sal, HF +Sal) or clenbuterol (HF + Clen). LV myocytes were isolated and studied usingoptical, fluorescence, and electrophysiological techniques. Clenbuterol treatmentimproved in vivo LV function measured with echocardiography (LVEF (%): HF 35.9+/- 2 [16], HF + Clen 52.1 +/- 1.4 [16]; P < 0.001; mean +/- SEM [n]). Incombination with unloading, clenbuterol increased sarcomere shortening (amplitude(microm): HF + UN + Clen 0.1 +/- 0.01 [50], HF + UN + Sal 0.07 +/- 0.01 [38]; P <0.001) by normalizing the depressed myofilament sensitivity to Ca(2+) (slope ofthe linear relationship between Ca(2+) transient and sarcomere shorteninghysteresis loop during relaxation (microm/ratio unit): HF + UN + Clen 2.13 +/-0.2 [52], HF + UN + Sal 1.42 +/- 0.13 [38]; P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Clenbuterol treatment of failing rat hearts, alone or in combination with mechanical unloading, improves LV function at the whole-heart and cellularlevels by affecting cell morphology, excitation-contraction coupling, andmyofilament sensitivity to calcium. This study supports the use of this drug inthe strategy to enhance recovery in HF patients treated with LVADs and alsobegins to elucidate some of the possible cellular mechanisms responsible for the improvement in LV function.
