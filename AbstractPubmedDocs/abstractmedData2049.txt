Ann Thorac Surg. 1993 Jan;55(1):273-5.Chronic left ventricular support with a vented electric assist device.Frazier OH(1).Author information: (1)Texas Heart Institute, Houston 77225-0345.Based on the success of the pneumatically powered HeartMate (Thermo CardiosystemsInc, Woburn, MA) left ventricular assist device, researchers at the Texas HeartInstitute have begun conducting clinical studies of the vented electric model in bridge-to-transplantation procedures. Like the pneumatic device, the electricdevice is implanted intraperitoneally, but the blood pump is powered through apercutaneous lead that is connected to two rechargeable batteries. The batteries are worn in a shoulder holster; thus, patients are not tethered to a controlconsole and are fully mobile. Two patients are currently undergoing leftventricular support with the vented electric HeartMate (duration of support, 315 days and 112 days) as they await cardiac transplantation, and they seem to bemedically fit for outpatient care and follow-up. This technology may eventuallyallow selected patients to receive long-term support as a substitute for cardiac transplantation.
