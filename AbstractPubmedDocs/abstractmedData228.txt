Limited dataregarding efficacy of the CF-RVSD for RVF exist.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 46 patients receiving a CF-RVSDfor RVF from a registry comprising data from 8 tertiary-care hospitals in theUnited States. CF-RVSD use was recorded in the setting of acute myocardialinfarction; myocarditis; chronic left heart failure; after valve surgery,orthotopic heart transplantation, left ventricular assist device surgery,coronary bypass grafting. Devices were implanted via the percutaneous (n = 22) orsurgical (n = 24) route.RESULTS: No intraprocedural mortality was observed. Mean time from admission toCF-RVSD implantation was 5.7 ± 8.5 days, with a mean of 6,769 ± 789rotations/min, providing 4.2 ± 1.3 l/min of flow. Mean duration of support was5.4 ± 5.1 days. Mean arterial pressure (65 ± 12 mm Hg vs. 73 ± 14 mm Hg; p <0.05), right atrial pressure (21 ± 8 mm Hg vs. 16 ± 7 mm Hg; p = 0.05), pulmonaryartery systolic pressure (43 ± 15 mm Hg vs. 33 ± 15 mm Hg; p = 0.01), and cardiacindex (1.7 ± 0.7 vs. 2.2 ± 0.6; p = 0.01) were improved within 48 h of CF-RVSDimplantation. Total in-hospital mortality was 57% and was lowest in the settingof left ventricular assist device implantation, chronic left heart failure, andacute myocardial infarction. Increased age, biventricular failure, andThrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-defined major bleeding were associated withincreased in-hospital mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Use of the CF-RVSD for RVF is clinically feasible and associatedwith improved hemodynamic status. Observations from the registry of patients who have received this device may support the development of prospective studies thatwill examine the role of percutaneous circulatory support for RVF.Copyright © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
