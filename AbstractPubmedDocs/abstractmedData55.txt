Croat Med J. 2014 Dec;55(6):609-20.Why pulsatility still matters: a review of current knowledge.Barić D(1).Author information: (1)Davor Barić, Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, DubravaUniversity Hospital, Avenija Gojka Šuška 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, dbaric@kbd.hr.Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become standardtherapy option for patients with advanced heart failure. They offer severaladvantages over previously used pulsatile-flow LVADs, including improveddurability, less surgical trauma, higher energy efficiency, and lowerthrombogenicity. These benefits translate into better survival, lower frequencyof adverse events, improved quality of life, and higher functional capacity ofpatients. However, mounting evidence shows unanticipated consequences ofcontinuous-flow support, such as acquired aortic valve insufficiency and acquiredvon Willebrand syndrome. In this review article we discuss current evidence ondifferences between continuous and pulsatile mechanical circulatory support, witha focus on clinical implications and potential benefits of pulsatile flow.PMCID: PMC4295069
