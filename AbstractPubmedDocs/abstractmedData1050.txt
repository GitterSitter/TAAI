Epub 2009 Sep 11.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridge to adult heart transplantation.Chung JC(1), Tsai PR, Chou NK, Chi NH, Wang SS, Ko WJ.Author information: (1)Queen's University, Kingston, Canada.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can rescue some critical patients withcirculatory collapse when intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and ventricular assistdevices (VAD) are not suitable. A subset of these patients can use ECMO fordirect bridging, or indirect double bridging via VAD to heart transplantation(HTx). For these patients, we identified risk factors for unsuccessful ECMObridging, with survival to receiving either HTx or VAD as the measure of success.The characteristics evaluated were age, sex, body mass index, pre-ECMOcardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), IABP use, dialysis use, sequential organfailure assessment (SOFA) score, and the etiology of cardiomyopathy. From January1995 to August 2007, there were 70 adult ECMO patients with the intent to bridge to HTx (male: 55, age: 46 +/- 14 yr). Thirty-one patients (44%) were successfulin bridging. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis found that age > 50 yr (p = 0.003), pre-ECMO CPR (p = 0.001) and SOFA score > 10 at ECMOinitiation (p = 0.018) were significant independent predictors of unsuccessfulbridging. Direct VAD implantation, if possible, is preferable to double bridging in patients over 50 yr. Also, elective ECMO support before hemodynamicdeterioration to cardiac arrest or multiple organ dysfunction would improve ratesof successful ECMO bridging.
