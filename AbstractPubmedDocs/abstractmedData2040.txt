Ann Thorac Surg. 1993 May;55(5):1141-6.Left ventricular assist with an axial flow pump (Hemopump): clinical application.Wiebalck AC(1), Wouters PF, Waldenberger FR, Akpinar B, Lauwers PM, Demeyere RH, Sergeant PT, Daenen WJ, Flameng WJ.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, University Clinic Gasthuisberg, KatholiekeUniversiteit Leuven, Belgium.Eighteen patients suffering from acute left heart failure were selected ascandidates for Hemopump support. In 6 patients, peripheral atheromatosisprevented insertion of the device. Of the remaining 12 patients, 9 hadpostcardiotomy shock, 2 had acute rejection after orthotopic hearttransplantation, and 1 had acute myocardial infarction complicated by a largepostinfarction ventricular septal defect. During Hemopump support, hemodynamicsrecovered in all patients. Major complications were related to mechanical pumpfailure, such as fracture of the drive cable and expulsion of the cannula out of the ventricle, or to hemolysis of variable degree. Seven patients (58%) survived and were discharged from the hospital: the 2 patients bridged to hearttransplantation and 5 of the 9 postcardiotomy patients, including 1 who could notbe weaned but later underwent successful transplantation. The patient with thepostinfarction ventricular septal defect died after removal of the device becauseof hemolysis. These results indicate that the Hemopump is a relativelynoninvasive and efficacious left ventricular system of moderate power.
