Epub 2008 Jun 17.Destination therapy: time for real progress.Westaby S(1).Author information: (1)Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.Both prognosis and quality of life are poor for severely symptomatic patientswith stage D heart failure, and treatment options are limited. Few individualsare eligible for cardiac transplantation, and ventricular resynchronizationtherapy provides only marginal benefit in select patients. The aim of this Reviewis to highlight the promise of blood pumps in this setting. Circulatory supportdevices were first developed to act as a bridge to recovery in patients who hadfailed to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass. As blood pumps developed, they wereused to support patients with cardiogenic shock until a donor heart becameavailable. Implantable left ventricular assist devices were then shown to relieveheart failure symptoms and prolong life in patients ineligible for transplant.The limitations of first-generation device technology have meant that thedevelopment of an 'off the shelf' solution for advanced heart failure has beenslow to progress. New rotary blood pumps already show much promise in this regardbut have not yet been subject to rigorous clinical trials. Anecdotal evidencefrom 7.5 years of event-free survival in the first patient to receive a'destination' axial flow pump permits justifiable optimism about the future ofthis approach. It is now time for real progress.
