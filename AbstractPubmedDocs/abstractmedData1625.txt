Decades of research and development have allowed the present devices to be used as bridges to native heart recovery andbridges to transplantation. We are now entering the era in which devices arebeing placed for permanent assist or replacement. Although the acute cardiogenic shock patient remains problematic, we now have at our disposable a variety oftools that have enabled us to salvage more patients than ever before. Theexperience with these systems continues to grow, with leading centers andinvestigators contributing meaningful information toward the application anddevelopment of the latest technologies. It has been said that mechanicaltherapies precede biological therapies. We are at the crossroads in which acombination of biological therapies with mechanical therapies is underway.Current research is investigating the role of mechanical cardiac support whilebiological therapies are introduced into the failing heart. In the meantime, the role of mechanical cardiac assist and replacement has matured into an effectivemeans of treating acute cardiogenic shock of any variety.
