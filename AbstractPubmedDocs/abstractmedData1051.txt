Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can be applied in AHF, refractoryto conventional measures, to improve outcomes. This article aims to describe the current and the prospective role of MCS in the treatment of AHF. The supportstrategies and the indications of MCS are continuously evolving, includingsituations considered as contraindications in the past. Appropriate patientselection, advanced device technology and improved patient management havecontributed to the substantially improved results. Evolution in device technologyresults in evolution of the clinical applications of MCS. Earlier application of MCS, with novel, flexible and individualized support strategies is now feasible. Bridging to recovery is the most intriguing support strategy and bridging tofuture treatments is feasible with long-term support. The progressively expandingrole of MCS in the treatment of heart failure is not reflected in the existingguidelines. Being reserved for refractory heart failure, MCS has been applied to the sickest patients who were less amenable to randomization. This explains thelack of robust evidence, but also highlights the value of the progressivelyimproving results. The anticipated wider application of MCS should be betterdefined, systematically recorded, and guided.
