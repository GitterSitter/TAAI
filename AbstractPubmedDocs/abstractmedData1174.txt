Smaller, more durable, continuous flow devices such as theHeartMate II LVAD are increasingly being used. The aim of this study is to reportour single-center experience with this device as bridge-to-transplant therapy.METHODS: Overall, 47 patients received HeartMate II LVADs at our center from June2005 to July 2007; 32 as bridge to transplant, 7 as destination therapy, and 8 asexchange therapy for a failed HeartMate XVE. We reviewed our experience with the device as bridge-to-transplant therapy and report on patient survival and adverseevents.RESULTS: The mean age of the bridge-to-transplant patients was 50.75 +/- 13.78years; 10 (31.3%) were female. The cause of the underlying disease was ischemicin 18 patients (56.3%), idiopathic in 11 (34.4%), myocarditis in 1 (3.1%),postpartum cardiomyopathy in 1 (3.1%), and congenital heart disease in 1 (3.1%). The mean duration of HeartMate II support was 193.2 +/- 139.9 days. At 30 daysafter HeartMate II placement, the patient survival was 96.9% by Kaplan-Meieranalysis; at 6 months (alive or transplanted), 86.9%. Major adverse eventsincluded bleeding requiring reexploration in 5 patients (15.6%), rightventricular failure requiring right ventricular assist device support in 2(6.3%), LVAD-related infections in 4 (12.5%), neurologic or thromboembolic eventsin 2 (6.3%), and gastrointestinal bleeding in 5 (15.6%). We noted one seriousdevice malfunction (3.1%) resulting in the patient's death; in addition, 2patients experienced pump thrombosis (6.3%).CONCLUSIONS: Despite morbidity, use of the HeartMate II LVAD asbridge-to-transplant therapy is associated with excellent survival and lowmortality rates. We found a marked decrease in morbidity related to rightventricular failure, to device-related infections, and to thromboembolic events. However, the requirements for anticoagulation therapy may be associated withincreased mediastinal and gastrointestinal bleeding. Strategies to optimizeanticoagulation therapy may further improve results for these critically illpatients.
