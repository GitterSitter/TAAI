Serial echocardiograms (at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12months) and right heart catheterizations were performed after LVAD implant.Cardiac recovery was assessed on the basis of improvement in systolic anddiastolic function indices on echocardiography that were sustained during LVADturn-down studies.RESULTS: After 6 months of LVAD unloading, 34% of patients had a relative LVejection fraction increase above 50% and 19% of patients, both ischemic andnonischemic, achieved an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40%. LV systolic functionimproved as early as 30 days, the greatest degree of improvement was achieved by 6 months of mechanical unloading and persisted over the 1-year follow up. LVdiastolic function parameters also improved as early as 30 days after LVADunloading, and this improvement persisted over time. LV end-diastolic andend-systolic volumes decreased as early as 30 days after LVAD unloading (113 vs. 77 ml/m(2), p < 0.01, and 92 vs. 60 ml/m(2), p < 0.01, respectively). LV massdecreased as early as 30 days after LVAD unloading (114 vs. 95 g/m(2), p < 0.05) and continued to do so over the 1-year follow-up but did not reach values belowthe normal reference range, suggesting no atrophic remodeling after prolongedLVAD unloading.CONCLUSIONS: Continuous-flow LVAD unloading induced in a subset of patients, bothischemic and nonischemic, early improvement in myocardial structure and systolic and diastolic function that was largely completed within 6 months, with noevidence of subsequent regression.Copyright © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
