The aim of this study is to report the outcomes in patients receivingthe HeartMate II LVAD at a single center and review the lessons learned from thisexperience.METHODS: From June 2005 to June 2010, 130 consecutive patients received theHeartMate II LVAD. Of these, 102 were bridge-to-transplant (BTT), 17 destination therapy, and 11 exchanges for failed HeartMate XVE. This study focuses on the 102BTT patients. The HeartMate II was approved by the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) as BTT in April 2008 and 64 patients received this device asBTT since that date. We review our experience with the device as BTT and reporton patient survival and adverse events as well as the impact of FDA approval onoutcomes.RESULTS: Overall, mean age was 52.6 ± 12.8 years; 26 (25.5%) were female. Diseaseetiology was ischemic in 58, nonischemic in 36, and other in 8. Overall, 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year survival for the BTT patients was 95.1%, 83.5%, and 78.8%,respectively. The 6-month survival in 38 patients in the clinical trial (pre-FDA)was 88.8% and was not statistically significant compared with the 76.2% 6-monthsurvival in the 64 patients in the post-FDA approval period (p value = 0.1).Major adverse events among the 102 BTT patients included right ventricularfailure in 5 (4.9%), LVAD driveline infections in 25 (24.5%), neurologic eventsin 10 (9.8%), and gastrointestinal bleeding in 18 (17.6%) patients. In addition, 1 patient (0.98%) had pump thrombus requiring device replacement.CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant morbidity, use of the HeartMate II LVAD as BTTprovides excellent hemodynamic support and is associated with excellent survival and low mortality. In addition, there needs to be improvement and focusedstrategies in the areas of gastrointestinal bleeding, driveline infections, andadverse neurologic events for these devices to be able to provide a reallong-term alternative to heart transplantation.Copyright Â© 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
