Epub 2009 Oct 17.Quality of life and functional status in patients surviving 12 months after left ventricular assist device implantation.Allen JG(1), Weiss ES, Schaffer JM, Patel ND, Ullrich SL, Russell SD, Shah AS,Conte JV.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Johns HopkinsUniversity Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA.BACKGROUND: As left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support duration increases, quality of life (QoL) becomes a concern. We reviewed the QoL in patients on LVAD support for >or=1 year.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our prospective database for patientssupported >or=1 year by HeartMate pulsatile- (HM1) or continuous-flow (HM2) LVADsfrom 2000 to 2009. Transplant or death before 1 year merited exclusion. Metabolicequivalents of tasks (METs), the Minnesota Living with Heart FailureQuestionnaire (MLHFQ), the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and New York HeartAssociation (NYHA) class were reviewed. Complications and re-admissions wereassessed.RESULTS: Thirty patients were supported for >or=1 year (7 HM1s, 23 HM2s). Meansupport duration was 594 +/- 173 days. Mean QoL metrics/functional statusindicators at 12 months were: 6MWD, 393 +/- 290 m; MET tolerance, 3.3 +/- 1;MLHFQ, 35 +/- 31; and NYHA, 1.4 +/- 0.6. Mean re-admissions/year was 2.9 +/- 2,with a duration of 13.8 +/- 21 days. Three patients were never re-admitted. Mean out-of-hospital time was 471 +/- 172 days (87.3% of days). Infectiouscomplications led to 43% of re-admissions and occurred in the: drive-line (47%)at 442 +/- 236 days; blood (37%) at 472 +/- 257 days; and LVAD pocket (20%) at550 +/- 202 days. Twenty-three patients (77%) required additional operations (1.7+/- 1.8/year). The most common indication was drive-line infection, but rangedfrom ischemic bowel to defibrillator exchange. Eight required LVAD exchanges for mechanical (n = 4), electrical (n = 3), and thrombotic (n = 1) issues.CONCLUSIONS: Although LVAD support is not without complications, patients spendthe majority of time outside the hospital enjoying a good quality of life.PMCID: PMC2887481
