These pumps alter flow physiology by lowering pulsatility in the arterial circulation. In patients with peripheral stenosis, continuous flow pumps may lead tothrombosis of peripheral vessels, possibly predisposing to vascular thrombosis inareas of non-flow-limiting stenosis. The authors performed a computerized flowmodeling simulation to analyze the effects of altered hemodynamics in a stenotic area. Drawing on previous clinical experience, we modeled a stenotic area in the common carotid artery. Computerized flow modeling revealed blood stagnation zoneswith low shear stress and velocity adjacent to the stenotic area duringnonpulsatile flow. Such stagnation was not present during pulsatile flow. Theseresults indicate a mechanism by which altered physiologic flow may accelerateocclusion of arterial conduits in patients with preexisting stenosis. Thisfinding may be important for patients with continuous flow devices who haveperipheral vascular disease; therefore, further study is warranted.
