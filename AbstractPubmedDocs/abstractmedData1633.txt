All patients in both of these initial feasibility studies werein NYHA class 4.METHODS: The pump was implanted through a thoracotomy or median sternotomyincision with the aid of partial cardiopulmonary bypass in bridge-to-transplantpatients. A skull-mounted percutaneous power delivery was used for the patientswho received the pump as destination therapy.RESULTS: Of the 22 bridge-to-transplant patients, 13 underwent transplant; 7 diedduring support; and 2 studies are ongoing. The surviving patients have an averagefollow-up of 15 months; one died at 2.6 months after transplant, and theremaining patients are all in NYHA class 1. Support averaged 67.1 days. Deathswere due to acute myocardial infarction in two patients and multiorgan failure infive patients. Hemodynamic function improved with LVAS support. The averagecardiac index increased 70.6% by 48 hours after implant, pulmonary capillarywedge pressure decreased 44%, systemic vascular resistance decreasedsignificantly, and inotropic support became unnecessary. Similar results havebeen seen in the patients who received the device as destination therapy. In thatseries, one patient died of subdural hematoma 380 days after implant. The othertwo patients are in NYHA class 1, 642 and 889 days after implant. The averagecardiac index increased 89.5%, and pulmonary capillary wedge decreased 52.2%.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 axial-flow LVAS can be used safely in selectedpatients to provide support until transplant or as destination therapy. In thisseries, the patients who most benefited from this device were those who required true left ventricular assistance rather than total capture of left ventricularoutput. Current experience indicates that continuous offloading of the ventricle is most effective when there is enough residual myocardial function to maintainpulsatility and aortic root ejection and to maintain, with nonpulsatile pumpsupport, a normal cardiac index as well as reinstitution of the Frank-Starlingresponse to the native ventricle.PMCID: PMC1514519
