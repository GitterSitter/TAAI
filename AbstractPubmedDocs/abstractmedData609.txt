However, patients with biventricular HF may represent a unique cohort.METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 113 adult,end-stage HF patients at University of California Los Angeles Medical Center who required BIVAD support between 2000 and 2009.RESULTS: Survival to transplant was 66.4%, with 1-year actuarial survival of62.8%. All patients were Interagency Registry for Mechanically AssistedCirculatory Support (INTERMACS) Level 1 or 2 and received Thoratec (Pleasanton,CA) paracorporeal BIVAD as a bridge to transplant. Univariate analyses showeddialysis use, ventilator use, extracorporal membrane oxygenation use, low cardiacoutput, preserved LV ejection fraction (restrictive physiology), normal-to-highsodium, low platelet count, low total cholesterol, low high-density andhigh-density lipoprotein, low albumin, and elevated aspartate aminotransferasewere associated with increased risk of death. We generated a scoring system forsurvival to transplant. Our final model, with age, sex, dialysis, cholesterol,ventilator, and albumin, gave a C-statistic of 0.870. A simplified systempreserved a C-statistic of 0.844. Patients were divided into high-risk orhighest-risk groups (median respective survival, 367 and 17 days), with strongdiscrimination between groups for death.CONCLUSIONS: We have generated a scoring system that offers high prognosticability for patients requiring BIVAD support and hope that it may assist inclinical decision making. Further studies are needed to prospectively validateour scoring system.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
