However,clinical presentation and outcome of CIED infection in the setting of LVAD hasnot been previously described.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 247 patients who underwent LVAD implantationat Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida, from January 2005 to December 2011. Demographic and clinical data of patients who met criteria forCIED infection were extracted.RESULTS: Of 247 patients with LVADs, 215 (87%) had CIED at the time of LVADimplantation and six (2.8%) subsequently developed CIED infections. Threepatients developed CIED lead-related endocarditis and the other three had pocket infection. All three instances of CIED pocket infection were preceded by devicegenerator exchange, whereas all three patients with CIED lead-relatedendocarditis had prior LVAD-related infections. Causative pathogens includedPseudomonas aeruginos (1), coagulase-negative staphylococci (2),methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (1), a gram-positive bacillus (1),and culture negative (2). All patients underwent complete CIED removal along withantimicrobial therapy. The three patients with CIED lead-related endocarditis andprior LVAD infections received chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy, and onepatient had LVAD exchange. All but one remained alive at the last follow-up with a median duration of 15 months (7-46 months) from the time of CIED infection.CONCLUSION: Patients who are receiving LVAD therapy and develop CIED infectionshould be managed with complete CIED removal. Chronic suppressive antibiotictherapy is warranted in cases that have concomitant LVAD infection.©2013, The Authors. Journal compilation ©2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.PMCID: PMC3872248
