The outcomes of these patients after LVAD implantation are unknown.METHODS: Baseline predictors and outcomes were collected and analyzed frompatients with active substance abuse and a cohort of patients without activesubstance abuse matched for age, INTERMACS profile and year of implantation. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included rates oflisting for cardiac transplantation, transplantation and chronic drive-lineinfection.RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 20 consecutive LVAD recipients with activesubstance abuse and 40 recipients without active substance abuse. During a medianfollow-up period of 2.3 years (IQR 1.4 to 3.6), the substance abuse group had 3.2times the rate (hazard) of death compared with a matched cohort (HR 3.2, 95% CI1.2 to 8.0, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of listing for transplant was 69%lower (rate ratio 0.31, p < 0.0005), rate of cardiac transplant was 89% lower(rate ratio 0.11, p < 0.0005), and risk of chronic drive-line infection was 5.4times higher (rate ratio 5.4, p < 0.0005) in the substance abuse group.CONCLUSIONS: Active substance abuse in patients who received an LVAD wasassociated with increased mortality and overall poor outcomes. Larger scale data will be needed to confirm these findings and to inform decision-making in thispopulation.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
