In spite of newer medicaltherapies, a significant proportion of patients progress to irreversibleend-stage heart disease, for which cardiac transplantation remains the only long term hope. The inability to meet the demand for donor organs has led to thedevelopment of left ventricular assist devices as a temporizing measure whileawaiting a transplantation. The "bridging to transplantation" experience hasfirmly established the efficacy of these devices as short-term and medium-termmechanical assistance and has provided valuable lessons applicable to long-termsupport. Mechanical cardiac assistance technology has dramatically improved andcan provide reliable univentricular support with minimal thromboembolic andinfectious complications. Although major obstacles remain, the potential benefitsare great enough and the morbidity and mortality of end-stage heart disease high enough to warrant the evaluation of wearable left ventricular assist devices for long-term mechanical assistance.
