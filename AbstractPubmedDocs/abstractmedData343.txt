The study explored potential benefits ofthe therapy at 12 months, and results were previously reported.OBJECTIVE: To report long-term (3-year) clinical effects and transgene expressionin the patients in CUPID 1.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with advanced heart failure who were on stable, optimal heart failure therapy were randomized to receive intracoronaryinfusion of AAV1/SERCA2a in 1 of 3 doses (low-dose, 6×10(11) DNase-resistantparticles; mid-dose, 3×10(12) DNase-resistant particles; and high-dose, 1×10(13) DNase-resistant particles) versus placebo. The following recurrent cardiovascularand terminal events were tracked for 3 years in all groups: myocardialinfarction, worsening heart failure, heart failure-related hospitalization,ventricular assist device placement, cardiac transplantation, and death. Thenumber of cardiovascular events, including death, was highest in the placebogroup, high but delayed in the low- and mid-dose groups, and lowest in thehigh-dose group. Evidence of long-term transgene presence was also observed inhigh-dose patients. The risk of prespecified recurrent cardiovascular events was reduced by 82% in the high-dose versus placebo group (P=0.048). No safetyconcerns were noted during the 3-year follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: After a single intracoronary infusion of AAV1/SERCA2a in patientswith advanced heart failure, positive signals of cardiovascular events persistfor years.
