Epub 2012 Sep 9.Patient-reported selective adherence to heart failure self-care recommendations: a prospective cohort study: the Atlanta Cardiomyopathy Consortium.Marti CN(1), Georgiopoulou VV, Giamouzis G, Cole RT, Deka A, Tang WH, Dunbar SB, Smith AL, Kalogeropoulos AP, Butler J.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.Simultaneous adherence with multiple self-care instructions among heart failure(HF) patients is not well described. Patient-reported adherence to 8recommendations related to exercise, alcohol, medications, smoking, diet, weight,and symptoms was assessed among 308 HF patients using the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale questionnaire (0="never" to 5="always," maximumscore=40). A baseline cumulative score of ≥32/40 (average ≥80%) defined goodadherence. Clinical events (death/transplantation/ventricular assist device),resource utilization, functional capacity (6-minute walk distance), and healthstatus (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) were compared amongpatients with and without good adherence. The mean follow-up was 2.0±1.0 years,and adherence ranged from 26.3% (exercise) to 89.9% (medications). A cumulativescore indicating good adherence was reported by 35.7%, whereas good adherencewith every behavior was reported by 9.1% of patients. Good adherence wasassociated with fewer hospitalizations (all-cause 87.8 vs 107.6; P=.018; HF 29.6 vs 43.8; P=.007) and hospitalized days (all-cause 422 vs 465; P=.015; HF 228 vs282; P<.001) per 100-person-years and better health status (KCCQ overall score70.1±24.6 vs 63.8±22.8; P=.011). Adherence was not associated with clinicalevents or functional capacity. Patient-reported adherence with HF self-carerecommendations is alarmingly low and selective. Good adherence was associatedwith lower resource utilization and better health status.© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.PMCID: PMC3519965
