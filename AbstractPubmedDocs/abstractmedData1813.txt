Aust N Z J Med. 1999 Jun;29(3):410-7.Mechanical circulatory support devices in the treatment of heart failure.Knight JL(1).Author information: (1)Cardiac Surgery, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, SA.With an increasingly aging population, heart failure is a major health issue,affecting more than 10% of the population over 65 years of age, and costinghundreds of millions of dollars per year for ongoing care. Even with maximalmedical therapy, annual mortality rates of in excess of 25% are commonlyreported. Over the last three decades, various surgical approaches have beenexamined in the hope of improving the outcome of congestive cardiac failure.These procedures range from simple coronary revascularisation to left ventricularreduction surgery and cardiac transplantation. Although of value in selectedsituations, no surgical approach, beyond transplantation, has had significantimpact on the outcome of heart failure. In the last decade, development in thearea of mechanical support for the failing heart has continued to expand at arapid rate. Strong evidence now exists to show that in many patients withadvanced heart failure, prolonged mechanical support results in significantmyocardial recovery. There are currently several mechanical support devicesavailable for clinical use, although most are considered experimental in thiscountry. These devices are expensive and are not without significantcomplications, but early results of their use as either a bridge totransplantation or as a stand alone treatment, have been very encouraging.Currently available mechanical assist devices are described, with discussion ofindications for implantation, complications and results of their use.
