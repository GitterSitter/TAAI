We tested the hypothesisthat LVAD support normalizes the ability of cardiac muscle to respond tosympathetic nervous system stimulation by reversing the downregulation ofbeta-adrenergic receptors.METHODS AND RESULTS: Human LV tissue was obtained from nonfailing hearts ofunmatched organ donors and failing hearts at the time of transplantation, with orwithout LVAD. Baseline contractile parameters and inotropic response to abeta-adrenergic agonist were measured in isolated trabecular muscles.beta-Adrenergic receptor density was quantified by radioligand binding. Resultsshowed a significant increase in the response to beta-adrenergic stimulationafter LVAD (developed tension increased by 0.76+/-0.09 g/mm(2) in nonfailing,0.38+/-0.07 in failing, and 0.68+/-0.10 in failing+LVAD; P<0.01), accompanied by an increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors (58.7+/-9.6 fmol/mg protein in nonfailing, 26.2+/-3.8 in failing, and 63.0+/-8.3 in failing+LVAD; P<0.05). Thesechanges were unrelated to the duration of support.CONCLUSIONS: Data demonstrate that mechanically supporting the failing humanheart with an LVAD can reverse the downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptorsand restore the ability of cardiac muscle to respond to inotropic stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system. This indicates that functional impairment ofcardiac muscle in human heart failure is reversible.
