Pleasanton, CA) implantation.Elevated cytotoxic antibody levels complicated the patient's treatment plan byprecluding orthotropic heart transplantation. The CVAS operated for 304 dayswithout mechanical difficulty until replaced with the HeartWare (速) VentricularAssist System (HeartWare Inc. Miramar, FL).
