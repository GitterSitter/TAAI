Although early, non-fatal AEs may increase therisk of later death during VAD support, this relationship has not beenestablished. Therefore, we sought to determine the impact on 1-year mortality of AEs occurring during the first 60 days of VAD support.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed using prospectively collecteddata from a single-site database for patients aged > or =18 years receiving left ventricular or biventricular support during 1996 to 2008 and who survived >60days on VAD support. Fourteen major classes of AEs occurring during this 60-dayperiod were examined. One-year survival rates of patients with and without eachmajor AE were compared.RESULTS: The study included 163 patients (80% men; mean age, 49.5 years), of whom87% were European American, 72% had left ventricular support, and 83% were bridgeto transplant. The occurrence of renal failure, respiratory failure, bleedingevents, and reoperations during the first 60 days after implantationsignificantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality. After controlling forgender, age, VAD type, and intention to treat, renal failure was the only majorAE significantly associated with later mortality (hazard ratio, 2.96; p = .023).CONCLUSIONS: Specific AEs, including renal failure, respiratory and bleedingevents, and reoperations, significantly decrease longer-term survival. Renalfailure conferred a 3-fold increased risk of 1-year mortality. Peri-operativemanagement should focus on strategies to mitigate risk for renal failure in orderto maximize later outcomes.Copyright 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
