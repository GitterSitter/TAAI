We have been studyingthe safety and efficacy of the partial support SynergyÂ® Pocket Micro-pump asbridge-to-transplant in a less-sick group of patients as a prelude to a study of its use for destination therapy.METHODS: The CircuLiteÂ® Synergy device is implanted via a small right-sidedthoracotomy with an inflow cannula in the left atrium and an outflow graftconnected to the right subclavian artery without the use of extracorporealcirculation. The micro-pump is the size of an AA battery, sits in the 'pacemaker'pocket subcutaneously in the right clavicular groove and pumps up to 3.0 l minâ?»Â¹ from the left atrium to the right subclavian artery.RESULTS: The device has been implanted in 27 patients awaiting cardiac transplant(22 males), age 54.8 Â± 10.0 years with ejection fraction (EF) 21 Â± 6%, meanarterial pressure 73.5 Â± 8.8 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)27.5 Â± 7.8 mm Hg and cardiac index (CI) 2.0 Â± 0.4 l minâ?»Â¹ mâ?»Â². Duration ofsupport has ranged from 6 to 281 days. Right-heart catheterization showedsignificant hemodynamic improvement in the short- and intermediate term afterimplant, with increases in CI from 2.0 Â± 0.4 to 2.8 Â± 0.6 l minâ?»Â¹ mâ?»Â² (p < 0.001)and reductions in PCWP from 28 Â± 6 to 18 Â± 7 mm Hg (p = 0.002) at an average of9.5 Â± 5.5 weeks.CONCLUSIONS: The Synergy device provides partial hemodynamic support and its use is associated with significantly improved hemodynamics, thus appearing tointerrupt and partially reverse the progressive hemodynamic deterioration typicalof end-stage heart failure. Ongoing efforts are aimed at demonstrating additionalclinical benefits and continuing to further improve the risk/benefit ratio.Copyright Â© 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
