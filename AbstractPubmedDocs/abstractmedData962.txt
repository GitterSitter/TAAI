Furthermore,prior studies with pulsatile LVADs have shown that transplantation, either early (<6 weeks) or late (>6 months) after LVAD implantation, adversely affectedpost-cardiac transplant survival. We sought to determine factors related toposttransplant survival in patients supported with continuous-flow LVADs.METHODS: The HeartMate II LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif) wasimplanted in 468 patients as a bridge to transplant at 36 centers in amulticenter trial. Patients who underwent transplantation after support werestratified by demographics: gender, age, etiology, body mass index, duration ofdevice support, and by adverse events during support. The median age was 54 years(range 18-73 years); 43% had ischemic etiology, and 18% were women. Survival was determined at the specific intervals of 30 days and 1 year after transplantation.RESULTS: Of 468 patients, 250 (53%) underwent cardiac transplant after a medianduration of LVAD support of 151 days (longest: 3.2 years), 106 (23%) died, 12(2.6%) recovered ventricular function and the device was removed, and 100 (21%)were still receiving LVAD support. The overall 30-day and 1-year posttransplantsurvivals were 97% and 87%. There were no significant differences in survivalbased on demographic factors or LVAD duration of less than 30 days, 30 to 90days, 90 to 180 days, and more than 180 days. Patients requiring more than 2units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support had astatistically significant decreased 1-year survival (82% vs 94%) when comparedwith patients who did not require more than 2 units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support (P = .03). There was a trend for slightly lowersurvival at 1 year in patients with percutaneous lead infections during LVADsupport versus no infection (75% vs 89%; P = .07).CONCLUSIONS: Post-cardiac transplant survival in patients supported withcontinuous-flow devices such as the HeartMate II LVAD is equivalent to that with conventional transplantation. Furthermore, posttransplant survival is notinfluenced by the duration of LVAD support. The improved durability and reducedshort- and long-term morbidity associated with the HeartMate II LVAD has reduced the need for urgent cardiac transplantation, which may have adversely influenced survival in the pulsatile LVAD era.
