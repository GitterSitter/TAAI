Six sheep were assigned to eitheran acute or chronic group. Then we created an acute myocardial infarction in eachby occluding the distal left anterior descending coronary artery with a balloonfor 90 minutes. All the sheep underwent LVAD implantation 30 days later. On thesame day, sheep in the acute group underwent transendocardial cell injections andwere euthanized. Sheep in the chronic group received cell injections 2 weeksafter LVAD implantation and were euthanized 30 days later. The presence of theLVAD or the use of chest-closure wires did not interfere with electromechanicalmapping. Furthermore, no adverse events were observed during electromechanicalmapping or the stem cell injections. In all sheep, the LVAD flow rate wasapproximately 4 L/min during mapping and the injections, and no adjustments were required. Histologic analysis confirmed that the mesenchymal precursor stem cellswere successfully delivered. No differences were observed between the acute andchronic groups. In conclusion, our study showed that transendocardialelectromechanical mapping and stem cell injections are safe and feasible in thepresence of an LVAD. Surgically implanted metal devices, including the LVAD,steel chest-closure wire, and skin staples, were compatible with theelectromechanical mapping system.PMCID: PMC3709201
