The MEDOS/HIA-System provides pulsatile ventricular assistancefor pediatric and adult patients. Our experience with 13 consecutive patientswith the MEDOS is reported. Perioperative survival was 84.6%, complicationsoccurred in 61% (31% thrombembolism, 23% rethoracotomy, 7% infections). Meanduration of support was 17.6 +/- 14.6 days (1-45 days). Bilirubin decreased from 3.9 +/- 2.3 to 2.7 +/- 1.6 mg/dL; creatinine from 1.6 +/- 1 to 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dL;lactate from 5.8 +/- 4.2 to 1.7 +/- 1.5 (P = 0.027; Wilcoxon). All patients whounderwent subsequent heart transplantation (6 of 13; 46%) were discharged fromhospital. For 38.5% of the patients no organ offer was received. Mechanicalcirculatory support with the MEDOS/HIA-System can be performed successfully forbridging to transplantation. Secondary organ functions improve under thispulsatile circulatory assistance. Hemorrhage and thromboembolic events are themost frequent complications.
