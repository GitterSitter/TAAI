In this study weinvestigated reliable predictors of LVAS weaning.METHODS: Eighty-two patients underwent LVAS implantation between April 1994 andJuly 2006 at our institution. Cardiac function was restored in 8 patients, whowere weaned from LVAS after a mean of 5 months (Group R). Thirty-three patientsremained on LVAS support for >1 year (Group N) because natural heart function didnot show adequate improvement. We retrospectively evaluated the differencesbetween these two groups. Group R was younger, and had a shorter duration ofheart failure than Group N (23.4 vs 36.7 years and 13.3 vs 56.1 months, p < 0.01,respectively). Pathologic findings showed that the interstitial fibrosis scorewas lower in Group R (p < 0.01). Three months after LVAS insertion, B-typenatriuretic peptide (BNP) and fractional shortening (FS) were more favorable(66.6 +/- 46 vs 264.5 +/- 170 pg/ml, p < 0.01, and 23 +/- 17.1 vs 12 +/- 9.1%, p < 0.05, respectively) in Group R. Furthermore, Group R received a higher dose of beta-blocker (15.4 +/- 8.4 vs 5.8 +/- 3.9 mg, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, shorter history of heart failure, and less interstitialfibrosis were effective predictors of weaning from LVAS. Restoration of naturalheart function was more rapid and more persistent in candidates for LVASexplantation, and presence of beta-blocker played a prominent role in improvingcardiac function after LVAS implantation.
