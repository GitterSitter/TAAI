Rev Esp Cardiol. 2008 Jun;61 Suppl 2:25-32.[Progress in mechanical circulatory support].[Article in Spanish]Delgado MS(1), Bernabeo G, Delgado DH.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology and Transplantation, University Health Network,Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Mechanical circulatory support is an important aspect of the management ofpatients with severe heart failure. Such support improves survival when treatmentwith intravenous inotropes or vasodilators, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsationand mechanical ventilation has failed. Technological advances in ventricularassist devices have reduced the risk of postoperative complications. However,risk stratification prior to device implantation is essential for reducingcomplications over both the short and long term. As knowledge aboutcardiovascular disease and the range of mechanical devices available continue to develop, the challenge for clinicians will be to use clinical findings to select the device that is most likely to benefit the individual patient. This articledescribes the circulatory support devices currently available for use inpatients, the indications for their use, their beneficial effects on ventricular function, and the advantages and disadvantages of each particular device.
