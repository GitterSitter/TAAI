J Card Fail. 2002 Dec;8(6 Suppl):S500-5.Reversal mechanisms of left ventricular remodeling: lessons from left ventricularassist device experiments.Margulies KB(1).Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Research Group, Temple University School of Medicine,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.The mechanical left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has become a reliable means of stabilizing the conditions of medically refractory patients with severe heart failure who are awaiting heart transplantation. At the same time, a substantialand growing body of evidence indicates that LVAD support triggers a multitude of adaptations within the failing human heart that seem to be triggered byhemodynamic unloading of the failing heart and changes in intracardiac andsystemic neurohumoral activity. At the cell and tissue level, virtually everytype of pathologic defect associated with failing human hearts demonstrateschanges during LVAD support, and these adaptations are usually towards a lesspathologic phenotype. This review summarizes the available literature concerning the phenomenology of so-called reverse remodeling. From this review it is clearthat myocardial responses to LVAD support reveal the remarkable plasticity ofeven the most severely failing hearts. The composite literature on myocardialresponses to LVAD support supports the thesis that mechanical overload is aprimary factor sustaining the pathologic phenotype of the failing heart andsuggests that the study of reverse remodeling provides a valuable opportunity to discover adaptive signaling pathways capable of mediating myocardial recovery.
