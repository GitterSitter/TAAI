G. Suska 6, 10000, Zagreb, Croatia,abarisin@kbd.hr.Primary graft failure in the early postoperative period after hearttransplantation, remains a main cause of a poor outcome. Current treatmentoptions include pharmacological (catecholamines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors)and mechanical assist device support. Pharmacological support with catecholaminesis related to elevated myocardial oxygen consumption and regional hypoperfusionleading to organ damage. On the other hand, levosimendan, as acalcium-sensitizing agent increases cardiac contractility without alteringintracellular Ca(2+) levels and increase in oxygen demand. We present a case of a51-year-old man, who was suffering from acute right-heart failure in the earlypostoperative period after heart transplantation. As a rescue therapy at the latestage of a low cardiac output state, levosimendan was started as continuousinfusion at 0.1 μg/kg/min for 12 h and thereafter, at 0.2 μg/kg/min for thefollowing 36 h. Levosimendan demonstrated an advanced pharmacological option aswas portrayed in this case, where the right ventricle was under a prolongedsevere depression and acutely overloaded after heart transplantation.
