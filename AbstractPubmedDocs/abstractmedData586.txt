Survival in the two cohorts receiving mechanical support (with data censored at the time of transplantation or weaning from the deviceowing to recovery) was compared with survival in two propensity-score-matchedhistorical control groups (one for each cohort) undergoing extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO).RESULTS: For participants in cohort 1, the median survival time had not beenreached at 174 days, whereas in the matched ECMO group, the median survival was13 days (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). For participants in cohort 2 and thematched ECMO group, the median survival was 144 days and 10 days, respectively(P<0.001 by the log-rank test). Serious adverse events in cohort 1 and cohort 2included major bleeding (in 42% and 50% of patients, respectively), infection (in63% and 50%), and stroke (in 29% and 29%).CONCLUSIONS: Our trial showed that survival rates were significantly higher with the ventricular assist device than with ECMO. Serious adverse events, includinginfection, stroke, and bleeding, occurred in a majority of study participants.(Funded by Berlin Heart and the Food and Drug Administration Office of OrphanProduct Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00583661.).
