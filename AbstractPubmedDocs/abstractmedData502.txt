There are limited data on the microbiology andepidemiology of these infections.METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients scheduled for VAD implantationwere enrolled (2006-2008) at 11 US cardiac centers and followed prospectivelyuntil transplantation, explantation for recovery, death, or for 1 year.Eighty-six patients (57%) received HeartMate II devices. Data were collected onpotential preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors forinfection. Clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were collected forsuspected infections and evaluated by an infectious diseases specialist.Thirty-three patients (22%) developed 34 VAD-related infections with an incidencerate of 0.10 per 100 person-days (95% confidence interval, 0.073-0.142). Themedian time to infection was 68 days. The driveline was the most commonlyinfected site (n=28); 18 (64%) were associated with invasive disease.Staphylococci were the most common pathogen (47%), but pseudomonas or otherGram-negative bacteria caused 32% of infections. A history of depression andelevated baseline serum creatinine were independent predictors of VAD infection(adjusted hazard ratio=2.8 [P=0.007] and 1.7 [P=0.023], respectively). TheHeartMate II was not associated with a decreased risk of infection. VAD infectionincreased 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio=5.6; P<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, multicenter study demonstrates that infectionfrequently complicates VAD placement and is a continuing problem despite the use of newer, smaller devices. Depression and renal dysfunction may increase the riskof VAD infection. VAD infection is a serious consequence because it adverselyaffects patient survival.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Uniqueidentifier: NCT01471795.PMCID: PMC3695607
