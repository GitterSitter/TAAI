Although the Fontanoperation has created a generation of survivors of complex single-ventricledisease, recognition of the limitation of this circulation is increasing. Mostcommonly, survivors suffer from ventricular dysfunction, protein-losingenteropathy, plastic bronchitis and arrhythmias. Although several medicaltherapies exist to palliate these long-term complications, surgical treatmentsare becoming increasingly useful, including the introduction of mechanicaldevices and cardiac transplantation. Currently, there are a variety of optionsavailable for mechanical support of the failing Fontan. Further developments inmechanical support technology will be required to tailor-make specific devicesfor this unique population. Owing to the fact that availability of donor heartsfor transplantation is limited, mechanical support will play an increasinglyimportant role in the management of complications of the Fontan circulation.
