The number of VAD implantations is growingworldwide. Between July 1987 and July 2010, we implanted 1,598 VADs in 1,455patients. The majority were male (81.0%), and their mean age was 49.4 years(range 0.3-82 years). Indications for implantation were: cardiomyopathy (n =1,074), post-cardiotomy heart failure (n = 282), acute myocardial infarction (n =83), graft failure after heart transplantation (n = 64), and others (n = 61). In 55.5%, the VAD implanted was left ventricular, in 39.5% biventricular, and in4.8% right ventricular. Until 1995, the implanted pumps were mostly pulsatile.Today, however, more than 95% of the implanted VADs are continuous-flow rotarypumps. The average support time was 148.6 days (range 0-1,836 days). Thepercentage of biventricular VADs has dropped over the years to 20% in 2009. Threehundred forty-seven patients could be successfully bridged to hearttransplantation. In 122 patients (8.3%), the device could be explanted aftermyocardial recovery. In 2009, 31.4% of the patients were implanted for permanent support. During the study period, 521 patients could be discharged home or to arehabilitation center. Implantation of ventricular assist devices is now anestablished treatment for patients with both acute and chronic end-stage heartfailure. Small implantable left ventricular assist devices of the second andthird generation are now broadly employed worldwide, with growing acceptance and decreasing complications. The percentage of biventricular support has droppedover the years to 20%.
