Left ventricular assist device implantation offers analternative treatment approach. Left ventricular assist device practice haschanged dramatically since the 2008 Food and Drug Administration approval of the HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif), but at what societal cost? Thepresent study examined the cost and efficacy of both treatments over time.METHODS: All patients who underwent either orthotopic heart transplantation (n = 9369) or placement of an implantable left ventricular assist device (n = 6414)from 2005 to 2009 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were selected. The trends intreatment use, mortality, and cost were analyzed.RESULTS: The incidence of orthotopic heart transplantation increased marginallywithin a 5-year period. In contrast, the annual left ventricular assist deviceimplantation rates nearly tripled. In-hospital mortality from left ventricularassist device implantation decreased precipitously, from 42% to 17%. In-hospital mortality for orthotopic heart transplantation remained relatively stable (range,3.8%-6.5%). The mean cost per patient increased for both orthotopic hearttransplantation and left ventricular assist device placement (40% and 17%,respectively). With the observed increase in both device usage and cost perpatient, the cumulative Left ventricular assist device cost increased 232% within5 years (from $143 million to $479 million). By 2009, Medicare and Medicaid were the primary payers for nearly one half of all patients (orthotopic hearttransplantation, 45%; left ventricular assist device, 51%).CONCLUSIONS: Since Food and Drug Administration approval of the HeartMate II,mortality after left ventricular assist device implantation has decreasedrapidly, yet has remained greater than that after orthotopic hearttransplantation. The left ventricular assist device costs have continued toincrease and have been significantly greater than those for orthotopic hearttransplantation. Because of the evolving healthcare economics climate, withincreasing emphasis on the costs and comparative effectiveness, a concertedeffort at LVAD cost containment and judicious usage is essential to preserve the viability of this invaluable treatment.Copyright Â© 2013 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
