Because the majority of MCS devices areimplanted after prior cardiac operations, special precautions are necessary atthe time of implant. MCS in single ventricle patients usually requiresventricular and aortic cannulation, with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt forpulmonary blood flow. Limited outcomes data is available, with less than 15% ofpediatric MCS patients having congenital heart disease. The Berlin EXCOR is theonly durable device currently available for infants. Neurologic complications arethe major cause of mortality, and survival during support is poor for infants <5 kg. Patients post-Fontan with acute cardiac failure and/or respiratory failureare at high risk for death before transplant and should be considered for MCStherapy. Several emerging miniature continuous flow devices will soon broaden thelandscape of available pediatric devices.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
