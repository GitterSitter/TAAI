In patients requiring a ventricular assist device (VAD), the benefit from ICD therapy is not well established. The aim of this study was todefine the impact of ICD on outcomes in VAD-supported patients.METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed data for consecutive adult HF patients receivingVAD as a bridge to transplantation from 1996 to 2003. The primary outcome wassurvival to transplantation. A total of 144 VADs were implanted [85 leftventricular (LVAD), 59 biventricular (BIVAD), mean age 50 ± 12 years, 77% male,left ventricular ejection fraction 18 ± 9%, 54% ischemic]. Mean length of supportwas 119 days (range 1-670); 103 patients (72%) survived to transplantation.Forty-five patients had an ICD (33 LVAD, 12 BIVAD). More LVAD patients had anappropriate ICD shock before implantation than after (16 vs 7; P = .02). Therewas a trend toward higher shock frequency before LVAD implant than after (3.3 ±5.2 vs 1.1 ± 3.8 shocks/y; P = .06). Mean time to first shock after VAD implantwas 129 ± 109 days. LVAD-supported patients with an ICD were significantly morelikely to survive to transplantation [1-y actuarial survival to transplantation: LVAD: 91% with ICD vs 57% without ICD (log-rank P = .01); BIVAD: 54% vs 47%(log-rank P = NS)]. An ICD was associated with significantly increased survivalin a multivariate model controlling for confounding variables (odds ratio 2.54,95% confidence interval 1.04-6.21; P = .04).CONCLUSIONS: Shock frequency decreases after VAD implantation, likely owing toventricular unloading, but appropriate ICD shocks still occur in 21% of patients.An ICD is associated with improved survival in LVAD-supported HF patients.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.
