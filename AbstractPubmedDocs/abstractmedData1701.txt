Theimmunologic consequence of continuous-flow rotary blood pumps is not known.METHODS: Six male adult patients (mean age 47 plus minus 10.3) with end-stageleft heart failure received a DeBakey VAD axial-flow pump for use as a bridge to transplantation. (Four patients underwent transplantation after a mean 115 plusminus 14 days; 2 patients are still waiting for the allograft.)RESULTS: We prospectively monitored T-cell populations and apoptosis-specificaberrant T-cell activation via CD95 triggering and annexin V binding tolymphocytes, identifying T cells undergoing early phases of apoptosis, within thefirst 10 weeks. Moreover, soluble death-inducing receptors soluble CD95 andsoluble tumor necrosis factor-R1 were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay.CONCLUSION: Patients bridged to transplantation by a nonpulsatile ventricularassist device demonstrated an initial pronounced apoptosis-specific immunealteration by increased annexin V binding to CD3 T cells and death-inducingreceptors soluble CD95/tumor necrosis factor-R1 (all P <.001). All parametersnormalized after 7 weeks to baseline. No blood-borne sepsis was detected, asdefined by blood culture, within the first 10 weeks of the cohort study. Theseresults indicate a biphasic immunologic response in patients with end-stage heartfailure treated with nonpulsatile ventricular assist devices.
