Treatmentindications and the current situation in Spain].[Article in Spanish]Gómez Bueno M(1), Segovia Cubero J, Alonso-Pulpón Rivera L.Author information: (1)Unidad de Insuficiencia Cardiaca y Trasplante, Servicio de Cardiología,Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.Despite advances in all areas of cardiology, the incidence of heart failureincreases each year. Pharmacologic treatment, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and heart failure surgery have resulted in prolonged survival in these patientsand in symptomatic improvement. However, in more advanced phases of the disease, these therapeutic options become less effective. This is when hearttransplantation and cardiac assist devices are the only techniques that canlengthen survival and improve quality of life. For the past 25 years, hearttransplantation has been the most effective therapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart failure. The scarcity of suitable donors and the development ofalternative forms of treatment that are effective in less advanced disease stageshave led to heart transplantation being reserved for young heart disease patientswhose life-expectancy is short. Cardiac assist devices have been shown to beeffective as temporary therapy, providing a bridge to heart transplantation orrecovery, or as permanent support in patients with contraindications to hearttransplantation. Currently both paracorporeal and intracorporeal assist devicesare available, and there are even systems that can replace the heart completely. More widespread use of these devices depends on the establishment of appropriate indications, on an improvement in the devices' cost-benefit ratios, and on areduction in the still high rate of complications.
