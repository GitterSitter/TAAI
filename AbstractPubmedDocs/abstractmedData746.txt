Sebastian.Michel@med.uni-muenchen.deIn an aging population, numerous patients who underwent previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are presenting with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.Although redo CABG and cardiological interventions are possible treatmentoptions, orthotopic heart transplantation remains an ultimate option for thesepatients. However, there is high morbidity and mortality on the waiting list, andmechanical circulatory support is a life-saving concept [Hetzer 2006; Taylor2009].We developed a simplified and safe technique for implantation of abiventricular assist device as a redo in complex patients after previous CABG andend-stage heart failure.
