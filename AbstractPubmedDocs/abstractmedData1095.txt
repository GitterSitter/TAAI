However, there is a subgroup of patientswith end-stage cardiomyopathy requiring major aortic surgery who do not meetheart transplant criteria. The optimal treatment strategy for these patients isstill to be defined. In this report, we describe the use of an implantablecontinuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as an adjunct to extensive aortic repair for providing patients with an acceptable risk surgical alternativeto palliative treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reportof this approach in the published literature.
