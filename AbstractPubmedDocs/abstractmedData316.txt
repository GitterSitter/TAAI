Because most reported post-discharge experience is with left ventricularassist devices (LVAD), we sought to evaluate the safety and feasibility of homedischarge on paracorporeal biventricular assist devices (BIVAD).METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the hospital course and post-dischargeoutcomes of 46 consecutive patients who received paracorporeal VADs as bridge to transplant. The success of home discharge was assessed by frequency and reasonsfor hospital readmission and survival to transplant.RESULTS: Thirty patients (65%) were successfully transferred from the intensivecare unit and considered candidates for discharge. Of the 26 patients discharged home, 11 were supported with an LVAD and 15 with BIVADs. Median duration ofsupport until transplant, explant, or death did not differ significantly between LVAD or BIVAD patients (91 days vs 158 days; p = 0.09). There were 26readmissions for medical or device-related complications; 10 in 7 LVAD patientsand 16 in 10 BIVAD patients, with no difference in median length of stay (17 daysvs 25 days; p = 0.67). Out of hospital duration of support was similar betweenLVAD and BIVAD patients (61 days vs 66 days; p = 0.87) as were 6-month and 1-yearevent-free survival rates (p = 0.49).CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes were similar in patients bridged to transplant on homeparacorporeal BIVAD versus LVAD support. We recommend discharge for stablepatients demonstrating device competency and adequate home care regardless of theneed for univentricular or biventricular paracorporeal support.Copyright Â© 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
