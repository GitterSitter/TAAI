Circulation. 2002 Jun 4;105(22):2588-91.Circulatory support for long-term treatment of heart failure: experience with an intraventricular continuous flow pump.Westaby S(1), Banning AP, Saito S, Pigott DW, Jin XY, Catarino PA, Robson D,Moorjani N, Kardos A, Poole-Wilson PA, Jarvik R, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Oxford Heart Centre, Oxford, UK. swestaby@AHF.org.ukBACKGROUND: A lifetime mechanical solution for advanced heart failure must bereliable, with a low risk of life-threatening complications. After extensivelaboratory testing, we began clinical trials with an axial flow pump forlong-term treatment of New York Heart Association class IV, transplant-ineligiblepatients.METHODS AND RESULTS: The Jarvik 2000 is a continuous flow device that isimplanted in the apex of the left ventricle with offloading to the descendingthoracic aorta. Skull-based percutaneous power delivery was derived from cochlearimplant technology. We used this system in 4 patients with end-stage dilatedcardiomyopathy. Exercise capacity, quality of life, device parameters, and nativeheart function were monitored serially. One patient died from right heart failureat 3 months. The other patients were discharged from hospital between 3 and 8weeks postoperatively and are currently New York Heart Association I or II.Follow-up lasted between 9 and 20 months. There has been no device failure orhemolysis. Native heart function and quality of life were markedly improved.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 is a true assist (rather than replacement) devicethat functions synergistically with the native left ventricle and providesexcellent quality of life. Adverse events are infrequent. This blood pump mayprovide a mechanical solution for end-stage heart failure in the community.
