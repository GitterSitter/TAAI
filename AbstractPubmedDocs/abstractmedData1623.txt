Such aparadigm would require a definition of appropriate candidates for LVADimplantation, the most appropriate time for LVAD placement during the management of end-stage CHF, reliable histologic, biochemical, and imaging markers ofrecovery, and the optimum duration of LVAD support. The device technology must berefined further to reduce the morbidity associated with the device itself, and tomake the device smaller, less invasive, and less thrombogenic. It will be achallenge to identify the role for concomitant drug therapy and to developweaning programs for device support. Finally, guidelines will have to bedeveloped to monitor and manage these patients after explantation of LVAD.
