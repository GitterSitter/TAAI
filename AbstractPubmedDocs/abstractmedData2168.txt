Preclinical appraisal.Bernhard WF, Poirier V, LaFarge CC, Carr JG.Surgical patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass duringoperation or who develop balloon-dependent left ventricular failurepostoperatively are now considered unsavable. However, in those with potentially reversible ventricular dysfunction, recovery might be possible if an improvedmeans of temporary circulatory support were available. Towards this end, apneumatically actuated, left ventricular assist pump was developed and evaluated in 20 consecutive calf experiments. The device, containing a flexiblepolyurethane pumping chamber, was positioned on the chest wall and connected tothe left ventricular apex and descending thoracic aorta by two Dacron valvedconduits (xenograft valves). All animals survived a 14 to 30 day pumpinginterval, and 7 underwent successful removal of the device by division of theDacron conduits below skin level. As a prelude to human investigation, pumps wereimplanted during a series of routine autopsies through midline sternotomyincison. The device was positioned on the right anterolateral chest wall, withtwo valved conduits traversing the mediastinum to connect the pump to the leftventricular apex and ascending aorta.
