Mechanical circulatory support frequently improves renal function, but theimpact of pre-MCS renal dysfunction on renal function after cardiactransplantation (CTX) is unknown.METHODS: Patients with MCS from January 1995 until April 2008 at a single center were included if their MCS duration was at least 60 days and they underwentsuccessful CTX. Patients were followed for 1 year after CTX.RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were included in the study. Mechanicalcirculatory support was biventricular assist device in 28% and left ventricularassist device in 72% (continuous flow left ventricular assist device, 14%). Mean duration of MCS was 124 days. Patients were grouped according to tertiles ofpre-MCS creatinine clearance (CrCl): group 1, CrCl less than 45 mL/min; group 2, CrCl between 45 and 65 mL/min inclusive; and group 3, CrCl more than 65 mL/min.Group 3 had the best renal outcomes both after MCS and 1 year after CTX.Regardless of group, patients who had a CrCl of at least 60 mL/min before CTX hadsimilar 1-year posttransplant CrCl (55 versus 53 versus 56 mL/min for groups 1through 3, respectively; not significantly different). However, the ability toachieve this level of renal function after MCS was less likely in those with the worst renal function before the initiation of MCS (53% versus 74% versus 90% for groups 1 through 3, respectively; p=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of MCS leads to improvements in renal function in patientsafter MCS. However, the renal outcomes after CTX seem to be more dependent on thelevel of renal function achieved during MCS than on the level of renal functionbefore MCS.Copyright Â© 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
