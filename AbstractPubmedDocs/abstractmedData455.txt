Epub 2013 Apr 17.Heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy: two comparable options in end-stage heart failure?Garbade J(1), Barten MJ, Bittner HB, Mohr FW.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Heart Center, University of Leipzig, Leipzig,Germany. garbade@med.uni-leipzig.deHeart transplantation is the only curative therapy for chronic heart failure, andit plays an important role in the treatment of chronic heart failure with asurvival rate of approximately 50% of all patients after 10 years. This has to bekept in mind when alternative therapies enter into our daily routine in treating this patient population. However, the shortage of appropriate donor organs andthe expanding pool of patients waiting for heart transplantation have led togrowing interest in alternative strategies, particularly in left ventricularassist device (LVAD) therapy. With growing clinical experience and continuedtechnical advances, continuous-flow pumps are evolving as a bridge totransplantation or as a destination therapy for advanced heart failure.Nevertheless, the importance of this new indication of chronic cardiac supportcompared to heart transplantation is still completely open and the object ofcontroversial ongoing discussion. This review (1) describes the clinical use and long-term outcome of a currently available miniaturized LVAD in the context tothe standard of care-heart transplantation, (2) provides an outlook of theongoing process of further optimization of LVADs, and (3) comments on thechallenges with assist devices as alternatives to transplantation with a 5-yearoutlook.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
