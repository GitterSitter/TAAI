To determine the feasibility of using a clinically available axial flow ventricular assist device as an RVAD, we implanted Jarvik 2000 pumps in the left ventricle and right atriumof two Corriente crossbred calves (approximately 100 kg each) by way of a leftthoracotomy and then analyzed the hemodynamic effects in the mechanicallyfibrillated heart at various LVAD and RVAD speeds. Right atrial implantation ofthe device required no modification of either the device or the surgicaltechnique used for left ventricular implantation. Satisfactory biventricularsupport was achieved during fibrillation as evidenced by an increase in meanaortic pressure from 34 mm Hg with the pumps off to 78 mm Hg with the pumpsgenerating a flow rate of 4.8 L/min. These results indicate that the Jarvik 2000 pump, which can provide chronic circulatory support and can be powered byexternal batteries, is a feasible option for right ventricular support after LVADimplantation and is capable of completely supporting the circulation in patients with global heart failure.
