However, the model has not been externally validated,and its suitability as a selection tool for heart transplantation (HT) and leftventricular assist device (LVAD) is unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated the UCLA risk score (based on B-typenatriuretic peptide, peak VO2, New York Heart Association class, and use ofangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) in 180patients referred for HT. The outcome was survival free from urgenttransplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared toKaplan-Meier's estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%,and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively.Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated gooddiscrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year, 0.774; 3-year,0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was poor. Thedifference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results werefound when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariateimputation of missing data.CONCLUSIONS: The UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent andhigh-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort. Further modelassessment is warranted before widespread use.Â© 2014 The Authors. Published on behalf of the American Heart Association, Inc., by Wiley Blackwell.PMCID: PMC4309113
