Heart transplantation provides an effective treatment for a subset of thesepatients. This article provides cardiologists with up-to-date information aboutreferral for transplantation, the role of left ventricular assist devices priorto transplant, patient selection, waiting-list management and donor heartavailability. Timing is of central importance; patients should be referred beforecomplications (eg, cardiorenal syndrome or secondary pulmonary hypertension) havedeveloped that will increase the risk of, or potentially contraindicate,transplantation. Issues related to heart failure aetiology, comorbidity andadherence to medical treatment are reviewed. Finally, the positive role thatcardiologists can play in promoting and facilitating organ donation is discussed.
