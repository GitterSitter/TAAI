Our aim was tocalculate the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow LVADs.METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective was performed. Alifetime Markov model was set up in which continuous-flow LVAD was compared with optimal medical therapy (OMT). The treatment effect was modeled indirectlycombining the results of the REMATCH trial comparing OMT with a pulsatile-flowLVAD and the HeartMate II Destination Therapy Trial comparing a pulsatile-flowLVAD with a continuous-flow LVAD. Cost data were based on real-world financialdata of sixty-nine patients with a HeartMate II implantation from the University Medical Centre Utrecht (the Netherlands). One-way and probabilistic sensitivityanalyses were performed.RESULTS: Comparing the continuous-flow HeartMate II with OMT, 3.23 (95 percentconfidence interval [CI], 2.18-4.49) life-years were gained (LYG) or 2.83 (95percent CI, 1.91-3.90) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost of an LVADimplant was approximately €126,000, of which the device itself represented thelargest cost, being €70,000. Total incremental costs amounted to €299,100 (95percent CI, 190,500-521,000). This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €94,100 (95 percent CI, 59,100-160,100) per LYG or €107,600 (95 percent CI, 66,700-181,100) per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed these results wererobust.CONCLUSIONS: Although LVAD destination therapy improves survival and quality oflife, it remains a relatively expensive intervention which renders thereimbursement of this therapy questionable.
