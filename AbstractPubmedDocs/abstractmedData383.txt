Patients undergoing MVR with concomitant HMII implantationwere compared with those undergoing HMII implantation alone. Of the 57 patientsundergoing cf-LVAD implantation, 21 (36.8%) underwent concomitant MVR and 36(63.2%) underwent cf-LVAD implantation alone. Patients receiving MVR had greater decrement in PVR (59.4% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.01). Decrease in end-diastolic diameter was greater for patients receiving MVR but did not reach statistical significance(18.2 vs. 13.5 mm, p = 0.33). Duration of mechanical ventilation (121.6 vs. 181.4hours, p = 0.45) and inotropic support (162.4 vs. 153.2 hours, p = 0.86), change in creatinine (0.19 vs. -0.26 mg/dl, p = 0.34), increase in bilirubin (2.54 vs.1.55 mg/dl, p = 0.63), intensive care unit stay (168.0 vs. 231.5 hours, p =0.38), and overall length of stay (32.0 vs. 42.5 days, p = 0.75) were similar.There was no difference in survival at 3 months (89.7% vs. 83.3%) and 1 year(83.7 vs. 67.3%, p = 0.34). Addition of MVR may result in greater decrement ofPVR than HMII implantation alone. This may permit certain patients thought to be ineligible for transplantation to become candidates.
