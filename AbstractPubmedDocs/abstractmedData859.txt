TwentyLVAD patients were evaluated prospectively (Jarvik 2000: n = 9, HeartMate II: n =11). The mean age was 57.7 Â± 14.9 years, and 14 were male. B-type natriureticpeptide levels were drawn while the patients were supported on LVADs at variable RPM settings. The RPM settings were correlated with the changes in BNP levels.Eleven patients underwent LVAD implantation for a lifelong support while the restwere as a bridge therapy to transplantation. Four patients required LVAD changeout for various causes of pump failure. Postoperative BNP levels decreaseddramatically with the initiation of LVAD support. The levels correlated inverselywith the degree of hemodynamic support rendered at various RPM settings of theHeartMate II (p < 0.001). Overall, BNP levels decreased significantly in 2 daysafter RPM increase. We observed a significant inverse correlation between thepostoperative BNP levels and the degree of LVAD support. The effective LVADsupport seems to result in a marked reduction in BNP levels, and monitoringserial BNP levels may be helpful in managing patients supported on continuousLVAD.
