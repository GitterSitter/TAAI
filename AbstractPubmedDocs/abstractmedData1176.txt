Stefan.Christiansen@uk-sh.deThe growing number of heart failure patients and the scarcity of donor organsgive rise to the development of mechanical circulatory support devices for along-term support. After approximately 15 years of experience, these devicesshould be critically evaluated. The presented article gives an overview on thecurrently most often used mechanical circulatory support systems, describes theindications for implantation (bridge to cardiac transplantation, destinationtherapy, and bridge to recovery), the complications like bleeding, thromboembolicevents, infections, and technical failures, and analyzes the costs of thistherapy. Furthermore, alternative treatment options like cardiac transplantation,coronary artery bypass grafting, cardiac valve surgery, defibrillatorimplantation, multisite pacing, dynamic and passive cardiomyoplasty, partial leftventriculectomy (PLV), Myosplint implantation (Myocor, Maple Grove, MN, USA),stem cell therapy, and xenotransplantation are shortly presented, and the future of mechanical support devices is discussed. Despite a great number of patientsbenefitting from mechanical support devices, the treatment with these deviceswill only compete with other therapeutic strategies if the rates of complicationsand technical failures as well as the costs are significantly reduced.Furthermore, innovative therapies like biochemical influencing of the cardiacmetabolism have a high potential and may play an important role in the future.
