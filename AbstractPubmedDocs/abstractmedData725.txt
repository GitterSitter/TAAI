With increased use of mechanical circulatorysupport devices (MCSD) over the course of the study, we can now evaluate thesevariables as predictors of MCSD in an extended follow-up.METHODS: Analyses focused on 313 MCSD-free patients (82% men; aged 53 ± 11 years)newly listed for heart transplantation (HTx). Variables assessed at time oflisting included psychosocial risk (depression, social isolation), quality oflife, waiting list stress, and medical risk (Heart Failure Survival Score,pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Cumulative incidence functions andcause-specific Cox models examined the association of medical and psychosocialrisk (low: non-depressed and socially integrated; medium: depressed or sociallyisolated; high: depressed and socially isolated) with time until MCSD,considering covariates and competing outcomes (death, high-urgencytransplantation [HU-HTx], elective HTx, and delisting due to clinical improvementor deterioration).RESULTS: Psychosocial risk groups were comparable regarding demographics, medicalparameters, and quality of life, but differed in waiting list-related stressors. During follow-up (median, 326; range, 5-1,849 days), 26 patients received MCSD,53 died, 144 underwent HTx (103 in HU status), and 53 were delisted (15deteriorated, 31 improved). Non-depressed and socially integrated patients didnot require MCSD. Controlling for medical risk, psychosocial risk significantlycontributed to MCSD, HU-HTx, and improvement; medical risk and female genderpredicted death (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial risk at time of listing affects the prognosis of HTxcandidates beyond medical risk. Psychosocial interventions may help to stabilize patients' health.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
