Theeffects on myocardial apoptosis and its mediators are unknown.METHODS: Myocardial biopsies from 17 patients at the time of LVAD implantationand after explantation, at the time of heart transplantation (HTx), were examinedby terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)reaction and with antibodies against Fas ligand (FasL), Fas, tumor necrosisfactor (TNF)-alpha receptor 1 (TNF-R1), TNF-alpha receptor 2 (TNF-R2), TNF-alpha,TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), caspase-3 and FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP).RESULTS: Apoptosis incidence was low: 0.8% (range 0% to 3%) positivecardiomyocytes nuclei before support, and 0.1% (range 0% to 0.6%) after support(p < 0.01). This was accompanied by low expression of caspase-3 and highexpression of the DNA repair enzyme, PARP. Its product, PAR, increased aftersupport. Mediators and receptors inducing apoptosis as well as FLIP were widelypresent before and after support.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the abundant presence of mediators and receptors inducingapoptosis, the incidence of apoptosis itself was low before and after mechanical support. The abundant expression of FLIP may suggest an important role for thisprotein in the inhibition of cardiomyocyte death.
