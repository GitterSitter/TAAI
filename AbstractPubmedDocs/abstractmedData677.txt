Our experience with SynCardia TotalArtificial Heart implantation documents its indications, safety, and efficacy.METHODS: Data regarding preoperative condition, mortality, and morbidity havebeen reviewed and analyzed.RESULTS: From January 1993 to December 2009, 101 patients had bridge totransplant procedures with the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart. Ninety-onepercent of cases were Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profile 1, and the remaining 9% of cases were failing medical therapy on multiple inotropic medications. The mean support time was 87 days (median, 53days; range, 1-441 days). Pump outputs during support were 7 to 9 L/min. Adverse events included strokes in 7.9% of cases and take-back for hemorrhage in 24.7% ofcases. Survival to transplantation was 68.3%. Causes of death of 32 patients ondevice support included multiple organ failure (13), pulmonary failure (6), andneurologic injury (4). Survival after transplantation at 1, 5, and 10 years was76.8%, 60.5%, and 41.2%, respectively. The longest-term survivor is currentlyalive 16.4 years postimplantation.CONCLUSIONS: These patients were not candidates for left ventricular assistdevice therapy and were expected to die. The SynCardia Total Artificial Heartoffers a real alternative for survival with a reasonable complication rate inappropriate candidates who otherwise might have been assigned to hospice care.Copyright Â© 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
