Framingham, MA)ventricular assist device (HVAD) is approved for implantation through asternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. We report on our initial experience with this device implanted off-pump via thoracotomy.METHODS: A total of 26 patients were included in this review. All patients wereInteragency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support categories 2or 3 and underwent implantation of an HVAD as an elective procedure viathoracotomy and mini sternotomy approach. Three-dimensional echocardiography was used to assess the ventricle and was also used to facilitate proper pumppositioning. Patients were managed during follow-up using anti-coagulants at atarget international normalized ratio 2.0 to 2.5 as well as anti-platelet agents.RESULTS: Implantation was performed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass,but 1 patient did require conversion to on-pump surgery. There were noperioperative deaths or right heart failure events. The mean intensive care unit stay was 1.5 days. Transfusions of 1 to 3 units of packed red blood cells wererequired in 16 patients, whereas 10 patients maintained a stable perioperativehematocrit of at least 30% and did not require transfusion. Survival through 90days was 100%, and survival through 180 days was 87%.CONCLUSIONS: Our experience was favorable in respect to outcome, safety, and use of blood products. Our technique can be used as an alternative approach for left ventricular assist device implantation using the HVAD.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
