AACN Clin Issues Crit Care Nurs. 1991 Aug;2(3):575-86.Novacor left ventricular assist system.Shinn JA.Clinical investigation of the Novacor ventricular assist system has been ongoing since 1984. Major successes have been achieved using the device as a bridge toheart transplant. This system uses an electrically driven, pulsatile pumpimplanted in the left upper abdominal quadrant. The system has demonstrated theability to provide long-term patient support, a feature that allows patients tobecome mobile and active once recovered from their initial heart failure. By the time of transplant, nutrition is restored, activity tolerance is improved, andmost patients require no inotropic support. The system allows patients to recoverfrom cardiogenic shock by providing total systemic circulatory support.
