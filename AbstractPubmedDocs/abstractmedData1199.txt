In order to get an overview of the use andperformance of the device in Europe a group of investigators was founded tocompare the initial results.METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of the first 101 consecutive cases inEurope, data were collected with regard to postoperative outcome and severeadverse events and anticoagulation protocols. Results were stratified byintention to treat as a bridge to transplant or as chronic support therapy inheart failure (destination therapy).RESULTS: In 70% of patients, the HeartMate II was intended as a bridge totransplant therapy, in 30%, it was used as a destination therapy device. Theperioperative mortality post implant was 20% in the bridge to transplant patientsand 7% in the destination therapy arm. However, after 1 year a comparablesurvival was observed in both groups (69% destination therapy, 63% bridge totransplant). Main causes of death were multiple organ failure (n=12) andcerebrovascular accidents (n=5). All, but one cerebrovascular accident occurredin the first 9 days after surgery. Only one other death was reported thereafterand there was no mechanical failure of the device.CONCLUSIONS: Even in the early experience the HeartMate II was used as a chronic support device in a substantial number of patients in Europe. Although the total experience is still limited, the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents is verylow and the survival beyond the perioperative period is excellent.
