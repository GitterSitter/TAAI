Several right ventricular (RV)echocardiographic parameters have been proposed as sensitive markers to detectpatients at risk. Our objective was to compare the predictive value of four RVsystolic echocardiographic parameters for outcomes in patients with HF.METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with stable HF and aleft ventricular ejection fraction <35% were assessed for the following: (i) RVfractional area (RVFA), (ii) tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), (iii) integral of the systolic wave (ISW(tdi)), and (iv) peak systolic velocity(PSV(tdi)). ISW(tdi) and PSV(tdi) were measured using tissue Doppler imaging atthe tricuspid annulus. The primary endpoint was death, urgent transplantation,urgent ventricular assist device implantation, or an acute HF episode. During amean follow-up of 295 days, 33 patients reached the primary endpoint. The cut-offthresholds for RVFA, TAPSE, PSV(tdi), and ISW(tdi) defined usingreceiver-operating characteristic curves were 36.8%, 13.5 mm, 9.5 cm s(-1), and1.75 cm, respectively. On Cox multivariate analysis, NYHA, log BNP, and onlyPSV(tdi) from the RV systolic parameters were found to be independent predictors of outcome.CONCLUSION: PSV(tdi) is a strong independent predictor of outcome in HF at athreshold value of 9.5 cm s(-1) and appears to be superior to other RV systolicechocardiographic parameters.
