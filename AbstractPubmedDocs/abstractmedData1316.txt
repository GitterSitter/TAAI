Ann Thorac Surg. 2007 Mar;83(3):1179-81.Berlin Heart ventricular assist device in a child with hypoplastic left heartsyndrome.Chu MW(1), Sharma K, Tchervenkov CI, Jutras LF, Lavoie J, Shemie SD, Laliberte E,Calaritis C, Cecere R.Author information: (1)Division of Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery, Montreal Children's Hospital,Montréal, Québec, Canada.We report the implantation of a Berlin Heart ventricular assist device (VAD) in a4-year-old boy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome previously palliated withNorwood and Glenn operations, who presented with progressive ventricular failure and hypoxemia. Insertion of a 30-mL pneumatic pediatric pump with cannulation of the systemic right ventricle and aorta had a salutary effect on cardiac output,improving oxygen saturations. While awaiting heart transplantation, multiplethromboembolic complications developed and he died, despite therapeuticheparinization and aspirin therapy. Important lessons learned about VAD supportin Glenn physiology, anticoagulation, and complications of the Berlin Heart arediscussed.
