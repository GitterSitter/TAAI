Box 85.500,3508GA Utrecht, The Netherlands. A.H.Bruggink@lab.azu.nlBACKGROUND: In the heart elevated levels of TNFalpha can cause lethal heartfailure, like Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM). The level of TNFalpha production isin part determined by promoter gene polymorphisms. We investigated whether theTNFalpha promoter gene polymorphism is in this way involved in the outcome ofend-stage heart failure and predicts whether patients require left ventricularassist device (LVAD) support or can be kept on medical therapy (MT)while awaitingheart transplantation (HTx). As most patients in this study received a hearttransplant, the role of the TNFalpha polymorphisms in transplant rejection wasstudied as well.METHODS AND RESULTS: In twenty nine patients with DCM, 35 patients with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD; both on MT), 26 patients on LVAD support and 61 cardiactransplant donors TNFalpha plasma level was detected by EASIA. In both patientsgroups high levels of TNFalpha plasma levels was observed however, in patientssupported by LVAD this increase was much higher compared to patients on MT.Furthermore, this increase seems to be associated with the TNF 1 allele ('G' atposition -308) instead of the TNF2 allele (A at position -308). The promoterpolymorphisms at positions -238, -244 and -308 were observed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Polymorphism at positions -238, -244 and -308 did notshow any relevant differences between the groups. However, at position -308, atrend of a higher incidence of the TNF2 allele (an "A" at position -308) in DCMpatients compared to donors was shown. The distribution of the TNF1 and TNF2alleles was not different in patients on medical therapy compared to the patientssupported by a LVAD. No association was found between patients' TNFalpha promotergene polymorphism and rejection. However, patients that received a donor heartwith the TNF2 allele developed more rejection episodes, compared to patients thatreceived a donor heart with the TNF1 allele.CONCLUSION: TNFalpha levels are high in patients with end-stage heart failure on MT, but even higher in patients on LVAD support. These high TNFalpha plasmalevels however, are not correlated with the TNF2 allele but seems to beassociated with the TNF1 allele. Furthermore, in HTx the donor TNFalpha gene seemto play a more important role in severity of acute rejection than that of thepatient.
