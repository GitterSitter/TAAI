Circulation. 2005 Jul 19;112(3):438-48.Mechanical device-based methods of managing and treating heart failure.Mancini D(1), Burkhoff D.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical School, New York, NY, USA.Despite advances in pharmacological treatments aimed at neurohormonal blockadefor heart failure in the setting of left ventricular pump dysfunction, there isstill a growing number of patients with advanced symptoms who suffer significant morbidity and mortality. Mechanical stresses and chronic neurohormonal activationconspire to propagate maladaptive ventricular remodeling responsible for theinsidious nature of this disease. Recent studies suggest that furtherpharmacological neurohormonal blockade may not be safe or effective, which hasdriven development of devices for this patient population. Furthermore, suchdevices may target fundamental pathophysiological abnormalities that are largely hemodynamic and mechanical in nature that are not addressed by availablepharmacological agents. The profound reverse remodeling routinely associated withleft ventricular assist device use, reviewed in detail, further validatesdevice-based approaches and should inspire research to find ways to make thisrecovery more complete and permanent. Accordingly, this review focuses on themultitude of mechanical device-based approaches currently being investigated tomanage and treat this population. From devices for monitoring patient status toanticipate congestive heart failure exacerbations and preemptively adjust therapyto devices to support preterminal patients with end-stage disease, it isrecognized that these device-based approaches will assume an increasinglyimportant role in treating the growing number of patients with advanced heartfailure.
