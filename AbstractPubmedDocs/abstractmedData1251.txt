In animal models and patients, continuous aortic flow augmentation using the Orqis Medical Cancion System (Orqis MedicalCorporation, Lake Forest, California), a percutaneously placedarterial-to-arterial circuit (continuous flow up to 1.5 L/min) with anextracorporeal, magnetic, centrifugal pump, improves hemodynamics and renalfunction with benefits persisting 24 hours after discontinuation.METHODS AND RESULTS: The Multi-center Trial of the Orqis Medical Cancion Systemfor the Enhanced Treatment of Heart Failure Unresponsive to Medical Therapy isenrolling patients hospitalized with HF who are randomized to continuous aorticflow augmentation or medical therapy alone. Entry requires persistent HF,elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, reduced cardiac index, and impaired renal function or substantial diuretic requirement despite intravenous inotropeor vasodilator treatment. The primary efficacy end point is a composite includingthe components of 72- to 96-hour pulmonary capillary wedge pressure reduction anddays alive out of hospital with no mechanical support for more than 35 days.Additional end points include changes in serum creatinine, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and health-related quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: The Multi-center Trial of the Orqis Medical Cancion System for theEnhanced Treatment of Heart Failure Unresponsive to Medical Therapy tests thehypothesis that continuous aortic flow augmentation improves the clinical status and outcomes in patients hospitalized with HF exacerbation who are inadequatelyresponsive to medical therapy.
