We present ourexperiment of HTx using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with Thoratec pneumatic ventricular assist device (TpVAD).METHODS: From May 1996 to June 2011, among 410 patients who underwent HTx 23required mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with implantation of the TpVAD and 15 (65%) of them received grafts.RESULTS: The 23 patients included 4 female and 19 male patients of age range 10to 80 years. Eighteen (78%) of them needed ECMO before TpVAD implantation. Twelve(67%) were implanted with a TpVAD double bridge to HTx. The demand for MCS among patients with acute hemodynamic collapse has led to major improvements in theexisting systems such as ECMO with double bridge to TpVAD.CONCLUSION: We used ECMO as a rescue procedure for acute hemodynamicdeterioration. However, during ECMO support, left ventricular afterloadincreased. If prolonged support is required, TpVAD might be required: 15 (65%) ofpatients supported by ECMO with TpVAD needed to a wait a suitable donor. Werecommend the application of ECMO for short-term support (within 1 week), andTpVAD as a bridge for medium- or long-term support.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
