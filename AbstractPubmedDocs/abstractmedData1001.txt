The prevalence of CHF increases with advancing life span, withdiastolic heart failure predominating in the elderly population. Primaryprevention of coronary artery disease and risk factor management via aggressiveblood pressure control are central in preventing new occurrences of leftventricular dysfunction. Optimal therapy for CHF involves identification andcorrection of potentially reversible precipitants, target-dose titration ofmedical therapy, and management of hospitalizations for decompensation. Theetiological phenotype, absolute decrease in left ventricular ejection fractionand a widening of QRS duration on electrocardiography, is commonly used toidentify patients at increased risk of progression of heart failure and suddendeath who may benefit from prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillatorplacement with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy. Patients whotransition to advanced stages of disease despite optimal traditional medical and device therapy may be candidates for hemodynamically directed approaches such as a left ventricular assist device; in selected cases, listing for cardiactransplant may be warranted.PMCID: PMC2813829
