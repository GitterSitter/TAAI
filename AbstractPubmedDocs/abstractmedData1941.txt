All patients undergoing heart transplantation during a 6year period were divided into 3 groups: group A patients (n = 110) had stablehemodynamics on oral medication, group B recipients (n = 41) received continuous i.v. catecholamine application, and in group C (n = 21) mechanical hemodynamicsupport was necessary. In groups B and C elevated serum creatinine andtransaminase levels-reflecting renal and hepatic dysfunction-were detected moreoften and the survival rate was worse during the first six months (A: 85%, B:71%, C: 52%, p < 0.01). In group C the prognosis of patients with multi-organdysfunction was significantly worse compared to patients with normal renal andhepatic function (38% vs. 75%; p < 0.01). In recipients surviving for six months,there was no difference in long-term prognosis between the groups studied. It is concluded that heart transplantation in patients with multi-organ dysfunction on invasive hemodynamic support bears a significantly increased risk in the earlypostoperative period. In view of the current donor shortage the condition ofother organs should be improved before transplantation as far as possible, evenusing long-term mechanical support.
