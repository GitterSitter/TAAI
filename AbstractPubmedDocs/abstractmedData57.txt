[Epub ahead of print]Around and around the merry-go-round: multiple implantations of short- andlong-term ventricular assist devices in a patient with severe heart failure.Sabashnikov A(1), Butters T, Högerle B, Hedger M, Zeriouh M, Fatullayev J,Weymann A, Choi YH, Wahlers T, Popov AF, Simon AR.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical CirculatorySupport, Harefield Hospital, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust,Middlesex, London, UB9 6JH, UK, a.sabashnikov@gmail.com.Multiple implantations of left ventricular assist devices over a period of three years were performed in a 17-year-old gentleman with non-ischaemic dilatedcardiomyopathy and congestive cardiac failure. The first device (HeartMate II)was implanted as a bridge to transplantation. However, after few months ofsupport the patient showed signs of myocardial recovery and the device wassuccessfully explanted. After 2 years of uneventful follow-up, the patient'scondition deteriorated requiring further mechanical support. Due to the elevated risk associated with a redo full-support LVAD implantation, we decided to implanta partial support device (Synergy(®) CircuLite). Because of recurrent pumpthrombosis requiring device exchange, the final weeks to transplantation werebridged with CentriMag(®) short-term LVAD. After successful cardiactransplantation the patient required further temporary extracorporeal membraneoxygenation support which was weaned off and explanted on the fourthpostoperative day. After further uncomplicated postoperative recovery the patientwas discharged and has been doing well for 1 year of follow-up.
