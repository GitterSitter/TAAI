Ventricular geometry change is achieved by placement of three Myosplint devices to bisect the LV and to createtwo smaller LV chambers.METHODS AND RESULTS: Since the first animal experiment in June 1997, theMyosplint has been tested extensively in a series of animal studies using apacing-induced, canine dilated cardiomyopathy model. Device-based LV geometrychange decreased LV wall stress, improved systolic function, and maintaineddiastolic function, resulting in an improvement in myocardial energetics. Anacute human feasibility study during heart transplant surgery was started in July1999. While awaiting the arrival of the donor heart, the Myosplint was implanted in the recipient LV in 5 patients. The device was easily applied on a beatingheart without complications related to the device or the procedure in any of the patients. LV wall stress was significantly decreased after tightening of thedevice. Clinical safety studies with chronic Myosplint implantation were begun inGermany in June 2000 and in the United States in February 2001. There have been atotal of 21 patients receiving the implant without evidence of bleeding, muscletearing, severe arrhythmia, or thrombus formation associated with the implant.CONCLUSIONS: Device-based geometry change has been demonstrated to be practical, effective, and safe.
