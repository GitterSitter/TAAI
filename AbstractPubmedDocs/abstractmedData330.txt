Selecting appropriate patients for MCSinvolves meeting a number of prespecifications as is required in evaluation forcardiac transplant candidacy. As technology evolves to bring forth more durablesmaller devices, selection criteria for appropriate MCS recipients will likelyexpand to encompass a broader, less sick population. The "Holy Grail" for MCSwill be a focus on clinical recovery and explantation of devices rather than the currently more narrowly defined indications of bridge to transplantation orlifetime device therapy.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.
