ASAIO J. 2005 Sep-Oct;51(5):508-12.Pulsatile ECMO in neonates and infants: first European clinical experience with anew device.Agati S(1), Mignosa C, Ciccarello G, Dario S, Undar A.Author information: (1)Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit, San Vincenzo Hospital, 98039 Taormina,Messina, Italy.This study presents the first European clinical experience with the MedosDeltaStream DP1, a new pulsatile flow pump, in neonates and infants. BetweenJanuary 2002 and December 2004, 420 patients at our institution underwentcongenital heart surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass. During this period, 10patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for acutepostcardiotomy heart failure. Seven patients (median age 7 days, range 1-70days), were supported by a nonpulsatile Biomedicus centrifugal pump, whereasthree patients (aged 1 month, 1 year, and 12 years) were supported by a pulsatileMedos DP1. The DP1 is an extracorporeal rotary blood pump. The pump features adiagonal-flow impeller, and can be used for both continuous and pulsatile output.Special characteristics include a small priming volume of approximately 30 ml anda high pumping capacity. A temperature sensor and speed sensors are integrated inthe pump. The pump has a delivery rate of up to 8 l/min and a speed range of100-10,000 rpm. Overall mortality was 40% (4 of 10 patients), and all four deathswere in the nonpulsatile Biomedicus group. In the nonpulsatile group, the median support duration was 95 hours with a range of 48-140 hours. Two patients assistedwith the pulsatile pump system were successfully weaned after 36 and 53 hours,respectively; the 12-year-old patient was successfully transplanted on the eighthpostimplant day and discharged from the hospital on the 32nd posttransplant day. Although this preliminary experience doesn't allow for statistical analysis,clinically it was possible to observe a better performance in pulsatile flowrecipients with faster lactate recovery, reduced need for inotropic support,reduced assistance duration in bridge-to-recovery settings, and smootherintensive care management. ECMO for postcardiotomy heart failure in neonates and infants still carries high mortality and morbidity rates. Pulsatile flow with theMedos DeltaStream DP1 pump system improves results by producing more physiologic hemodynamics, reducing the duration of support in the case of bridge to recovery,and improving end-organ function.
