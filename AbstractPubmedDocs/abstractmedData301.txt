Pump thrombosis may initially be suspected inthe setting of clinical and biochemical evidence for intravascular hemolysis,putatively related to shear stress on red blood cells propelled through apartially occluded pump. Limited data exist to guide management in thesepatients.METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a series of 8 LVAD patients who presented withintravascular hemolysis secondary to pump thrombosis who were treated withintraventricular thrombolytic therapy. In 3 patients, thrombolytic therapy led tocomplete and lasting resolution of hemolysis, suggesting successful dissolutionof pump thrombus. In the remaining 5 patients, thrombolytic therapy ultimatelyfailed to halt or reverse pump thrombosis and hemolysis: 1 patient requiredemergent pump exchange, 2 patients progressed to cardiogenic shock and died, 1patient suffered a debilitating stroke after which care was withdrawn, and 1patient underwent cardiac transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of LVAD thrombosis, thrombolytic therapy is analternate treatment strategy in a subset of patients. Candidacy for thisalternate procedure must carefully weigh the risks of complications, includinghemorrhage and thromboembolism.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
