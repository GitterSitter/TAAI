Circulation. 1997 May 20;95(10):2340-3.BACKGROUND: Long-term implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) maybe a future alternative treatment for end-stage heart failure. The objective ofthe present study was to determine the hemodynamic effects of supine bicycleexercise and functional capacity during upright treadmill exercise in 10 patientsafter LVAD implantation placed for refractory heart failure as a bridge tocardiac transplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: With supine bicycle exercise, 46 +/- 25 days after deviceplacement, heart and LVAD rates increased in parallel from 87 +/- 12 to 117 +/-14 bpm and 82 +/- 18 to 107 +/- 21 bpm, respectively. Peak O2 consumption was 8.2+/- 1.7 mL O2.kg-1.min-1. Fick Systemic blood flow rose from 5.0 +/- 1.2 to 7.8+/- 2.5 L/min. Right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures increasedfrom 6 +/- 4 and 5 +/- 3 mm Hg to 12 +/- 5 and 13 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively.End-diastolic left ventricular dimension increased from 3.9 +/- 1.3 to 4.8 +/-1.6 cm; however, right ventricular dimension decreased from 3.2 +/- 1.0 to 2.3+/- 0.9 cm. With upright treadmill exercise, peak O2 consumption was 14.1 +/- 2.9mL O2.kg-1.min-1.CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that exercise during long-term LVAD support is safe and is not limited by right heart decompensation. It also justifies a largerstudy to examine how exercise after LVAD implantation compares with that aftercardiac transplantation.
