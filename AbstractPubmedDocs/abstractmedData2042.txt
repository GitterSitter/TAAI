J Heart Lung Transplant. 1993 May-Jun;12(3):460-2.Dialysis access via a right ventricular assist device.Siskind MS(1), Rosado LJ, Brady L, Howell C, Duffy JP, Copeland JG.Author information: (1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arizona College of Medicine,Tucson.In this report, we describe the successful utilization of an external rightventricular assist device as vascular access for hemodialysis and continuousarteriovenous hemodialysis in a critically ill patient on biventricularmechanical assist support. Utilization of the right ventricular assist devicelines provided relatively easy and safe dialysis access and temporarily reducedthe risks associated with the conventional vascular access techniques.
