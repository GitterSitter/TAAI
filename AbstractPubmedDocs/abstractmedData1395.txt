DeBakey Department of Surgery, Division of Congenital HeartSurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. charlesf@bcm.tmc.eduMechanical circulatory support for both acute and chronic heart failure is awidely applied therapeutic option in the adult population with a variety ofdevices clinically available. Technology in this field has advanced sufficiently such that long-term support or "destination therapy" has become a generallyaccepted reality. Similar progress has not occurred in the field of devicesupport for heart failure in children. While the number of potential patients is significantly lower in the pediatric population, the clinical relevance andpoignancy of individual need are nonetheless real. Until recently, children with heart failure have been largely disadvantaged in comparison to their adultcounterparts. The DeBakey VAD Child (MicroMed Technology, Inc, Houston, TX)represents a hopeful initial step in the direction of reducing the technological gap between adults and children. While the clinical experience with this deviceis limited at present, preliminary results are encouraging. This report willprovide an overview of the DeBakey VAD Child, including device specifications,indications for clinical use, surgical and postoperative considerations, andupdated clinical experience.
