The use of mechanical assistance as a bridge to transplantationor a bridge to recovery are the main indications for mechanical circulatorysupport in infants and children. The problem of organ donor shortage is evenworse compared to the situation in the field of adult heart transplantations.Especially in Europe however, newly developed pulsatile, paracorporealventricular assist devices designed for long-term assist in children havedemonstrated their ability to provide excellent results beyond the abilities ofextracorporeal membrane oxygenation and centrifugal pumps, which are still themainstay of mechanical support in children worldwide. Especially in the group of the smallest patients, the use of the most appropriate form of circulatoryassistance has to be carefully considered as the co-incidence of respiratoryfailure as well as other complex physiological situations will severely influencethe outcome.
