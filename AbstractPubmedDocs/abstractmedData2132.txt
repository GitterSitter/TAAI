ASAIO Trans. 1989 Jul-Sep;35(3):547-50.Evaluation of right ventricular function during clinical left ventricularassistance.Kormos RL(1), Gasior T, Antaki J, Armitage JM, Miyamoto Y, Borovetz HS, Hardesty RL, Griffith BP.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15261.Hemodynamic and mechanical parameters of right ventricular (RV) performance were measured in eight patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) assistance as abridge to cardiac transplantation. All patients, even those with impaired RVperformance, survived support and transplantation. The reduction of LV afterload produced by the left ventricular assist system (LVAS) results in RV afterloadreduction, which permits even the marginal RV to function adequately during LVAS support.
