Although several clinical tests are in use, none accuratelydistinguish between patients with poor versus excellent survival. We hypothesizedthat a transcriptomic signature, generated from a single endomyocardial biopsy,could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker in HF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Endomyocardial biopsy samples and clinical data werecollected from all patients presenting with new-onset HF from 1997 to 2006. Amonga total of 350 endomyocardial biopsy samples, 180 were identified as idiopathicdilated cardiomyopathy. Patients with phenotypic extremes in survival wereselected: good prognosis (event-free survival for at least 5 years; n=25) andpoor prognosis (events [death, requirement for left ventricular assist device, orcardiac transplant] within the first 2 years of presentation with HF symptoms;n=18). We used human U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix) and analyzed the datawith significance analysis of microarrays and prediction analysis of microarrays.We identified 46 overexpressed genes in patients with good versus poor prognosis,of which 45 genes were selected by prediction analysis of microarrays forprediction of prognosis in a train set (n=29) with subsequent validation in test sets (n=14 each). The biomarker performed with 74% sensitivity (95% CI 69% to79%) and 90% specificity (95% CI 87% to 93%) after 50 random partitions.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential of transcriptomic biomarkers topredict prognosis in patients with new-onset HF from a single endomyocardialbiopsy sample. In addition, our findings offer potential novel therapeutictargets for HF and cardiomyopathy.PMCID: PMC3408076
