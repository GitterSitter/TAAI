TheDeBakey VAD, a continuous axial flow pump weighing 93 g, has been introduced intoclinical practice as a bridge to transplant.METHODS: Starting from April 2000,17 patients (12 males, five females, mean age44.3 +/- 12.8 years; 11 dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy, five ischaemiccardiomyopathy, one pulsatile device failure) with end-stage heart failure wereimplanted with a DeBakey VAD as a bridge to transplantation at our institution.Before implant, all patients suffered from severe heart failure (New York HeartAssociation functional class IV) despite optimal medical therapy and were put on the waiting list for heart transplantation. Mean cardiac index was 1.59 +/- 0.51 l/min/m2.RESULTS: Fourteen patients were successfully transplanted after 99 +/- 117 daysof assistance (range 11-443 days). Two patients died during assistance ofmultiorgan failure, one patient is still on VAD. No patient needed additionalright ventricular mechanical support. Left ventricular/left VAD thrombosisoccurred in one patient who was successfully treated conservatively. No clinical elevation of plasma free haemoglobin was detected. Neither device, driveline,abdominal pocket infection nor device failure occurred.CONCLUSIONS: In our experience with the continuous axial flow DeBakey VAD, a highsuccess rate was obtained associated with a low risk of complications. All thepatients tolerated continuous blood flow for extended periods that makes thisdevice a valuable alternative to pulsatile VADs as a bridge to transplantation.
