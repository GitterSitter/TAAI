Epub 2012 Apr 25.Transplant registrants with implanted left ventricular assist devices haveinsufficient risk to justify elective organ procurement and transplantationnetwork status 1A time.Dardas T(1), Mokadam NA, Pagani F, Aaronson K, Levy WC.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.tdardas@uw.eduOBJECTIVES: The goal of this research was to identify disparities in risk within heart transplant urgency designations.BACKGROUND: Patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are given 30days of elective status 1A time. This allowance may create competition for organsbetween stable LVAD-supported registrants and less stable registrants listedstatus 1A or 1B.METHODS: The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was analyzedfor all status 1A and 1B listings between 2005 and 2010. Cox models were used to estimate the relative and absolute risk of adverse events (death or delisting as too ill) during status 1A or 1B listing.RESULTS: Status 1A registrants supported with dual inotropes and right heartmonitoring had a higher risk of adverse events compared to those supported withimplanted LVADs using elective 1A time (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% confidenceinterval: 1.8 to 5.7). The 30-day risk of events was 1% (95% confidence interval:0.1% to 3%) for implanted LVADs using elective 1A time and 6% (95% confidenceinterval: 4% to 8%) for dual inotrope support. Registrants listed withparacorporeal ventricular assist devices had a higher risk of adverse events(hazard ratio: 9.1; p < 0.0001) compared with registrants with implanted LVADsusing elective 1A time. The odds of transplant were higher for implanted LVADs(odds ratio: 1.5; p < 0.0001) compared with dual-inotrope and intra-aorticballoon pump support.CONCLUSIONS: The historic allowance for 30 days of elective status 1A time forimplanted LVADs creates disparities in risk among status 1A registrants. Theallowance of 30 days of elective status 1A time should not be allocated to stableregistrants with implanted LVADs. Registrants supported with paracorporealventricular assist devices should be listed status 1A indefinitely.Copyright Â© 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by ElsevierInc.
