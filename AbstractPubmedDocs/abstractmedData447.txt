It can be used forlong-term support of the left and/or right ventricule during end-stage heartfailure. The aim of this study was to share our clinical experience in 54patients.METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, 54 patients with end-stage heartfailure underwent Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device implantation,including 5 females and 9 children. Twenty-four patients (44%) were in Intermacs level 1, 11 (21%) in level 2, and 19 (35%) in level 3. Biventricular support was applied to 13 patients. Device implantation was performed with an "on pump"beating heart technique while 6 other patients underwent intervention operations while the aortic valve has under cross-clamp. Tricuspid annuloplasty wasperformed in 6 patients.RESULTS: There was no peroperative death. Nine patients (17%) underwentre-exploration because of hemorrhage in the early postoperative period. Hearttransplantation was performed in 32 patients (59%), while 10 (19%) are stillunder pump support with a mean follow-up of 13 months. Although 1 wassuccessfully weaned from the system, 11 patients (20%) died during the support.Pump-head exchange was required 19 times in 17 patients because of visiblethrombus or fibrin deposit in the pump head or due to membrane rupture.DISCUSSION: The use of long-term paracorporeal assist devices has decreased inrecent years because of the increased popularity of implantable devices thatpermit longer survival and a better quality of life. We believe that the BerlinHeart EXCOR has a special role because it can be used in pediatric patients andespecially in critical conditions like Intermacs levels 1 and 2.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.
