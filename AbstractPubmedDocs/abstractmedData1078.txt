We present our experience with prolonged CentriMag (Levitronix, Waltham, Mass) support fortransitioning patients after successful salvage from bridge to decision directly to transplant.METHODS: Records of patients who underwent salvage with a CentriMag as bridge to decision and later to transplant were reviewed. Between June 2003 and June 2008, 4 patients in cardiogenic shock from acute decompensated end-stage heart failure and multiorgan dysfunction underwent salvage with biventricular CentriMag asbridge to decision. Three were male. Mean age was 39.3 years (range 24-52 years).Three had dilated cardiomyopathy; 1 had ischemic cardiomyopathy. All hadpreoperative mechanical ventilation, large doses of multiple inotropes, andintra-aortic balloon support. All also had acute liver and renal failure andmetabolic acidosis.RESULTS: After mean postimplant period of 43 days (range 7-70 days), patients hadreversal of end-organ dysfunction; after mean waiting time of 31 days (range21-67 days), all were transplant listed. Mean mechanical circulatory support was 87.7 days (range 26-105 days). No thromboembolic or neurologic events ormechanical failures occurred. Posttransplant mean ventilation and intensive care unit stay were 2 and 4 days (ranges 1-4 and 3-7 days), respectively. All patientswere discharged home and remain alive and well.CONCLUSION: CentriMag use as long as 3 months appears to be safe andcost-effective for bridging selected patients directly to transplant aftersalvage. Further clinical experience is still needed.
