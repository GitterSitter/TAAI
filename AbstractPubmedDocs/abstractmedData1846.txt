This report is a general overview of our experience. Ahypothetical cost analysis focusing on specific devices and device-relatedpersonnel contrasted the BVS 5000 with our prior model of centrifugal pump use.METHODS: In 3 years, 22 patients were supported with the BVS 5000, as abiventricular assist device in 40%, right ventricular assist device in 27%, andleft ventricular assist device in 32%. Indications were postcardiotomy support in12, acute myocarditis in 2, bridge to transplant in 4, and failed hearttransplant in 4. The cost analysis was performed retrospectively. The actual costof disposable blood pumps, including replacement pumps, and cannulae constituted the BVS cost. The hypothetical centrifugal costs included the disposables,replacement cones, as well as the labor costs of the continuous perfusionistcoverage.RESULTS: Of the 22 patients, 10 (45%) were weaned and 13 (59%) were successfully discharged. Five patients were transplanted while on BVS 5000 support, accountingfor a higher rate of discharge. Comparison of "actual" BVS costs with "projected"centrifugal costs revealed differences based upon the intended application of theBVS. In bridge-to-transplant patients with long duration of support, the dailycost of support was dramatically lower with the BVS 5000. For short-termpostcardiotomy support, acute myocarditis, or failed transplant, the differences were small.CONCLUSIONS: Because the BVS 5000 was readily managed by the intensive care unit nursing staff, this system displaced centrifugal systems in our program. Outcome measures of weaning and successful discharge were improved relative to our prior experience with centrifugal pumps. Even without taking indirect costs intoaccount, the hypothetical cost analysis supported continued use of the BVS systemfor acute cardiac assistance.
