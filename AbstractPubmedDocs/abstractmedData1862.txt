Randomized Evaluation ofMechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure.Rose EA(1), Moskowitz AJ, Packer M, Sollano JA, Williams DL, Tierney AR, Heitjan DF, Meier P, Ascheim DD, Levitan RG, Weinberg AD, Stevenson LW, Shapiro PA, LazarRM, Watson JT, Goldstein DJ, Gelijns AC.Author information: (1)International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research, ColumbiaUniversity, New York, New York 10032, USA.BACKGROUND: Because left ventricular assist devices have recently been approvedby the Food and Drug Administration to support the circulation of patients withend-stage heart failure awaiting cardiac transplantation, these devices areincreasingly being considered as a potential alternative to biologic cardiacreplacement. The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatmentof Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial is a multicenter study supported bythe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to compare long-term implantationof left ventricular assist devices with optimal medical management for patientswith end-stage heart failure who require, but do not qualify to receive cardiactransplantation.METHODS: We discuss the rationale for conducting REMATCH, the obstacles todesigning this and other randomized surgical trials, the lessons learned inconducting the multicenter pilot study, and the features of the REMATCH studydesign (objectives, target population, treatments, end points, analysis, andtrial organization).CONCLUSIONS: We consider what will be learned from REMATCH, expectations forexpanding the use of left ventricular assist devices, and future directions forassessing clinical procedures.
