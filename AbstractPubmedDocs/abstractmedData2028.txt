Cardiology. 1994;84(3):211-5.Use of left-ventricular assist with the Hemopump in cardiac surgery.Waldenberger FR(1), Wouters P, Wiebalck A, Flameng W.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.From July 1989 to May 1992 16 patients received circulatory support with aHemopump assist device in the Department of Cardiac Surgery of the KatholiekeUniversiteit Leuven. The mean age of those patients was 56 +/- 13 years (ranging from 23 to 72 years). The mean time of assisted circulation was 60 +/- 46 h(ranging from 2 to 168 h). Group I consists of 13 patients who received thedevice after postcardiotomy cardiac failure (survival 38%). Group II includes 1patient who received the pump prior to repair of a large postinfarctionventricular septal defect (survival 10%). Group III consists of 2 patients forwhom the Hemopump was used as a bridge to cardiac retransplantation. Both arestill alive (survival 100%). If the 21-F Hemopump is implanted following acritical indication it can be used rather successfully for mechanical circulatorysupport.
