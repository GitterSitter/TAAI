Ann Thorac Surg. 1991 Jun;51(6):987-91.Heterotopic heart transplantation and native heart ventricular arrhythmias.Kotliar C(1), Smart FW, Sekela ME, Pacifico A, Pratt CM, Noon GP, DeBakey ME,Young JB.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas.Heterotopic heart transplantation has been said to be contraindicated in patientswith serious native heart arrhythmias that produce hemodynamic instability.Placement of heterotopic allografts, however, can theoretically act as abiological biventricular assist device to provide hemodynamic support duringthese unstable rhythms. Further, this operation might beneficially alter thehemodynamic milieu of heart failure such that the arrhythmias are ameliorated.Described is our experience with 4 patients with heart failure receivingheterotopic cardiac allografts, documenting changes in native heart arrhythmiathat occurred. These cases demonstrate that heterotopic grafts can adequatelysustain hemodynamics during malignant native heart dysrhythmia. We believe nativeheart ventricular arrhythmias are not a contraindication to heterotopic hearttransplantation.
