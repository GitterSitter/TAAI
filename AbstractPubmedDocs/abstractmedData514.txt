We examined the differences in risk of adverse outcomes betweenLVAD-supported and medically managed candidates on the heart transplant waitinglist.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed mortality and morbidity in 33,073 hearttransplant candidates registered on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)waiting list between 1999 and 2011. Five groups were selected: patients withoutLVADs in urgency status 1A, 1B, and 2; patients with pulsatile-flow LVADs; andpatients with continuous-flow LVADs. Outcomes in patients requiring biventricularassist devices, total artificial heart, and temporary VADs were also analyzed.Two eras were defined on the basis of the approval date of the firstcontinuous-flow LVAD for bridge to transplantation in the United States (2008).Mortality was lower in the current compared with the first era (2.1%/mo versus2.9%/mo; P<0.0001). In the first era, mortality of pulsatile-flow LVAD patientswas higher than in status 2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15; P<0.0001) and similar tothat in status 1B patients (HR, 1.04; P=0.61). In the current era, patients with continuous-flow LVADs had mortality similar to that of status 2 (HR, 0.80;P=0.12) and lower mortality compared with status 1A and 1B patients (HR, 0.24 and0.47; P<0.0001 for both comparisons). However, status upgrade for LVAD-relatedcomplications occurred frequently (28%) and increased the mortality risk (HR,1.75; P=0.001). Mortality was highest in patients with biventricular assistdevices (HR, 5.00; P<0.0001) and temporary VADs (HR, 7.72; P<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and morbidity on the heart transplant waiting list havedecreased. Candidates supported with contemporary continuous-flow LVADs havefavorable waiting list outcomes; however, they worsen significantly once aserious LVAD-related complication occurs. Transplant candidates requiringtemporary and biventricular support have the highest risk of adverse outcomes.These results may help to guide optimal allocation of donor hearts.PMCID: PMC3752367
