Themedian duration of mechanical support was 387 days (IQR 150-600), with a range of1-1835 days. The 6-month, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year survival rates during HM II LVAD support were 85, 81, 76, 76 and 68%, respectively. Echocardiographic parametersdemonstrated effective left ventricular unloading, while laboratory resultsreflected adequate organ perfusion. However, HM II support was associated withadverse events, such as infections in 42 patients (49%; 0.67events/patient-year), cardiac arrhythmia in 44 (52%; 0.86 events/patient-year),bleeding complications in 32 (38%; 0.43 events/patient-year) and neurologicaldysfunction in 17 (20%; 0.19 events/patient-year).CONCLUSIONS: In view of the increasing shortage of donor hearts, HM II LVADsupport may be considered a life-saving treatment in end-stage HF patients, with good survival. However, it is still associated with some serious adverse events, of which neurological complications are the most critical.
