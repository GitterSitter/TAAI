To evaluate this problem, weanalyzed neurocognitive function and the frequency and incidence of neurologicevents in 21 consecutive patients who were undergoing long-term support with the HeartMate XVE LVAD (Thoratec Corporation; Pleasanton, Calif). The mean durationof LVAD support was 531 days (range, 55-1, 309 d); the cumulative support timewas 11,188 days (30.7 yr). No patients received anticoagulant therapy, and mostreceived aspirin. None experienced strokes or transient ischemic attacks. Twenty patients were discharged from the hospital; 2 were later readmitted because oftransient changes in neurologic status (metabolic encephalopathy) that ultimatelyresolved. Neurologic function, as measured by the National Institutes of HealthStroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Modified Rankin Score (MRS), was abnormal beforeLVAD implantation but normal 6 and 12 months after (mean NIHSS, 23.6 before vs 0 after; mean MRS, 0.68 before vs 0.18 after). Neurocognitive function, asevaluated by the Boston Naming Test, Trail Making Test part B, and Block DesignTest, also improved during LVAD support. Together, these findings indicate thatfew neurologic events occur during long-term HeartMate XVE LVAD support in theabsence of anticoagulation therapy. They also suggest that modifications made to the HeartMate LVAD since the REMATCH trial have resulted in fewer complications, and that better patient selection and supportive care have improved outcomes.PMCID: PMC2565527
