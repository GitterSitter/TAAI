Because the number ofavailable organs is insufficient, mechanical circulatory support systems such as VADs are also being developed for use in pediatric patients. During myocardialrecovery, the system must be weaned from the patient to prepare for explant; for pulsatile devices, this often includes a reduction in flow rate, which can changethe fluid dynamics of the device. These changes in flow need to be monitoredbecause strong diastolic rotational flow, no areas of blood stasis, low bloodresidence time, and wall shear rates above 500 s, can help prevent thrombusdeposition. Particle image velocimetry was used to observe the planar flowpatterns and wall shear rates of the 12 cc Penn State Pneumatic Pediatric VAD(PVAD) at a normal operating condition and a reduced beat rate. At the reducedbeat rate, the PVAD showed an earlier loss of rotational pattern, increased bloodresidence time, and an overall reduction in wall shear rate at the outer walls.Because this reduction in flow rate could lead to a possible increase in thrombusdeposition, it may be necessary to look into other options for weaning a patient from the PVAD.
