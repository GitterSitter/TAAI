All electrocardiograms of spontaneous andinduced VT were analyzed. Apical VT was defined as left bundle branch morphology with precordial transition ≥ V5 or right bundle branch morphology with precordialtransition ≤ V3. Scar percentage was defined as the area of low voltage dividedby the total surface area.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 76 patients had 1 or more apical VTs. Those with apicalVTs had larger percentage of endocardial and epicardial bipolar scars (14.9% vs8.1%, P = .01, and 15.5% vs 5.5%, P = .03, respectively), scar that, althoughoriginating from the periannular region (94.7% of the patients), was more likely to extend apically beyond the basal half (48.3% vs 24.4%, P = .05 endocardial,and 85.7% vs 25.9%, P = .07 epicardial), and worse transplant/LVAD-free survival during a mean follow-up of 332 days (P = .006).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NICM and apical VTs have larger voltage abnormalityextending as contiguous or patchy "scar" from the base further toward the apexand worse transplant/LVAD-free survival. Particular attention should be paid tooptimal heart failure management in these patients, with more guarded prognosis.Copyright © 2013 Heart Rhythm Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.
