In previousyears, the primary indication for MCS therapy supported bridge totransplantation. These early left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) sufferedsignificant adverse events, thereby limiting their prolonged use. With theintroduction of newer continuous flow LVADs, with lower morbidity, neurologicalevents, pump failure and the expanded indication use (i.e. destination therapy), the overall number of implanted patients has grown.SUMMARY: There has been a dramatic advancement of durability found in the second and third-generation, continuous flow LVADs, along with improved survival ratesin patients receiving these devices for destination therapy. MCS may soon become the treatment option of choice in refractory heart failure patients, especiallywith further evolution of less invasive approaches, smaller designs, and energysources.
