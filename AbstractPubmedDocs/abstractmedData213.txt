Of these, 588 (27%) underwent aconcomitant TVP. Inverse probability weighting based on propensity score was usedto adjust for differences between the LVAD alone and LVAD+TVP groups, andoutcomes were compared.RESULTS: Most patients in the LVAD+TVP group underwent an annuloplasty alone(81.1%). Concomitant TVP did not affect risk of post-operative right VADinsertion (risk ratio [RR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.36; p =0.4310) or death (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.68-1.33; p = 0.7658). However, TVP wasassociated with an increased risk for post-operative renal failure (RR, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.13-2.08; p = 0.0061), dialysis (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.03-2.15; p = 0.0339),reoperation (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.45; p = 0.0056), greater total transfusion requirement (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05; p = 0.0013), and hospital length ofstay > 21 days (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.16-1.43; p < 0.0001). Time on the ventilator and intensive care unit length of stay were also significantly prolonged for the LVAD+TVP group.CONCLUSIONS: Performing a concomitant TVP for continuous-flow LVAD patients with moderate to severe TR did not reduce early death or right VAD requirement and wasassociated with worse early post-operative outcomes. These data caution againstroutine concomitant TVP based solely on degree of pre-operative TR and suggestthat additional selection criteria are needed to identify those patients in whom concomitant TVP may prevent post-operative right ventricular failure.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
