The purpose of this study was to compare the functional capacity of patientsfollowing implantation of a LVAD vs heart transplant (HTx).METHODS: Eighteen patients from 6 centers who received an intracorporeal LVAD as a bridge to HTx underwent treadmill testing 1 to 3 months post-LVAD and againpost-HTx. Baseline and peak measurements, including oxygen consumption, bloodpressures, and respiratory rate were made during each treadmill test.RESULTS: Peak oxygen consumption was 14.5+/-3.9 ml/kg/minute post-LVAD and17.5+/-5.0 ml/kg/minute post-HTx (p < .005). The percentage of the predicted peakoxygen consumption based on gender, weight, and age was 39.5%+/-5.5% post-LVADand 47.7%+/-10.9% post-HTx (p < .005). Exercise duration was lower post-LVAD thanpost-HTx (10.3+/-4.2 minute vs 12.5+/-5.4 minute, p < .05). After LVADimplantation, peak total oxygen consumption correlated with peak LVAD rate andoutput. Eight patients reached an LVAD rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm) before the conclusion of exercise, the maximum rate for the outpatient electric device. The peak respiratory exchange ratio post-LVAD was 1.15+/-0.22 and post-HTx was1.15+/-0.18, consistent with a good effort in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrated a lower functional capacity post-LVAD thanpost-HTx. For some patients functional capacity post-LVAD may be improved by ahigher maximum LVAD rate and output.
