Patients with status 2(n=38) had a prognosis as poor as those dependent on inotropes (n=54) or MCS(n=91; P=0.615, log-rank test), and only 4 of them had eventual ventricularassist device (VAD) implantation (10.5%). Patients who eventually received VAD(n=92) had better 4-year survival than those without MCS among status 1 and 2(P=0.030, log-rank test). On Cox regression analysis plasma B-type natriureticpeptide (BNP) >740pg/ml was the only significant predictor for 4-year survivalamong the status 2 group (P=0.014; hazard ratio, 8.267). Ten patients with status2 died: 6 due to acute hemodynamic compromise and 4 due to ventricularfibrillation.CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis in status 2 patients was as poor as that of thosedependent on inotrope infusion or VAD, mostly because of out-of-hospital suddendeath without MCS. Status 2 patients with considerably high plasma BNP may begood candidates for continuous flow VAD therapy.
