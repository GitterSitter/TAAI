Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2004 Dec;6(6):471-479.Left Ventricular Assist Devices as Destination Therapy for End-stage HeartFailure.Stevenson LW(1).Author information: (1)Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital.In the therapy of advanced heart failure, left ventricular assist devicesrepresent an exciting new option. The role of mechanical circulatory support iscurrently limited predominantly by factors related to device durability. Thepopulation for whom mechanical circulatory support can be considered as permanenttherapy is defined by those for whom improvement in survival and clinicalfunction is expected from current devices. Reported device survival in the range of 50% at 1 year limits the present candidate population to those with greaterthan 50% mortality at 1 year, who are not eligible for cardiac transplantation,after which survival is 50% at 10 years. Even as we learn to identify thesepatients who are "sick enough" to warrant device placement and yet "well enough" to survive surgery, the devices and surgical techniques are evolving so that the outcomes are improving and the candidate population is expanding.
