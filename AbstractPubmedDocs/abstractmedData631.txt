Although extracorporeal membraneoxygenation is commonly used in infants and children, ventricular assist devices (VAD) provide a longer duration of support with fewer complications beforerecovery or as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx), as described herein.METHODS: This retrospective chart review of eight patients transplanted fromApril 2008 to December 2011, after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)implantation due to end-stage heart failure. Their mean age was 12 years (9-15 y)and mean body weight, 48 kg (20-78). All were New York Heart Associationfunctional class IV with mean left ventricular ejection fractions less than 15%.RESULTS: The six patients (75%) received HTx after a mean LVAD support durationof 43.2 days; 2 (25%) died before a suitable heart became available. Their meanduration of LVAD support was 30 days. There were 4 (50%) who experiencedclinically evident thromboembolic events: 3 (37.5%) cerebrovascular with 1mortality and 1 (12.5%) as acute limb ischemia. Transient hemodialysis wasperformed in 4 (50%). Bloodstream infection identified in 6 (75%) was controlled with intravenous antibiotics. Driveline infection identified in 4 (50%) wastreated successfully with local wound dressing changes and intravenousantibiotics. One 9-year-old boy died of rejection at 16 months aftertransplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the organ shortage, pediatric patients have a low chance to undergo HTx. VAD provides long-term support for children with end-stage heart failure before a suitable heart becomes available. A thromboembolic event remainsa major complication influencing their survival.Copyright Â© 2012. Published by Elsevier Inc.
