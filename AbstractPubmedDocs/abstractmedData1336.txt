Transplant Proc. 2006 Dec;38(10):3695-6.T-cell response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B is reduced among heart failurepatients on ventricular device support.Kimball P(1), Flattery M, Kasirajan V.Author information: (1)Department of Transplant Surgery, Medical College of Virginia Hospitals,Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA. pkimball@gems.vcu.eduInfections are the major complication among patients on left ventricular device(LVAD) support. One mechanism that may explain the elevated incidence ofinfection is a deficiency in cellular immunity after LVAD placement. To test thishypothesis, we evaluated the in vitro T-cell-proliferative and cytokine response following challenge with staphylococcal enterotoxin B in 14 LVAD and 6 non-LVADstable outpatients awaiting heart transplantation. Clinical outcome was followed for 12 months. Clinical outcome was poorer (P < .05) for LVAD vs non-LVADpatients. T-cell-proliferative response was lower (P = .002) for LVAD vs non-LVADpatients. Th1 cytokine expression was lower (P < .05) and Th2 cytokine expressionwas higher (P < .05) for LVAD vs non-LVAD patients. We conclude that LVADrecipients are hyporesponsive to superantigen challenge, indicating a depressedcellular immunity that may contribute to their increased susceptibility toinfections.
