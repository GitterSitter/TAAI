Primary and secondary care facilities are efficiently managed. Cardiacsurgical and interventional facilities, however, exist only in a small number of territories and are mainly privately funded and are only accessible to fewpatients. Patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) are given few optionsapart from palliative care or to seek treatment outside of the region.Transplantation remains the 'gold standard' therapy for ESHF. Establishing aCaribbean cardiac transplantation programme would require legislative andinfrastructure changes. Tissue rejection poses a problem and expensiveimmunosuppressants are needed. Mechanical assist devices are costly andassociated with complications such as haemorrhage, thrombosis and infections.Both forms of therapy require significant technical and financial investment and do not appear to be economically viable for the Caribbean. The use of thepatient's own skeletal muscle to perform biological cardiac assistance ispotentially the ideal alternative. The skeletal muscle is conditioned byelectrical stimulation to become fatigue resistant. It is then transposed andharnessed as an auxilliary circulatory pump. The required muscle stimulators are relatively inexpensive and the surgical techniques and postoperative care are notoverly demanding. We discuss the financial and research implications of treating patients from the Caribbean who have end-stage heart failure.
