Nevertheless, problems of embolic andbleeding complication, infections, and technical failure still inhibit successfulpermanent support. We analyzed the courses of 198 patients who were supported for>1 year by 12 different MCS devices. Of the 198 patients, 87 had first-generationMCS devices (pulsatile), 43 second-generation devices (nonpulsatile with standardbearings), and 68 third-generation devices (nonpulsatile with magnetic bearings),implanted between July 1994 and March 2009. The mean time on support of the totalgroup was ∼ 2 years (690 ± 321 [366-1,875] days). Of the first generation, 83patients (95%) could be discharged; in the second and third group, all patientscould be discharged. Rehospitalizations were observed in all patients. Reasonsfor readmission were coagulation disorders, wound infections, stroke, andtechnical failure. Seventy-seven patients received heart transplantation, 66 are still receiving support, 53 died, and two patients have been weaned from thedevice. All types of devices can be used for extended periods of time. Device-and nondevice-related rehospitalizations were observed in all three groups ofpatients. Close outpatient monitoring and support are crucial to ensure goodlong-term results.
