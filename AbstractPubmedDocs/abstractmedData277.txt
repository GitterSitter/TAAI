Inouye College of Pharmacy,University of Hawaii, Hilo, Hawaii.Durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have not only enhanced longevity but also conferred sustained improvements in quality of life, symptom control,and functional capacity in patients with medically refractory advanced heartfailure. Problems with device-related infection, bleeding, neurologic events,right-sided heart failure, and device malfunction have dominated the clinicalcare of patients living on mechanical support. Even as adoption of durable LVADs accelerated globally, we began to encounter a growing dilemma of pump malfunctioncaused by thrombosis. In early 2011, clinicians began to notice a spike in theincidence of pump thrombosis with the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton,CA) LVAD. By 2012, the problem of thrombosis in LVADs began to consume most ofthe scientific direction as centers and collaborative groups began to dissectthis nascent phenomenon. In this perspective, we describe the magnitude andimplications of pump thrombosis, discuss secular and management trends in thisunique population, attempt to dissect the problem at its root, offer guidance on surveillance and therapeutic principles, and outline issues that deserve ourimmediate and collaborative attention.Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published byInternational Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.
