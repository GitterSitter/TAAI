Little is known about theincidence, risk factors and outcomes of NA in large numbers of pediatric hearttransplant (HT) recipients.METHODS: Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) data were used to identifyall children <18 years of age in the U.S.A. who underwent HT from October 1999 toJanuary 2007. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify risk factorsfor NA and the effect on graft survival.RESULTS: Of 2,070 pediatric heart transplants performed the median age attransplant was 6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 13 years); 40% hadcongenital heart disease (CHD), 7% were re-transplants, 42% were non-white and43% had Medicaid insurance. Overall, 186 (9%) children had a report of NA at amedian age of 15 years with more than two-thirds of NA episodes occurring after12 years of age. Factors independently associated with NA were: adolescent age attransplant (hazard ratio [HR] 7.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 12,compared with infants); black race (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.3, compared withwhite); Medicaid insurance (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.7, compared with non-Medicaidinsurance); and ventilator or ventricular assist device (VAD) support attransplant. The risk of mortality conditional upon report of NA was 26% at 1 yearand 33% at 2 years.CONCLUSIONS: Medication NA is an important problem in pediatric HT recipients andis associated with high mortality. Adolescent age, black race, Medicaid insuranceand invasive hemodynamic support at transplant were associated with NA, whereastime on the wait list and gender were not. Targeted interventions among at-riskpopulations may be warranted.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
