Experimental studies have shown that RV function isderived from 2 sources: the free wall of the RV and the interventricular septum. Management of RV failure involves not only decreasing RV afterload, but alsooptimizing both contributions to RV function, which is best achieved byoptimizing developed systemic pressure. Techniques for managing the pulmonarycirculation and strategies for optimizing RV function in various clinicalsettings are presented.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
