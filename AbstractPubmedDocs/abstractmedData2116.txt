Kardiol Pol. 1990 Jan;33(1):58-65.[Experimental studies of assisted circulation using left-ventricular assistdevices with the pneumatic system (LVAD)].[Article in Polish]Stopczyk MJ(1), Jaworski JL, Granas-Olewi≈Ñski MW, Peczalski K.Author information: (1)Instytutu Kardiologii.The results of short-term (acute) studies of assisting artificially produced(reversible) left ventricle insufficiency with an artificial, pneumaticallydriven left ventricle are discussed. Both mechanical left ventricle and drivingdevices are of Polish manufacture. The studies involved mongrel dogs and sheepand were fully hemodynamically and biochemically monitored. The results obtained with each design of the device were given to the producers. It seems that recent models are near to clinically acceptable ones and enable to assist left cardiacventricle for a short time preceding elective transplantation of the heart.
