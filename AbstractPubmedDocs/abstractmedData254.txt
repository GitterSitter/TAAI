There has been interest in understanding whether pre-operative frailtyis associated with worse outcomes after implantation of a left ventricular assistdevice (LVAD) as destination therapy.METHODS: Patients undergoing LVAD implantation as destination therapy at the MayoClinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from February 2007 to June 2012, were included inthis study. Frailty was assessed using the deficit index (31 impairments,disabilities and comorbidities) and defined as the proportion of deficitspresent. We divided patients based on tertiles of the deficit index (>0.32 =frail, 0.23 to 0.32 = intermediate frail, <0.23 = not frail). Cox proportionalhazard regression models were used to examine the association between frailty anddeath. Patients were censored at death or last follow-up through October 2013.RESULTS: Among 99 patients (mean age 65 years, 18% female, 55% with ischemicheart failure), the deficit index ranged from 0.10 to 0.65 (mean 0.29). After amean follow-up of 1.9 Â± 1.6 years, 79% of the patients had been rehospitalized(range 0 to 17 hospitalizations, median 1 per person) and 45% had died. Compared with those who were not frail, patients who were intermediate frail (adjusted HR 1.70, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.31) and frail (HR 3.08, 95% CI 1.40 to 7.48) were atincreased risk for death (p for trend = 0.004). The mean (SD) number of daysalive out of hospital the first year after LVAD was 293 (107) for not frail, 266 (134) for intermediate frail and 250 (132) for frail patients.CONCLUSIONS: Frailty before destination LVAD implantation is associated withincreased risk of death and may represent a significant patient selectionconsideration.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
