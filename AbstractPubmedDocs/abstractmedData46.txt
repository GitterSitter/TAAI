Epub 2015 Jan 23.A new era of ventricular assist device surgery: less invasive procedures.Rojas SV(1), Avsar M, Uribarri A, Hanke JS, Haverich A, Schmitto JD.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation, and Vascular Surgery HannoverMedical School, Hannover, Germany - schmitto.jan@mh-hannover.de.As the number of patients suffering of congestive heart failure is risingworldwide, the use of mechanical circulatory support to treat these patients has also grown enormously, surpassing the number of annual heart transplants.Moreover latest generation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) ischaracterized by improved technologies. Moreover the size of new LVAD systems is considerably reduced when compared to older generation devices. Therefore, lessinvasive surgery is now possible for the implantation, explantation, and exchangeof LVADs. Although experience with these new techniques is still limited,minimally invasive procedures are thought to improve surgical outcomes bydeclining the rates of operative complications such as bleeding or woundinfection. The miniaturization of LVADs will continue, so that minimally invasivetechniques will be used for most LVAD-related procedures in the future. In thisarticle, we summarize and describe minimally invasive surgical techniques, with afocus on the most common LVAD systems in adults.
