The first 40 patients were assessedto determine the accuracy of Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiographyparameters to estimate hemodynamics and to derive a diagnostic algorithm fordiscrimination between mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤15 versus >15mm Hg. Ten patients served as a validation cohort.RESULTS: Doppler echocardiographic and invasive measures of mean right atrialpressure (RAP) (r = 0.863; p < 0.0001), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP)(r = 0.880; p < 0.0001), right ventricular outflow tract stroke volume (r =0.660; p < 0.0001), and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.643; p = 0.001)correlated significantly. Several parameters, including mitral ratio of the earlyto late ventricular filling velocities >2, RAP >10 mm Hg, sPAP >40 mm Hg, leftatrial volume index >33 ml/m(2), ratio of mitral inflow early diastolic fillingpeak velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity >14, and pulmonaryvascular resistance >2.5 Wood units, accurately identified patients withpulmonary capillary wedge pressure >15 mm Hg (area under the curve: 0.73 to0.98). An algorithm integrating mitral inflow velocities, RAP, sPAP, and leftatrial volume index was 90% accurate in distinguishing normal from elevated left ventricular filling pressures.CONCLUSIONS: Doppler echocardiography accurately estimated intracardiachemodynamics in these patients supported with CF-LVAD. Our algorithm reliablydistinguished normal from elevated left ventricular filling pressures.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by ElsevierInc. All rights reserved.
