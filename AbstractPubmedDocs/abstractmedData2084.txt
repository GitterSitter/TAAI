ASAIO Trans. 1991 Jul-Sep;37(3):M287-8.Univentricular support results in reduction of pulmonary resistance and improved right ventricular function.Gallagher RC(1), Kormos RL, Gasior T, Murali S, Griffith BP, Hardesty RL.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,Pennsylvania.A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the effects of univentricularsupport on the transpulmonary gradient (TPG), pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR), total pulmonary resistance (TPR), and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) in 16 patients who spent from 2 to 144 days (mean, 61) on the Novacor leftventricular assist system ([LVAS] Novacor Corp., Baxter Healthcare, Oakland, CA) as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Results revealed a significant reduction in the TPR, and improvement in RVEF while patients were on the LVAS. Afterorthotopic heart transplantation (OHTx), TPG and PVR were significantly lowerthan when calculated before support. It was concluded, therefore, that thereduction in the TPR and the improvement in the RVEF, seen in patients who wereprovided univentricular support with the Novacor LVAS, are associated with asignificant reduction in the TPG and the PVR, which are persistent after OHTx.Four patients who otherwise would have been considered at higher risk for OHTxbecause of elevated pulmonary resistance before veniventricular support underwentsuccessful OHTx after LVAS support.
