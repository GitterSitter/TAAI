This retrospective reviewanalyzed their perioperative anesthetic care.RESULTS: All patients had end-stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. We used invasive arterial and central venous pressure monitoring andintraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in conjunction with intravenousadministration of either ketamine (1 mg/kg) and midazolam (n = 3) or thiopental(3-5 mg/kg; n = 7). The mean intraoperative fentanyl dose was 434 ± 264.27 μg.Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. Dopamine, dobutamine, and epinephrinewere infused in 8, 10, and 5 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric oxide wasadministered to all patients. The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh frozenplasma, and thrombocyte suspension transfusions were be 2.3 ± 0.82 (range, 1-4), 1.6 ± 0.69 (range, 1-3), and 2.4 ± 1.42 (range, 0-4) units, respectively. Onaverage, patients were extubated 23 hours after arrival in the intensive careunit and exited there on day 6. Six patients were successfully bridged to hearttransplantation, 2 died during the follow-up, and 2 patients remain on VADsupport.CONCLUSION: VAD is increasingly being used as a bridge to heart transplantationin the pediatric population. Anesthesiologists must be vigilant about thepathophysiology of heart failure, the operative procedure, and the implanteddevice.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
