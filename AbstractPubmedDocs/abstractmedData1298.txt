Curr Cardiol Rep. 2007 May;9(3):194-9.The financial burden of destination left ventricular assist device therapy: whoand when?Bieniarz MC(1), Delgado R.Author information: (1)Texas Heart Institute, 6624 Fannin, Suite 2420, Houston, TX 77030, USA.Heart failure continues to be an economic health care burden of profoundproportion. The disease in its end stage has limited therapeutic options.Transplantation is limited by the number of available organs. Mechanical assisttherapy has continued to be an increasingly feasible strategy for bridgingpatients to heart transplantation but is also now used in place oftransplantation. The REMATCH trial was the first trial to document the failure ofmedical therapy in end-stage heart failure when compared with mechanical support.However, one of the primary concerns is the marked expense involved with thisinvasive therapy. As the cost of ventricular assist devices (VADs) fordestination therapy has been appraised in the medical literature, and throughexamination of patients who have been implanted in the "post-REMATCH era," asubset of patients has emerged in whom VAD implantation is futile, as well asanother subset that clearly benefits both in quality of life as well as inmortality. We review the current literature on VAD feasibility for destinationtherapy as well as ongoing trends in careful patient selection to improveoutcomes and, implicitly, cost benefit of VAD therapy.
