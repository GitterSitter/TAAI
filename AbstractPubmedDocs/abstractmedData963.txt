The aim ofthis case study was to describe changes in physical work capacity following 9months of LVAD support.CLINICAL CASE: The patient described here was diagnosed with idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy and demonstrated worsening heart failure over a 5-year period witha maximum left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 8.99 cm and an ejectionfraction of 15% to 25%. Upon implantation of an LVAD, central hemodynamicfunction improved and the device was removed after 9 months of support. Leftventricular diastolic and systolic diameter decreased by 39.8% and more than 30%,respectively. The left atrium decreased by 21.7% and ejection fraction wasmaintained by the LVAD and stabilized at 20%. Four months postexplantation, acycle ergometry graded cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed. Exercisebegan at 0 W and increased 25 W per 3-minute stage.RESULTS: The patient showed improvement in peak aerobic capacity when compared topre-LVAD cardiopulmonary stress tests. Peak oxygen uptake increased from pre-LVADmeasures of 11.8 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) to 17.0 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1). Time tomaximal exertion increased from 5 minutes 27 seconds to 15 minutes.CONCLUSION: Results of this case study indicate that significant improvements in native heart function leading to an increased ability to perform work is possiblefollowing a period of mechanical unloading through LVAD support.
