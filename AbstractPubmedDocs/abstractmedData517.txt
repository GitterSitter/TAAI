KSundareswaran@thoratec.comThe primary objective of this study was to evaluate bearing wear during clinical use of the HeartMate II (HMII) left ventricular assist device. Bearings obtained from HMII pumps explanted after clinical use in the Destination Therapy andBridge to Transplantation clinical trials were analyzed for wear using surfaceprofilometry. Geometric profile variations measured on the inlet bearing ballwere used to calculate the wear. Bearing wear was normalized to the total pumpsupport duration to obtain an annualized bearing wear rate. Bearing life wasestimated assuming a linear wear rate, as the time to reach a wear limit of 25µm, which includes a 3× safety factor, to ensure that there is no contact betweenthe rotor blades and the blood bore housing. One hundred and eighty-threebearings from left ventricular assist devices implanted in 181 patients wereanalyzed. Average age of the patients was 56.3 ± 14.6 years, 76% were male, 46%had an ischemic etiology of heart failure. Mean support duration for the pumpswas 363 ± 349 days (median: 238, range: 1-1,621 days). Sixty pumps (33%) wereexplanted at heart transplantation, 20 (11%) after device replacement, 6 (3%) forventricular recovery, 94 (51%) after patient death, and 3 (2%) were explanted forother reasons. Mean bearing wear was 0.59 ± 0.37 µm (median: 0.46 µm [5-95%interval: 0.25-1.48]). The median bearing wear rate for patients supported for atleast 1 year was 0.30 [5-95% interval: 0.09-0.94] µm/yr. The 5-95% limits of the bearing wear rate corresponded to an estimated bearing life between 27 and 269years. The pump having the highest bearing wear rate (1.46 µm/yr) had anestimated bearing life of at least 17 years. HMII bearing wear is extremelysmall, with an estimated bearing life well in excess of 17 years; it is not alimiting factor for long-term support with the HMII left ventricular assistivesystem.
