We sought to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and short- andlong-term all-cause mortality of patients with AKI following VAD implantation.METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent VAD implantation at theUniversity of Chicago between January 1, 2008, and January 31, 2012. We evaluatedthe incidence of AKI, defined as a â‰¥50% increase in serum creatinine over thefirst 7 postoperative days (RIFLE Risk-Creatinine). A logistic regression modelwas used to identify risk factors for the development of AKI, and a Coxproportional hazards model was used to examine factors associated with 30-day and365-day all-cause mortality.RESULTS: A total of 157 eligible patients had VAD implantations with 44 (28%)developing postimplantation AKI. In a multivariate analysis, only diabetesmellitus [odds ratio = 2.25 (1.03-4.94), p = 0.04] was identified as asignificant predictor of postoperative AKI. Using a multivariable model censored for heart transplantation, only AKI [hazard ratio, HR = 3.01 (1.15-7.92), p =0.03] and cardiopulmonary bypass time [HR = 1.01 (1.001-1.02), p = 0.02] wereindependent predictors of 30-day mortality. Preoperative body mass index [HR =0.95 (0.90-0.99), p = 0.03], preoperative diabetes mellitus [HR = 1.89(1.07-3.35), p = 0.03] and postimplantation AKI [HR = 1.85 (1.06-3.21), p = 0.03]independently predicted 365-day mortality.CONCLUSION: AKI is common following VAD implantation and is an independentpredictor of 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality.PMCID: PMC4000722
