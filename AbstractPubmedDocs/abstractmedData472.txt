RV deformationanalysis by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) has recently allowed a deeperanalysis of RV longitudinal function. The aim of the study was to observe RVfunction by STE in patients with advanced heart failure before and after LVADimplantation.METHODS: Transthoracic echo Doppler was performed in 10 patients referred forLVAD therapy at baseline and with serial echocardiograms after LVAD implantation.In a sub-group of 4 patients, an echocardiographic evaluation was also made afterintra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support was initiated and before LVADimplantation. All echocardiographic images were analyzed off-line to calculatethe free wall RV longitudinal strain (RVLS).RESULTS: Three patients who presented the lowest free wall RVLS values atbaseline, showed a progressive decline of RVLS after LVAD implant, presentingfinally RV failure; however, patients with higher values of RVLS at baselinepresented a further and overt increase of strain values in the course offollow-up. The overall performance for the prediction of RV failure after LVADimplant was greatest for free wall RVLS (area under the curve, 0.93). For thesub-group receiving the IABP as an intermediate step, only 2 patients with anincrease of RVLS after IABP implantation also showed an increase of RVLS levels, after subsequent LVAD implantation. The 2 patients without an increase of RVLSafter IABP implantation also presented with RV failure after LVAD therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study of 10 patients indicates that the new parameter of RVLS, representing RV myocardial deformation, may have important clinical implications for the selection and management of LVAD patients. A large multicenter study isrequired to confirm these observations and to quantify the clinical significance of changes in RVLS value.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
