Participants weredivided into 3 categories based on echocardiograms: HF-REF if EF was <50%, HF-PEFif EF was consistently ≥50%, and HF-Recovered if EF on enrollment in PHFS was≥50% but prior EF was <50%. A significant portion of HF-Recovered patients had anabnormal biomarker profile at baseline, including 44% with detectable troponin I,although in comparison, median levels of brain natriuretic factor, solublefms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1, troponin I, and creatinine were greater inHF-REF and HF-PEF patients. In unadjusted Cox models over a maximum follow-up of 8.9 years, the hazard ratio for death, transplantation, or ventricular assistdevice placement in HF-REF patients was 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-6.8;P<0.001) and in HF-PEF patients was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.5;P=0.013) compared with HF-Recovered patients. The unadjusted hazard ratio forcardiac hospitalization in HF-REF patients was 2.0 (95% confidence interval,1.5-2.7; P<0.001) and in HF-PEF patients was 1.3 (95% confidence interval,0.90-2.0; P=0.15) compared with HF-Recovered patients. Results were similar inadjusted models.CONCLUSIONS: HF-Recovered is associated with a better biomarker profile andevent-free survival than HF-REF and HF-PEF. However, these patients still haveabnormalities in biomarkers and experience a significant number of HFhospitalizations, suggesting persistent HF risk.© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.PMCID: PMC4053508 [Available on 2015-06-10]
