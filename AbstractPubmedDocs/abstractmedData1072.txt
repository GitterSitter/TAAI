Epub 2009 Jul 16.Left ventricular assist devices.Birks EJ(1).Author information: (1)Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, Harefield, Middlesex UB9 6JH, UK.e.birks@imperial.ac.ukLeft ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion in patients with advanced heartfailure with deteriorating clinical status is life saving, and LVADs are nowbeing inserted into an increasing number of patients with advanced heart failure.They were initially inserted as a bridge to transplantation, and the decreasedavailability of donor hearts means that an increasing number of patients arerequiring LVAD support for survival when their clinical status deteriorates.There is strong evidence that with LVAD unloading, particularly when combinedwith pharmacological treatment, the patients' myocardial function can alsorecover, allowing device removal and avoiding the need for transplantation,immunosuppression and its associated complications. This indication, known as"bridge to recovery" is a newer and expanding indication. The future use ofLVADs, particularly as survival continues to increase, is extending to theirwider use as destination therapy, when the device is inserted lifelong as analternative to transplantation, and this role is likely to increase further. LVADtechnology is evolving quickly, survival is improving, the incidence ofcomplications is decreasing and durability of the devices is improving.
