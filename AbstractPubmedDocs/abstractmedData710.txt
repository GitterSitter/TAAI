The incidence of right ventricular dysfunction after leftventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation that fails to resolve in theoperating room is reported to be as frequent as 20% to 50% and imposes aconsiderable burden in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Shouldthis syndrome supervene, the mortality of an LVAD operation increases from 19% to43%. Although most patients can be maintained with prolonged inotropic support,10% to 15% may require implantation of a separate right ventricular supportdevice.Copyright Â© 2011.
