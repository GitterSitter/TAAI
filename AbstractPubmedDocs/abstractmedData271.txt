Anti-coagulation strategiesused to treat this complication are empiric and without firm data for guidance.The addition of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to intravenousanti-coagulation has been suggested by several case series and recent guidelines.The aim of this study was to evaluate our use of eptifibatide for the treatmentof suspected pump thrombus/thrombosis.METHODS: This retrospective, single-center cohort study was performed atBarnes-Jewish Hospital. The medical informatics system was queried to identifyall LVAD patients who received eptifibatide for suspected pumpthrombus/thrombosis from January 1, 2011, through April 30, 2013.RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (16 HeartMate II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], 1HeartWare [HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA]) with 22 separateadministration attempts received eptifibatide (dose range, 0.1-2 Î¼g/kg/min) forsuspected pump thrombus/thrombosis presenting as one or more of the followingfindings: elevated lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, elevated plasma free hemoglobin, LVAD dysfunction, or new, persistently high LVAD power. The meantime from device implantation to eptifibatide therapy was 47.34 days (range,3.88-397.67 days). Of the 22 attempts, 5 (22.7%) resulted in resolution of 1 ormore patient-specific indicators of LVAD thrombus/thrombosis. Three patients(17.6%) had resolution of an indicator while also remaining free from continuedhemolysis, death, pump exchange, or emergent heart transplant. Bleeding eventswere common, with 11 patients (64.7%) experiencing bleeding during the infusion. Seven patients (41.2%) died, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage as the cause ofdeath in 2 patients. Pump exchange was performed in 3 patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our limited experience indicates the risk of using eptifibatideoutweighs the proposed benefit of salvaging the existing LVAD in the setting ofsuspected pump thrombus/thrombosis at our institution.Published by International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation onbehalf of International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
