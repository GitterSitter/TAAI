This study reviews thepopulation-based provincial experience in British Columbia.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the prospectively maintaineddatabase. Impella devices were inserted for acute cardiogenic shock refractory tomaximal therapy, as a bridge to decision or to long-term mechanical support.RESULTS: Between August 2007 and September 2009, 35 patients received 37 Impella devices (Impella LP 2,5, n=2; Impella LP 5,0, n=29; and Impella RD 5.0, n=6)(Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA). Devices were inserted in the setting of dilatedcardiomyopathy (n=13), acute myocardial infarction (n=6), postcardiotomy shock(n=6), and other etiologies (n=12). Mean age was 53.0±13.7 years. Mean leftventricular ejection fraction was 19±9% at the time of insertion. Nineteenpatients required aggressive resuscitation, all patients were on inotropicsupport, 97% of patients were intubated, and 46% of patients received mechanical circulatory support prior to insertion of the Impella devices. Mean duration ofsupport was 3.7±3.0 days. In all, 49% were successfully weaned, and 22% weretransferred to long-term mechanical support. Four patients have subsequentlyundergone successful cardiac transplantation. The 30-day mortality was 40%, and6-month mortality was 49%. Complications included gastrointestinal bleeding(n=1), hemoptysis (n=1), and thrombocytopenia (n=4). There were no cardiovascularor cerebrovascular events.CONCLUSION: Temporary support with Impella microaxial ventricular assist devices adds a valuable therapeutic option in selected patients with acute decompensated heart failure.Copyright © 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
