Epub 2013 Jun 14.Preservation of left ventricular function and morphology in volume-loaded versus volume-unloaded heterotopic heart transplants.Didié M(1), Biermann D, Buchert R, Hess A, Wittköpper K, Christalla P, Döker S,Jebran F, Schöndube F, Reichenspurner H, El-Armouche A, Zimmermann WH.Author information: (1)Institute of Pharmacology, University Medical Center Göttingen and DeutschesZentrum für Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung, partner site Göttingen, Germany;Total mechanical unloading of the heart in classical models of heterotopic heart transplantation leads to cardiac atrophy and functional deterioration. Incontrast, partial unloading of failing human hearts with left ventricular (LV)assist devices (LVADs) can in some patients ameliorate heart failure symptoms.Here we tested in heterotopic rat heart transplant models whether partialvolume-loading (VL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonary artery of donor to left atrium of donor, superior vena cava of donor to inferior vena cava of recipient; n = 27) is superior to the classical model of myocardial unloading (UL; anastomoses: aorta of donor to aorta of recipient, pulmonaryartery of donor to inferior vena cava of recipient; n = 14) with respect topreservation of ventricular morphology and function. Echocardiography, magneticresonance imaging, and LV-pressure-volume catheter revealed attenuated myocardialatrophy with ~30% higher LV weight and better systolic contractile function in VLcompared with UL (fractional area shortening, 34% vs. 18%; maximal change inpressure over time, 2,986 ± 252 vs. 2,032 ± 193 mmHg/s). Interestingly, nodifferences in fibrosis (Picrosirus red staining) or glucose metabolism(2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET) between VL and UL were observed. Weconclude that the rat model of partial VL attenuates atrophic remodelling andshows superior morphological as well as functional preservation, and thus should be considered more widely as a research model.
