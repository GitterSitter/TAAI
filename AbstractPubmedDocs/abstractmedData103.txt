However, expansion of this technology is still limited bycomplications that impact morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is essential toidentify and optimize modifiable predictors of poor outcomes. One such predictor may be hypertension (HTN). Not only may chronic HTN as a traditionalcardiovascular risk factor be present during long-term LVAD support, but HTN may also contribute to device malfunction or device-associated complications.Although current guidelines identify blood pressure (BP) control as important to outpatient continuous flow (CF) LVAD management, there is no evidence base tosupport these guidelines. Indeed, our comprehensive literature search did notidentify any studies that evaluated post-device implantation HTN as a potentialpredictor of adverse CF-LVAD outcomes. HTN among CF-LVAD patients is likely arelatively unstudied factor because of difficulties using standard noninvasivetechniques to measure BP in the setting of reduced pulsatile flow. Fortunately,recent research has elucidated the meaning of Doppler BP measurements andvalidated a slow-cuff deflation system for BP measurements in the setting ofCF-LVAD support. Therefore, CF-LVAD researchers and clinicians may (1) considerpotential mechanisms relating HTN to poor outcomes, (2) realize that HTNmanagement is a stated goal despite scarce evidence, and (3) utilize the newreliable and valid methods for outpatient BP measurement that make research andmanagement possible. It is critical and now feasible that research on HTN in the CF-LVAD patient population move forward.PMCID: PMC4385742 [Available on 2016-05-01]
