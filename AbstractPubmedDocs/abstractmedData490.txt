Nat Rev Cardiol. 2013 Oct;10(10):559.Right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex problem with poor outcomes. Diagnosisrequires a high degree of clinical suspicion, because many of the signs andsymptoms of this condition are nonspecific and can be acute or chronic.Identification of the underlying aetiology, which can include pulmonaryhypertension, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, congenital or valvular heartdisease, and sepsis, is essential. Echocardiography is the technique of choicefor first-line assessment, but cardiac MRI is the current gold standard foranatomical and functional assessment of the right ventricle. Therapy for RVfailure should be directed at the underlying cause, although management ofsymptoms is also important. Therapeutic options range from pharmacologicaltreatment to mechanical RV support and heart transplantation. The complex 3Dgeometry of the right ventricle and its intricate interactions with the leftventricle have left many questions about RV failure unanswered. However,promising new targeted therapies are under development and mechanical support is becoming increasingly feasible. The next decade will be an exciting time foradvances in our understanding and management of RV failure.
