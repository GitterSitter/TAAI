Continuous-flow rotary LVADs have been developed in the hopes ofdelivering circulatory support in a more durable manner with fewer device-relatedcomplications. The HeartMate(®) II continuous-flow left ventricular assist system(LVAS; Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) has become the standard of carefor heart failure patients who require long-term mechanical circulatory support. The efficacy of the HeartMate II has been demonstrated in patients wheretemporary support with an LVAD is needed until a suitable donor organ can befound for transplant (termed 'bridge to transplantation'), as well as forterminally-ill heart failure patients who are not candidates for transplant('destination therapy'). When directly compared with a pulsatile LVAD, theimplantation of a HeartMate II LVAS resulted in an overall improvement insurvival with a reduction in the number of device-related complications andadverse events. The purpose of this article is threefold: to describe the historyof the development of continuous-flow LVADs; to describe the technology of theHeartMate II; and, finally, to review the clinical outcomes in patients who have been implanted with the device.
