We evaluated the association of renal function andinotrope versus CF-LVAD support on posttransplant graft survival in status 1Bpatients.METHODS: The Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for posttransplant survival in status 1B patients bridged with inotropes orCF-LVAD who underwent transplantation between 2003 and 2012. Pretransplant renal function was measured by estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and wasstratified as less than 45 mL · min(-1) · 1.73 m(-2), 45 to 59, and 60 orgreater. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were usedto evaluate the main effects of GFR strata and inotropes versus CF-LVAD, and the interaction effect of GFR strata by CF-LVAD, on graft survival.RESULTS: This study included 4,158 status 1B patients (74% male, aged 53 ± 12years). Of those, 659 patients had a CF-LVAD (HeartMate-II [Thoratec, Pleasanton,CA], n = 638; HVAD [HeartWare, Framingham, MA], n = 21), and 3,530 were receivinginotropes (31 CF-LVAD patients were also receiving inotropes). Kaplan-Meieranalyses demonstrated reduced graft survival (p = 0.022) in patients withpretransplant GFR less than 45 versus GFR 45 to 59 (p = 0.062) and versus GFR 60 or greater (p = 0.007), and no effect of inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on graftsurvival (p = 0.402). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, after adjustingfor the main effects of GFR stratum, CF-LVAD, and inotropes, status 1B patientsbridged with a CF-LVAD and GFR in the lowest stratum had reduced graft survival(interaction effect p = 0.040).CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant renal insufficiency was associated with reducedposttransplant graft survival in status 1B patients. This risk is increased forpatients bridged with a CF-LVAD (versus inotropes) who have GFR in the loweststratum.Copyright © 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
