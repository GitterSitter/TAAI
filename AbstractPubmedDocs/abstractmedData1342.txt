In the setting of acute renalfailure, percutaneous catheters are placed for hemodialysis and/orultrafiltration. Incorporation of an ultrafiltration or hemodialysis system inthe Abiomed BVS5000 VAD circuit is a simple maneuver that eliminates the need foran additional catheter, thereby reducing the vascular and infectiouscomplications associated with these catheters. We recommend splicing connectorsinto the outflow tubing of the right VAD circuit for attachment to anultrafiltration or hemodialysis unit. This technique is a safe, simple, andreliable method by which to perform intermittent or continuous ultrafiltration orhemodialysis.
