Aso-called Mechanical Heart, HeartMate 1, was to replace a failing left ventricle so that the patient could be resuscitated and await heart transplantation. Theaim of the present study is to describe the results of this new treatment inDenmark.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 patients with a mean age of 41 years weretreated with the HeartMate 1 system in the period 1998 to 2006. Two patients had the system changed to a new HeartMate 1 due to mechanical problems. Both patientswere later successfully heart transplanted. A third patient had the systemsuccessfully changed to a HeartMate 2 and he is waiting for a donor heart.RESULTS: Hemodynamic observations reveal fast improvement after implantation ofthe HeartMate system. Patients who were later heart transplanted had theHeartMate system implanted for a mean of 220 days. About 90% of those that weretransplanted later improved due to the system from New York Heart Associationsclass IV to class I-II and they could often be discharged to a normal social lifewith a well-functioning HeartMate. Calculated 1-year survival with the HeartMate system was 82%.CONCLUSION: Patients with terminal heart failure can be treated and improved byimplantation of the HeartMate system and await successful heart transplantation. Permanent advanced assist systems do exist today and these can be applied as afinal treatment in selected patients--so-called destination therapy withmechanical circulatory support. The present study shows that it is very likelythat the Heart Centre at the Danish National University Hospital will be able to establish a well-functioning programme for destination therapy.
