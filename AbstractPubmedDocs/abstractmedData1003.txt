Left ventricularassist devices (LVADs) improve pulmonary hemodynamics, but our understanding ofthe degree of improvement and the effect on outcomes is still evolving.METHODS: We reviewed invasive pulmonary hemodynamics from 58 consecutive patientsreceiving LVAD support as a bridge to HTx from 1996 to 2003. The primary outcome was change in baseline transpulmonary gradient (TPG) during LVAD support andafter HTx/recovery. The secondary outcome was post-HTx survival.RESULTS: All patients (age, 49 +/- 14 years, 79% male, 40% ischemic) received apulsatile LVAD (median support, 97 days; interquartile range [IQR], 31-222).Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline (median, 1 day; IQR, 1-3),during early (median, 1 day; IQR, 0-4) and late (median, 75 days; IQR, 24-186)LVAD support, and after HTx/recovery (median, 28 days; IQR, 17-40). Improvementin TPG occurred throughout LVAD support and was sustained after HTx/recovery.Levels of TPG reductions in patients with a baseline TPG in the highest quartile (14.1-26.0 mm Hg) were 8.6 +/- 3.5 vs 6.5 +/- 3.1 mm Hg in the lowest quartile(2.0-7.7 mm Hg) during LVAD support (p = 0.102), with 90% vs 100% 30-day post-HTxsurvival (P = 0.113).CONCLUSION: Pulmonary hemodynamics and post-HTx survival were similar afterpulsatile LVAD support in patients with and without pre-implant PH. LVAD support may be a useful strategy to reverse PH in carefully selected patients, thusimproving candidacy for HTx.PMCID: PMC3066206
