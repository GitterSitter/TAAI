Semin Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 2007 Sep;11(3):185-204.Current status of mechanical circulatory assistance.Stone ME(1).Author information: (1)Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029-6574, USA.marc.stone@mountsinai.orgMechanical circulatory support has become an increasingly used managementstrategy for patients with both acute and chronic ventricular failure. Thisarticle briefly reviews the current state of mechanical circulatory support with a focus on indications, contraindications, and complications of currentlyavailable devices. Perioperative considerations for ventricular assist deviceimplantation are discussed, including the decision-making process underlying the use of univentricular versus biventricular support, specific anestheticconsiderations, and the role of transesophageal echocardiography whereventricular assist devices are concerned. The anesthetic considerations for thepatient already supported by a ventricular assist device presenting fornoncardiac surgery are also reviewed. The work concludes with a discussion of therationale behind the next generation of continuous flow devices currently inhuman clinical trials.
