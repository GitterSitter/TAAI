The technical innovation of theLVAD has a significant benefit on the patients' physical functioning. However,within the United Kingdom, there has been no systematic evaluation of thepsychological adjustment and quality of life (QoL) of patients currently livingwith an LVAD, or of the differences in QoL for patients who are either explanted or transplanted.AIM: To assess the differences in QoL and psychological adjustment for currentLVAD patients, patients who have been transplanted from an LVAD and patients inwhom the device has been explanted.METHODS: Twenty-two patients involved in an LVAD programme were recruited (18 menand four women; age range 18-60). Eight patients had an LVAD in situ, sixpatients had the LVAD explanted and eight had undergone transplantation. QoL and psychological functioning were assessed using previously validated measures.RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences between the three groups,there was a trend for the LVAD patients to have higher levels of anxiety anddepression and a lower QoL compared with transplanted or explanted patients.CONCLUSIONS: For patients with an LVAD in situ, there was a trend for QoL andpsychological functioning to be poorer than for transplanted and explantedpatients. Larger studies will be needed to confirm these findings, butpsychological assessment and interventions to reduce psychological morbidity and improve QoL will be important in these patients, particularly in view of theincreasing numbers of LVADs being implanted and the possibility of their use for long-term "destination" therapy.
