Neuropathologic findings in these patients have not been welldescribed. We retrospectively reviewed 2,632 autopsy reports (between 1990 and2000) and found 64 patients who received VADs. Of these 64 patients, brain andspinal cord tissue was available for review in 33 patients (25 males and eightfemales; age range, 4 to 69 years; mean age, 52 years). The study group wascomposed of these 33 patients. Ventricular assist devices were in place from one to 603 days (mean 49 days). Twenty-five patients had left VAD, three had rightVAD, and five had biventricular VADs. Brain weights ranged from 928 g to 1,740 g (mean 1,325 g). The most common central nervous system pathologic findingsincluded infarct (N = 23; 70%), acute neuronal necrosis (N = 22; 67% focal and N = 1; diffuse anoxic encephalopathy), hemorrhage (N = 14; 42%), and herniations (N= 7; 21%). Two patients had no neuropathologic findings at autopsy. Cause ofdeath was central nervous system-related in eight patients (24%) including sixwith massive parenchymal hemorrhage and herniations, one with brainsteminfarction, and one with air embolism (radiographically diagnosed). The mostcommon causes of death in the remaining 25 patients included sepsis (n = 10;30%), pneumonia (n = 4; 12%), and embolic events with widespread infarcts (n = 4;12%). The most common neuropathologic findings in patients with VAD were related to ischemia and infarction. In a significant subset of patients, central nervous system pathology, particularly hemorrhage with herniation, was the primary cause of death. Ann Diagn Pathol 5:67-73, 2001.Copyright 2001 by W.B.
