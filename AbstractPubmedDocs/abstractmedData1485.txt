Circ J. 2005 Mar;69(3):362-4.Mechanical ventricular assist system required for sustained severe cardiacdysfunction secondary to peripartum cardiomyopathy.Monta O(1), Matsumiya G, Fukushima N, Miyamoto Y, Sawa Y, Koseki M, Nakamichi I, Matsuda H.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Osaka UniversityGraduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.A 29-year old woman developed severe congestive heart failure in the first weekafter an uneventful full-term delivery. Despite intense medical treatment overthe next 6 months, her heart failure symptoms gradually worsened and sheeventually developed cardiogenic shock. She successfully underwent theimplantation of a left ventricular assist system, but because there was no signof recovery of ventricular function, she was placed on the waiting list for hearttransplantation. After 143 days of support, she suffered from brain hemorrhage,and eventually died after a total of 321 days of left ventricular support.Postmortem examination of the myocardium showed sustained diffuse fibrosis and noinflammatory reaction. This case implies that with severe peripartumcardiomyopathy heart transplantation should be considered without delay even if amechanical assist system is available.
