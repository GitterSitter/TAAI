The use ofpulsatile devices is associated with significant comorbidity and limiteddurability. The axial-flow HeartMate II LVAD represents the new generation ofdevices. The clinical use of this pump resulted in superior outcomes. We reviewthe HeartMate II technology, management, clinical usage and our experience.METHODS: Between 3/2002 and 12/2008, 18 transplantable adult patients weresupported on long-term HeartMate II LVAD at our institution (13 men, age 52 +/-8.4 years, range: 31-64 years). Primary indications were: ischemic cardiomyopathy(CMP) (n = 13), idiopathic CMP (n = 5). All patients were in New York HeartAssociation (NYHA) Class IV heart failure. None of patients had prior open-heart surgery. Implantation via cannulation of the left ventricular apex and theascending aorta was always elective.RESULTS: Mean support time was 217 +/- 212.3 days (range: 1-665 days). Early(30-day) mortality was 27.7% (five patients) with multiple organ failure andsepsis as main causes of death. Bleeding requiring reoperation occurred in six(33.3%) cases. Cerebral hemorrhage occurred in one patient. There were twodriveline infections and no device failure. Twelve (66.6%) patients weresuccessfully discharged home. Overall nine patients (50%) were transplanted andtwo patients are actually waiting for a suitable organ (n = 2 patients dischargedhome and n = 1 patient in hospital). At latest, follow-up survival rate afterheart transplantation is 66.6% (six patients).CONCLUSION: Long-term HeartMate II LVAD provides good mid-term, long-termresults. This new technology requires delicate management. Functional status and quality of life greatly improve in patients who survive the perioperative period.
