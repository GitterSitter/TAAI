Mechanical support is associated with a marked decrease of cardiac dilation and hypertrophy as well as numerous cellular and molecular changes ("reverse cardiac remodeling"), which can be accompanied byimproved cardiac function ("bridge to recovery") in a relatively small subset of patients with heart transplantation no longer necessary even after removal of thedevice ("weaning"). In the recent past, novel pharmacological strategies havebeen developed and are combined with mechanical support, which has increased the percentage of patients with improved clinical status and cardiac performance.Gene expression profiles have demonstrated that individuals who recover afterLVAD show different gene expression compared to individuals who do not respond tounloading. This methodology holds promise for the future to develop read outframes to identify individuals who can recover after support. Aside fromdescribing the morphological changes associated with "reverse cardiacremodeling", this review will focus on signal transduction, transcriptionalregulation, apoptosis, cell stress proteins, matrix remodeling, inflammatorymediators and aspects of neurohormonal activation in the failing human heartbefore and after ventricular unloading.PMCID: PMC2780817
