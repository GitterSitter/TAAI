All patients were able to safelymaintain their devices. Outflow graft bleeding and driveline infection wereresponsible for two readmissions. No long-term anticoagulation treatment wasused; one small thromboembolic episode occurred, but without significantlong-term sequelae.CONCLUSIONS: None of the 7 patients released from the hospital died, and all wereable to successfully maintain their devices at home. Hospital discharge ofpatients supported with left ventricular assist devices has allowed long-termevaluation of this technology, and the findings should prompt study of their use as a long-term alternative treatment to medical management for congestive heartfailure.
