Patients treated with mechanical support alone, withoutadditional measures, have a mortality rate of 80%, the same as patients treatedmedically. Emergency angioplasty and emergency coronary artery bypass graftingcan reduce mortality in certain subsets of patients to 40%. Patients with moresevere shock and secondary organ dysfunction may be treated with mechanicalbridging to transplantation with survival rates varying between 45% and 76%.Percutaneous support systems may be used to resuscitate a patient or totemporize, allowing time to perform diagnostic studies to determine if thepatient is suitable for revascularization or heart transplantation. Intravenousenoximone may improve cardiac function as well and thus allow better decisionmaking for further therapy.
