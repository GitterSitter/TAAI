Despite the association of elevated serum levels with poor prognosis, BNP release is considered beneficial because of itsantihypertrophic, vasodilating, and diuretic properties. However, there isevidence that BNP-mediated signaling may adversely influence cardiac remodeling, with further impairment of calcium homeostasis.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the effects of BNP on preload-dependentmyocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) expression. In rabbitisolated muscle strips stretched to high preload and shortening isotonically over6 hours, the SERCA/glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA ratio was enhancedby 168% (n=8) compared with unloaded preparations (n=8; P<0.001). Recombinanthuman BNP at a concentration typically found in end-stage HF patients (350 pg/mL)abolished SERCA upregulation by stretch (n=9; P<0.0001 versus BNP free).Inhibition of cyclic guanosine 3',5' monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase-5mimicked this effect, whereas inhibition of cGMP-dependent protein kinaserestored preload-dependent SERCA upregulation in the presence of recombinanthuman BNP. Furthermore, in myocardium from human end-stage HF patients undergoingcardiac transplantation (n=15), BNP expression was inversely correlated withSERCA levels. Moreover, among 23 patients treated with left ventricular assistdevices, significant SERCA2a recovery occurred in those downregulating BNP.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that preload stimulates SERCA expression. BNPantagonizes this mechanism via guanylyl cyclase-A, cGMP, and cGMP-dependentprotein kinase. This novel action of BNP to uncouple preload-dependent SERCAexpression may adversely affect contractility in patients with HF.
