We analyzed the results of such patients whounderwent HTx at our institution.METHODS: Ten patients with Marfan syndrome (median age 36, range 19 to 56 years) underwent HTx between March 1986 and December 2005. The primary vascularmanifestation of Marfan syndrome was type-A aortic dissection in three patientsand ascending aortic aneurysm in seven patients. All patients had undergonecardiovascular operations prior to transplantation. All had refractory heartfailure (New York Heart Association class IV) before transplantation. Threepatients underwent transplantation after ventricular assist device (VAD) support (left VAD, n = 2; biventricular assist device, n = 1).RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths. Two patients died of causesunrelated to Marfan disease (pneumonia on day 27, n = 1; stroke on day 102, n =1). One patient died due to type-B dissection 3.8 years posttransplantation andone due to rupture of an aortic arch aneurysm after 12.1 years. Two patientsunderwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement for chronic dissection 14 and 20months posttransplantation, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 80% at 1year and 64% at 10 years. The Kaplan-Meier freedom from reoperation was 100% at 1year and 62.5% at 10 years.CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation in patients with Marfan syndrome results ingood long-term survival, similar to that of patients without Marfan syndrome.Close follow-up and timely operation of aortic pathologies is mandatory.Reluctance to place these patients on a heart transplant waiting list appears notto be justified.
