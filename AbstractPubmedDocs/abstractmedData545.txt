Cardiogenic shock in PPCM, thoughrare, can be life-threatening, often requiring support with mechanicalcirculatory support devices. We present a case of 37-year-old Caucasian femalewho developed cardiogenic shock within 24 hours of the delivery of her twins. Theechocardiogram demonstrated severe biventricular failure which necessitatedbiventricular device placement and support with a CentriMag® centrifugal pump.This biventricular support was employed, using a single-circuit CentriMag® pump, using a 'Y' connection which made weaning from right-sided support and conversionto univentricular support easier and feasible. The patient recovered four weekslater and was explanted off the CentriMag® support and did well. This technology allows for the CentriMag® to be considered as an early option for biventricularsupport in the treatment and management of these patients as a bridge torecovery.
