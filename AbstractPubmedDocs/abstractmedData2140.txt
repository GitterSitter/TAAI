Ann Thorac Surg. 1988 Aug;46(2):134-40.Bridging to cardiac transplantation with pulsatile ventricular assist devices.Kanter KR(1), McBride LR, Pennington DG, Swartz MT, Ruzevich SA, Miller LW,Willman VL.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery (Cardiology), St. Louis University Medical Center, MO.As cardiac transplantation becomes more commonplace in the treatment of end-stageheart failure and as suitable donors become less available, an increasing number of patients will require mechanical circulatory assistance to bridge totransplantation. Since 1982, refractory hemodynamic instability requiringplacement of pulsatile ventricular assist devices (VADs) has developed in 11candidates for transplantation aged 24 to 54 years (mean, 39.6 years). Apneumatic Pierce-Donachy pump was used in 9 patients and an electrical Novacorpump in 2. The cause of the cardiomyopathy was ischemic in 6, postpartum in 2,idiopathic in 2, and doxorubicin hydrochloride toxicity in 1. Seven patientsrequired left ventricular support (LVAD); 4 required biventricular mechanicalsupport (BVAD). Duration of support ranged from 8 hours to 91 days with flowsranging from 4.1 to 8.5 L/min (mean, 5.5 L/min). Although hemodynamic stabilitywas achieved in all 11 patients, contraindications to transplantation developedin 5 patients during VAD support (renal failure in 4, sepsis in 3, disseminatedintravascular coagulopathy in 1). The remaining 6 patients (4 with an LVAD, 2with a BVAD) remained good candidates for transplantation despite majorcomplications in 5 (mediastinal bleeding in 3, driveline infection in 3,development of preformed antibodies in 2, small embolic stroke caused by devicemalfunction in 1). The 3 patients who were supported the longest (24, 75, and 91 days) were ambulatory while awaiting a donor heart. All 6 patients underwentsuccessful transplantation after 8 hours to 91 days (mean, 24 days) of support.Other than one sternal wound infection, there were no major complications aftertransplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
