The number of heart transplantations performed worldwide remains fairly static, and medical therapy alone for end stage heart failurecontinues to have dismal results. This article presents the authors' opinion asto the current status, challenges, and future course of the field of mechanicalcirculatory support.RECENT FINDINGS: There is significant disparity between perceived and actuarialsurvival of a patient with the diagnosis of advanced heart failure. Thetraditional indications for mechanical circulatory support are becoming lessrelevant as the application of the therapy broadens. More devices with improveddurability are becoming available, and patient selection, management, andoutcomes continue to improve. Long-term myocardial recovery is possible in apopulation of patients with heart failure through the use of mechanicalcirculatory support combined with evolving pharmacologic therapy, gene therapy,and other forms of tissue regeneration (stem cells, cellular matrix).SUMMARY: Mechanical circulatory support holds great promise in the treatment ofadvanced heart failure. It is critical to change the perception of both theclinician and the patient toward the prognosis of end stage heart failure. Theprospect of achieving long-term myocardial recovery using mechanical support as aplatform for other strategies is exciting and requires intensive futureinvestigation.
