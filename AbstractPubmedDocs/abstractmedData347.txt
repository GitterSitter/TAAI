Little is known about their post-transplant outcomes. The aim of this analysis was to determine whether there was a difference in earlysurvival for children bridged to transplant with EXCOR versus status 1A pediatricheart transplant patients not transplanted with ventricular assist devicesupport.METHODS AND RESULTS: Pediatric heart transplant patients (n=106) bridged totransplantation with EXCOR were compared with a similarly aged cohort (n=1021)within the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) database (both cohortsfrom May 2007 to December 2010). In the EXCOR group, 12-month post-transplantsurvival (88.7%) was similar to OPTN patients listed status 1A who were not onventricular assist device support at transplant (89.3%; P=0.85) and significantlybetter than 12-month survival in OPTN patients on extracorporeal membraneoxygenation at transplant (60.3%; P<0.001). Rejection (50%) was a significantly(P=0.005) higher cause of 12-month post-transplant mortality in the EXCORcompared with the OPTN group. Death after transplant was also higher in EXCORpatients with congenital heart disease compared with those with cardiomyopathy(26.1% versus 7.2%; P=0.02). Post-transplant survival was similar in EXCORpatients with â‰¥1 serious adverse event during ventricular assist device supportas those without an event during support.CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month post-transplant survival with EXCOR is comparable with overall pediatric heart transplant survival and superior to survival afterextracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Neither adverse events during support norfactors associated with mortality during support influence post-transplantsurvival. Rejection was a significantly greater cause of post-transplantmortality in EXCOR than in OPTN patients.
