However, data on risk factors for early death in BTTpatients are limited.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the United Network for Organ Sharingdatabase of all patients bridged to OHT with a HeartMate II from January 2005 to December 2010. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day mortality. Additionalpostoperative outcomes were cerebrovascular accident and need for renalreplacement therapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival. Preoperativevariables associated with 90-day death on univariate analysis (p<0.2) wereincluded in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.RESULTS: A HeartMate II was used to bridge 1,312 patients (average age, 52±12years) to OHT, most commonly for idiopathic cardiomyopathy (50.7%). During thestudy, 171 patients (13.0%) died. The unadjusted 90-day survival was 92.3%. Thehighest annual average center volume in this cohort, examining for BTT recipientsonly, was 28 BTT procedures yearly. Postoperative cerebrovascular accidentoccurred in 29 patients (2.2%), and 106 (8.3%) required renal replacementtherapy. Cox regression revealed age, glomerular filtration rate, AfricanAmerican race, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, serum bilirubin, need formechanical ventilation, donor age, and prolonged ischemia time were associatedwith 90-day death. Early survival was improved for patients who underwent OHT at high-volume centers (p=0.01).CONCLUSIONS: This study examining risk factors for early death in patientsbridged to OHT using HeartMate II mechanical assistance will aid in identifyingpatients best suited to benefit from this technology.Copyright © 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
