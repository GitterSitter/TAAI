This expansion of use depends as much on quality of life as it does on survival. To draw an inference aboutlong-term quality of life with implanted LVADs, we studied "bridged" patients at our institution.METHODS: We elicited, by standard gamble, the utilities (preferences) of bridged patients at three points in their care: before LVAD implantation, during LVADsupport, and after cardiac transplantation.RESULTS: Utility was 0.548 (+/-0.276) before implantation, 0.809 (+/-0.136)during LVAD support, and 0.964 (+/-0.089) after transplantation. For patientsinterviewed during all three states of health, the utilities were significantlydifferent (p = 0.0009 by analysis of variance).CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life with an LVAD was substantially better than with medical therapy, on par with renal transplantation (as established by others),and not as good as after cardiac transplantation. These results portend anacceptable quality of life for long-term use of LVADs for patients with end-stageheart failure and contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting aclinical trial to test this new use.
