It is also not clear how intravenous inotropic therapyand mechanical cardiac assist devices (MCAD) affect cognitive function.METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional cognitive preliminary study evaluated252 potential heart transplant candidates assessing functions in memory, motor,and processing speed. Patients were divided into three HF groups based onseverity of disease: group 1 outpatients (n = 113), group 2 in-patients requiringinotropic infusion (n = 83), and group 3 inpatients likely requiring MCAD support(n = 56). Aggregate z-scores for memory, motor, and processing speed andindependent samples t tests assessed intergroup differences on 13 cognitivemeasures.RESULTS: A broad pattern of cognitive impairment was observed within the advancedHF group; fewer deficits were found in group 1 outpatients and more severedeficits in group 3 MCAD subjects. A difference in motor functions was observedas the earliest abnormality, with group 3 showing significant changes comparedwith group 1. The most dramatic changes were seen in domain mental processingspeed along with specific verbal and visual memory functions, which were slowerin group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive deficits are common in advanced HF and worsen withincreasing severity of HF. Appropriately designed and randomized studies will be needed to demonstrate if earlier MCAD implantation is warranted to arrestcognitive dysfunction and better postimplantation adaptation.
