Circulatory support devices may be used to assistthese patients while they await cardiac transplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1986 to 1997, 25 patients in cardiogenic shockcomplicating AMI within 3.6+/-0.7 days of the event were supported withartificial hearts. Of the 25 patients, 21 were men with a mean age of 48.4 +/-1.8 years. The age range was 26 to 62 years. Patients were considered for adevice when the following criteria were met: cardiac index less than 1.8L/min/m2, wedge pressure greater than 20 mmHg despite one or two inotropes and/orintra-aortic balloon support. They received either a CardioWest total artificial heart (n=13), a Thoratec biventricular assist device (n=6) or left ventricularassist device (LVAD) (n=6). Three patients were not considered transplantcandidates and died while on the devices (two with multiorgan failure and onefound to have a bronchogenic carcinoma after implant), with 22 undergoing cardiactransplantation within 8.6+/-2.2 days of device implant. Six patients died inhospital after the transplants (27.3% mortality). Complications included bleedingor tamponade in seven (28%), pneumonia in six (24%) and right ventricular failurein three LVAD patients (12%). Post-transplant actuarial one-, two- and five-year survival rates were 71.4%, 71.4% and 51%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Circulatory support devices offer a means to maintain organperfusion in patients who develop cardiogenic shock due to AMI. Patients can thenundergo transplantation with a reasonable expectation for survival when thealternative is death. Eventually the availability of permanent support devicesmay obviate the need for transplant in these patients.
