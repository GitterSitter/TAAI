Circulation. 2005 Aug 30;112(9 Suppl):I57-64.Gene profiling changes in cytoskeletal proteins during clinical recovery afterleft ventricular-assist device support.Birks EJ(1), Hall JL, Barton PJ, Grindle S, Latif N, Hardy JP, Rider JE, BannerNR, Khaghani A, Miller LW, Yacoub MH.Author information: (1)Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital NHS Trust, Harefield, Middlesex, UB96JH, UK.BACKGROUND: After left ventricular-assist device (LVAD) support, a proportion of patients recover sufficient ventricular function to enable explantation of thedevice. The exact molecular mechanisms involved in myocardial recovery remainunknown. Cytoskeletal proteins are essential for the structure and function ofthe cardiac myocyte and might play a major role.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 15 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy whorequired LVAD implantation were studied; 6 recovered sufficiently to allowexplantation of the device compared with 9 who did not recover and requiredtransplantation. LV myocardial samples were collected at implantation andexplantation/transplantation. Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed on thepaired samples and analyzed with reference to sarcomeric and nonsarcomericcytoskeletal proteins. In the recovery group, of the nonsarcomeric proteins,lamin A/C increased 1.5-fold (P<0.05) and spectrin 1.6-fold (P<0.05) between the times of implantation and explantation. Integrins beta1, beta6, and alpha7decreased 1.7-fold (P<0.05), 2.4-fold (P<0.05), and 1.5-fold (P<0.05),respectively, but integrins alpha5 and beta5 increased 2.3-fold (P<0.01) and1.2-fold (P<0.01) at explantation. The following sarcomeric proteins changed inthe recovered group only: beta-actin increased 1.4-fold (P<0.05);alpha-tropomyosin, 1.3-fold (P<0.05); alpha1-actinin, 1.8-fold (P<0.01); andalpha-filamin A, 1.6-fold (P<0.05). Both troponin T3 and alpha2-actinin decreasedby 1.6-fold at the time of explantation (P<0.05). Vinculin decreased 1.7-fold(P=0.001) in the recovered group but increased by 1.7-fold (P<0.05) in thenonrecovered group. Vinculin protein levels decreased 4.1-fold in the recoveredgroup.CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial recovery was associated with a specific pattern ofchanges in sarcomeric, nonsarcomeric, and membrane-associated proteins, whichcould have important implications in understanding the mechanisms involved.
