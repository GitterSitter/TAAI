This study investigatedwhether prior sensitization or LVAD type affected the degree of post-implantationsensitization. The records of consecutive HeartMate (HM) I and HM II LVADpatients were reviewed. Panel reactive antibody (PRA) was assessed before LVADimplantation and biweekly thereafter. Sensitization was defined as PRA > 10%, andhigh-degree sensitization was defined as PRA > 90%. An HM LVAD was implanted in64 patients, and 11 received a HM II LVAD as a bridge to transplant. Ten HM Ipatients (16%) were sensitized before LVAD implantation (HM I-S), and 54 (84%)were not (HM I-Non-S). Nine HM I-S patients (90%) became highly sensitized (PRA >90%) compared with 9 HM I-Non-S patients (16.7%; p < 0.001). The PRA remainedelevated (> 90%) in 8 of the 9 (88.9%) highly sensitized HM I-S patients vs 5 of the 9 (55.6%) HM I-Non-S highly sensitized patients. The PRA levels in the restof the HM I-S highly sensitized patients declined from 93% +/- 4% to 55% +/- 15% (p = 0.01). Among the 11 HM II patients, 1 (9%) was sensitized before LVADimplantation (PRA, 40%) and the PRA moderately increased to 80%. No other HM IIpatient became sensitized after implantation. Thus, 1 of 11 (9%) HM II patientsbecame sensitized compared with 29 of 64 (45%) HM I patients (p = 0.04).Pre-sensitized patients are at higher risk for becoming and remaining highlyHLA-allosensitized after LVAD implantation. The HeartMate II LVAD appears tocause less sensitization than HeartMate I.PMCID: PMC2758491
