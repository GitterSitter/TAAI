Circulation. 2003 Sep 9;108 Suppl 1:II272-7.Worldwide experience with the MicroMed DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device as abridge to transplantation.Goldstein DJ(1).Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, 201Lyons Avenue, Suite G5, Newark, NJ 07112, USA. dgoldstein@sbhcs.comBACKGROUND: Ventricular assist device (VAD) support with pulsatile firstgeneration pumps is a well-established therapy for bridging to transplantation.Shortcomings of this technology include limited applicability to small patients, noise, and high incidence of infection and pump malfunction. A second generation of pumps, spearheaded by the axial flow MicroMed DeBakey VAD, is in clinicaltrials and potentially will address these shortcomings.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between November 13, 1998 and May 7, 2002, 150 patientsworldwide underwent placement of the Micromed DeBakey VAD as a bridge totransplantation. Prospectively acquired data including demographics, adverseevents and outcomes was collected. Follow up is 100% with 30.4 patient-years ofcumulative support time. Mean age was 48+/-4 years and 18% were female.Twenty-three percent had prior sternotomy. Preoperatively, 25% were on balloonpump support, 20% had renal insufficiency, and 40% were on at least two inotropeswith a mean cardiac index of 1.8 L/min/m2. Mean support time was 75+/-81 days.Linearized rates (events/patient-year) were: reoperation for bleeding 2.03,hemolysis 0.61, device infection 0.16, thromboembolic event 0.61, pump thrombus0.61, and pump failure 0.13. Eight-two patients (55%) were either bridged totransplantation, recovery or are ongoing and 68 (45%) have died. Several patientshave been supported as outpatients.CONCLUSIONS: This initial experience suggests that bridging to transplantationcan be successfully approached with a small and quiet axial flow pump thatprovides low incidence of device infection and pump failure. The incidence ofpump thrombus and thromboembolism is being addressed by incorporation of heparin coating to all device surfaces.
