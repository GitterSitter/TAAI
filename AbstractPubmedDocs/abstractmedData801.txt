Accurate evaluation of RV function in patients with LVAD remains challenging. Wehypothesized that, after LVAD implantation, electrocardiographic-gated cardiaccomputed tomography (CCT) allows RV evaluation with higher feasibility andreproducibility compared with echocardiography.METHODS: Thirty-six patients with an implanted LVAD who had 2-dimensionalechocardiography and CCT evaluation were studied. RV end-diastolic andend-systolic volumes and ejection fraction were quantified using CCT. RVfractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and RVend-diastolic short-to-long axis ratio were calculated by echocardiography.Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman analysis were used toassess intra- and interobserver reproducibility for all measurements.RESULTS: The quality of CCT studies was good in all cases except for one. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility for all CCT measurements was high(interobserver ICC for RV ejection fraction = 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.95). Echocardiographic indices of RV function and geometry had lowerreproducibility. The echocardiographic index that best correlated with theCCT-determined RV ejection fraction was RV fractional area change (r = 0.80, p < 0.001). In addition, CCT detected relevant post-operative findings in 50% of the patients.CONCLUSIONS: CCT is highly effective and reproducible compared withechocardiography for the evaluation of RV function in patients with LVAD support and provides relevant information on post-operative findings. Our results suggestthat CCT should be considered as a useful imaging modality in this clinicalsetting.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
