Extremes of bodymass index (BMI) are associated with decreased survival after cardiac surgery.Many patients with congestive heart failure develop cardiac cachexia. In thisstudy the association between BMI and outcomes after VAD implantation wasinvestigated.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 590) who underwent VAD placement between 1996 and 2006 were divided into five groups based on BMI (kg/m2) quintiles (<20;20-24; 25-29; 30-35; and >35). In a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis, emergency level, and type of device (left ventricular or biventricularassist device), procedural success (recovery, transplantation, or 30-daysurvival) and complications were analyzed. The best group was set as referencecategory for calculation of odds ratios.RESULTS: The groups with both extremes of BMI had the worst outcomes. The bestprocedural success was in the group with BMI 25 to 29 kg/m2. Underweight patientshad similar survival rates to patients with normal weight. Overweight and obesepatients did not have decreased survival. Extreme obesity at the time of VADimplantation showed elevated risk for postoperative death. There was nosignificant difference for BMI groups in the type of complications and cause ofdeath. Cumulative survival curves for BMI category and overall VAD patientsurvival showed no significant differences.CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac cachexia need not be an exclusion criterion for VADplacement. Underweight patients appear to have benefit from mechanical support.Severely obese patients should be carefully selected before VAD placement.
