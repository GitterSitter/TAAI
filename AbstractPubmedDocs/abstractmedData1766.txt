Perfusion. 2001 Jan;16(1):13-8.Five-year clinical experience with Abiomed BVS 5000 as a ventricular assistdevice for cardiac failure.Dekkers RJ(1), FitzGerald DJ, Couper GS.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiac Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard MedicalSchool, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.Mechanical support for the failing heart has interested and challenged cardiacspecialists for decades. In the United States alone, there are close to 375,000cardiac surgical procedures performed each year, and, despite the recent advancesin myocardial protection, surgical techniques, intra-aortic balloon therapy andmaximal pharmacological support, postoperative ventricular dysfunction continues to occur in 0.5-1.0% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Thisretrospective review describes our 5-year clinical experience at the Brigham and Women's Hospital with the Abiomed BVS 5000 as a means of ventricular support.During the period of 1994 to present, 7,428 cardiac surgical operations wereperformed at our institution. The Abiomed BVS 5000 has been implanted in 47patients exhibiting ventricular failure. There were 38 patients in thebridge-to-recovery group and nine patients in the bridge-to-transplantationgroup. Twenty-five patients (66%) in the bridge-to-recovery group were weaned and16 patients (42%) went on to discharge. In the bridge-to-transplantation group,one patient actually recovered myocardial function and one expired on the device.The remaining seven patients (77%) underwent cardiac transplantation withpost-transplant survival at 66%. Overall, patients were supported in the isolatedleft ventricular mode (28%), in the biventricular mode (45%) and in the isolated right ventricular mode (28%). The Abiomed BVS 5000 has been shown to be a safeand simple cardiac support system with no mechanical failure. Our experienceshows that a substantial number of patients suffering from ventricular failurewill benefit from the use of this device. The results also justify the use ofthis device in groups of patients other that of postcardiotomy ventricularfailure.
