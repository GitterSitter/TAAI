Until recently technological advances have been limited to theadult population.METHODS: Between February 1994 and December 1996, 553 infants or childrenunderwent operation at our institution. Ten of them were treated with cardiacassist systems. Their ages ranged from 4 days to 8 years (median 5 months). In 8 patients we used a pulsatile circulatory support system available in 6 sizes (9, 10, 22.5, 25, 54, and 60 mL). A centrifugal pump was used in 2 additionalinfants. In 3 children cardiac assist was considered as a bridge totransplantation; in the remaining patients postcardiotomy failure or cardiogenic shock led to mechanical support.RESULTS: Median duration of assist was 4 days (range 8 hours to 17 days). In all cases we could observe recovery of renal, hepatic, and cardiac function in theimmediate postimplantation period. Six patients survived and could be discharged either after successful transplantation or after myocardial recovery frompostcardiotomy failure. The cause of death in 4 cases was bleeding and multiorganfailure. No technical failures occurred with either system.CONCLUSIONS: The pulsatile circulatory support system seems to be feasible andeffective for pediatric extracorporeal support. If the anatomic situation doesnot permit implantation, centrifugal pumps are an alternative.
