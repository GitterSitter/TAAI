Forty patients (LVAD, n = 14; HT, n = 12; andheart failure [HF], n = 14) and 14 matched healthy subjects were assessed forphysical activity, energy expenditure, and QoL. The LVAD and HT groups wereassessed postoperatively at 4 to 6 weeks (baseline) and 3, 6, and 12 months. Atbaseline, LVAD, HT, and HF patients demonstrated low physical activity, reaching only 15%, 28%, and 51% of that of healthy subjects (1,603 ± 302 vs 3,036 ± 439 vs5,490 ± 1,058 vs 10,756 ± 568 steps/day, respectively, p <0.01). This wasassociated with reduced energy expenditure and increased sedentary time (p<0.01). Baseline QoL was not different among LVAD, HT, and HF groups (p = 0.44). LVAD implantation and HT significantly increased daily physical activity by 60%and 52%, respectively, from baseline to 3 months (p <0.05), but the level ofactivity remained unchanged at 3, 6, and 12 months. The QoL improved frombaseline to 3 months in LVAD implantation and HT groups (p <0.01) but remainedunchanged afterward. At any time point, HT demonstrated higher activity levelthan LVAD implantation (p <0.05), and this was associated with better QoL. Incontrast, physical activity and QoL decreased at 12 months in patients with HF(p <0.05). In conclusion, patients in LVAD and HT patients demonstrate improvedphysical activity and QoL within the first 3 months after surgery, but physicalactivity and QoL remain unchanged afterward and well below that of healthysubjects. Strategies targeting low levels of physical activity should now beexplored to improve recovery of these patients.Copyright © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
