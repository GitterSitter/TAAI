The major limitations are infection, coagulopathies, anddevice dysfunction. The Scientific Council on Mechanical Circulatory Support ofthe International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation has established aninternational database (http://www.ishlt.org/regist_mcsd_main.htm) to generatecritical data to advance knowledge about effectiveness of mechanical circulatory support device therapy for one of the most difficult and costly contemporarymedical problems, the malignant syndrome of advanced heart failure.
