We analyzed the effect on PVR of pretransplantLVAD therapy in patients with PH and compared posttransplant outcome with matchedcontrols. Long-term survival was compared between heart transplant recipientswith mild, moderate or severe PH and patients with no PH.METHODS: Heart transplant recipients 1988-2007 (n=405) were reviewed and divided into two groups with respect to pretransplant PVR: <2.5 WU (n=148) and >2.5 WU(n=158). From the group with PH, patients subjected to pretransplant LVAD therapy(n=11) were analyzed with respect to PVR at implant and at transplant and, withrespect to outcome, compared to matched historical controls (n=22). Patients withPH without LVAD treatment (n=147) were stratified into three subgroups: mild,moderate and severe PH and survival according to Kaplan-Meier was analyzed andcompared to patients with no PH.RESULTS: LVAD therapy reduced PVR from 4.3+/-1.6 to 2.0+/-0.6 WU, p<0.05. Threecases of perioperative heart failure required mechanical support whereas onecontrol patient developed perioperative right heart failure requiring mechanical support. The incidence of other perioperative complications was comparablebetween groups. There was no difference in survival between LVAD patients andcontrols, 30-day survival was 82% and 91%, respectively and 4-year survival was64% and 82%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant LVAD therapy reduces an elevated PVR in hearttransplant recipients, but there was no statistically significant difference inposttransplant survival in patients with PH with, or without LVAD therapy. Thestudy revealed no differences in survival in patients regardless of the severity of the PH.
