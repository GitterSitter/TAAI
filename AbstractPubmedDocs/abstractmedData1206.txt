Epub 2008May 30.The magnitude of reverse remodelling irrespective of aetiology predicts outcomeof heart failure patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy.Di Biase L(1), Auricchio A, Sorgente A, Civello K, Klersy C, Faletra F,Riedlbauchova L, Patel D, Arruda M, Schweikert RA, Martin DO, Saliba WI, MoccettiT, Wilkoff BL, Natale A.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Section of Cardiac Electrophysiologyand Pacing, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.AIMS: We assessed the relationship between cardiac resynchronization therapy(CRT)-induced reverse remodelling and mortality during a long-term follow-up in aprospective observational study.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from a prospective registry including 398consecutive patients who underwent CRT between September 1998 and September 2007.Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed before CRT and in theperiod between 3 and 6 months following implant. All-cause mortality, urgenttransplantation and implantation of left ventricular assist device were allconsidered relevant events. A total of 398 (179 non-ischaemic and 219 ischaemic) patients were analysed. Overall, the increase of LVEF was statisticallysignificant and was computed with 7.0 points (95% CI 5.8-8.3, P < 0.001).Non-ischaemic patients had a larger increase [9.2 points (95% CI 7.0-11.1), P <0.001] of their LVEF from baseline, when compared with the ischaemic group. Themedian duration of follow-up was 4.4 years. The cumulative incidence of allevents at the end of the 96 months period of follow-up was 55% and it was 34%(95% CI 29-40) at 5 years. At the multivariable analysis of the event-freesurvival, aetiology lost its predictive value (HR 0.92, P = 0.47), while a changein LVEF >or=6 points still significantly decreased the risk of event during thefollow-up (HR 0.30, P = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Reverse remodelling measured by LVEF after 3 months is a goodpredictor of long-term outcome. Patients with an increase in LVEF >or=6 pointshave an excellent event-free survival approaching 66% at 5 years of follow-up.
