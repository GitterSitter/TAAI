With longer implant times comesLVAD exchange for component failure or serious device-related infection thatcannot be treated medically. LVAD exchange should be performed promptly andplanned in accordance with the patient's condition, the type of device previouslyimplanted, and the type used for exchange, as well as whether total system orindividual component replacement is required. Most patients who experience pumpfailure after extended support are in good condition. Preoperatively, patientsmust be stabilized using standard inotropic and vasoactive medications andundergo a complete workup, including echocardiography. Coagulation abnormalities should be corrected preoperatively. Intraoperatively, continuous transesophageal echocardiography and standard hemodynamic monitoring should be utilized. Afteropening the chest, LVAD support should be minimized to prevent air entry.Detailed descriptions of the following exchange procedures are presented: Jarvik 2000 to Jarvik 2000, HeartMate (VE or XVE) to HeartMate (VE or XVE), HeartMate(VE or XVE) to HeartMate II, and HeartMate II to HeartMate II. Although morereliable systems may offer longer support times, the need for exchange procedureswill likely continue to increase.
