In studyingheart failure physiology on support devices, we hypothesized that improvement of cardiac function by a left ventricular assist device is associated withnormalization of volume load secondary to normalization of its regulatorysubstances.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 15 patients (13 men, 2 women: age 51 +/- 8 years)with end-stage heart failure who were cardiac transplant candidates eligible for HeartMate implantation. We measured plasma volume and plasma levels of atrialnatriuretic peptide, aldosterone, renin, and arginine vasopressin sequentiallybefore HeartMate implantation (baseline), after HeartMate implantation (weeks 4and 8), and after transplantation. Baseline plasma volume was 123 +/- 20% ofnormal; it was 122 +/- 22% at week 4 and decreased to 115 +/- 14% at week 8.Atrial natriuretic peptide was 359 +/- 380 pg/mL at baseline, 245 +/- 175 pg/mLat week 4, and 151 +/- 66 pg/mL at week 8. Plasma aldosterone fell from 68 +/- 59ng/dL at baseline to 17 +/- 16 ng/dL at week 4 (P < .05 versus baseline) and was 32 +/- 50 ng/dL at week 8. Plasma renin activity decreased from 80 +/- 88 ng/dLat baseline to 11 +/- 12 ng/dL at week 4 and was 16 +/- 38 ng/dL at week 8 (both P < .05 versus baseline). Arginine vasopressin fell from 5.0 +/- 4.8 fmol/mL atbaseline to 1.1 +/- 0.7 fmol/mL at week 4 and 1.2+/-0.8 fmol/mL at week 8 (both P< .05 versus baseline).CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, andarginine vasopressin occurred earlier than the reduction of plasma volume andatrial natriuretic peptide after HeartMate implantation, possibly because ofdecreased pulmonary congestion and improved renal perfusion. The reduction ofatrial natriuretic peptide cannot be responsible for the lack of adequatedecrease of plasma volume; its reduction can be taken as a marker of improvedcardiac pump function and decreased atrial stretch.
