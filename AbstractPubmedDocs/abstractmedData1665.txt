Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 2002 Sep;103(9):597-602.[Left ventricular assist system].[Article in Japanese]Kyo S(1), Nishimura M, Asano H.Author information: (1)Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Saitama Medical School, Saitama, Japan.Two types of artificial heart, the total artificial heart (TAH) and ventricularassist system (VAS), have been utilized in patients with end-stage heart failure waiting for heart transplantation (bridge to transplantation). The TAH is asystem to replace the native heart, whereas the VAS is a system to support theleft ventricle (LVAS), right ventricle (RVAS), or both ventricles (BVAS) whilemaintaining native cardiac function. There are two types of VAS, paracorporealVAS and implantable VAS. Implantable VAS devices such as Novacor LVAS andHeartMate LVAS are only available for LVAS, although paracorporeal VAS, such asToyobo VAS, Zeon VAS, and Thoratec VAS, are available for RVAS, LVAS, or BVAS.Due to recent advances in the VAS, the "patient discharge program" from hospital has been promoted for improvement of the quality of life (QOL) and reduction ofmedical costs. VAS also have been utilized as "bridges to recovery" for nativehearts or for "semipermanent use" in patients without indications for hearttransplantation, and superior clinical results of VAS therapy compared withconservative therapy have been reported in terms of one-year survival rate andimprovement of QOL. Recently, several inexpensive VAS systems with an axial orcentrifugal pump have been developed and the initial clinical trials of thesesystems have recently started in Western countries. Another remarkabletechnological advance in VAS is the Lion Heart (Arrow) which is a totallyimplantable VAS system the includes an energy transmission system. We expect thatrecent technological progress in VAS will improve the survival and QOL inpatients with end-stage heart failure.
