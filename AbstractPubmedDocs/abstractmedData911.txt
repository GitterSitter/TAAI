The use of ventricular assist devices (VAD) in these patients is now available as abridge to heart transplantation. The use of a VAD may reveal the presence of asilent interatrial septal defect or a patent foramen ovale (PFO), inducing aright to left shunt resulting in systemic desaturation and hemodynamicinstability. We present two cases of low weight infants on circulatory supportwith VADs and right to left shunt through interatrial septum that weresuccessfully treated by percutaneous intervention with an occlusion device.Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
