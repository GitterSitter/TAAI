Ann Thorac Surg. 1989 Aug;48(2):222-7.The Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiactransplantation.Gray LA Jr(1), Ganzel BL, Mavroudis C, Slater AD.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Kentucky.The Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device (VAD) was used as an attemptedbridge to orthotopic cardiac transplantation in 12 patients aged 13 to 55 years. Ischemic (4 patients), dilated (4 patients), acute viral (1 patient), postpartum (1 patient), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1 patient), along with a failedtransplant (1 patient), were the causative factors of end-stage cardiomyopathy inthese patients. All patients were candidates for orthotopic cardiactransplantation but sustained refractory cardiogenic shock (cardiac index lessthan 2 L/min/m2). Left VADs were placed in all patients; 7 also required rightVADs. Four patients died of hemorrhagic complications less than 24 hours afterVAD insertion. Ventricular assist device stabilization was successful in 8patients and support ranged from eight hours to 64 days. Seven patientssuccessfully underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation. One diedpostoperatively of hemorrhagic complications, 6 were discharged from thehospital, and 1 patient died at 3 months of cytomegalovirus infection. Fivepatients are long-term survivors. The Pierce-Donachy VAD is an effective meansfor supporting critically ill patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy andcardiogenic shock before orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Death is related to hemorrhagic, rather than infectious or thromboembolic, complications. Patientssuccessfully stabilized with the VAD can undergo orthotopic cardiactransplantation with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates.
