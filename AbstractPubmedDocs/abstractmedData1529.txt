Mechanical circulatory support has become the standardtherapy to bridge patients with intractable heart failure to eithertransplantation or myocardial recovery. Yet, successful weaning frombiventricular support with full recovery is extremely rare in the pediatricpopulation. This report describes the successful use of the MEDOS HIA ventricularassist device to bridge a 12-year-old girl to myocardial recovery in abiventricular bypass configuration. The left and right ventricle were completely off-loaded by the pumps and the device provided sufficient cardiac output tonormalize end-organ function. Anticoagulation was maintained with i.v. heparininfusion. No neurological complications were detectable and the pump system wasfree of any macroscopic thrombi. After 19 days of support, cardiac function hadrecovered and the patient was successfully weaned from the device. Followingphysical rehabilitation, the patient was discharged home.
