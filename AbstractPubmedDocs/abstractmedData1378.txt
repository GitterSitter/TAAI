Nat Clin Pract Cardiovasc Med. 2006 Jul;3(7):377-86.Technology insight: Use of ventricular assist devices in children.Hetzer R(1), Stiller B.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Deutsches HerzzentrumBerlin, Germany. hetzer@dhzb.deMechanical circulatory support systems for the treatment of end-stage heartfailure are now available for a wide variety of clinical situations and supporttimes. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and centrifugal pump circuits havebeen most widely used in children, particularly in small infants. These systemsare preferred for support after cardiac operations and for use in patients whohave concomitant respiratory failure, but are suitable for short-term applicationonly and intensive care is obligatory. True ventricular assist devices (VADs)qualify for long-term application and allow patients full mobilization. Thesefeatures are important in patients awaiting heart transplantation as well as inthose with myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, who might achieve complete cardiacrecovery. Pneumatic pulsatile VADs have been available in pediatric sizes since1992. At our institution, VAD use lasting from several days to 14 months in 70infants and children with myocarditis and cardiomyopathy has led to a notablerise in survival in the past 5 years. We have been able to discharge 78% of theinfants under 1 year old. In this review we present current VAD experience inchildren in the light of improvements in decision making, device technology,implantation techniques, and in coagulation monitoring and anticoagulation.
