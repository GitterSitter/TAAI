Epub2013 Aug 23.Should eligibility for heart transplantation be a requirement for leftventricular assist device use? Recommendations based on a systematic review.Boothroyd LJ(1), Lambert LJ, Sas G, Guertin JR, Ducharme A, Charbonneau É,Carrier M, Cecere R, Morin JE, Bogaty P.Author information: (1)Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS),Montreal, Québec, Canada. Electronic address: lucy.boothroyd@inesss.qc.ca.Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used in chronic end-stage heartfailure as "bridge to transplantation" (BTT) and, more recently, fortransplant-ineligible patients as "destination therapy" (DT). We reviewed theevidence on clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of 2 types of continuous-flowLVADs (HeartMate II [HM II] and HeartWare), for BTT and DT patients. Wesystematically searched the scientific literature (January 2008-June 2012) andidentified 14 clinical studies (approximately 2900 HM II and approximately 200HeartWare patients), and 3 economic evaluations (HM II) using simulation models. Data were, however, limited to 2-3 studies per outcome. We made policyrecommendations on the basis of our systematic review. Although complicationsafter implantation are frequent, LVAD therapy is often highly effective acrosstransplantation eligibility status and device, with 1-year survival reaching 86% for BTT and 78% for DT (compared with 25% for medical therapy). Neither BTT norDT currently meet traditional cost-effectiveness limits in models usinghistorical data, although BTT is standard practice for a limited number ofpatients in many regions. We found that BTT and DT as implantation strategiestend to be no longer mutually exclusive. We conclude that evidence is sufficient to support LVAD use, regardless of transplantation eligibility status, as long aspatients are carefully selected and program infrastructure and budget areadequate. However, evidence gaps, limitations in economic models, and the lack ofCanadian data point to the importance of mandatory, systematic monitoring of LVADuse and outcomes.Copyright © 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
