Epub2010 Feb 23.Are ventricular assist devices underutilized?Boyle AJ(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Aurora St Luke's Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53215, USA. andrew.boyle@aurora.orgA dramatic shift in the durability and reliability of ventricular assist device(VAD) therapy is taking hold due to the newer generations of continuous flow VADsthat are either in clinical trials or under consideration by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) for commercial approval. To expand the pool of potentialmechanical circulatory support (MCS) patients, device reliability will need toprove to be greatly enhanced over previous generations of VADs and functionalcapacity and quality of life will need to improve substantially over baseline.Improved patient selection should have the simultaneously beneficial effects ofimproving outcomes while expanding the MCS patient population. The criticalfactors determining the likelihood of expansion of the MCS field include, but arenot limited to, improvements in technology and its reliability, training andeducation of all advanced heart failure caregivers, improving availability of MCSgeographically, and a shift in patient selection to a population more likely tobenefit from MCS therapy.
