The TandemHeart is a new assist device that may be percutaneously or surgically inserted. Wereview techniques for percutaneous and intraoperative placement of theTandemHeart, including detailed descriptions of its insertion. Additionally, wepresent the most common complications associated with the percutaneous oroperative approaches and suggest ways to avoid these complications. Whetherplaced percutaneously or surgically, the TandemHeart can provide adequatehemodynamic support for heart failure patients. If the device is placed bysurgeons in the operating room, there must be strict adherence to protocols andde-airing techniques. Complications may occur with either insertion technique, soknowledge of the most common types of complications and their prevention isnecessary.
