We aimed to evaluate the quality of twodifferent systems based on patients' perspective and its interrelationship withquality of life. Differential assessment of the HeartMate II axial flow pump (n =17; Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and the HVAD centrifugal pump (n = 10;HeartWare, Inc., Miramar, FL, USA) was obtained from 27 outpatients by aquestionnaire 2 months to 2.9 years after device implantation. In addition, ahealth-related quality of life questionnaire (Short Form-36 [SF-36]) wascompleted. Overall patients' satisfaction was high. Severe limitations wereattributed to the loudness of the power base unit in HeartMate II patients (P =0.00), and HVAD patients were dissatisfied by the length of the driveline (P =0.02). Between HVAD and HeartMate II patients, no significant differences in the quality of life (assessed by SF-36) were reported. While the overall satisfactionof outpatients on LVAD support was high, differences between the systems werefound. Patients' perspectives may have an important impact on future modificationof external components. Ultimately, this may also contribute to an improvement inthe quality of life of chronic LVAD patients.© 2010, Copyright the Authors.
