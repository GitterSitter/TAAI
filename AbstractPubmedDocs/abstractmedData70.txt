We performed a multicentreanalysis of the real world outcomes associated with its use.METHODS: Between May 2010 and January 2013, 4 Canadian centres inserted a totalof 72 HVADs in 71 patients. Data were collected prospectively and analyzedretrospectively for the 1-year estimate of the principal outcome of transplant,explant for recovery, or death in patients who had a bridge to transplantationindication. Adverse event rates were estimated as events per patient-year (PPY).RESULTS: In the 67 patients who received the HVAD with the indication of bridgeto transplant, 26 (38.8%) received a successful transplant, 2 (3%) received anexplant for recovery, and 10 (14.9%) patients died during support. Medianfollow-up time with the HVAD was 6.9 months (range, 2 days to 30.4 months).Despite having 74% of the patients with Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) scores of level 1 and 2 at the time ofimplantation, the rate estimate for survival at 1 year was 86.3% (95% confidence interval, 76.7-93.3). With 48.2 total patient years of support, the rates ofischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were 0.21 and 0.19 events PPY, respectively.Women made up 40% of the cohort and an adverse neurologic event occurred with an event rate of 0.38 PPY in women.CONCLUSIONS: The HVAD adequately supports acutely ill heart failure patientsuntil the time of transplant or recovery. A high incidence of adverse neurologic outcomes might be related to the large percentage of female patients, the highINTERMACS levels, or unknown factors; further surveillance is required.Copyright Â© 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
