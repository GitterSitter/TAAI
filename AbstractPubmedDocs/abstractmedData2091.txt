Aust N Z J Surg. 1991 Apr;61(4):271-5.Initial clinical experience with the Haemopump left ventricular assist device.Smith JA(1), Salamonsen RF, Rosenfeldt FL, Esmore DS.Author information: (1)Heart and Heart-lung Replacement Service, Alfred Hospital, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.The Haemopump is an intra-arterial, axial flow, temporary left ventricular assistdevice. The intra-cardiac pump assembly is connected by a flexible drive shaft toa high speed motor and a drive console. The pump is placed in the left ventricle via the femoral artery, iliac artery or abdominal aorta. Blood is withdrawn from the left ventricle and pumped in a continuous, non-pulsatile fashion into thedescending thoracic aorta. We report the use of the Haemopump to providecirculatory assistance in 2 patients with severe graft dysfunction followingcardiac transplantation. Both patients were successfully weaned from theHaemopump after 6 and 3 days of support. The first patient subsequently died ofoverwhelming fungal sepsis and the other remains well 3 months aftertransplantation with normal left ventricular function. The Haemopump is aneffective temporary cardiac assist device for application in severe leftventricular failure.
