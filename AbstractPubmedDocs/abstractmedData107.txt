Improved long-term outcomes may facilitate the use of device therapy as an alternative to heart transplantation. However, there are scarce data about thelong-term outcomes of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. This studysought to evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients receiving continuous-flowleft ventricular assist devices.METHODS: Between March 2004 and June 2010, 140 patients underwent continuous-flowleft ventricular assist device insertion as a bridge to transplantation or adestination therapy. These patients' charts were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: The initial strategy for continuous-flow left ventricular assist device therapy was bridge to transplantation in 115 patients (82%) and destinationtherapy in 25 patients (18%). Of those, 24 (17%) died on left ventricular assist device support, 94 (67%) were successfully bridged to transplantation, and 1(0.71%) showed native heart recovery. Twenty-four patients (17%) had been oncontinuous-flow left ventricular assist device support for more than 3 years(mean, 3.9 years; range, 3.0-7.5 years). Estimated on-device survival at 1, 3,and 5 years was 83%, 75%, and 61%, respectively. Rehospitalizations due tobleeding, cardiac events, and device-related issues were common. The freedom fromrehospitalization rates at 1 and 3 years was 31% and 6.9%, respectively. A total of 14 patients (10%) required device exchange.CONCLUSIONS: Current continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices can provide satisfactory long-term survival. However, rehospitalization is frequentlyrequired.Copyright Â© 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published byElsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
