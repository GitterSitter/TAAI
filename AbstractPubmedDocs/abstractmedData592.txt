In this study weevaluated the effect of VAD implantation upon the quality of life among Turkishpatients with end-stage heart failure.METHODS: Twenty-eight VAD implantation patients included 3 (10.7%) withbiventricular support using the Berlin Heart Excor; 15 (53.6%), left ventricular support with the Berlin Heart Excor; and 10 (35.7%), Heartware implantation forleft ventricular support. The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire(MLHFQ) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Questionnaire were used to assesschanges in the quality of life (QOL).RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, 2 were females (7.1%) and 26 were males (92.9%) ofoverall mean age of 44.6 ± 15.3 years (range, 8-66). Preoperative mean score ofMLHFQ was significantly improved at 200.4 ± 147.4 days follow-up (72.8 ± 11.5 vs 13.7 ± 10.5; P < .05). SF-36 physical scores and mental scores were improvedpostoperatively (physical scores, 20.0 ± 24.4 vs 70.2 ± 19.9; mental scores, 38.4± 18.8 vs 73.9 ± 15.7; P < .05). No significant relation was observed between thepostoperative scores of questionnaires and type of surgery. More improvement inpostoperative MLHFQ scores was seen in patients younger than 45 years of age (P =.027). The severity of chronic heart failure (CHF) regressed from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV to NYHA class II in 26 and to NYHA class III in 2patients (P = .000).CONCLUSION: The QOL among patients with end-stage heart failure improveddramatically soon after VAD implantation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.
