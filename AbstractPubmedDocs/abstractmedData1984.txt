A surgical intervention forright-side circulatory failure.Slater JP(1), Yamada A, Yano OJ, Stennet R, Goldstein DJ, Levin HR, Spotnitz HM, Oz MC.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons,New York, NY, USA.BACKGROUND: Right-side circulatory failure (RSCF), a common complication of hearttransplant and left ventricular assist device recipients, results in decreasedcardiac output because of diminished flow across the pulmonary circuit. Wehypothesized that creation of a controlled venoarterial shunt would result indecompression of the right ventricle and improved systemic cardiac output attolerable oxygen saturations.METHODS AND RESULTS: A venoarterial shunt was created in a large-animal model(calf, n = 6). RSCF was induced by banding the pulmonary artery. Hemodynamicmeasures and blood gas determinations were obtained during nonshunted and shuntedstates. Pulmonary artery banding increased mean right ventricular systolicpressure from 44.9 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 85.9 +/- 6.9 mm Hg (P < .05,paired t test) and decreased mean aortic flow from 7.8 +/- 1.0 to 4.2 +/- 1.1L/min (P < .05). Flow through a venoarterial shunt at approximately 40% ofcardiac output resulted in a decrease in right ventricular end-systolic pressure from 85.9 +/- 6.9 to 72.1 +/- 5.6 mm Hg (P < .01, ANOVA), a decrease in meanpulmonary artery pressure from 42.9 +/- 5.0 to 37.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg (P < .01), and an increase in aortic flow from 4.2 +/- .05 to 5.1 L/min (P < .01). Leftventricular stroke work decreased from 2.22 +/- 0.28 to 1.55 +/- 0.88 (P < .05). Carotid artery oxygen saturation did not change significantly (99.9 +/- .02 to97.6 +/- 1.7) during shunting.CONCLUSIONS: A controlled venoarterial shunt improved hemodynamics and cardiacoutput in a large animal model with RSCF. This strategy may be useful in themanagement of transplant and left ventricular assist device recipients withperioperative RSCF.
