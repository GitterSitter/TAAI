Of the 15 patients, 3 received CVVHD and 12 received CVVHD and hemodialysis. Renal function improved within 2 months of support compared withaverage values before support (creatinine clearance, 64 ± 39 vs 92 ± 55 ml/min, p= 0.041; glomerular filtration rate, 46.9 ± 20.7 vs 73.2 ± 38.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2);p = 0.032). Renal function improved after HeartMate II implantation in 10patients, and RRT was removed. Of these 10 patients, 2 underwent hearttransplantation 4 months after RRT was removed, 1 underwent heart and kidneytransplantation 4 years later, 2 died at home of conditions unrelated to renalfunction 6 months after RRT was removed, and 5 are awaiting hearttransplantation, with good quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients who experienced clinical recovery after the LVAD implant had subsequent recovery of renal function after continuous-flow LVADsupport.Copyright © 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
