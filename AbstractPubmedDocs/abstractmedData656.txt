However, significant rates of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) have been observed during CF-LVAD support.METHODS: From March 2006 through March 2011, 86 patients with chronic heartfailure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD (HeartMate II; Thoratec Corp.,Pleasanton, CA). Records were reviewed to determine the prevalence ofpost-implant GIB, location of the bleeding site and associated morbidity andmortality. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of GIB.RESULTS: GIB occurred in 19 patients (22.1%) with a duration of support thatranged from 5 to 456 days. Sources of GIB included small bowel and rectum in 6patients each, large bowel in 2 patients and stomach in 1 patient. No definitesource was identified in 4 patients. There were no deaths referable to GIB.Recurrent GIB occurred in 4 patients. History of a GIB prior to LVAD implant was the only variable significantly different between patients with and withoutpost-implant GIB (21.1% vs 10.4%, p = 0.016), and was the only independentpredictor of GIB (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 2.121 to 2.435, p = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent source of morbidity forpatients on HeartMate II LVAD support but does not significantly impact survival.As implantation of CF-LVADs with non-pulsatile flow gains popularity for bothbridge-to-transplant and destination therapy, a better understanding of thepathophysiology of GIB in these patients will be needed for minimizing thiscomplication.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
