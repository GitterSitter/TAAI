Ann Thorac Surg. 1993 Jan;55(1):283-7.Use of the Symbion biventricular assist device in bridging to transplantation.Lick S(1), Copeland JG 3rd, Smith RG, Cleavinger M, Rosado LJ, Huston CL, SethiGK, Molloy TF.Author information: (1)University of Arizona Health Science Center, Tucson 85715.From 1988 to 1991 13 patients received Symbion biventricular assist devices inattempts to bridge them to cardiac transplantation. All 7 of those who hadcardiac transplants survived to hospital discharge. One death occurred 60 daysafter transplantation because of rejection. All other patients who receivedtransplants are surviving. Implant times in this group varied from 10 to 164 days(mean, 55 days). There were two embolic neurologic events and two significantinfections, and 2 of the survivors were dialyzed for reversible renal failurebefore transplantation. Of those who died on device support, 3 presented oncentrifugal pump support. The three other deaths were caused by graft rejection, multiple organ failure, and multiple peripheral emboli. Biventricular assistdevices optimally provide cardiac outputs of 4 to 5 L/min, can be quicklyinserted often without requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, are easily explanted,and seem best suited for patients weighing less than 80 kg.
