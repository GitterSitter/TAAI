Matteo, Pavia.OBJECTIVES: To review experience with anaesthetic management in patientsundergoing a left ventricular assist system (LVAS) Novacor implant as a bridge tocardiac transplantation.DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study.SETTING: Cardiothoracic operating room in a university hospital.PATIENTS: Nine, aged 37-62 years, suffering from 8 dilated and 1 postischemiccardiomyopathy at end stage heart failure. INTERVENTIONS OR METHODS: Undergeneral anaesthesia and cardio-pulmonary bypass the LVAS pump is placed in theabdomen and connected to the left ventricle through an inflow cannula and to the aorta through an outflow cannula. The pump has an output of 5-7 l/min and worksin synchronous counterpulsation with the left ventricle.RESULTS: The mean Novacor support has been 75.56 days (DS +/- 85.95). Five out of9 patients have been transplanted, while 3 are still waiting at home.Pretransplant CI was on average 1.66 l/min/m2 (DS +/- 0.27) and REF 11.44% (DS+/- 5.29); after the Novacor implant CI was 3.44 (DS +/- 0.49) and REF 22.22% (DS+/- 4.49).CONCLUSIONS: A LVAS can bridge patients to heart transplantation while improving or preserving their health conditions. Some factors are to be taken into account for the anaesthesiological management of the implant/explant of a LVAS: thepatients' poor clinical conditions; the knowledge of the components andfunctioning of the LVAS that conditions the choice of the anaesthesiologicaldrugs and volemia; the unassisted right ventricle function that has to bepharmacologically supported; the bleeding problem because of the adherencesduring the explant surgery.
