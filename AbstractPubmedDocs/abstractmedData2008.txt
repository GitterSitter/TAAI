J Heart Lung Transplant. 1994 Nov-Dec;13(6):1125-32.Recovery of major organ function in patients awaiting heart transplantation with Thoratec ventricular assist devices. Thoratec Ventricular Assist Device PrincipalInvestigators.Farrar DJ(1), Hill JD.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, California Pacific Medical Center, SanFrancisco 94115.The time course of recovery of hepatic and renal function was determined in 193patients receiving Thoratec ventricular assist devices while awaitingtransplantation at 41 hospitals in eight countries. The duration of circulatorysupport averaged 26 days (maximum 248 days) and the average ventricular assistdevice blood flow index was 2.7 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2 compared with a preoperativecardiac index of 1.4 +/- 0.7 L/min/m2. Renal and hepatic function improved inmost patients in 1 to 3 weeks of support. When comparing patients with thelongest durations on the ventricular assist device (60 to 248 days) to patientswith the shortest durations (< 7 days), laboratory values were significantlyimproved: creatinine (-29%, from 1.7 +/- 1.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dl), blood ureanitrogen (-32%, from 37 +/- 27 to 25 +/- 14 mg/dl), serum glutamic-oxaloacetictransaminase (-81%, from 397 +/- 702 to 76 +/- 45 IU) and total bilirubin (-79%, from 7.0 +/- 8.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.7 mg/dl). However, the posttransplantation survivalthrough hospital discharge was not significantly different: 88% (14 of 16) forpatients supported for at least 60 days and 86% (43 of 50) for patients whounderwent transplantation after only 1 week of support. Therefore renal andhepatic function improve during ventricular assist device support, but thesurvival rate after transplantation is not related to duration and is comparable to that of conventional heart transplantation for short or long periods ofventricular assist support. Although it is clearly important not to proceed totransplantation in patients with irreversible organ failure who have ventricular assist devices, these data suggest that as long as the patient is on the path to recovery, the outcome is basically the same as for patients who have fullrecovery of renal and hepatic function.
