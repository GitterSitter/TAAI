The TandemHeart percutaneousventricular assist device can provide temporary support until another device can be placed or a donor heart becomes available. We examined the TandemHeart'seffect on cardiac index, central venous pressure, mixed venous oxygen saturation,creatinine, mean arterial pressure, urine output, and 30-day mortality rate in 5 heart-failure patients (2 with nonischemic and 3 with ischemic cardiomyopathy;mean preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.17 +/- 0.056). Twopatients were undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation when the device wasinserted. The average duration of TandemHeart support was 7.6 +/- 3.2 days; allpatients were successfully bridged to transplantation. The TandemHeart improvedthe cardiac index (1.9 +/- 0.3 vs 3.5 +/- 0.8 L/[min.m2], P= 0.01), mean arterialpressure (69 +/- 12.5 vs 91 +/- 4.3 mmHg, P=0.009), mixed venous oxygensaturation (45.4 +/- 14.3 vs 71.4 +/- 7.5, P=0.009), and urine output (1,861 +/- 988 vs 4,314 +/- 1,346 mL/hr, P=0.01). The device decreased central venouspressure (21.2 +/- 7.4 vs 12.8 +/- 5.9 mmHg, P=0.02) and pressor requirements(2.4 +/- 1.1 vs 1.0 +/- 0.7 agents, P=0.02). Average long-term follow-up afterheart transplantation was 8.4 +/- 9.9 months, with no deaths. We conclude thatthe TandemHeart can provide hemodynamic support for patients with profound,refractory cardiogenic shock. Furthermore, the device can bridge patients tocardiac transplantation and can be placed percutaneously, without invasivesurgery.PMCID: PMC2607106
