Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2002 Apr;14(2):178-86.Mechanical circulatory support: new advances, new pumps, new ideas.Frazier OH(1).Author information: (1)Cardiopulmonary Transplantation Service, Cullen Cardiovascular ResearchLaboratories, Texas Heart Institute, Houston, TX 77225-0345, USA.Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a viable therapy for severe end-stageheart disease. Most obstacles to long-term MCS therapy have been overcome, and a number of clinical trials, including the recent REMATCH trial, have shown a clearbenefit in terms of survival and improved quality of life. MCS should thereforeno longer be considered as simply a temporary bridge to other therapies, but alsoa destination therapy whose potential should continue to expand through thedevelopment and use of newer, more innovative devices such as continuous flowpumps, next-generation centrifugal pumps, and total artificial hearts. Thehomebound heart failure patient and the patient facing imminent death frommassive myocardial infarction receive little statistical benefit from currenttherapies, and the new and evolving MCS technologies offer the potential foreffective therapy to these desperately ill patients.Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).
