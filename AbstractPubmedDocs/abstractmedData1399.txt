Skirball Center for Cardiovascular Research, Cardiovascular ResearchFoundation, Orangeburg, NY 10962, USA.BACKGROUND: With improved technology, increasing clinical experience, andexpanding indications for use, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) areassuming a greater role in the care of patients with end-stage heart failure.Early in the course of LVAD use as a bridge to transplant, it became evident thatsome patients exhibit substantial recovery of ventricular function, which led to the concept of reverse remodeling.METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein we summarize and integrate insights derived from amultitude of studies that have investigated how LVAD support influencesventricular structural, cellular, extracellular matrix, molecular, biochemical,and metabolic characteristics of the end-stage failing heart. The focus includes a review of the extent and sustainability of reverse remodeling, the importantadvances in understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure derived fromthese studies and the implications of these findings for development of newtherapeutic strategies.CONCLUSION: In brief, studies of LVAD-heart interactions have led to theunderstanding that although we once considered the end-stage failing heart ofpatients near death to be irreversibly diseased, when given sufficient mechanicalunloading and restoration of more normal neurohormonal milieu, a relatively largedegree of myocardial recovery is possible. Comparison of effects on right andleft ventricles have provided mechanistic insights by implicating hemodynamicunloading as primarily regulating certain aspects of reverse remodeling,neurohormonal factors as regulating other aspects, and joint regulation of still other aspects. As such these observations have driven a shift of thinking ofchronic heart failure as a progressive irreversible disease process to apotentially treatable entity.
