The high mortality ratesfor medically treated stage D heart failure have not improved in the last 10years, and patients at this advanced stage require either palliative measures or surgical management of heart failure. In recent years, surgically implantedventricular assist devices (VADs) have become available for long-term use and arenow commonly used as a therapy for advanced heart failure. The data generatedfrom this early experience have clearly shown that VADs improve survival andquality of life in patients with advanced heart failure when implanted as atemporary measure or as long-term support. However, with a growing heart failure population, there is much work to be done to continually improve VAD technology, patient selection criteria, and postimplantation management to define the optimalrole for assist devices in the management of systolic heart failure.Copyright Â© 2011.
