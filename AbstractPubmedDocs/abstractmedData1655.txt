Treatment choices includepharmacologic, psychological, and surgical interventions. Recent data suggestthat mechanical heart pumps, or assist devices, are viable additions oralternatives to transplantation in management of advanced heart failure. Aventricular assist device (VAD) can support the circulation when the naturalheart is unable to maintain adequate perfusion. Although its use continues to be explored, VADs can be used in three ways: as a bridge to transplantation, as adestination therapy (or implanted permanently), or as a bridge to recovery. AsVAD science advances, nurses will needs to understand its practice implications.
