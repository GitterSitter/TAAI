We aimed to assess the utility of the SHFM by validationin patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for heart transplantation.METHODS: We assessed the SHFM performance in 382 patients with CRT and/or ICDreferred for heart transplantation. Outcome was survival free from urgenttransplantation or left ventricular assist device. Model discrimination andcalibration were assessed graphically and by formal tests.RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, 195 events occurred. One-, 2-, and3-year observed event-free survival was 77%, 62%, and 52%, and the observed topredicted event-free survival ratio was 0.89, 0.80, and 0.76. Calibration plotsdemonstrated results deviating from the ideal calibration line at 1, 2, and 3years. The SHFM score adequately assigned patients in discrete risk strata,according to Kaplan-Meier estimated survival. Time-dependent receiver operatingcharacteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination overall, which wasslightly better for 1-year (area under the curve [AUC] 0.774) compared with2-year (AUC 0.742) and 3-year (AUC 0.728) event-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: The SHFM has good discrimination but underestimates risk of adverse outcomes in patients with CRT and/or ICD referred for heart transplantation. The SHFM may be used to assess relative risk and changes over time, but whenassessing absolute percentage of event-free survival, the overestimation ofevent-free survival should be accounted for.Copyright Â© 2014 Mosby, Inc.
