Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have beenincreasingly used as a bridge support to heart transplantation in children. Weaimed to examine the profiles of CRP in children receiving VAD support.METHODS: Charts of 13 children receiving Berlin Heart EXCOR(®) from 2005 to 2009 were reviewed. The data obtained prior to and during VAD support included: CRP,white blood cells, inotropes and steroid use, VAD mode and duration of VADsupport. Ten patients received left VAD (LVAD) and 3 biventricular VAD (BiVAD).RESULTS: The median duration of VAD support was 59 days (ranged 3-678 days).Pre-VAD CRP was 35 ± 51 mg/l and increased to 109 ± 59 mg/l on days 1-3 after theVAD implantation (P = 0.01), then gradually decreased to 28 ± 28 mg/l by 4 monthsand normalized by 5 months (P < 0.0001). CRP was higher in BiVAD than in LVADpatients throughout the study period (P = 0.003). CRP positively correlated with the doses of the epinephrine and norepinephrine and the monocyte counts, andnegatively correlated with the lymphocyte count. The lymphocyte count was 2.5 ±0.4 x 10(9)/l prior to implantation, and decreased to 2.1 ± 1.3 x 10(9)/l on days1-3 (P = 0.5) and then to 0.6 ± 0.1 x 10(9)/l by 6 months (P = 0.08). It tendedto be lower in BiVAD patients (P = 0.06).CONCLUSIONS: SIR exists in children prior to VAD support. VAD implantation isassociated with a significant and prolonged increase in CRP and a decrease inlymphocyte count, indicating a suppressed immune function, being more pronounced in BiVAD patients.PMCID: PMC3422931
