Unfortunately, due to the limited pool of organs, many of thesechildren do not survive to transplant. Mechanical circulatory support of thefailing heart in pediatrics is a new and rapidly developing field world-wide. It is utilized in children with acute congestive heart failure associated withcongenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis, both as a bridge totransplantation and as a bridge to myocardial recovery. The current arsenal ofmechanical assist devices available for children is limited to ECMO, intra-aorticballoon counterpulsation, centrifugal pump ventricular assist devices, theDeBakey ventricular assist device Child; the Thoratec ventricular assist device; and the Berlin Heart. In the spring of 2004, five contracts were awarded by theNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to support preclinical development for arange of pediatric ventricular assist devices and similar circulatory supportsystems. The support of early development efforts provided by this program isexpected to yield several devices that will be ready for clinical trials withinthe next few years. Our work reviews the current international experience withmechanical circulatory support in children and summarizes our own experiencesince 2005 with the Berlin Heart, comparing the indications for use, length ofsupport, and outcome between these modalities.PMCID: PMC2845794
