We present the case of a34-year old patient who underwent HeartAssist 5 (HA5) implantation as a bridge tocardiac transplant. After an initial uneventful recovery, he developed a pumpthrombosis that was refractory to medical treatment. We present the surgicaltechnique used to exchange the HA5 with a HeartWare (HVAD), leaving the oldinflow-sewing ring in situ.PMCID: PMC3653478
