Thisproject aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a bridge-to-transplantation(BTT)-VAD approach relative to direct heart transplantation intransplant-eligible patients.METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was used to evaluate survival benefits andcosts for BTT-VAD versus nonbridged heart transplant recipients. Three different scenarios were considered according to severity of patients' baseline hemodynamicstatus (high, medium, and low risk). Results are presented in terms of survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analyses were used to analyzeuncertainty in model estimates. Over a 20-year time horizon, BTT-VAD therapyincreased survival at an increased cost relative to nonbridged heart transplantrecipients: $100 841more in costs and 1.19 increased life years (LYs) inhigh-risk patients ($84 964/LY), $112 779 more in costs and 1.14 more LYs ($99039/LY) in medium-risk patients, and an additional cost of $144 334 andincremental clinical benefit of 1.21 more LYs ($119 574/LY) in low-risk patients.The sensitivity analysis estimated a 59%, 54%, and 43% chance of BTT-VAD therapy being cost-effective for high-, medium-, and low-risk patients at awillingness-to-pay level of $100 000/LY. Subgroup analyses indicated that risk ofpost-VAD and transplantation complications, waiting time, renal dysfunction, and patient age substantially affected the cost-effectiveness ratio.CONCLUSIONS: BTT-VAD therapy is associated with improved survival and increasedcosts. On the basis of commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, BTT-VADtherapy is likely to be cost-effective relative to nonbridged hearttransplantation in specific circumstances.
