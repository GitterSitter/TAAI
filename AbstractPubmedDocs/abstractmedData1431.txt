Pre-synaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors are essential feedbackregulators to control the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves. Inthis study we tested whether a deletion polymorphism in the humanalpha2C-adrenoceptor gene (alpha2CDel322-325) affects progression of heartfailure in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped and phenotyped 345 patients presenting with DCMin the heart transplant unit of the German Heart Institute, starting in 1994.Patients were treated according to guidelines (99% ACEI, 76% beta-blockers) andwere followed until December 2002 or until a first event [death, hearttransplantation, or implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for alife-threatening condition] occurred. Mean follow-up time was 249 weeks (4.9years) in event-free patients and 104 weeks (2 years) in patients with events.During follow-up, 51% of the patients exhibited an event: death (18%),implantation of LVAD as bridging for transplantation (7%), or hearttransplantation (25%). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, DCM patients with the deletionvariant Del322-325 in the alpha2C-adrenoceptor showed significantly decreasedevent rates (P=0.0043). Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of thedeletion was associated with reduced death rate (relative risk: 0.129, 95% CI:0.18-0.9441, P=0.044) and event rates (relative risk: 0.167, 95% CI: 0.041-0.685,P=0.012).CONCLUSION: Alpha2C-adrenoceptor deletion may be a novel, strong, and independentpredictor of reduced event rates in DCM patients treated according to guidelines.
