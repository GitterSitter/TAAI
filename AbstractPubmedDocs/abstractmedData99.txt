We undertook amulticenter single-arm study to assess the C-Pulse System in such patients.METHODS: New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or ambulatoryfunctional class IV HF patients were eligible. Safety was assessed continuouslythrough 12 months. Efficacy measurements included changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months in NYHA functional class, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF)and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, 6-min walk distance(6MWD), and exercise peak oxygen consumption (pVO2; 6 months only).RESULTS: Twelve men and 8 women (56.7 ± 7 years, 34 to 71 years of age) withischemic (n = 7) or nonischemic (n = 13) cardiomyopathy were implanted. There wasno 30-day mortality and no neurological events or myocardial infarctions through 12 months. At 6 months, there were 3 deaths (1 device-related). One-year survivalwas 85%. At 6 months, C-Pulse produced improvements in NYHA functional class (3.1± 0.3 to 1.9 ± 0.7, p = 0.0005), MLWHF (63.6 ± 19.9 to 40.2 ± 23.2, p = 0.0005), and KCCQ scores (43.6 ± 21.1 to 65.6 ± 21.5, p = 0.0002), but not 6MWD (275.5 ±64.0 to 296.4 ± 104.9, p = NS) or pVO2 (14.5 ± 3.6 to 13.1 ± 4.4, p = NS).Improvements continued at 12 months, with 6MWD change becoming statisticallysignificant (336.5 ± 91.8, p = 0.0425).CONCLUSIONS: Use of C-Pulse in this population is feasible, appears safe, andimproves functional status and QoL. A prospective, multicenter, randomizedcontrolled trial is underway. (C-Pulse IDE Feasability Study-A Heart AssistSystem; NCT00815880).Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
