Due to the lack of donor organs, cardiac transplantation can have only a minimal epidemiologicimpact. Advances in left ventricular assist device development and experiencewith management and surgical implantation techniques have slowly improved thefield, and the use of these devices to treat severe heart failure is gainingacceptance. The Texas Heart Institute has remained at the forefront of artificialheart research, currently utilizing both short- and long-term devices asbridge-to-transplant, bridge-to-recovery, or destination therapy. These devicesprovide varying degrees of support and, depending on their design, are implanted either surgically in the operating room or percutaneously in the cardiaccatheterization laboratory. Despite the remarkable progress in left ventricularassist device development, there are several improvements to be made that maypotentially increase their acceptance by patients and referring doctors.
