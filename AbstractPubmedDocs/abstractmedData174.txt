Epub 2013 Oct 16.Use of Foley catheter for insertion of ventricular assist device inflow cannula.Mohite PN(1), Sabashnikov A(1), Zych B(1), Popov AF(2), Simon AR(1).Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation & Mechanical Support, RoyalBrompton and Harefield NHS Trust, Harefield Hospital, Harefield, UK.(2)Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation & Mechanical Support, RoyalBrompton and Harefield NHS Trust, Harefield Hospital, Harefield, UKPopov@med.uni-goettingen.de.Ventricular assist devices are fast becoming an accepted alternative to treatend-stage heart failure, and are being implemented as a bridge to myocardialrecovery, a bridge to heart transplantation, or as destination therapy.Positioning of the inflow cannula into the apex of the ventricle is a crucialstep due to the risk of sucking in air. We describe an improved method ofpreparing the insertion site for the ventricular assist device inflow cannula, tominimize the chances of air embolism and blood spillage, which we applied in a34-year-old man, as a bridge to transplantation.Â© The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions:sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.
