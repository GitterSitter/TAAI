A logistic regression analysis wasperformed to identify the independent variables associated with 30-day mortality.RESULTS: Between February 2006 and November 2009, 745 patients in ourestablishment received ECLS. In the single-centre cohort, we retrospectivelyreviewed 77 patients who had required ECLS support for AMI with CS. The delaybetween AMI and CS ECLS was 15 ± 4 h. PCI was performed in 58 patients (75.3%)and isolated emergency CABG in 12 (15.6%). The remaining 7 patients (9.1%) didnot undergo revascularization. ECLS duration averaged 9.8 ± 7.1 days. Nineteenpatients were successfully weaned from ECLS (24%). Fifty-eight patients did notundergo or did not tolerate the weaning trial (76%). Forty patients died duringECLS support, 13 were implanted with a mono-ventricular (n = 9) or biventricular assist device (n = 4) and 5 were bridged to heart transplantation. Complications consisted primarily in pneumonia (51.3%) and acute renal failure requiringhaemofiltration (46.1%). Pulmonary oedema occurred in 24 patients (31.6%) andmajor bleeding in 16 (21.33%). 30-day and in-hospital survival rates were,respectively, 38.9 and 33.8%. Multivariable analysis identified preimplantationlactate serum level, preimplantation creatinine serum level and previouscardiopulmonary resuscitation as independent predictors of 30-day mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Prompt ECLS support is an effective strategy and provides areasonable chance of survival in patients with AMI associated with profound CS.As shown in our results pertaining to predictive risk factors for 30-daymortality, reducing the duration of end-organ ischaemia is the keystone tomanagement of this patient population. A major remaining challenge will consistin preventing pulmonary oedema following peripheral ECLS.
