This therapy has been shown to increase survival and improve morbidity in carefully selected patients waitingfor heart transplantation. With approximately 30000 patients being listedworldwide for transplant every year and only 3500 transplantations performedannually, alternative strategies need to be developed to minimize morbidity andmortality in this high-risk population. Patient selection remains the primarydeterminant of success with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. Thisarticle will review both the cardiac and extracardiac considerations needed inthe assessment of patient suitability for LVAD support as a bridge totransplantation.
