Medical therapies intended to slow or reversedisease progression have been shown to improve prognosis in prospective trials.Improvement in prognosis has also been observed in large cohorts across timestrata. However, near-term mortality for those with advanced disease remainsunacceptably high. Prognosis in advanced heart failure may be assessed with theappropriate use of clinical prediction tools. Optimal timing of evaluation forheart transplantation and/or mechanical circulatory support depends on anunderstanding of these issues.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
