In addition, inotropes are considered to be harmful in nonischemic HF.METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the association of in-hospital inotrope use with(1) major events (death, ventricular assist device, or heart transplant) and (2) study days alive and out of hospital during the first 6 months in the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery CatheterizationEffectiveness, which excluded patients with immediate need for inotropic therapy.Predefined subgroups of interest were baseline SBP <100 versus ≥ 100 mm Hg,cardiac index <1.8 vs ≥ 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2), and ischemic versus nonischemic HFetiology. Inotropes were frequently used in both the <100 mm Hg (88/165 [53.3%]) and the ≥ 100 mm Hg (106/262 [40.5%]) SBP subgroups and were associated withhigher risk for major events in both subgroups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-5.12 [P < .001]; and HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.02-3.37 [P = .042]; respectively). Risk with inotropes was more pronounced among thosewith cardiac index ≥ 1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 114; HR 4.65, 95% CI 1.98-10.9; P <.001) vs <1.8 L min(-1) m(-2) (n = 82; HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.61-3.58; P = .39). Eventrates were higher with inotropes in both ischemic (n = 215; HR 2.64, 95% CI1.49-4.68; P = .001) and nonischemic (n = 216; HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.18-4.07; P =.012) patients. Across all subgroups, patients who received inotropes spent fewerstudy days alive and out of hospital.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of cardiogenic shock or end-organ hypoperfusion,inotrope use during hospitalization for HF was associated with unfavorable6-month outcomes, regardless of admission SBP, cardiac index, or HF etiology.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
