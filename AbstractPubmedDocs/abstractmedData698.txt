With expandingclinical experience and continued technical advances, continuous-flow pumps areevolving from bridge to transplantation to destination therapy for advanced heartfailure. This review describes the clinical use and outcome of currentlyavailable miniaturized left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). It provides anoutlook of the ongoing process of the miniaturization of LVADs, new concepts ofpartial support and, furthermore, it commentates on the current challenges withLVADs and the 5-year perspective.
