Ann Thorac Surg. 1994 Jun;57(6):1416-22; discussion 1421-2.Improved survival after extended bridge to cardiac transplantation.Frazier OH(1), Macris MP, Myers TJ, Duncan JM, RadovanceviÄ‡ B, Parnis SM, Cooley DA.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Research, Texas Heart Institute/St. Luke'sEpiscopal Hospital, Houston.In the past, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support was frequently plaguedby complications; thus, bridge to transplantation times were kept short.Increasing evidence suggests that extended bridging provides greater benefit due to improved end-organ perfusion and, thus, generally improved physical condition.To assess whether extended bridging translates into improved long-term survivalafter transplantation, we reviewed our experience with the HeartMate 1000 IP LVAD(Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, MA). Since January 1988, 19 patients (meanage, 45 +/- 9 years) have undergone extended bridging (mean time, 106 +/- 57days). Their mean weight was 82 +/- 16 kg, and their mean body surface area was2.0 +/- 0.2 m2. We define "extended" as the length of support necessary forsystemic organ recovery after prolonged heart failure. During support, averagepump flow indices ranged from 2.3 to 3.3 L.min-1.m-2, and all patients underwent physical rehabilitation. Between the time of LVAD implantation and explantation, the mean serum creatinine value decreased from 1.63 +/- 0.6 to 1.25 +/- 0.6 mg/dL(p = not significant), and the mean serum total bilirubin value decreased from2.8 +/- 2.0 to 0.63 +/- 0.11 mg/dL (p < 0.05). All but 1 patient improved fromNew York Heart Association class IV to class I. Device-related complications wereminimal. Twelve control patients ("de facto randomized") who did not receive the LVAD also were evaluated: actuarial survival at 1 year was 0% (p < 0.05); 3 (25%)underwent transplantation and died within 2 months; 9 (75%) died beforetransplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
