Five patients had a pneumatic device,and 5 had an electric device. All except 1 patient with an electric device hadthe pump for an extended period.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Median time on the ventilator was 6.2 days, andmedian time in the ICU was 14 days. Significant hemodynamic improvement wasobserved by echocardiography and invasive monitoring. Milrinone and epinephrinesupplemented by prostaglandin E1 were the most commonly used drugs to avoidright-sided heart failure. Nine patients were transplanted after pump therapy of 241 days (median) (range, 56 to 873 days). One patient died because ofendovascular infection and septicemia. Infectious complications were frequent,especially when the pump time was extended.CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of an LVAD program in a nontransplanting center canbe achieved with good results. Intense collaboration with a transplant center is mandatory. The complication rate increased when treatment times were extended.
