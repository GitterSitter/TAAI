Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg Pediatr Card Surg Annu. 2006:99-108.Mechanical cardiac support in the young with the Berlin Heart EXCOR pulsatileventricular assist device: 15 years' experience.Hetzer R(1), Alexi-Meskishvili V, Weng Y, HÃ¼bler M, Potapov E, Drews T, Hennig E,Kaufmann F, Stiller B.Author information: (1)Deutsches Herzzentrum, Berlin, Germany.The pediatric-size pneumatically driven pulsatile extracorporeal ventricularassist device (VAD) Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart Mediprodukt GmbH, Berlin,Germany) was introduced into clinical practice by the German Heart InstituteBerlin in 1992. Until July 1, 2005, Berlin Heart EXCOR systems have been used forcirculatory support in 68 children up to 18 years of age with severe circulatory failure resistant to pharmacologic therapy. These were patients suffering fromcardiomyopathy, fulminant myocarditis, end-stage congenital cardiac defects, and acute heart failure following congenital heart surgery. Mean VAD support time was35 days (range, 0 to 420 days). Forty-two patients (62%) survived totransplantation or after weaning; 37 patients (54%), including eight infants,were discharged home. These results in patients with very advanced disease haveimproved significantly in recent years because of technical developments andgrowing experience in the treatment of patients on the device, in postoperativecare and optimal timing for VAD implantation. Timely implantation of the BerlinHeart EXCOR in the course of progressive heart failure now appears to bejustified because the system has undergone the necessary modifications and theaccumulation of clinical knowledge has made its use highly reliable and safe.
