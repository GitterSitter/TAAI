ASAIO Trans. 1989 Jul-Sep;35(3):539-41.Mechanical circulatory support for perioperative donor heart failure.Radovancevic B(1), Nakatani T, Frazier OH, Moncrief C, Vega J, Haupt H, DuncanJM.Author information: (1)Cullen Cardiovascular Surgical Research Laboratories, Texas Heart Institute,Houston 77225.Perioperative acute donor heart failure can be caused by various factors, such asrecipient pulmonary hypertension, marginal donor heart function, or immunologicmismatch. Of 265 patients who underwent orthotopic transplantation, four receivedmechanical support for acute perioperative donor heart failure. In two patientswith reactive pulmonary hypertension, right heart bypass (RHB) with a centrifugalpump was used for 53 and 36 hr, respectively. One patient who experiencedbiventricular donor heart failure was supported for three days with anintraarterial, transvalvular, axial-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD).Circulation was supported effectively with the LVAD, despite an initial absenceof right ventricular function. The fourth patient, who had signs of heartfailure, received intraaortic balloon pump support for 24 hr aftertransplantation. All four patients were weaned from circulatory support, andheart function was restored in each; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 63% (range from 57 to 71%). One patient died of fungal infection 14 daysafter being weaned from pump support, another died of lymphoma two months aftersupport was discontinued, and the remaining two patients are well 9 and 18 monthsafter transplantation. In cases of acute donor heart dysfunction, temporarymechanical assistance is a reliable option for supporting the circulation during heart recovery.
