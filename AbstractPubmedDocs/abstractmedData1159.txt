Weng, Yug [corrected to Weng, Yuguo].Early graft failure, particularly right ventricular dysfunction, remains asignificant determinant of early morbidity and mortality in heart transplantrecipients. If conservative medical management fails to help recover cardiacallograft function, mechanical circulatory support either bridging to recovery orretransplantation remains the last option. We report on a 16-year-old patientwith hypertropic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy who was weaned successfully from aright ventricular assist device (RVAD) after extended right ventricularmechanical support for three months following heart transplantation.
