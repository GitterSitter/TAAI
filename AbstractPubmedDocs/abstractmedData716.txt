However, success andapplicability of this therapy is largely limited by high complication ratesassociated with these devices. Although superior outcomes have been achieved withthe second-generation continuous-flow LVADs, device-related infections continueto be a prevalent complication in this patient population and contributesignificantly to the financial burden of this therapy due to an increased needfor hospitalizations and surgical interventions. Patient selection, device designand LVAD-induced immune system dysfunction appear to be major risk factors forthe development of device-related infections. Improvements in device design andbetter patient selection strategies, particularly with respect to identifyingindividuals with genetic susceptibility to device-related infections, may furtherreduce this prevalent complication and improve outcomes in patients with advancedheart failure.PMCID: PMC3205433
