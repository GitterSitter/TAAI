We aimed to propose a practicalechocardiographic assessment to diagnose LVAD malfunction secondary to pumpthrombosis.METHODS: Among 52 patients implanted with a CF-LVAD from a single center whounderwent echocardiographic pump speed-change testing, 12 had suspected pumpthrombosis as determined by clinical, laboratory, and/or device parameters.Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation was performed at baseline pump speedand at each 1,000-rpm interval from the low setting of 8,000 rpm to the highsetting of 11,000 rpm in 11 of these patients.RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic curves and stepwise logisticregression analyses showed that the best diagnostic parameters included changesin the LV end-diastolic diameter (<0.6 cm), aortic valve opening time (<80 msec),and deceleration time of mitral inflow (<70 msec) from lowest to highest pumpspeed. One parameter was predictive of pump malfunction, with 100% sensitivityand 89% specificity, whereas 2 of 3 parameters increased the sensitivity to 100% and specificity to 95%.CONCLUSIONS: The 3 echocardiographic variables of measured changes in LVend-diastolic diameter, aortic valve opening time, and deceleration time ofmitral inflow between the lowest (8,000 rpm) and highest pump speed settings(11,000 rpm) during echo-guided pump speed-change testing appear highly accurate in diagnosing device malfunction in the setting of pump thrombosis among patientssupported with CF-LVAD. Further investigation is warranted to create and validatea prediction score.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
