After the introduction of portable blood pump systems into clinical practice, we now study the performance characteristics of totally implantable mechanical circulatory support systemswhich do not require percutaneous drive lines or percutaneous electrical wiring. As a matter of fact, transcutaneous energy transfer is now achieved by induction,and pump controller performance read-out and pump parameter adjustment isperformed by telemetry. The indication for clinical use of such devices has to beevaluated carefully. Mainly patients in need of a heart transplant but havingcontraindications to move forward (advanced age, former neoplasm, persistentantibodies) have benefits from such devices as destination therapy.
