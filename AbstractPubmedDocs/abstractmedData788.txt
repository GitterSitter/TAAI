Mean age was 43.7 ± 13.6 years.The main causes of cardiac failure were ischemic cardiomyopathy (39%), idiopathicdilated cardiomyopathy (41.3%), or myocarditis (6.4%). Bridge to transplantation was indicated in 87.8% of patients, bridge to recovery in 9%, while destinationtherapy was proposed in 3.2% of patients.RESULTS: For patients in cardiogenic shock or advanced heart failure undergoingdevice implantation as bridge to transplantation or recovery (n=458), overallmortality was 39% (n=179). The main causes of mortality under MCS weremulti-organ failure (MOF) (57.4%), neurological events (14.1%), or infections(11.9%). Heart transplantation was performed in 249 (54.3%) patients. The maincauses of death following heart transplantation were primary graft failure(22.4%), MOF (14.3%), neurological event (14.3%), or infection (10.2%). Long-termsurvival in transplanted patients was 75 ± 2.8% at 1 year and 66 ± 3.4% at 5years.CONCLUSIONS: MCS is an essential therapeutic tool to save the life of youngpatients with cardiogenic shock or advanced cardiac failure. Early MCSimplantation and the availability of a device that is adapted to the patient'sclinical status are prerequisites for reducing overall mortality rates.Copyright © 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
