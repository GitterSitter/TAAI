An initial design of the impeller for this axial flow bloodpump was performed using computational fluid dynamics analysis, includingpressure-flow characteristics, scalar stress estimations, blood damage indices,and fluid force predictions. A plastic prototype was constructed for hydraulicperformance testing, and these experimental results were compared with thenumerical predictions. The numerical predictions and experimental findings of thepump performance demonstrated a pressure generation of 2-16 mm Hg for 50-750ml/min over 5,500-7,500 RPM with deviation found at lower rotational speeds. The axial fluid forces remained below 0.1 N, and the radial fluid forces weredetermined to be virtually zero due to the centered impeller case. The scalarstress levels remained below 250 Pa for all operating conditions. Blood damageanalysis yielded a mean residence time of the released particles, which was foundto be less than 0.4 seconds for both flow rates that were examined, and a maximumresidence time was determined to be less than 0.8 seconds. We are in the process of designing a cage with hydrodynamically shaped filament blades to act as adiffuser and optimizing the impeller blade shape to reduce the flow vorticity at the pump outlet. This blood pump will improve the clinical treatment of patients with failing Fontan physiology and provide a unique catheter-based therapeuticapproach as a bridge to recovery or transplantation.
