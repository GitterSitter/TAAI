Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med. 2005 May;7(1):47-54.Left Ventricular Assist Devices for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure.Haddad M, Lam K, Hendry P, Mesana T, Davies R.The mainstay of heart failure therapy is aggressive medical management withconsideration of resynchronization therapy and automatic implantablecardioverter-defibrillator. This is best done with the support of amultidisciplinary team. Transplantation, when possible, remains the therapy ofchoice for patients who are refractory to medical therapy. Other options short ofleft ventricular assist device (LVAD) that should be considered includerevascularization, mitral valve repair, and left ventricular remodelingprocedures. LVAD therapy as a bridge to transplantation should be considered inpatients with heart failure who are clinically deteriorating while on thetransplant waiting list. This should be initiated prior to the onset ofirreversible end-organ damage. In nontransplant candidates, an LVAD can beconsidered as an alternative to transplantation (destination therapy). However,cost and the availability of expertise continue to limit this therapy toquaternary care and research institutions.
