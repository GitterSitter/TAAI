Crit Care Med. 2006 Sep;34(9 Suppl):S268-77.Cardiac failure: mechanical support strategies.Boehmer JP(1), Popjes E.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine,The Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, USA.OBJECTIVE: Mechanical support of the circulation is necessary when heart failure becomes refractory to medical support and is typically applied when organdysfunction occurs as a result of hypoperfusion. However, in timing theintervention, it is important to apply mechanical support before multiple organfailure occurs. The objective of this work is to review the current strategiesfor mechanical circulatory support in patients with refractory cardiac failure.DESIGN: A review of the use of mechanical circulatory support is presented forpatients with refractory cardiac failure.PATIENTS: Data are taken from human studies that were selected to best exemplify the results that may be obtained from various forms of mechanical circulatorysupport.INTERVENTIONS: Commonly applied forms of mechanical support include mechanicalventilatory support, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, and hemodialysis orultrafiltration. If these measures fail, mechanical support of the circulationwith ventricular assist devices is possible in specialized centers with expertisein the implantation and management of these devices. The decision to pursuemechanical circulatory support in the critically ill patient is based on thecause of acute decompensation, the potential reversibility of the condition, and the possibility for other treatments to improve the underlying condition or, inhighly selected cases, heart transplantation. Newer forms of ventricularassistance that require less surgery are becoming available and may allow use in a broader range of critically ill patients.MAIN RESULTS: There is a range of means to mechanically support the circulationin patients with advanced heart failure.CONCLUSIONS: A variety of means to support the circulation have found applicationin the treatment of patients with refractory heart failure. More work is requiredto best identify populations who will benefit from the therapy and to refine the therapy to reduce associated risks.
