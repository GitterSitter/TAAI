One ofthe main complications inherent following institution of LVAD therapy is rightventricular (RV) failure, manifested by the need for inotropic and/or nitricoxide support >14Â days after LVAD implant and/or the need for right-sidedmechanical circulatory support. RV failure is a major contributor of significant morbidity and mortality after LVAD placement. The complex pathophysiology of RVfailure, which could potentially be related to RV myocardial dysfunction,interventricular dependence, and RV afterload, has led to inconsistencies inpredicting risk factors for RV dysfunction. Several strategies have evolved over the years of experience with mechanical circulatory support that have aimed toavoid as well as reduce the incidence of RV failure. It is imperative thatpatients who definitely need biventricular support are identified. Despite thenumerous risk factors identified in many studies as well as the development ofrisk factor profile scores, this continues to be a challenging problem. However, the lower incidence of RV failure following LVAD in the current era isencouraging, suggesting a favorable relationship between RV unloading andfunction, and continuous-flow physiology.
