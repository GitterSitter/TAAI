The purpose was to assess the safety and efficacy of the CardioWest Total Artificial Heart in transplant-eligible patients at risk forimminent death from irreversible biventricular cardiac failure. The primary endpoints included the rates of survival to heart transplantation and of survivalafter transplantation.RESULTS: Eighty-one patients received the artificial-heart device. The rate ofsurvival to transplantation was 79 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 68 to87 percent). Of the 35 control patients who met the same entry criteria but didnot receive the artificial heart, 46 percent survived to transplantation(P<0.001). Overall, the one-year survival rate among the patients who receivedthe artificial heart was 70 percent, as compared with 31 percent among thecontrols (P<0.001). One-year and five-year survival rates after transplantationamong patients who had received a total artificial heart as a bridge totransplantation were 86 and 64 percent.CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the total artificial heart improved the rate ofsurvival to cardiac transplantation and survival after transplantation. Thisdevice prevents death in critically ill patients who have irreversiblebiventricular failure and are candidates for cardiac transplantation.Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society
