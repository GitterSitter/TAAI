Extensive clinical study has been done with BTT in theadult population, but comparatively fewer data are available in the pediatricpopulation with regard to pulsatile devices.METHODS: Ten pediatric patients are presented, all of whom underwent BTT orrecovery with pneumatic paracorporeal systems. The Berlin Heart bi-ventricularassist device (BVAD) was utilized in 1 patient, the Medos VAD in 4 patients (1left ventricular assist device [LVAD], 3 BVADs) and the Thoratec VAD in 5patients (3 BVADs, 2 LVADs). The pediatric population consisted of 3 females and 7 males. Mean age of the population was 7.4 years, weight 25 kg and body surface area (BSA) 0.88 m(2). Etiology for heart failure consisted of 4 viral, 3congenital and 3 idiopathic cardiomyopathies. Before implant, all patients hadevidence of progressive cardiac failure despite inotropic support, and 2 patientshad been on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Mean duration on thedevice was 34.3 days (8 to 107 days).RESULTS: Two patients suffered stroke and recovered without sequelae. Twopatients died of ischemic stroke and 1 of sepsis. Seven patients survived (6transplanted and 1 weaned) for a survival rate of 70% compared with survival for ECMO as BTT, which was 40% to 50%. All survivors had complications related tobleeding, thromboembolic events and infections.CONCLUSIONS: The Thoratec VAD can be placed in small patients with large heartsthat can accommodate the available cannulas. The Berlin Heart and the Medos VADhave a selection of ventricles with small stroke volumes. All 3 systems can beused successfully in the pediatric population as BTT with better survival thanwith ECMO.
