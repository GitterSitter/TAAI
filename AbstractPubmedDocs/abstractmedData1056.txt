Infections with multidrug-resistant(MDR) organisms in VAD recipients present a high mortality rate. Daptomycin(Cubicin, Novartis, Nuremberg, Germany), a new cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, is useful for MDR gram-positive organisms. We report the successful use ofdaptomycin in patients presenting with MDR gram-positive infections after VADimplantation.METHODS: We retrospectively studied nine consecutive patients presenting withresistant gram-positive infections after VAD implantation treated withdaptomycin. We analyzed type of VAD, type of infection, responsiblemicroorganism, outcome, and adverse events.RESULTS: We studied nine patients (eight males, one female), of overall mean age of 51 +/- 8 years; 78% required a biventricular assist device or a left VAD(Berlin Heart, Berlin, Germany), 22% received other ventricular support.Sixty-six percent presented with catheter-related infections (CRIs). Therapy withdaptomycin was empirically initiated in all cases. The initial dose was 6 mg/kg, continued at 4 mg/kg. The mean duration of therapy was 16 +/- 5 days. Thereported pathogens were MRSA, 33%; E. faecium, 25%; methicillin-resistantstaphylococcus epidermidis, 12.5%; methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus,12.5%; others, 17%. Successful outcomes were reported in seven subjects (78%),with two patients succumbing due to multiorgan failure related to their heartcondition prior completing antibiotic therapy. No adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Among our VAD patients, daptomycin proved efficient as a therapy forCRI with bacteremia. However, controlled studies are necessary to evaluate thisantibiotic in patients presenting with VAD and MDR bacteremia.
