The application of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)is a promising approach in the case of severe and otherwise untreatable cardiacfailure. In our experience we have used two external centrifugal pumps for theextracorporeal biventricular cardiac support in a post-transplantation patientwho experienced severe rejection six months after heart transplantation. Our own series includes a total of ten implantations of LVAD's with six patients whocould be weaned from the device but only one long-term survivor. The clinicalresults are not encouraging which suggests that the heart of the patient whoneeds an LVAD has been damaged beyond any chance for later recovery. Obviouslytiming is the most crucial aspect of the decision to implant the device. It wouldappear that orthotopic implantation of the transplanted heart remains the method of definitive treatment.
