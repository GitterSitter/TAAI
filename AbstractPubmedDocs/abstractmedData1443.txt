Circulation. 2005 Aug 30;112(9 Suppl):I32-6.Myocardial recovery using ventricular assist devices: prevalence, clinicalcharacteristics, and outcomes.Simon MA(1), Kormos RL, Murali S, Nair P, Heffernan M, Gorcsan J, Winowich S,McNamara DM.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh,PA, USA.BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are important bridges to cardiactransplantation. VAD support may also function as a bridge to ventricularrecovery (BTR); however, clinical predictors of recovery and long-term outcomesremain uncertain. We examined the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes ofBTR subjects in a large single center series.METHODS AND RESULTS: We implanted VADs in 154 adults at the University ofPittsburgh from 1996 through 2003. Of these implants, 10 were BTR. This included 2/80 (2.5%) ischemic patients (supported 42 and 61 days, respectively). Bothsubjects had surgical revascularization, required perioperative left VAD support,and were alive and transplant-free at follow up (232 and 1319 days,respectively). A larger percentage of nonischemic patients underwent BTR (8/74,11%; age 30+/-14; 88% female; left ventricular ejection fraction 18+/-6%;supported 112+/-76 days). Three had myocarditis, 4 had post-partum cardiomyopathy(PPCM), and 1 had idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Five received biventricular support.After explantation, ventricular function declined in 2 PPCM patients who thenrequired transplantation. Ventricular recovery in the 6 nonischemic patientssurviving transplant-free was maintained (left ventricular ejection fraction54+/-5%; follow-up 1.5+/-0.9 years). Overall, 8 of 10 BTR patients are alive and free of transplant (follow-up 1.6+/-1.1 years).CONCLUSIONS: In a large single center series, BTR was evident in 11% ofnonischemic patients, and the need for biventricular support did not precluderecovery. For most BTR subjects presenting with acute inflammatorycardiomyopathy, ventricular recovery was maintained long-term. VAD support as BTRshould be considered in the care of acute myocarditis and PPCM.
