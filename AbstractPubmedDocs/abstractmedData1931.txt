Data were recorded with the LVADoff and LVAD on before (control) and during RV ischemia. Assessment of RVdiastolic function included RV myocardial relaxation (time constant of isovolumicpressure decay [tau]), RV chamber stiffness (slope of the end-diastolicpressure-volume relation), and RV filling dynamics (peak filling rate and meanfilling rate during early diastole).RESULTS: During control, full LVAD support did not alter RV tau (104 +/- 67 msec LVAD off versus 109 +/- 49 msec LVAD on, p > 0.50), RV diastolic stiffness (0.56 +/- 0.31 versus 0.51 +/- 0.25 mm Hg/ml, p > 0.20), peak filling rate (107 +/- 51 versus 119 +/- 82 ml/sec, p > 0.35) or mean filling rate during early diastole(32 +/- 28 versus 27 +/- 18 ml/sec, p > 0.40). With right coronary arteryocclusion, RV tau rose to 136 +/- 33 msec (p < 0.001), and RV diastolic stiffnessfell to 0.29 +/- 0.13 mm Hg/ml (p < 0.005), but there was no change in RV fillingrates (p > 0.20). With mechanical LV support during acute RV ischemia, there was no additional change in RV tau, diastolic stiffness, or filling dynamics (p >0.20).CONCLUSIONS: In intact animals, RV ischemia impaired RV relaxation and decreased chamber stiffness, but there was no change in RV filling rates. Mechanical LVsupport, during the control state and with RV ischemia, did not affect RVdiastolic performance.
