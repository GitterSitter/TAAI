These patients represent about 1% of the adults inthe United States, considering that heart failure is a contributing factor inmore than 250,000 deaths annually. It has been estimated that about 60,000patients per year in the United States could benefit from heart transplantationor long-term mechanical support. Because of the short supply of donor hearts for transplant, assist devices have become of great value. At least four assistdevices are clinically available, and two other devices are being investigated.Because cardiopulmonary by-pass is required for implantation of these devices,anesthetizing these critically compromised patients requires extensivemonitoring, skillful anesthetic management, and expert postoperative care.
