The application of rFVIIa innonapproved settings, as in cardiac surgery, has not been established. It raises concerns regarding its safety. We used rFVIIa in a patient with excessivenonsurgical bleeding on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which wasestablished for early graft failure after heart transplantation and after 3months of biventricular assist device support. After rFVIIa administration,cardiac thrombosis developed and caused the patient's death.Copyright (c) 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.All rights reserved.
