Epub2014 Jan 31.IntraVAD, an intra-ventricular assistive device for heart failure patients:design and proof of concept simulations.Hosseinipour M(1), Elahinia M, Wanna F.Author information: (1)Dynamic and Smart Systems Laboratory, The University of Toledo, Toledo, OH,USA, mhp@vt.edu.Ventricular assistive devices are approved by Food and Drug Administration as an alternative to heart transplant for congestive heart failure patients. Unlikeother devices requiring open-heart surgery, thin active flexible membrane ofIntraVAD, made of ionic polymer-metal composites and shape memory alloys (SMA),enables transcatheter implantation and eliminates thoracotomy. Actuationmechanism of the device mimics the natural motion of the heart, applies almost noshear stress on blood cells, and leaves no stagnant points. Hence, it reduceshemolysis and thrombosis risks. The first step in designing the device isdefining the objectives based on hemodynamics of eligible patients. A3-dimensional model is extracted from magnetic resonance images of a subject toprovide a precise representation of the inner shape of the ventricle. Numericalsolution to the mathematical model of the behavior of ionic polymer-metalcomposites is then used to check their compliancy with the objectives. Different actuator designs are evaluated to perform the desired motions and address thecardiac insufficiency. Using an iterative design and simulation process, various geometric and material parameters affecting the performance of the device areoptimized, including those of the antagonistic two-way SMA actuators. Althoughmethods and results provided here are for the left ventricle, the same are alsoapplicable to the right ventricle.
