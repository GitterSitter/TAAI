In addition, primary myocardial dysfunction related to myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy may cause end-stage cardiac failure inchildren or infants, although not as frequently as in adults. The need formechanical circulatory support may be either temporary until spontaneousmyocardial recovery, as in postcardiotomy cardiac failure, or prolonged untilheart transplantation in the absence of recovery. Two types of mechanicalcirculatory devices are suitable for the paediatric population: extracorporealmembrane oxygenation for short-term support; and ventricular assist devices forlong-term support as a bridge to transplantation. The aim of this review is todescribe the specific issues related to paediatric mechanical circulatory supportand the different types of devices available, to report on their rapidly growing use worldwide and on the outcomes for each indication and type of device, and to provide a perspective on the future developments and remaining challenges in thisfield.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.
