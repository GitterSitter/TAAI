Historically, the treatment options have been very limited forpediatric patients, but recent technological advances, combined with new researchinto circulatory support devices, are seeking alternative therapeutics optionsfor infants and children. We present a review of the technological advances ofmechanical circulatory support in the pediatric population, including the recent emergence of a new class of circulatory support devices for pediatric patientswith single ventricle physiology. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutepediatric circulatory support program is discussed, in addition to the use ofadult devices in pediatric applications, the Berlin Heart Excor, and severalother blood pumps in development for bridge-to-transplant and bridge-to-recovery support. These devices have the potential to generate a paradigm shift in thetreatment of the pediatric patients with heart failure--a shift is likely alreadybe underway.
