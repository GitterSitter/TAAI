Before implantation, 23% hadcardiac arrest, 38% were on a ventilator and 31% were on an intra-aortic balloon pump. Cardiac index was 1.6+/-0.5 L/min/m(2) and total bilirubin levels were39+/-59 micromol/L. During support, 29 patients (35%) died in the intensive care unit and seven (10%) died after leaving. Forty-seven patients (56%) were weanedor transplanted, with one still under support. Despite significantly moreadvanced preoperative end-organ dysfunction, survival rates were similar inpatients with biventricular devices (74%) and those undergoing isolated leftventricular support (24%) (63% versus 45%, respectively; p=0.2). Actuarialsurvival estimates after transplantation were 78.7+/-6.3%, 73.4+/-6.9% and62.6+/-8.3% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our experience validates the use of p-VAD as a primary device tosupport patients with cardiogenic shock. In contrast to short-term devices,p-VADs provide immediate ventricular unloading and pulsatile perfusion in asingle procedure. Biventricular support should be used liberally in patients withend-organ dysfunction.
