De Gasperis, Niguarda CÃ  Granda Hospital, Milan,Italy. emanuele.catena@tin.itAxial flow pumps have gained increased acceptance in recent years as a bridge to heart transplantation and, more recently, as destination therapy. As leftventricular (LV) assist device dysfunction will be increasingly prevalent, theaim of our work was to introduce an echocardiographic management protocol as aguide to recognize the causes of pump failure. In this article we describe theechocardiographic approach to 5 episodes of malfunction of an axial flow pump(DeBakey, MicroMed Technology Inc, Houston, Tex) in 4 patients: 4 episodes causedby thrombosis of LV assist device and one caused by abnormal increase of systemicvascular resistance. In our experience, echocardiography played a pivotal role inclinical management of LV assist device failure. It allowed us to: assess patencyand position of inflow and outflow cannulae; research the source ofthromboembolic material; assess adequate LV filling and unloading; and optimizeright ventricular function, volume replacement therapy, and pharmacologicsupport.
