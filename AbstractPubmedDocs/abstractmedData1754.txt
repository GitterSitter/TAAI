Recently, continuous flow axial impeller pumps were introduced to clinical application offering new advantages.METHODS: From November 1998 till September 2000, 6 male patients (mean age 53plus or minus 11 years) with end-stage left heart failure were implanted with aDeBakey ventricular assist device (VAD) axial-flow pump for bridge totransplantation.RESULTS: Three patients were successfully transplanted after 74, 115, and 117days, respectively. Two other patients died after 25 and 133 days. One patient isstill on the device after 108 days. Because of modification of the implantationtechnique after the first 2 patients, mean pump-flow within the first 3 weeks wasincreased from 4.3 +/- 0.6 L/min to 6.7 +/- 0.3 L/min. Patients were put onregular bicycle-ergometer training and improved their exercise capacities up to amean maximum oxygen consumption of 20.2 mL/kg/min.CONCLUSIONS: Initial implants of the DeBakey VAD demonstrated support properties comparable to pulsatile pumps but without significant restrictions for extendeduse.
