Pulmonary endarterectomyshould not be delayed for medical therapy, and risk stratification helps todefine patients likely to achieve the best outcome. Inoperable patients should bereferred for trials of medical agents. Atrial septostomy is promising butunderutilized, although better ways of ensuring an adequate, lasting septostomystill need to be determined. Indications for the procedure are unchanged, and it should be considered more frequently. Bilateral sequential lung or heart-lungtransplantation is an important option for selected patients, and potentialcandidates who are class IV or III but not improving should be referred early to a transplantation center. Currently, there is a need for right ventricular assistdevices with flow characteristics suited to the circulation of patients withpulmonary arterial hypertension. Right ventricular synchronization therapy hasnot yet been tested. Novel shunts (e.g., Potts anastomosis) also hold promise.All surgery for pulmonary hypertension should be performed in centers withexperience in these techniques.
