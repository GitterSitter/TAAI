This study evaluates the safety andefficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a means to transplantcandidacy in such patients.METHODS: Morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart failure, who wereineligible for cardiac transplantation and underwent LSG between 2008 and 2013,were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic characteristics, perioperativedetails, percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), and status of transplantcandidacy were analyzed.RESULTS: Six patients (3 men) with end-stage heart failure and morbid obesityunderwent LSG. Three patients (50%) had a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)in place at the time of surgery. Median age was 34 (31-66) years and meanpreoperative body mass index (BMI) was 47.6±3.0 kg/m2. Median operative time was 90 (66-141) minutes, with a median length of stay of 7 (4-16) days. There were noperioperative deaths. One patient suffered a spontaneous flank hematoma. The samepatient also had thrombosis of the LVAD pump at 3 weeks postoperatively,requiring an uneventful device exchange. At median follow-up of 22 (12-70)months, the mean %EWL was 51.4±10.3% with a decrease in BMI to 34.3±2.4 kg/m2(P<.05). All patients had lost sufficient weight to become transplant eligiblewithin 12 months of surgery. Two patients had undergone successfultransplantation and another 2 were on the transplant list.CONCLUSION: LSG appears to be a safe, technically feasible, and effective method for obtaining adequate weight loss in morbidly obese patients with end-stageheart failure and mechanical circulatory support, subsequently improving theiraccess to cardiac transplantation. This is the largest case series to date ofthis high-risk group of patients undergoing LSG.Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc.
