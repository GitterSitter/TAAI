We investigated the trends and outcomesfor cardiac transplantation in recipients aged 70 years and older in the UnitedStates.METHODS: De-identified data were provided by United Network of Organ Sharing.Transplant recipients were grouped by age 60-69 years and 70 years and older.Univariate comparisons were performed using Student's t-test or the Pearsonchi-square test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique andcompared with the log-rank test. Cox regression was used to determine predictors of death after transplant. Statistical significance was assigned to p < 0.05.RESULTS: Between January 1, 1998, and June 15, 2010, 5,807 sexagenarians and 332 septuagenarians received allografts. The septuagenarian cohort had more men, lessdiabetes, was less likely to have a ventricular assist device, and more likely tobe status II. Donors for septuagenarians were older and died more frequently fromintracranial hemorrhage. Median unadjusted survival was 9.8 years forsexagenarians vs 8.5 years for septuagenarians (p = 0.003). There was nodifference in the incidence of cerebrovascular accident, length of stay, orpacemaker need between groups. Septuagenarians were less likely to be treated forrejection the first year (p = 0.001). Age was a multivariate predictor of death(hazard ratio, 1.289; 95% confidence interval, 1.039-1.6; p = 0.021).CONCLUSIONS: Selected septuagenarians with advanced heart failure can derivegreat benefit from cardiac transplantation, although survival is inferior to thatof an immediately younger sexagenarian cohort. Most of the mortality risk is seenin the first year after transplantation. A reduced incidence of rejection wasobserved and warrants further study.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
