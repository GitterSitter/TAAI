The cardiac involvement typically results in a high risk ofsevere heart failure in infancy or early childhood. While Berlin Heart EXCOR iswidely accepted as ventricular assistance in pediatric patients with end-stagecardiac failure, infections remain a frequent and potentially severecomplication. Therefore, the extended use of the device in the setting ofintermittent or severe neutropenia is challenging. We present the case of athree-yr child with Barth syndrome who was bridged successfully to transplantwith a Berlin Heart EXCOR assist device for eight months (251 days) without majorinfectious complication, despite several episodes of severe neutropenia. Thiscase demonstrates that prolonged mechanical circulatory support for a patientwith neutropenia is feasible without important morbidity, with careful monitoringand a multidisciplinary approach. G-CSF provides an excellent support in managingneutropenia.Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
