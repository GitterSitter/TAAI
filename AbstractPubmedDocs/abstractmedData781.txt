Implantation of temporary right ventricular assistdevice may be life-saving procedure in various situations of right heart failure as: heart transplantation, LVAD therapy and post-cardiotomy failure. The aim ofthe study is an introduction of the implantation technique and retrospectivereview of current experience with the method.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since January 2007 isolated right ventricular assist deviceLevitronix CentriMag has been implanted in 16 patients. Patients were dividedinto 3 groups: post transplantation (post-Tx), post LVAD implantation (post-LVAD)and other cardiac procedures (OCP). Success rate of weaning from RVAD, 30-daysmortality and major complications has been assessed.OUTCOMES: Distribution of implants in groups was: post-Tx 5 pts (31%), post-LVAD 6 pts (38%) and 5 in OCP group (31%). The mean support time was 12 days. Off-pumpimplantation was achieved in 9 pts. The device was successfully weaned in 13(81%) patients. 30-days mortality occurred in 1 case only.CONCLUSION: Presented outcomes are encouraging for broader acceptance of thetherapy. Excellent success rate has been reached in post-Tx and post-LVAD. Thisstudy emphasises decesive role of proactive approach in early indication of RVAD implantation for achieving satisfactory results.
