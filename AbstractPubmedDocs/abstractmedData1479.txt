Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2005 Mar 24;130(12):652-6.[Circulatory assist devices in cardiology].[Article in German]Ferrari M(1), Figulla HR.Author information: (1)Klinik für Innere Medizin I, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena.One out of 13 patients with an acute myocardial infarction is endangered ofcardiogenic shock. In addition, acute valvular leakage, shunt vitiae, and acutemyocarditis can lead to acute myocardial failure. As a therapeutic option,mechanical assist devices offer cardiac support and hemodynamic stabilizationunder these circumstances. The following minimal-invasive devices are used incardiology and intensive care medicine: intra-aortic balloon pulsation (IABP),intra-vascular axial screw pumps, extra-corporal centrifugal pumps with andwithout additional membrane oxygenator. The IABP improves left ventricularfunction by a systolic reduction of the after-load, and an increase of diastolic blood pressure dependent on myocardial function. In contrast, axial screw pumpsand centrifugal pumps can provide circulatory support independently of myocardialfunction. Mechanical assist devices can prevent irreversible damage not only byoffering a reduction of myocardial work load, but also by improving organperfusion in cardiogenic shock situations. Another indication for mechanicalcirculatory support depicts high-risk coronary angioplasty if the leftventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced or the target vessel suppliesmore than 50 % of vital myocardium. In case of irreversible heart failure,turbine pumps or centrifugal pumps offer a stabilization for the patient'stransfer to a cardiac surgery center. They can also be used for bridging to hearttransplantation in acute situations. Technical improvements will enhance the use of mechanical assist devices in the near future. Especially the development ofportable emergency devices will enrich therapeutic possibilities in cardiologyand intensive care medicine.
