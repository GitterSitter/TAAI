Our goal was to determine the effects of LVAD support on cardiac myocyte size and shape.METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated myocytes were obtained at cardiac transplantationfrom 30 failing hearts (12 ischemic, 18 nonischemic) without LVAD support, 10failing hearts that received LVAD support for 75+/-15 days, and 6 nonfailinghearts. Cardiac myocyte volume, length, width, and thickness were determined byuse of previously validated techniques. Isolated myocytes from myopathic heartsexhibited increased volume, length, width, and length-to-thickness ratio comparedwith normal myocytes (P<0.05). However, there were no differences in anyparameter between myocytes from ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathic hearts. Long-term LVAD support resulted in a 28% reduction in myocyte volume, 20%reduction in cell length, 20% reduction in cell width, and 32% reduction in cell length-to-thickness ratio (P<0.05). In contrast, LVAD support was associated withno change in cell thickness. These cellular changes were associated withreductions in left ventricular dilation and left ventricular mass measuredechocardiographically in 6 of 10 LVAD-supported patients.CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that the regression of cellular hypertrophy isa major contributor to the "reverse remodeling" of the heart after LVADimplantation. The favorable alterations in geometry that occur in parallelfashion at both the organ and cellular levels may contribute to reduced wallstress and improved mechanical performance after LVAD support.
