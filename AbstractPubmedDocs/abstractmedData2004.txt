In addition, hypervolemia is a frequentcomplication encountered in the treatment of these patients because of theirlarge fluid intake requirements and relative potential for kidney failure.METHODS: Previous reports have documented the use of continuous-flow devices tosupport the failing right-sided circulation of patients after both leftventricular assist device insertion and orthotopic heart transplantation.However, such continuous-flow devices may carry the attendant risks of hemolysis and bleeding and may further require 24-hour monitoring by trained personnel. We report the temporary-use pulsatile Abiomed BVS 5000 right ventricular assistdevice and continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis in the recipient of a pulsatile TCI HeartMate 1000 IP left ventricular assist device both after left ventricular assist device implantation and after orthotopic heart transplantation.RESULTS: The patient was well at 13 months follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The use of right ventricular assist devices and continuousarteriovenous hemodialysis in both transplant and left ventricular assist device recipients undoubtedly will remain important as the popularity of these twotherapeutic modalities continues to grow.
