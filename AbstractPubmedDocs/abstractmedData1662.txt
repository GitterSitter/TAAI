Improvement in these assist devices now allows topermanently implant some of them which then appear as true alternatives tocardiac transplantation when this technique is contra-indicated. In parallel tothese "mechanical" options, "biological" strategies have been designed, which areprimarily based on cell therapy. Thus, autologous skeletal myoblasttransplantation has yet entered the clinical arena, on the basis of experimental data suggesting the functional efficacy of these cells once implanted intoinfarcted myocardium. However, the clinical benefits of this approach still need to be validated by randomized trials. Gene therapy appears more complex toimplement clinically, because of the multiplicity of candidate genes and thepersisting issues associated with vectors and gene transfection systems.
