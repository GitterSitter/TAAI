Despite the functional and biologic evidence of reverse cardiacremodeling, few patients actually proceed to myocardial recovery, and even fewer to the point of having their device explanted. An enhanced understanding of thebiology and care of the mechanically supported patient has redirected focus onthe possibility of using ventricular assist devices as a bridge to myocardialrecovery and removal. Herein, we review the current issues and approaches totransforming myocardial recovery to a practical reality.Copyright Â© 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
