Ann Thorac Surg. 2007 Jan;83(1):306-8.Bridge to transplantation with a left ventricular assist device for systemicventricular failure after Mustard procedure.George RS(1), Birks EJ, Radley-Smith RC, Khaghani A, Yacoub M.Author information: (1)Department of Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory, Royal Brompton andHarefield NHS Trust, Harefield, Middlesex, United Kingdom.After Mustard or Senning procedures, transplantation remains the only option for some patients who present at late stage with severe systemic (right) ventricular failure. In some circumstances these patients may require urgent mechanicalcirculatory support to bridge them to transplantation. The use of mechanicalsupport poses considerable potential and actual specific problems both in termsof insertion and management of the device. We report the case of a 17-year-oldpatient who had a left ventricular assist device implanted from the rightventricle to the aorta for "end-stage" heart failure 15 years after the Mustardprocedure. The specific problems are discussed and a management scheme isproposed.
