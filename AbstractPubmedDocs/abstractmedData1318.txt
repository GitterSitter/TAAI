The post-transplant survival of these patients is uncertain as pulmonaryhypertension may reappear, possibly affecting post-transplant survival.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 01/2000 and 01/2005 a total of 26 cardiactransplant candidates (92% male; mean age 56.2 years) in whom fixed pulmonaryhypertension was lowered by LVAD implantation (pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) before implantation: 5.1+/-2.8wood units (WU); PVR before cardiactransplantation: 2.0+/-.9WU) underwent cardiac transplantation at ourinstitution. These patients were age and sex matched with 52 cardiac transplantcandidates without pulmonary hypertension undergoing cardiac transplantationduring the same time period. Study endpoints were peri-transplant complicationsand long-term survival. Mean follow-up was 36+/-14 months.RESULTS: Peri-transplant mortality was 5% in patients after LVAD therapy and 7%in patients without prior LVAD therapy (p=.089). We observed 2 cases (4%) ofacute right heart failure requiring mechanical support in patients without prior LVAD therapy. None of the patients with LVAD therapy developed peri-transplantright heart failure requiring mechanical support. Incidence of otherperi-transplant complications was comparable between the two groups. Log-rank(p=.124) revealed comparable long-term survival between patients with (1 year:85%, 2 year: 85%, 3 year: 85%) and without (1 year: 90%, 2 year 82%, 3 year prior79%) prior LVAD therapy.CONCLUSION: LVAD therapy lowers fixed pulmonary hypertension in cardiactransplant candidates with fixed pulmonary hypertension. Thereafter, long-termpost-transplant survival is comparable to cardiac transplant recipients withoutpulmonary hypertension.
