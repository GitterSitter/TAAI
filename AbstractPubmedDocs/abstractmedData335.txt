Nowadays, medium-term survival does notsignificantly differ between MCS and heart transplant recipients. MCS management programs require a multidisciplinary team to optimize the pathway leading torehabilitation and improved quality of life and decrease the frequent occurrence of complications. However, in the near future with the growing number ofimplants, the chances for clinical cardiologists to come across a MCS recipientwill increase. The management of general or acute problems will no longer belimited to tertiary implanting centers. A key issue to improve patient outcomesis the provision of a smooth and careful transition from the hospital environmentto home care. The aim of this review is to start this process by providing basic notions and general indications through several scenarios of MCS recipientspresenting to the emergency room for acute clinical problems.
