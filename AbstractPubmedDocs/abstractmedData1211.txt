Myocardial ischemia is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity inAAA repair. Therapeutic strategy, in presence of ischemic heart failure and AAA, is not well established. Actually, AAA is considered as a contraindication toventricular assist device (VAD) support. We report a unique case of concomitantopen AAA repair and biVAD implantation in a patient with severe ischemic heartfailure. This case argues that AAA should no longer be considered acontraindication for VAD implantation, provided the AAA repair is made before or simultaneously with device placement.
