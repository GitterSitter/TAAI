All were assessed1 month later during graded supine bicycle exercise (maximal work load 100 to 150W). Detailed central hemodynamics, including continuous pulmonary artery oxygensaturation and oxygen consumption measurements, were obtained. Two of thepatients also underwent upright treadmill exercise with oxygen consumptionmeasurements.RESULTS: During supine bicycle exercise, the heart rate increased from 93 +/- 37 beats/min (95% confidence interval: mean +/- t0.025 x SE) at rest to 119 +/- 54beats/min and left ventricular assist device rate increased from 82 +/- 47 to 109+/- 55 beats/min. Oxygen consumption increased from 3.0 +/- 0.9 to 8.7 +/- 2.9 mloxygen/min per kg body weight. Cardiac output increased from 6.0 +/- 4.4 to 9.6+/- 7.1 liters/min, yielding an average exercise factor of 8.5 +/- 7.7 and anexercise index of 0.83 +/- 0.61. The patients assessed during treadmill exercise achieved a maximal oxygen consumption of 14.3 and 16.7 ml of oxygen/min per kg.No thromboembolic or other complications attributable to left ventricular assist device implantation occurred during the duration of support. All patientssurvived orthotopic heart transplantation and are doing well.CONCLUSIONS: Significant work loads compatible with activities of daily life and adequate exercise hemodynamics were demonstrated by these patients while awaitingheart transplantation. Definitive conclusions regarding the use of this devicemust be viewed as preliminary because only three patients were involved in thisstudy and the failure rate may be as high as 71% (95% confidence interval of leftventricular assist device success as a bridge to transplantation 29.3% to 100%). Final conclusions regarding the safety and efficacy of the left ventricularassist device as a possible long-term circulatory support device must awaitresults of larger multicenter trials in progress.
