The short- andlong-term impact of these devices on peripheral blood gene expression has notbeen characterized, and may provide insight into the molecular pathways mediated in response to left ventricular remodeling and an improvement in overall systemiccirculation. We performed RNA sequencing to identify genes and pathwaysinfluenced by these devices.METHODS: RNA was extracted from blood of 9 heart failure patients (8 male) prior to LVAD implantation, and at 7 and 180 days postoperatively. Libraries weresequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 and sequences mapped to the human EnsemblGRCh37.67 genome assembly.RESULTS: A specific set of genes involved in regulating cellular immune response,antigen presentation, and T cell activation and survival were down-regulated 7days after LVAD placement. 6 months following LVAD placement, the expressionlevels of these genes were significantly increased; yet importantly, remainedsignificantly lower than age and sex-matched samples from healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this genomic analysis identified a significant decrease in the expression of genes that promote a healthy immune response in patientswith heart failure that was partially restored 6 months following LVAD implant.PMCID: PMC3804545
