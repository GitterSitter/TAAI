Survival rates and functional status following hearttransplantation are excellent, particularly if compared to medical therapy. Theprocess of acute and chronic transplant rejection, however, and the sequelae ofimmunosuppression, such as infection, malignancy and renal insufficiency,prevents even better results. Therapy with current mechanical circulatory supportdevices is associated with improving outcome and may become competitive to heart transplantation, at least in selected patients. But long-term results are not yetavailable.PMCID: PMC4387387
