The INTERMACSCoordinators' Council provided ongoing feedback regarding the characterization ofpatients receiving implantable devices.RESULTS: The definition of 7 clinical profiles revealed that 80% of currentdevices are being used in the 2 profiles with the highest levels of clinicalcompromise. The INTERMACS Coordinators' Council helped to identify gaps in thecharacterization of hospitalized patients on temporary assist devices and ofhomebound patients with resting symptoms, which has led to revised definitions ofProfile 3 and 4 and the addition of 2 new modifiers, for temporary circulatorysupport devices in the hospital, and for frequent rehospitalization of patientsat home.CONCLUSIONS: Patients considered for mechanical circulatory support can now beclassified using the 7 profiles plus 3 modifiers developed through INTERMACS.Further understanding these profiles and their impact on outcome should help tobetter select patients and therapies in the advanced stages of disease.
