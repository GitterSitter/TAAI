HenriMondor, Cr√©teil, France.The Nippon-Zeon (NZ) ventricular assist device is a sac type, air driven,heterotopic, external pump. Its performance has been evaluated in Japan as abridge to myocardial recovery. Few data are available on the device as a bridgeto heart transplantation. Since 1991, 10 patients (9 men) were bridged to hearttransplantation with NZ, all in biventricular support. The mean age was 39 +/- 13years (range, 21-60 years), mean body weight was 75 +/- 13 kg (range, 51-95 kg). Five patients had a dilated cardiopathy, and five were ischemic (three acutemyocardial infarctions). Despite maximal inotropic support, including enoximonein seven, epinephrine in three, and intraaortic balloon pumping in one, eightpatients were anuric, three were in acute hepatic failure, and three wereintubated. Preoperative hemodynamic and biologic values were: cardiac index, 1.57+/- 0.4 l/min/m2; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 34 +/- 5 mmHg; creatinine, 200 +/- 80 mumol/l; blood urea nitrogen, 17.5 +/- 8 mmol/l; total bilirubin 36+/- 6 mumol/l; aspartate aminotransferase, 1,000 +/- 2,000 IU/l. In all patients,a biventricular assist device was implanted without the use of cardiopulmonarybypass. Improvement occurred immediately in all but one. Mean left ventricularflow was 4.5 +/- 0.8 l/min. Anticoagulation was maintained with intravenousheparin. Recently for bleeding was required in one case (10%), and two patientshad positive blood cultures that were successfully treated. There was nomechanical failure. Hemolysis was not significant (lactate dehydrogenase, 378 +/-50 IU/l; plasma-free hemoglobin below 10 mg/dl). Each device was free of thrombi and deposits at time of explantation. One patient died while on assist. Ninepatients (90%) were transplanted after 11 +/- 8 days (range, 1-32 days). Threedied early after transplantation, one of graft failure, two of sepsis. Sixpatients (66%) could be discharged. The follow-up ranges from 7 to 28 months. NZ is a simple, reliable, pneumatic device driven by a light, silent console; it canbe rapidly implanted without cardiopulmonary bypass in patients in desperatecondition who are awaiting cardiac transplantation. The difficulty of patientrehabilitation while using this device should limit the duration of support toweeks to allow the patient to be in optimal condition for heart transplantation.
