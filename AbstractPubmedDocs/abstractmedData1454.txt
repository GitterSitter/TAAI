Patients who are selected forleft ventricular assist device support must be able to undergo the surgicalimplantation procedure safely and avoid common complications such as right heart failure. Adequate patient selection is essential and can typically beaccomplished using simple hemodynamic measures. As left ventricular assist devicetechnology evolves, pulsatile devices will likely be replaced by their neweraxial flow counterparts, which offer decided advantages. In the future, therapyfor end-stage heart failure will involve aggressive use of mechanical assistdevice therapy and, as more patients are supported with these devices and thetechnology improves, this will become a burgeoning field for cardiologists andcardiovascular surgeons.
