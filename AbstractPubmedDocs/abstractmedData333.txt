If it does not improve with appropriate medical therapy, we must considermechanical support. Recently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) hasshown better results than a right ventricular assist device or retransplantation.Two HT patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had cold ischemic times beyond>240 minutes. After HT, their right heart function worsened and was unresponsive to medical therapy. After our application of ECMO, weaning was successful and thepatients were discharged without complication. Early application of ECMO for RHF after HT is a good option.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
