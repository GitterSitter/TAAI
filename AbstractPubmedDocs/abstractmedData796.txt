A post-approval study was required by the U.S. Food andDrug Administration to determine whether results with the device in a commercial setting are comparable to other available devices for the same indication.METHODS: The study was a prospective evaluation of the first 169 consecutive HMII patients enrolled in the national INTERMACS (Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) who were listed for transplant orlikely to be listed. Patients were enrolled from April through August 2008 at 77 U.S. centers and followed for at least 1 year after implant. A comparison group(COMP) included all patients (n = 169 at 27 centers) enrolled in the INTERMACSregistry with other types of LVADs (79% HeartMate XVE, 21% ImplantableVentricular Assist Device [Thoratec Corporation]) for the same BTT indication in the same time period. Survival rates, adverse events, and quality of life withthe EuroQol EQ-5D visual analog scale were obtained in the INTERMACS registry.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar, but creatinine and blood ureanitrogen were lower in the HM II versus COMP groups, and there were fewerpatients in the highest-risk INTERMACS patient profile Number 1 (24% for HM IIvs. 39% for COMP). Adverse event rates were similar or lower for HM II versusCOMP for all events. Bleeding was the most frequent adverse event for both groups(1.44 vs. 1.79 events/patient-year). Operative 30-day mortality for HM II was 4% versus 11% for COMP. The percentage of patients reaching transplant, cardiacrecovery, or ongoing LVAD support by 6 months was 91% for HM II and 80% for COMP,and the Kaplan-Meier survival for patients remaining on support at 1 year was 85%for HM II versus 70% for COMP. Quality of life was significantly improved at 3months of support and sustained through 12 months in both groups compared withbaseline.CONCLUSIONS: The results in a post-market approval, actual patient care settingBTT population support the original findings from the pivotal clinical trialregarding the efficacy and risk profile of the HM II LVAD. These data suggestthat dissemination of this technology after approval has been associated withcontinued excellent results.Copyright Â© 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
