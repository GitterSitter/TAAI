Wecompared follow-up with 146 patients (55 +/- 13 years) who underwent hearttransplantation during the same time without prior long-term mechanical support.RESULTS: Thirty-two of the 41 patients (78%) underwent heart transplantation, 9patients (22%) died of multi-organ (n = 5), cardiac (n = 2), or cerebral failure (n = 2). Thirty-day post-transplant mortality includes 5 cases (3 graftfailures). Within the following 2 years, another 5 patients expired, 2 of cardiacfailure/sudden death. Currently, 21 of 41 patients (51%) are still alive 10 to 77months (41 +/- 22 months) after heart transplantation (1 patient was lost forfollow-up). One-year and 5-year survival rates were compared with the controlgroup (VAD vs control, 1-year survival was 75% vs 74% and 5-year survival was 60%vs 66%). Fifteen patients are doing well in New York Heart Association Class I), and 6 are NYHA Class II despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction.Episodes of moderate acute rejection (International Society for Heart and LungTransplantation Grade 3) occurred in 10 patients (1.3 episodes per patient), not significantly different from that of the control group (1.2 episodes perpatient). Scintigraphy showed regional myocardial ischemia/transplantvasculopathy in 4 patients, and coronary angiography detected the same in 2. One patient has undergone successful retransplantation. Two patients had increasedright ventricular pressure. Six patients had impaired kidney function, and 3 had impaired liver function. Seven patients experienced cytomegalovirus infection.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that patients who underwent heart transplantation after long-term mechanical support have a similar survival rate and comparablecardiac morbidity associated with acute rejection episodes.
