Quality of life (QoL) hasnot been systematically evaluated in children bridged to heart transplant.METHODS: All children transplanted for cardiomyopathy during 2001 to 2008 andcurrently being followed at our center (n = 84) had QoL assessed during 2006 to2009, at a median of 3 years post-transplant, using a validated generic measure(PedsQL4.0).RESULTS: Twenty-six children, aged 2.7 to 18 (median 7.4) years who were bridged to transplant, were compared with 58 children, aged 2.0 to 18.0 (median 13.0)years, who were transplanted in the same era without bridging. There were nosignificant differences between the 2 groups on any domains of QoL assessed bychildren or parents, although the small number of bridged patients increases the likelihood of a Type II error. Bridged children who were younger (r = 0.48, p =0.02) or more recently transplanted (r = 0.42, p = 0.04) were scored by theirparents as having poorer emotional QoL. Regression analysis indicated that age attransplant was the only medical or demographic variable associated withparent-reported total QoL scores (β = 0.27, p = 0.01). With few links between QoLscores and medical or demographic factors, other subjective psychologic factorsmay be of greater salience in determining QoL.CONCLUSIONS: Despite greater severity of illness, children who requiredmechanical bridging to transplantation report a QoL comparable to that of otherchildren undergoing heart transplantation. Younger children may require greaterpsychologic support to reach their full potential in terms of QoL.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
