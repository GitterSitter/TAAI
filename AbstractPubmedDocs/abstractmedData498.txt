Indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely withthe development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), andthe total artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patientsawaiting transplantation, so much so, that LVADs are now approved of as astrategy for destination therapy. In this review, the authors describe in detail the current basic indications, functioning modalities, main limitations ofsurgical LAVDs, total artificial heart development, and percutaneous assistdevices, trying to clarify this complex, but fascinating topic.PMCID: PMC3545257
