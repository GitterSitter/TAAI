Patients (>1 month of age) admitted from 2005to 2007 with ADHF requiring intravenous vasoactive/diuretic therapy for ADHF wereeligible. Serum NT-pro-BNP levels were obtained within 24 hours of admission and at prespecified intervals, and clinical caregivers were blinded to these levels. End points included hospital discharge, death or cardiac transplantation, andcare escalation including the need for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) wasnoted. Twenty-four patients were enrolled: 22 survived to hospital discharge and 2 died. Ten required MCS (of which 6 underwent cardiac transplantation). Twopatients underwent transplantation without MCS. For the entire cohort, NT-pro-BNPlevels peaked at days 2 to 3 after admission, with a subsequent gradual decrease until discharge. However, for those who did require MCS, NT-pro-BNP failed todecrease consistently until after MCS initiation. At discharge, NT-pro-BNP levelswere significantly decreased from admission levels but remained well above normalfor all patients. Single-point NT-pro-BNP levels on admission did not correlatewith independently assessed clinical scores of heart failure severity or predict the need for MCS in this cohort. In conclusion, serial NT-pro-BNP levelsdemonstrated an incremental trend after 48 hours in patients who went on torequire MCS but decreased in all other patients and may therefore assist thedecision to initiate or avoid MCS after admission for pediatric ADHF.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.
