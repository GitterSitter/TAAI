Medical and interventional modalities arewidely used to treat this condition, although the ultimate therapy remains heart transplantation. Herein we present our clinical experience with 140 patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation.METHODS: Between February 1998 and September 2010, we transplanted 140 patientswith a mean age of 40 ± 13 years, including 109 men (77.8%) and 31 women (22%).There were 101 patients (73%) with dilated cardiomyopathy and 39 (27%) withischemic cardiomyopathy. Two patients were retransplanted owing to graft failure.Sixteen patients on assist device support were successfully bridged totransplantation.RESULTS: Eighteen patients (12.8%) died within 30 days with the most commoncauses being right ventricular failure (8/18, 44%) and infection (4/18, 22%).Overall mortality of 39% (55/140) was most commonly caused by infection (29%,16/55) or right ventricular failure (20%, 11/55). Nine patients (16%) diedsuddenly outside of the hospital. Three patients died of rejection; 4 of graftfailure, and 4 of malignant disease.CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation remains the standard treatment modality forend-stage cardiac failure. But significant waiting list mortality rates are dueto the worldwide shortage of donors. Heart transplantation in Turkey is feasible for a small and strictly selected number of patients with nonreversiblecongestive heart failure. In recent years, ventricular assist device applicationshave successful bridged subjects to transplantation, saving many patients onactive waiting lists.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
