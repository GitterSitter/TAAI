Epub 2011 Nov 27.Initial experience of conversion of Toyobo paracorporeal left ventricular assist device to DuraHeart left ventricular assist device.Yoshioka D(1), Sakaguchi T, Saito S, Miyagawa S, Nishi H, Yoshikawa Y, Fukushima S, Ueno T, Kuratani T, Sawa Y.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Osaka UniversityGraduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.BACKGROUND: This report details experience of the conversion of the Toyobo leftventricular assist device (LVAD; Nipro, Osaka, Japan) to the DuraHeart LVAD(TerumoHeart, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) in patients awaiting heart transplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight patients (4 male, 4 female) with Toyobo paracorporeal LVAD underwent conversion to the third-generation centrifugal (DuraHeart) LVAD.The apical cuff of the Toyobo was not exchanged because the size was the same as that of the DuraHeart. All conversion operations were performed safely, but 3patients who had infection of the Toyobo LVAD cannulation site prior toconversion suffered later pocket infections and 1 patient died because of sepsis.One patient underwent heart transplantation and 6 of 8 patients were awaitingheart transplantation at home.CONCLUSIONS: Conversions from the Toyobo LVAD to the DuraHeart LVAD wereperformed safely. Considering that implantable LVADs provide superior long-termsurvival and quality of life, conversion is a reasonable decision for Toyobo LVADusers in whom there are no infections.
