Circulation. 1983 Oct;68(4):883-8.Artificial hearts and blood pumps in the treatment of profound heart failure.Pierce WS.The recent clinical use of a pneumatic artificial heart at the University of Utahhas focused attention on the role of blood pumps in the support of thecirculation. Pneumatically powered assist pumps are now in clinical trials inpatients with profound but reversible heart failure after open-heart surgery;survival rates as high as 50% in a heretofore lethal condition have beenencouraging. The results of animal studies with the pneumatic artificial heartsuggest that these devices are ready for clinical trials; the major applicationis likely to be as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Implantable electricmotor-driven assist pumps and artificial hearts are being evaluated in animals aspermanent cardiac support or replacement devices; clinical use is projected tobegin late in this decade. Initially, these devices will be employed in patients with end-stage cardiac disease who are not suitable candidates for cardiactransplantation or for whom donor hearts are not available. The availability ofcompact blood pumps will offer new forms of therapy to patients with certaintypes of profound heart failure.
