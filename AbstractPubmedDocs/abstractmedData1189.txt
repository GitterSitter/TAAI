Pumps designed for adults are thus often used in children. Wereport herein a case of end-stage heart failure in a 3-year old girl (height100.4 cm; body weight 16.2 kg; body surface area 0.66 m2) who underwentimplantation with an adult-sized Toyobo-NCVC left ventricular assist device(Toyobo-National Cardiovascular Center, Osaka, Japan) in our unit. We startedwith the driving mode to "full-fill, full-empty" mode. The problem wasdifficult-to-treat hypertension due to excessive stroke volume induced by theleft ventricular assist device. Aggressive administration of antihypertensivetherapy was needed. Successful heart transplantation was performed in Germany 5months after beginning support with the Toyobo-NCVC left ventricular assistdevice.
