Epub 2010Feb 20.Triple-site pacing: a new supported therapy approach for bridge to recovery with a left ventricular assist system in a patient with idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy.Nishimura T(1), Kyo S.Author information: (1)Division of Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure, Department ofCardiothoracic Surgery, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo,Japan. takashin-tky@umin.ac.jpLeft ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are widely used as bridges to cardiactransplantation or for destination therapy. LVAD support may also function as abridge to ventricular recovery, but a sufficient rate of recovery has not beenobtained, even with various adjuvant therapies. Cardiac resynchronization therapy(CRT) is an effective treatment for heart failure, and there is a report ofsuccessful weaning off LVAD with CRT. However, some patients with CRT could notimprove their cardiac function because of residual dyssynchrony. Herein, wedescribe a case of a successful bridge to recovery with triple-site pacing forresidual dyssynchrony after biventricular pacing. A 34-year-old woman with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy whose condition deteriorated underwentToyobo LVAD implantation, resulting in improvement of the left ventricularejection fraction (LVEF) from 12 to 36%. Because of left ventriculardyssynchrony, we performed CRT, but residual dyssynchrony impeded cardiacrecovery. We inserted an additional ventricular lead at the right ventricularoutlet to achieve triple-site pacing in order to obtain complete synchronization.The LVEF improved to 45%, and the patient was successfully weaned off the LVAD.In LVAD-supported cases of persistent left ventricular dyssynchrony with CRT,implantation of triple-site pacing could potentially accelerate recovery.
