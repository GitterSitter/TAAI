Predicting mortality after heart transplant usingpretransplant donor and recipient risk factors.Hong KN(1), Iribarne A, Worku B, Takayama H, Gelijns AC, Naka Y, Jeevanandam V,Russo MJ.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College ofPhysicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.BACKGROUND: In this study we sought the following: (1) To objectively assess the risk related to various pretransplant recipient and donor characteristics; (2) todevise a preoperative risk stratification score (RSS) based on pretransplantrecipient and donor characteristics predicting graft loss at 1 year; and (3) todefine different risk strata based on RSS.METHODS: The United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identifiedpatient-level data. Analysis included 11,703 orthotopic heart transplantrecipients aged 18 years or greater and transplanted between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007. The primary outcome was 1-year graft failure. Multivariablelogistic regression analysis (backward p value<0.20) was used to determine therelationship between pretransplant characteristics and 1-year graft failure.Using the odds ratio for each identified variable, an RSS was devised. The RSSstrata were defined by calculating receiver operating characteristic curves andstratum specific likelihood ratios.RESULTS: The strongest negative predictors of 1-year graft failure included thefollowing: right ventricular assist device only, extracorporeal membraneoxygenation, renal failure, extracorporeal left ventricular assist device, total artificial heart, and advanced age. Threshold analysis identified 5 discrete RSS strata: low risk (LR, RSS: <2.55; n=3242, 27.7%), intermediate risk (IR, RSS:2.55-5.72; n=6,347, 54.2%), moderate risk (MR, RSS: 5.73-8.13; n=1,543, 13.2%),elevated risk (ER, RSS: 8.14-9.48; n=310, 2.6%), and high risk (HR, RSS: >9.48;n=261, 2.2%). The 1-year actuarial survival (%) in the LR, IR, MR, ER, and HRgroups were 93.8, 89.2, 81.3, 67.0, and 47.0, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant recipient variables significantly influence early and late graft failure after heart transplantation. The RSS may improve organallocation strategies by reducing the potential negative impact of transplanting candidates who are at a high risk for poor postoperative outcomes.Copyright Â© 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
