We adoptedveno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation using the Levitronixcentrifugal pump (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, Massachusetts) as a first-linetreatment of cardiogenic shock in a "bridge to decision" strategy. This articleprovides our experience of this clinical approach.METHODS: Since 1988, 160 ventricular assist devices have been implanted at ourhospital for heart failure. Since 2005, 15 consecutive patients have been treatedwith veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory cardiogenicshock. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been implantedeither centrally or peripherally.RESULTS: Mean age was 44.7 ± 20.0 years (2-78 years). There were 5 women.Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was implanted peripherally in 8cases (53.4%) and centrally in the remaining 7 (46.6%). Mean veno-arterialextracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration was 11.5 ± 8.1 days (range, 1-30).No patient experienced any neurologic event or vascular complication at thecannulation site. Twelve patients (80%) were weaned from veno-arterialextracorporeal membrane oxygenation or bridged to either a long-term leftventricular assist device or heart transplantation. Three patients died duringveno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support secondary tomulti-organ failure. Seven patients (46.6%) were discharged from the hospital,with a 100% survival at follow-up. The survivors include 2 patients affected byfulminant myocarditis, who were bridged to recovery, and 5 patients who werebridged to heart transplantation. Survivors were younger than nonsurvivors (mean age, 28.5 vs 58.8 years, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as bridge to decision has been effective to promptly restore adequatesystemic perfusion, allowing further time to evaluate myocardial recovery orcandidacy for ventricular assist device or heart transplantation. Youngerpatients, with no or mild end-organ injury, had the best outcomes. Peripheralcannulation decreases the surgical trauma and makes emergency implantationpossible, even in the intensive care unit.Copyright © 2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
