While the clinical context was suggestive ofadriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, the initial pathology of the Heartmate-2apical core showed lymphocytic myocarditis. After 8 months of stability, thepatient presented with progressive heart failure and recurrent ventriculararrhythmias. An endomyocardial biopsy revealed findings typical of giant cellmyocarditis (GCM); poor response to immunosuppressive therapy and markedhemodynamic instability led to urgent transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of GCM following an acute lymphocytic myocarditis and thesecond GCM case associated with B-cell lymphoma.PMCID: PMC3554427
