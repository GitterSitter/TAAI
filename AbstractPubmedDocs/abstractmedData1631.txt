We evaluated theincidence and outcome of PGF at our institution.METHODS: A retrospective review of 462 consecutive adult heart transplantsperformed between January 1993 and December 1999 revealed 20 cases of PGF.Donor-, surgery- and device-related variables were evaluated for association withoperative mortality, survival and successful device weaning.RESULTS: Transplant recipients included 17 men and 3 women, median age 56.5 years(20 to 66 years). PGF etiology included primary graft failure (n = 9); rightheart failure (RHF) secondary to pulmonary hypertension,coagulopathy/intra-operative hemorrhage or sepsis (n = 9); and hyperacuterejection (n = 2). Device types included RVAD (n = 11), LVAD (n = 4), BIVAD (n = 3) and IABP (n = 2). The wean rate was 45%. Duration of device support rangedfrom 2 to 965 hours. Early ventricular recovery (within 96 hours) was associated with significantly better 30-day and 2-year survival. Weaned patients had an 88% 30-day and 67% 2-year survival, whereas the overall survival rate was 79% at 2years (p = not significant).CONCLUSIONS: Early ventricular recovery is an important predictor of successfulweaning and survival. In view of the prohibitive mortality associated with PGFand the dismal prognosis with re-transplantation, we advocate aggressive use ofmechanical assistance for PGF, with an acceptable survival benefit.
