Destination mechanical circulatory support is often the onlytherapy available for these patients who are not transplant candidates. Theoutcomes after continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF LVAD) implantin older patients remains unclear. We undertook this multi-institutional study toquantify short-term and midterm outcomes after CF LVAD implant in the elderly.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients in the Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) national registry thatunderwent implant of a CF LVAD (June 2006 to April 2012). Patients were dividedinto 2 cohorts based upon age (<70 years [n = 4,439] and ≥ 70 years (n = 590]).Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed. Theprimary endpoint, survival, was compared between cohorts.RESULTS: Patients age 70 and older were more hemodynamically stable pre-VADimplant as evidenced by INTERMACS profile and inotrope dependence. Perioperative outcomes, including median bypass time (89 vs 89 minutes) and length of stay(0.657 vs 0.657 months) were similar between cohorts (p = not significant).Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in 2-year survivalbetween patients aged 70 years or greater (63%) and less than 70 (71%, p <0.001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed age as anindependent predictor of mortality during follow-up (p < 0.001). Nonetheless,midterm cumulative survival in the older cohort was still reasonable (63% at 2years).CONCLUSIONS: Multi-institutional analysis revealed advanced age as a predictor ofincreased mortality after CF LVAD implantation. Careful patient selection iscritical in the elderly to optimize long-term outcomes after CF LVADimplantation.Copyright © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
