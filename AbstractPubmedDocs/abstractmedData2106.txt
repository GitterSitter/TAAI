ASAIO Trans. 1990 Jul-Sep;36(3):M619-23.Experience with the Sarns centrifugal pump as a ventricular assist device.Joyce LD(1), Kiser JC, Eales F, King RM, Toninato CJ, Hansen J.Author information: (1)Minneapolis Heart Institute, Minnesota 55407.The authors used the Sarns centrifugal pump (Sarns 3M, Ann Arbor, MI) as aventricular assist device (VAD) in 30 patients between May 1985 and February1990. Sixteen patients were unweanable from cardiopulmonary bypass at the time ofsurgery; nine were patients who developed cardiogenic shock postoperatively inthe intensive care unit. One was a donor organ failure; one had a failed PTCA;and one an acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock preoperatively. Twopatients were bridged to cardiac transplantation. Of the 28 nontransplantcandidates, 20 (71.4%) were weaned successfully, 14 (50%) were discharged fromthe hospital, and 13 (46%) are alive from 1 to 46 months postoperatively (mean,21.1 months). Three patients received right ventricular support alone; all three were weaned, and two (66.7%) were discharged. Ten patients received leftventricular assistance alone. Six (60%) were weaned, and four (40%) weredischarged. Two patients received left ventricular support initially but weretaken back for right VAD insertion because of right-sided heart failure; one(50%) is alive. Fifteen patients received biventricular support. Eleven (77.3%)were weaned, and eight (53.3%) were discharged. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 73years, with a mean age for men of 59 years and 50.5 years for women. There wereno thromboembolic events. Various clinical parameters were evaluated to determineeffect on weanability and survival. These results show survival equivalent to anyother VAD at this time. The centrifugal pump is a convenient and effective means of maintaining ventricular support in individuals who are believed to havesalvageable myocardium.
