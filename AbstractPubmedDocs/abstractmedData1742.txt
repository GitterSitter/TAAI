Circulatory assistance and heart transplantation].[Article in French]Tatou E(1), Gomez MC, Leneuf P, Eicher JC, Jazayeri S, Charve P, Girard C, BrenotR, David M.Author information: (1)Service de chirurgie cardiovasculaire (Pr M.

Coronary angiography showed occlusion ofthe left anterior descending artery for which angioplasty resulted in failure.There was antero-lateral-apical akinesia and a ventricular septal defect (VSD)with a left-right shunt (Qp/Qs = 1.54). Persistence and aggravation ofhaemodynamic instability led to intra-aortic balloon pumping with inotropicpharmacological support followed by biventricular assistance with a MEDOS device.Under transoesophageal echocardiographic monitoring, the outcome was marked over 7 days by the progressive increase in the shunt volume of the VSD, a decrease of drainage and injection flow, progressive increase in spontaneous contrast echosfollowed by the presence of fibrin in the cardiac chambers and canulae, thepresence of thrombus in the external ventricles, blockage of the right externalvalve which only opened after increasing the degree of anticoagulation, and,finally, cardiac tamponade which required drainage before the patient's stateimproved. On the 8th day, the patient being stable with a normal neurologicalstatus, the availability of a donor heart led to the decision to transplant,which was carried out without complications. This case poses the problem ofcardiac assist devices and their daily monitoring, and then that of cardiactransplantation in this indication.
