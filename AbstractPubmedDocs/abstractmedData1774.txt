Heart transplantation, the goldstandard in the treatment of end-stage heart failure is reserved for only a fewpatients because of the shortage of donor hearts. Surgical alternatives totransplantation include dynamic cardiomyoplasty (CMP), mitral valvereconstruction, left ventricular reduction surgery (PLVR) and ventricular assist devices (VAD). Improved survival and objective physiologic improvement have notbeen documented for CMP in the treatment of dilative cardiomyopathy. Mitral valvereconstruction on the other hand shows promising results. PLVR is an innovativeprocedure in which the heart is surgically reduced in size and cardiac functionis dramatically improved immediately after surgery. The presence of long-termeffects is still unknown. VAD have been shown to be extremely effective as ashort- and long-term "bridge" to heart transplantation. They are not approved forpermanent support. A randomized trial in the U.S. is underway to compare theefficacy of these devices with the efficacy of medical therapy in NYHA functionalclass IV patients in quality of life, survival and costs.
