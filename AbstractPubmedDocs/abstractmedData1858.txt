This bleeding diathesis may be attributable topre-operative right-ventricular failure with concomitant hepatic dysfunction. Thepurpose of this study was to characterize coagulation abnormalities in LVADrecipients and determine the impact of pre-operative vitamin K administration on the incidence of postoperative bleeding.METHODS: Hemostatic and liver function profiles were obtained in 66 recipients ofthe Heartmate LVAD; 39 of these patients received perioperative vitamin K.RESULTS: During LVAD support, hepatic synthetic function improved as evidenced byincreases in clotting factors II, V, VII, XI. There was ongoing fibrinolysis withelevation of fibrinopeptide A and D-dimers and diminution of fibrinogen; however,plasminogen levels did not decline suggesting that systemic disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIC) did not occur. Bleeding requiring re-exploration more than 48 hours postimplantation occurred in 9 of 66 patients (13.6%). Priorto implantation, patients that bled had decreased levels of factor II (52.2 +/-27.1% vs 69.7 +/- 26.6%; p = 0.048) and prolonged prothrombin times (16.5 +/- 2.4seconds vs 13.8 +/- 3.1 seconds; p = 0.005) compared to patients that did notbleed. Seven of 27 patients (25.9%) not treated with vitamin K bled, while only 2of 39 (5.1%) patients treated with vitamin K required re-exploration for bleeding(p = 0.026).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that: (1) Liver synthetic function improves during LVAD support resulting in increased levels of circulating coagulation factors; (2)ongoing fibrinolysis occurs but likely only represents remodeling of fibrin onthe LVAD surface; (3) perioperative vitamin K reduces nonsurgical bleeding inLVAD recipients.
