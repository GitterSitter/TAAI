Forlanini no. 1, Rome, Italy. antonioloforte@yahoo.itThe novel Permanent Life Support (PLS; Maquet, Jostra Medizintechnik AG,Hirrlingen, Germany) as peripheral veno-arterial extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (ECMO) support system has been investigated as treatment for patientswith refractory cardiogenic shock (CS). Between January 2007 and July 2011, 73consecutive adult patients were supported on peripheral PLS ECMO system at ourinstitution (55 men; age 60.3 ± 11.6 years, range: 23-84 years). Indications for support were failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting ofpostcardiotomy (n = 50) and primary donor graft failure (n = 8), post-acutemyocardial infarction CS (n = 12), and CS on chronic heart failure (n = 3). Mean support time was 10.9 ± 7.6 days (range: 2-34 days). Overall, 26 (35.6%) patientsdied on ECMO. Among survivors on ECMO, 44 (60.2%) patients were successfullyweaned from support, and three (4.1%) were switched to a mid-long-termventricular assist device. Thirty-three (45.2%) were successfully discharged. Thefollowing variables were significantly different if survivors and nonsurvivors onECMO were compared: age (P = 0.04), female gender (P < 0.01), cardiopulmonaryresuscitation before ECMO (P < 0.01), lactate level before ECMO (P = 0.01),number of platelets, fresh frozen plasma units, and packed red blood cells(PRBCs) transfused during ECMO support (P = 0.03, P = 0.02, and P < 0.01), blood lactate level (P = 0.01), and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) relative index72 h after ECMO initiation (P < 0.001), and multiple organ failure on ECMO(P < 0.01). Stepwise logistic regression identified blood lactate level and CK-MBrelative index at 72 h after ECMO initiation, and number of PRBCs transfused onECMO as significant predictors of mortality on ECMO (P = 0.011, odds ratio[OR] = 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-3.12; P = 0.012, OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.026-2.531; and P = 0.012, OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.02-5.21; respectively).Patients with an initial poor hemodynamic status could benefit by rapidperipheral installation of PLS ECMO. The blood lactate level, CK-MB relativeindex, and PRBCs transfused should be strictly monitored during ECMO support.© 2012, Copyright the Authors.
