Although it is beingincreasingly realized that the LVAD unloading results in regression ofhypertrophy and improvement of myocyte function and LV geometry, the cellular andmolecular mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects remain undefined.The favorable alterations in geometry that occur in parallel fashion at theorgan, cellular, and molecular levels are most likely caused by the reduced LVwall stress/stretch as a consequence of the mechanical support provided by LVAD. If it is confirmed that LVAD unloading can contribute significantly to reverseremodeling, the role of LVADs may graduate from bridge-to-transplantation ordestination therapy to bridge-to-recovery.
