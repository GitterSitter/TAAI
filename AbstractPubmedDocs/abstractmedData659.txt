VADs decrease the symptoms of HF and improve quality of life byreplacing some of the work of a failing heart. They unload the ventricle toprovide improved cardiac output and end-organ perfusion, resulting in improvementin cardiorenal syndromes and New York Heart Association functional class rating. VADs are currently used asa bridge to heart transplantation, a bridge to recoveryof cardiac function, or as destination therapy. Complications of VAD includebleeding, infections, arrhythmias, multiple organ failure, right ventricularfailure, and neurological dysfunction. Patients with VAD have uniquepharmacotherapeutic requirements in terms of anticoagulation, appropriateantibiotic selection, and continuation of HF medications. Pharmacists in acutecare and community settings are well prepared to care for the patient with VAD.These patients require thorough counseling and follow-up with regard toprevention and treatment of infections, appropriate levels of anticoagulation,and maintenance of fluid balance. A basic understanding of this unique therapycan assist pharmacists in attending to the needs of patients with VAD.
