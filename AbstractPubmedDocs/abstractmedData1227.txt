Traditionally, extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been the most common form of mechanicalcirculatory support in children. However, more recently, in cases of pureventricular dysfunction, ventricular assist devices (VADs) have offered specific advantages over ECMO, including better ventricular recovery, reducedanticoagulation requirements, decreased use of blood products and decreased cost.We present the use of a VAD in an adolescent with single-ventricle physiology,who could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after undergoing arevision of a modified Fontan operation. Gas exchange was provided by thepatient's lungs while the centrifugal VAD was used successfully to support thecirculation as a bridge, first to a totally implantable pulsatile VAD andsubsequently to heart transplantation.
