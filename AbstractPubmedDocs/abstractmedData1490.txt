The role of continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support in the reduction of elevated PVR wasevaluated in a series of clinical implants.METHODS: Among 17 patients with terminal heart failure receiving a MicroMedDeBakey LVAD as bridge to transplant, there were six patients with pulmonaryhypertension (mean systolic PAP 47 mmHg) and high PVR (398 dynes/cm5), previouslynot considered suitable for heart transplantation, who underwent serial rightheart catheters during their LVAD support period.RESULTS: In these patients mean systolic pulmonary pressure dropped to 29 mmHgand PVR decreased to a mean 167 dynes/cm5 under LVAD support. Clinicalimprovement was significant in all patients. Four patients were successfullytransplanted without major postoperative difficulties (mean duration 130 dayssupport) and all are doing well to date. Post-transplant-PVR remained in thenormal range in all transplanted patients.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated PVR and severe PH were both previously considered ascontraindication for heart transplantation. A period of LVAD pumping leads to aprogressive decrease of PVR and normalization of pulmonary pressures, makingthese patients amenable for heart transplantation. LVAD as bridge to hearttransplantation is safe and highly beneficial for terminal heart failure patientswith severe PH.
