For example, children withlymphocytic myocarditis have an overall survival rate of nearly 90%, withcomplete myocardial recovery for the majority. Pharmacologic agents traditionallyhave been the mainstay of medical therapy for acute heart failure, but, in recentyears, there has been increasing interest in using measures that reduce themyocardial workload. This article highlights nonpharmacologic approaches to themanagement of severe heart failure in the critically ill child. It alsoconcentrates on physiologic approaches that address the balance between oxygendemand and delivery; the manipulation of cardiopulmonary interactions to optimizeventricular function; and the use of mechanical circulatory support as a methodof achieving ultimate myocardial rest.
