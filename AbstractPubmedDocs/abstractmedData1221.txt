Traditionally viewed asa bridge to transplantation and more recently as a destination therapy, leftventricular assist device support is now recognized to offer potential formyocardial recovery through reverse remodeling, a potential that is furtherenhanced by combination with pharmacologic therapy. In this study, we examine themolecular changes associated with left ventricular assist device support and how these may contribute to the recovery process.RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in both patients and experimental models havedemonstrated that improved function is associated with alterations in several keypathways including cell survival, cytokine signaling, calcium handling,adrenergic receptor signaling, cytoskeletal and contractile proteins, energymetabolism, extracellular matrix, and endothelial and microvascular functions.Moreover, the unique research opportunities offered by left ventricular assistdevice analysis are beginning to distinguish changes associated with recoveryfrom those of mechanical unloading alone and identify potential predictors andnovel therapeutic targets capable of enhancing myocardial repair.SUMMARY: Significant progress has been made toward revealing molecular changesassociated with myocardial recovery from heart failure. These studies also offer new insight into the pathogenesis of heart failure and point to novel therapeuticstrategies.
