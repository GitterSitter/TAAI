We present our recentexperience with a pneumatically powered left ventricular assist device (LVAD)implanted emergently to salvage adolescents with severe biventricular failure.Four patients, aged 15-17 years, body surface areas of 1.5-1.7 m2, with dilatedcardiomyopathy (LV diastolic dimension, 7.1-8.3 cm); two presented withcardiovascular collapse, one with refractory ventricular tachycardia, and onewith cardiac arrest. Hemodynamic and biochemical data before and 1 week afterLVAD placement are expressed as mean and range values. None of the patientsrequired right ventricular assist, and all patients achieved functional recovery while on LVAD support (8-71 days). Currently, all four patients are alive (11-22 months) after successful CTx. We conclude that emergency implantation of an LVAD in adolescents with biventricular heart failure can be life saving. As has beenshown in the adult population, such a ventricular assist system restores normalcirculatory hemodynamics, reverses multi-organ dysfunction, and provides a "safe"bridge to transplantation.
