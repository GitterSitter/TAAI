Most VADs are used as a bridge to hearttransplantation; however, in certain cases, myocardial function recovers and VADscan be explanted after the patient is weaned. The objectives of this study wereto describe patients who required Heartmate II VAD insertion, followed bymyocardial recovery and explanation in a quaternary heart centre.METHODS: Patients who had a VAD explanted were identified in the mechanicalsupport institutional database and their outcomes were analyzed. Clinicalexaminations, biochemical markers, and serial echocardiograms were used todemonstrate myocardial recovery.RESULTS: Seventeen patients had a Heartmate II VAD inserted between 2008 and2010. Four patients underwent successful weaning and subsequent VAD explantation.Etiology of decompensated heart failure was idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 1), ischemic (n = 1), or myocarditis (n = 2). Mean age was 35.3 years. Patientswere supported for 213 days (range 70-293 days) and were in New York HeartAssociation class I in the community before explantation. The devices wereexplanted via a minimally invasive approach, without cardiopulmonary bypass. All patients survived explantation and were discharged alive from hospital after anaverage of 5.7 ± 1.5 days post pump explantation. No adverse events were reportedafter explantation. Only one patient required allogenic blood transfusion afterthe procedure.CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring VAD support for myocardial failure can undergosignificant reverse remodelling. Explantation can lead to optimal outcome withminimal morbidity. Methods for assessment of reverse remodelling, weaningprotocol, and optimal timing of explantation remain under evaluation.Copyright © 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.
