Cas Lek Cesk. 1990 Mar 2;129(9):257-62.[Use of an artificial heart and ventricular support system before hearttransplantation].[Article in Czech]Rokitansky A(1), Wolner E.Author information: (1)II. chirurgická univerzitní klinika, Víden, Allgemeines Krankenhaus, Wien.Acute, uncontrollable heart failure in young candidates for transplantationshould be considered an indication for implantation of an artificial heart orartificial support of the hear ventricle, if a suitable graft for transplantationis not available at the time. It may be assumed that the two systems will ensure an adequate circulation and will improve organ function. The success of two-stagetransplantation is cca 50%. Postoperative haemorrhage and infection are a majorproblem. Infection after implantation of an artificial heart is frequentlyincurable and is a clear contra-indication for further implantation.Thromboembolism caused by the artificial blood pump does not seem to be a seriouscomplication when used temporarily. As none of the patients died due to failureof the pump and as also the other problems associated with the use of anartificial heart or a supporting device were successfully resolved, research and development of artificial blood pumps should proceed. Clinical results alsoconfirmed the success of two-stage transplantation of the heart.
