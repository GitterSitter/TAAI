We sought to validate the use of anew intracardiac axial flow impeller pump for this purpose.METHODS AND RESULTS: The Jarvik 2000 Heart was implanted into 30 sheep toascertain mechanical reliability, biocompatibility, and hemodynamic function. We attempted but failed to anticoagulate with warfarin. Elective explants withsurvival were performed in 3 animals to simulate bridge to recovery. Extensiveautopsy studies were performed in all other animals. At speeds between 8000 and12 000 rpm the device pumped up to 8 L/min, captured all mitral flow, andaugmented cardiac output with elevation of mean arterial pressure. The pump wassilent and hemolysis negligible. Nonpulsatile flow did not adversely affectneurological or renal function. Device removal proved straightforward and safe. Afractured inflow bearing occurred in 1 early model. There were no other pumpfailures, but power interruption occurred when the sheep chewed the cables orhead-butted the percutaneous pedestal. At autopsy, there was no thromboembolismor primary thrombus formation in any device. Pump occlusion occurred in 2 sheepwith bacterial endocarditis. One electively explanted pump, previously switchedoff for 5 months, had no thrombus in the device or vascular graft.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 Heart is a major advance in blood-pump technologyand increases the scope of mechanical circulatory support. Reliability and easeof removal favor its use for bridge to myocyte recovery, as well as for bridge totransplantation or long-term support.
