ASAIO J. 1996 Sep-Oct;42(5):M573-6.A comparison between intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal left ventricular assist system placement.Wasler A(1), Springer WE, Radovancevic B, Myers TJ, Stutts LA, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Texas Heart Institute, St. Luke'sEpiscopal Hospital, Houston, USA.The HeartMate left ventricular assist system (LVAS) is being used with increasingfrequency as a bridge to heart transplantation and for long-term support ofchronic heart failure patients who are not transplant candidates. The surgicaltechniques and anatomic placement of the HeartMate are factors in minimizingcomplications that occur during long-term use. Device related bleeding,infection, and other intraabdominal complications are serious adverse eventsassociated with the position of the LVAS. Clinical data from 48 HeartMatesupported patients were analyzed retrospectively to determine differences inserious complication rates between intraperitoneal (IP) and extraperitoneal (EP) LVAS placement. The LVAS was placed IP in 37 patients (77%) and EP in 11 patients(23%). The occurrence of postoperative bleeding that required reoperation was 57%in the IP group and 64% in the EP group. Device related bleeding was 8% in the IPgroup and 29% in the EP. Neither difference in bleeding rate was statisticallysignificant. The overall infection rate during the entire period of LVAS support was similar between groups (IP, 45.7%; EP, 46.2%; p = 0.25); however, devicerelated infection occurred more often in the EP group (46%; IP, 14%; p = 0.025). All patients who recovered from LVAS implantation experienced mild early satiety,but were otherwise free of intra-abdominal complications. The transplantationrate was 64% for the IP group and 78% for the EP group. IP LVAS placement mayoffer additional protection against device related infections.
