Epub 2004 May 10.Clinical recovery from end-stage heart failure using left-ventricular assistdevice and pharmacological therapy correlates with increased sarcoplasmicreticulum calcium content but not with regression of cellular hypertrophy.Terracciano CM(1), Hardy J, Birks EJ, Khaghani A, Banner NR, Yacoub MH.Author information: (1)Cellular Electrophysiology, Imperial College London, NHLI, Harefield HeartScience Centre, Harefield Hospital, Harefield, Middlesex UB9 6JH, UK.c.terracciano@imperial.ac.ukBACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) treatment is known to lead tostructural and functional cellular modifications in the heart. The relevance ofthese changes for clinical recovery is unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared properties of cardiomyocytes obtained fromtissue taken at explantation of the LVAD in patients with clinical recovery with those obtained from hearts of patients who did not show clinical recovery, thusrequiring transplantation. Compared with myocytes taken at implantation, both therecovery and nonrecovery groups showed approximately 50% reduction in cellcapacitance, an index of cell size. However, action potential duration shortened,L-type Ca2+ current fast inactivation was more rapid, and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content was increased in the recovery compared with the nonrecovery group.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that specific changes in excitation-contractioncoupling, and not regression of cellular hypertrophy, are specifically associatedwith clinical recovery after LVAD and further identify sarcoplasmic reticulumCa2+ handling as a key functional determinant in patients with heart failure.
