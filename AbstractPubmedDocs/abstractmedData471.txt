The concurrent use of mechanical circulatorysupport and bariatric surgery allowed the patient to lose weight and subsequentlyto qualify for placement on the heart transplant waiting list. This strategysupports consideration of patients previously deemed unsuitable for hearttransplantation owing to morbid obesity. Careful patient selection and strictmonitoring of the immunosuppressive regimens are important considerations for afavorable outcome.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
