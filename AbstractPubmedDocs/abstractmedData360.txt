Indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely withthe development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), and thetotal artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patients withend-stage heart failure awaiting for transplantation. However, the transplantcannot be the only solution, due to an insufficient number of available donors,but also because of the high number of patients who are not candidates for severecomorbidities or advanced age. New perspectives are emerging in which the VAD is no longer conceived only as a "Bridge to Transplant", but is now seen as adestination therapy. In this review, the main VAD classification, current basicindications, functioning modalities, main limitations of surgical VAD and thetotal artificial heart development are described.
