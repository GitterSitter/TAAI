To date there has been no detailedassessment of the incidence of a full range of AEs using standardized eventdefinitions. We sought to characterize the frequency and timing of AE onsetduring the first 60 days of VAD support, a period during which clinicalobservation suggests the risk of incident AEs is high.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing prospectively collecteddata from a single-site clinical database including 195 patients aged 18 orgreater receiving VADs between 1996 and 2006. Adverse events were coded usingstandardized criteria. Cumulative incidence rates were determined, controllingfor competing risks (death, transplantation, recovery-wean).RESULTS: During the first 60 days after implantation, the most common AEs werebleeding, infection, and arrhythmias (cumulative incidence rates, 36% to 48%),followed by tamponade, respiratory events, reoperations, and neurologic events(24% to 31%). Other events (eg, hemolysis, renal, hepatic events) were lesscommon (rates <15%). Some events (eg, bleeding, arrhythmias) showed steep onsetrates early after implantation. Others (eg, infections, neurologic events) hadgradual onsets during the 60-day period. Incidence of most events did not vary byimplant era (1996 to 2000 vs 2001 to 2006) or by left ventricular versusbiventricular support.CONCLUSIONS: Understanding differential temporal patterns of AE onset will allow preventive strategies to be targeted to the time periods when specific AE risksare greatest. The AE incidence rates provide benchmarks against which futurestudies of VAD-related risks may be compared.PMCID: PMC2763436
