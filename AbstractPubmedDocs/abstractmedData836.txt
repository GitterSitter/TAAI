However, current technology for controllers and alarmsystems for left ventricular assist devices does not permit their implantation ineligible patients with visual impairment. We report two patients in whom thedecrease in visual acuity was a significant factor in determining eligibility forlong-term mechanical circulatory support.Â© 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd
