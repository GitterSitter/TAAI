In the early stages of heart failure,ventricular contractility is maintained by adrenergic stimulation,rennin-angiotensin activation, and other neurohormonal and cytokine systemresponses. As the disease progresses, however, these compensatory mechanismscease to provide benefit; ventricular dilation and fibrosis occur and cardiacfunction deteriorates. When ventricular contractility becomes severely depressed and is no longer responsive to inotropic support, insertion of a left ventricularassist device (LVAD) may allow the left ventricle to rest, remodel, and recoversome contractile function. Our previous work has demonstrated that the myocardiumhas the capacity to repair itself during a period of unloading, after which some patients are able to resume a normal lifestyle and no longer need a cardiactransplant.
