Immediately before LVADimplantation and explantation, pressure and volume measurements were made withcatheters and echocardiography, respectively, the E(max) being calculated fromthe slope of the pressure-volume loops, and the left ventricular ejectionfraction (LVEF) being estimated by echocardiography. Transplantation wasperformed after 14 and 62 days, respectively, during which the LVEF increased by 75% (from 12% to 21%) in Patient 1 and remained unchanged (from 16% to 18%) inPatient 2, whereas the E(max) increased from 0.63 and 0.42 mm Hg/ml,respectively, to 1.31 and 1.07 mm Hg/ml, reflecting a 107% and 155% improvement. In these 2 cases, the E(max) was a more reliable indicator of intrinsicmyocardial contractility than was the LVEF.
