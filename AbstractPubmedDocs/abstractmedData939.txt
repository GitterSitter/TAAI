Epub 2010 Jul 1.The new concept of ''interventional heart failure therapy'': part 2--inotropes,valvular disease, pumps, and transplantation.Thompson KA(1), Philip KJ, Simsir S, Schwarz ER.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Cedars Sinai Heart Institute, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.Recent advances in heart failure therapy include a variety of mechanical anddevice-based technologies that target structural aspects of heart failure thatcannot be treated with drug therapy alone; these newer therapies can collectivelybe described as interventional heart failure therapy. This article is the second in a 2-part series reviewing interventional heart failure therapy. Interventions included in this discussion include those indicated for the treatment ofend-stage refractory heart failure, including interventional medical therapy,interventional treatment of valvular disease, mechanical assist devices, andheart transplantation. Also included is a review of the currently availablecatheter-based pumps, which are intended to provide temporary support in patientswith acute hemodynamic compromise. The use of cellular or stem cell therapy forthe treatment of heart failure is an emerging interventional therapy and datasupporting its use for the treatment heart failure will also be presented, aswill a discussion of the role of palliative care and self-care in heart failuretherapy.
