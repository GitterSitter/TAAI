We describe the case of a 35-year-old man with dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy who was supported with anLVAD for 9 months. After the device was removed, he led a normal life for 13years and 4 months. However, at 49 years of age, he presented with new signs and symptoms of heart failure, necessitating implantation of a 2nd LVAD. Afterwards, he has remained asymptomatic. This case is unique in that the patient lived anormal life for longer than a decade before renewed left ventriculardecompensation necessitated repeat LVAD therapy. Histologic examination revealed few changes between the first device's removal in 1999 and the 2nd device'simplantation in 2012.PMCID: PMC4120501
