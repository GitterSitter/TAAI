Right ventricular dilation and paradoxic movement of theinterventricular septum on echocardiography establishes the diagnosis. Rightheart catheterization is useful in establishing the specific cause and aidsclinicians in management. Principles of treatment focus on reversal of theunderlying cause, optimization of right ventricular preload and contractility,and reduction of right ventricular afterload. Mechanical support with rightventricular assist device or veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenationcan be used in select patients who fail to improve with optimal medical therapy.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.
