LVADs used as a bridgeto cardiac transplantation unload the left ventricle and may lead to a reversalof the remodeling, but little is known about the pathophysiology of this process.METHODS: The immunoreactivity for MT and the cardiomyocyte diameter was analyzed in left-ventricular tissue specimens of 17 patients with end-stage heart failure before and after LVAD support.RESULTS: MT positive cells were mainly located sub-endocardially in vacuolizedcardiomyocytes and in small vessels throughout the myocardium. During LVADsupport, MT-positive myocytes decreased in the sub-endocardial (p < 0.008) andsub-epicardial region (p < 0.003), MT-positive vessels decreased similarly (p <0.003). Cardiomyocyte diameter decreased significantly only in thesub-endocardium (p < 0.03). Hearts of patients supported longer than 88 days (=median) showed substantially lower MT reactivity at the time of LVAD explantationas compared to patients supported less than 88 days.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that unloading of the left ventricle duringprolonged LVAD support leads to regression of cellular hypertrophy and a decreaseof MT expression. The preferential reduction of MT-positive vacuolizedcardiomyocytes in the sub-endocardium is comparable with the concept of greatest reduction of wall stress in this area of the myocardium and may be due to theimprovement of myocardial blood flow and the energy balance.
