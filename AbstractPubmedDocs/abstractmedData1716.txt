ASAIO J. 2001 Nov-Dec;47(6):590-5.Hospital discharge for the ventricular assist device patient: historicalperspective and description of a successful program.Richenbacher WE(1), Seemuth SC.Author information: (1)The University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, 52242, USA.Comment in    ASAIO J. 2001 Nov-Dec;47(6):588-9.Patients who are supported with an implantable ventricular assist device (VAD) asa bridge to cardiac transplantation are potential candidates for hospitaldischarge. Hospital discharge rates in reported clinical series vary from 27% to 60%. Many of the patients included in these series, however, were subjects ofpremarket approval clinical trials and as such, are bound by rigid eligibilitycriteria for discharge. According to a voluntary registry maintained by ThermoCardiosystems, Inc., the postmarket discharge rate in patients supported with theHeartMate VE LVAS is approximately 25%, a number that is artificially low due to incomplete reporting. The postmarket discharge rate at the busiest ThermoCardiosystems HeartMate VE LVAS centers is 53%. Clearly, discharge rates need to increase if the VAD is ever to be considered a viable destination therapy forend-stage heart failure. The discharge program instituted at The University ofIowa incorporates patient and family training as well as community serviceseducation. Between January 1999 and April 2001, fourteen patients received VADsupport as a bridge to transplantation with the HeartMate VE LVAS. Thirteenpatients (93%) were discharged from the hospital. Eight of the 13 patients havebeen transplanted after having spent 65.8% +/- 31.4% of their period of bloodpump support as an outpatient. Eight of 13 patients (62%) required a total of 20 unplanned repeat hospitalizations. A well defined, aggressively implementeddischarge program can adequately prepare the VAD patient for the transition from hospital to home.
