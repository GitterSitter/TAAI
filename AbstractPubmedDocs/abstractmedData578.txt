CVD is the main cause of the disease burden (illness and death) inEurope (23% of all the disease burdens) and the second main cause of the disease burden in those European Union (EU) countries with very low child and adultmortality (17%).(1) Heart disease is a common health problem worldwide. Accordingto the most recent Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2011 update,(2) greaterthan 82 000 000 adults living in the United States of America (USA) have one ormore types of CVD. Many resources have been invested in attempting to understand and curtail the progression of congestive HF. This article attempts to addressthe growing concern over HF by looking at the epidemiology, pathophysiology andavailable therapies as anaesthesiologists encounter these patients more oftennowadays in the operating room and intensive care units. Mechanical circulatoryassistance and heart transplantation are two established treatment methods forend-stage HF. In this review, we also address the indications andcontraindications for mechanical circulatory assistance, types and spectrum ofavailable ventricular assist devices, efficacy, safety and cost analysis ofcirculatory support therapy.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
