Theintermediate-term functional changes in RV function in patients with refractoryheart failure (HF) supported with a continuous LVAD are not well characterized.METHODS: Serial transthoracic echocardiograms and simultaneous measurements ofbiochemical surrogates of disease severity and organ perfusion were obtained in20 patients (aged 57 +/- 17 years) with refractory HF before and afterimplantation of a continuous-flow LVAD (VentrAssist, Ventracor Ltd, Chatswood,Australia).RESULTS: After a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 140 days (34-367days), RV diameter was reduced (36 +/- 7 vs 33 +/- 4 mm; p = 0.04), as was right atrial area (27 +/- 5 vs 24 +/- 6 cm(2); p = .04). There was a trend toward areduction in tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion (14 +/- 6 vs 13 +/- 5 mm;p = .05). RV fractional area change (26% +/- 13% vs 27% +/- 10%; p = .53) andglobal RV dysfunction graded visually using a scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe dysfunction) did not change from pre-implant to follow-up (2 [1-2] vs 1.5[0.5-2]; p = .18). The degree of global RV dysfunction at follow-up was closelyrelated to the degree of RV dysfunction at the pre-implant study (r = 0.69; p =.001). Changes in global RV dysfunction were inversely related to changes inglomerular filtration rate (r = -0.49; p = .03).CONCLUSIONS: During continuous-flow LVAD support, pre-existing RV dysfunctiondoes not worsen in the intermediate term.
