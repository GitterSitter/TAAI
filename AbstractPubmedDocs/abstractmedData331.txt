Our aim was to determine risk factors associated withthe outcomes of delisting, transplant, or death while waiting.METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study of patients listed for heart transplants, competing risk analysis was used to model survival from listing to 4competing outcomes (transplant, death, delisting for clinical deterioration,delisting for clinical improvement or surgical intervention).RESULTS: There were 308 listing episodes in 280 patients. In competing riskanalysis, 11% remained listed at 6 months (transplant 62%, dead 13%, delistedworse 6%, delisted improved 8%). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation andventricular assist devices were associated both with higher probability oftransplant (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; P < .001) and delisting for clinicaldeterioration (HR, 2.7; P = .06). Younger age at listing and complex congenitalheart disease were shared risk factors for mortality (HR, 1.07; P = .05; HR, 2.9;P = .003) and delisting because of clinical deterioration (HR, 1.17; P = .01; HR,2.8; P = .02). Younger age at listing and fetal listing were associated withdelisting for clinical improvement or surgical intervention (HR, 1.13; P = .01;HR, 2.9; P = .02).CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival to transplant depends on risk factors including ageat listing, cardiac diagnosis, and mechanical circulatory support. Knowledge ofrisk factors for death and delisting for clinical deterioration or improvementcan assist patient selection and timing of transplant listing.Copyright © 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
