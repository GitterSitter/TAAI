J Heart Lung Transplant. 2004 Feb;23(2):228-35.Increased toll-like receptor 4 in the myocardium of patients requiring leftventricular assist devices.Birks EJ(1), Felkin LE, Banner NR, Khaghani A, Barton PJ, Yacoub MH.Author information: (1)Heart Science Centre, Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital, Harefield,Middlesex, United Kingdom.BACKGROUND: Cytokine activation in the myocardium of deteriorating patients with heart failure who undergo left ventricular assist-device (LVAD) implantation has been documented, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Wehypothesized the innate immune system is activated with expression of Toll-likereceptor 4 (TLR4), leading to cytokine activation in these patients.METHODS: We used quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chainreaction to measure TLR4, interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor, IL-1 beta, IL-6, andtumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA expression in myocardial samplesfrom 36 patients. We compared 18 patients who underwent LVAD implantation with 18patients with less severe heart failure who underwent elective hearttransplantation.RESULTS: Toll-like receptor 4 expression was 1.69-fold greater (p < 0.05) andIL-1 receptor expression was 3.64-fold greater (p < 0.0001) in the deteriorating patients who required LVADs. Myocardial TNF-alpha (1.71-fold, p < 0.05), IL-6(2.57-fold, p < 0.005), and IL-1 beta (9.78-fold, p < 0.001) also were increased in the LVAD candidates. Toll-like receptor 4 expression correlated strongly with IL-1 receptor expression (r= 0.75, p < 0.0001) and with IL-1 beta expression inindividual patients (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001). Interleukin-1 receptor expression alsocorrelated with IL-1 beta expression (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) within patients. Wefound no correlation between TLR4 and either TNF-alpha or IL-6 expression.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who required LVAD support showed evidence of innate immune system activation, indicated by an increase in the key effector molecule TLR4associated with a specific pattern of cytokine expression in the myocardium.
