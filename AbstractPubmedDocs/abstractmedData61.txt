This shortage has led to the development of effective mechanicalcirculatory support (MCS). Currently, various implantable ventricular-assistdevices (VADs) are able to provide temporary or long-term circulatory support formany end-stage heart-failure patients. Implantation of a total artificial heart(TAH) currently represents the surgical treatment option for patients requiringbiventricular MCS as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT).However, the clinical applicability of available versions of positivedisplacement pumps is limited by their size and associated complications.Application of advanced technology is aimed at solving some of these issues,attempting to develop a new generation of smaller and more effective TAHs to suita wider patient population. Particular targets for improvement includemodifications to the biocompatibility of device designs and materials in order todecrease hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. Meanwhile, new systems to power implanted driving units which are fully operational without interruption ofskin barriers represent a potential means of decreasing the risk of infections.In this review, we will discuss the history of the TAH, its development andclinical application, the implications of the existing technological solutions,published outcomes and the future outlook for TAHs.PMCID: PMC4250545
