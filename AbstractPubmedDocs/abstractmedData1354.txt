Ten patients had undergoneimplantation of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system.RESULTS: In 26 cases, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was implanted,while 3 patients had biventricular support. The support interval of all patients surviving the perioperative period lasted from 30 to 412 days, mean period ofsupport until heart transplantation or explantation was 184 +/- 117 days. Severe complications were rare.CONCLUSION: The Excor paracorporeal mechanical support system is an excellent andhighly versatile device for the support of patients of all ages and differenttypes of underlying heart disease in the mid-term and long-term. The implantprocedure and the perioperative management are simple, and complication rates arelow.
