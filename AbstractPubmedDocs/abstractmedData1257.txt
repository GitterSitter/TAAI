Crit Care Nurs Q. 2007 Oct-Dec;30(4):337-46.The next treatment option: using ventricular assist devices for heart failure.Stahovich M(1), Chillcott S, Dembitsky WP.Author information: (1)Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego, California 92123, USA.marcia.stahovich@sharp.comVentricular assist devices (VADs) are becoming more commonplace in the hospitaland community settings as the number of patients living with heart failureincreases. Patients being discharged after hospitalization for heart failure rosefrom 399 000 in 1979 to 1 099 000 in 2004, an increase of 175%. Patients withheart failure become severely debilitated finding activities of daily livingincluding eating, bathing, and walking a great effort. Patients with end-stageheart failure are often sent home on inotropic therapies and referred to hospice care. The use of VADs for these patients can dramatically improve both thequality and the length of life. VADs can be broadly categorized as being eithercontinuous flow (fluid dynamic) or pulsatile (volume displacement) and either canbe used as short- or long-term support devices. The critical care nurse is in aunique position to educate patients with chronic heart failure on optionsavailable to improve their quality of life including VAD therapy. VADs areavailable for destination therapy for those not meeting transplant criteria,offering a longer quality of life. As centers gain more experience and referrals are made earlier in the disease process, VAD patient care will be morestreamlined decreasing length of stay.
