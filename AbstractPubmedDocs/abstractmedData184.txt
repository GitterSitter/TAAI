Epub 2014 Mar 20.Cost of 1-year left ventricular assist device destination therapy in chronicheart failure: a comparison with heart transplantation.Droogne W, Jacobs S, Van den Bossche K, Verhoeven J, Bostic RR, Vanhaecke J, Van Cleemput J, Rega F, Meyns B.OBJECTIVE: To analyse overall cost involved with destination therapy (DT) incomparison to transplantation (HTX) and bridging to transplantation.METHODS: Three groups of patients at one hospital were considered for this costanalysis: (1) patients included in the BENEMACS study starting May 2009 (n = 6); (2) all patients from May 2009 till May 2010 undergoing heart transplantation(n = 19); or (iii) undergoing Heartmate II implantation as a bridge to transplant(n = 13). Patients undergoing bridging were more sick (lower Intermacs class). DTpatients were older (64±8 years). Cost was derived from actual hospital invoices,device, organ procurement and medical cost, and follow-up care during 1 year fromimplantation. Costs are presented in euro, by their mean values and standarddeviation.RESULTS: One-year survivals were 83, 84, and 77%, respectively, for DT, HTX, and bridging. Costs for initial and re-hospitalizations were not different betweengroups. Costs for medical follow-up and medication were significantly higher for transplanted patients. The 1-year total cost was €85 531±19 823 for HTX,€125 108±32 399 for bridging, and €137 068±29 007 for DT. As 42% of thetransplanted patients were bridged, the cost of the medical pathway HTX was€138 076±19 823. Assuming a 5-year survival and a similar yearly follow-up cost, the average cost per year is €42 153 for HTX, €53 637 for transplantationincluding the bridging cost, and €47 487 for DT.CONCLUSION: Direct transplantation without bridging is the most cost-efficienttreatment. The cost per patient per year for DT is similar to HTX considering itsbridging activity.
