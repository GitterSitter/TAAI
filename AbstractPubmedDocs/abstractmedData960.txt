However, little is known about their experience. Data from the Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (2006-2009) reported that 1722 patientshad received LVADs as a bridge to transplantation, recovery, or destinationtherapy. The use of this advanced technology in the management of endstage heart failure is expected to continue, suggesting increased involvement of familymembers and significant others. The purpose of this qualitative study was todescribe the experiences of caregivers of patients who received LVAD therapy as abridge to transplantation.METHODS: Semistructured interviews allowed participants to describe theirexperiences as caregivers. Interviews were audiotape-recorded and transcribedverbatim. An analysis was conducted using Sandelowski's three-step process forthe analysis of phenomenological data: data dwelling, open coding, and datareduction.RESULTS: Participants (n=5 women and 1 man; age, 51 years; range=44 to 66 years; duration of caregiving, 183.9 days; range, 26 to 372 days; relationship topatient: spouse=3, parent=1, significant other=1, and friend=1) were designatedcaregivers of patients discharged home with an LVAD. Two themes emerged:sacrifice and moving beyond. Caregivers sacrificed relationships with friends andfamily, jobs and livelihood, health, and peace of mind in their roles ascaregivers. "Moving beyond" reflected coping and adaptation to the sacrifices of being a caregiver.CONCLUSIONS: Experiences described by caregivers suggest that they successfullyincorporated the role of caregiver for patients with a complex therapeuticregimen into their daily lives. The specific findings should guide healthcareprofessionals in their efforts to support caregivers.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
