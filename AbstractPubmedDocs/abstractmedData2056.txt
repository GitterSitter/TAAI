Ann Thorac Surg. 1992 Dec;54(6):1139-43.Clinical cardiomyoplasty: preoperative factors associated with outcome.Furnary AP(1), Magovern JA, Christlieb IY, Orie JE, Simpson KA, Magovern GJ.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA 15212.Dynamic cardiomyoplasty has been used clinically to augment the ventricularfunction of a failing heart. Fifteen clinical dynamic cardiomyoplasties have beenperformed at Allegheny General Hospital since 1985. Left ventricular ejectionfraction improved in long-term survivors from a preoperative value of 0.23 +/-0.02 to 0.32 +/- 0.05 with postoperative cardiomyostimulation (p < 0.05). Therewas an average reduction of 2 +/- 0.3 New York Heart Association classes (3.6 +/-0.2 before operation versus 1.6 +/- 0.4 after operation; p < 0.001).Postoperative mortality was 27% (4/15), and early mortality (within 6 monthsafter operation) was 20% (3/15). Significant preoperative differences betweensurvivors and nonsurvivors were found in right ventricular ejection fraction(0.53 +/- 0.03 versus 0.30 +/- 0.07; p < 0.05), pulmonary artery mean pressure(19 +/- 2 versus 34 +/- 6 mm Hg; p < 0.05), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure(12 +/- 1 versus 25 +/- 5 mm Hg; p < 0.05), and pulmonary vascular resistance(1.4 +/- 2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.7 Wood units; p < 0.05). Dynamic cardiomyoplasty can be done with low operative mortality in patients with isolated left ventricularfailure, but mortality is high in those with biventricular failure or pulmonaryhypertension. Improvement in functional class and ventricular function can beexpected in long-term survivors. Application of these findings to patientselection will improve the risk/benefit ratio for dynamic cardiomyoplasty.
