However, the anatomic andphysiologic consequences of long-term LVAD support have yet to be fullyclarified. Despite the clinical success of these devices, it has been reportedthat many patients bridged to transplantation with mechanical support developcirculating antibodies with potential donor reactivity. Transplanting againstexisting or historic donor-specific antibodies is associated with increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection, graft dysfunction, and decreased survival. Safetransplantation of allosensitized patients is dependent on using prospectivecrossmatching and antibody titer reduction techniques (desensitization). Strictprotocols requiring a negative prospective crossmatch before transplantationresult in a decreased donor pool and a longer duration of support in sensitizedLVAD recipients with increased inherent morbidity such as infections andthromboembolic complications. The aim of this review is to present the currentstate of knowledge of possible immunologic mechanisms involved inalloimmunization of LVAD recipients, outline new methods of antibody detection,compare various desensitization strategies, and present an overview of clinicaldata assessing the impact of sensitization on posttransplantation outcome.
