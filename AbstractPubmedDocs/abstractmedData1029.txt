Anecdotally, the prevalence of cardiac cachexia appears to befalling, perhaps due to the increased use of beta-blockers. However, chronicheart failure is so common that many patients continue to lose weight andcontinue to deteriorate to a point where transplantation or mechanical support isconsidered. The origin of cachexia remains elusive and further research is neededto explore the relation between weight, sympathetic activation, and the response to cardiac surgery or transplantation.
