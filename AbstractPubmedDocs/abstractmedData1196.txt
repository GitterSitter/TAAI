Post-operative complicationscould be minimized by the placement of these devices without the use ofcardiopulmonary bypass.METHODS: We hypothesize that left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), in selectedpatients, can be implanted safely off-pump.RESULTS: In 25 patients, LVADs were implanted off-pump (mean age 50 years; 64%male, 36% female; average left ventricular ejection fraction 15%).Pre-operatively 68% of patients were on inotropes, 25% had an intra-aortic ballonpump, and 44% had a previous sternotomy. Blood utilization intra- andpost-operatively was relatively minimal with 1 re-exploration for bleeding. Therewere 3 deaths.CONCLUSIONS: We describe a technique for successful placement of a leftventricular assist device without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.
