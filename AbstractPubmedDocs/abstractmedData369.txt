Published data regarding LVAD-associated infections (LVADIs) are limited by single-center experiences and use of nonstandardized definitions.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 247 patients who underwent continuous-flowLVAD implantation from January 2005 to December 2011 at Mayo Clinic campuses inMinnesota, Arizona, and Florida. LVADIs were defined using the InternationalSociety for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria.RESULTS: We identified 101 episodes of LVADI in 78 patients (32%) from thiscohort. Mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) was 57±15 years. The majority (94%) underwent Heartmate II implantation, with 62% LVADs placed as destinationtherapy. The most common type of LVADIs were driveline infections (47%), followedby bloodstream infections (24% VAD related, and 22% non-VAD related). The mostcommon causative pathogens included gram-positive cocci (45%), predominantlystaphylococci, and nosocomial gram-negative bacilli (27%). Almost half (42%) ofthe patients were managed by chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy. While 14%of the patients had intraoperative debridement, only 3 underwent complete LVADremoval. The average duration (±SD) of LVAD support was 1.5±1.0 years. At year 2 of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was estimated to be43%.CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of LVADI vary on the basis of the type ofinfection and the causative pathogen. Mortality remained high despite combinedmedical and surgical intervention and chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy. Based on clinical experiences, a management algorithm for LVADI is proposed toassist in the decision-making process.PMCID: PMC3805171
