Kaufman Center for Heart Failure, Cleveland Clinic,Cleveland, Ohio, USA. HOERCHK@ccf.orgThe cardiac transplantation program at Cleveland Clinic has performed 1,627 adultorthotopic heart transplants, with a current 1-year survival of 96% and a 3-year survival of 82%. The change in the heart allocation system in 2006 has affectedour Center by both reducing the number of transplants we perform annually andincreasing the percentage of recipients on MCS at the time of transplant. Despitethe increased utilization of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to transplant, we continue to maintain excellent outcomes. The major clinicaladvances in LVAD technology have allowed us to expand this therapy to ineligible transplant patients, with outcomes that are continually improving. Nevertheless, the field of MCS as permanent therapy is still in its infancy. The number ofpatients who can benefit from this technology in the U.S. alone is in thethousands, but refinements in patient selection and management are needed tofurther advance this lifesaving therapy.
