However, we hypothesized that such dilation could be reversed withsufficient hemodynamic unloading, such as can be provided by a left ventricularassist device (LVAD).METHODS AND RESULTS: The EDPVRs of hearts from seven patients with end-stageidiopathic cardiomyopathy and comparable baseline hemodynamics were measured exvivo at the time of cardiac transplantation; these were compared with EDPVRs fromthree normal human hearts that were technically unsuitable for transplantation.Four of the patients received optimal medical therapy; three of the patients, whodeteriorated on optimal therapy, underwent LVAD support for approximately 4months. Compared with the normal hearts, EDPVRs of hearts from medically treated patients were shifted toward markedly larger volumes. In contrast, EDPVRs ofhearts from LVAD patients were similar to those of normal hearts.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hemodynamic unloading of sufficient magnitude and durationcan result in reversal of chamber enlargement and normalization of cardiacstructure as indexed by the EDPVR, both important aspects of remodeling, even in the most advanced stages of heart failure.
