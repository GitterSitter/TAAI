Most devices require abdominal wall transgression, creating a potential for abdominal complications. The incidence and impact ofthese relatively underreported complications are unknown.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 179 patients who received MCStherapy from 1999 to 2008. Abdominal complications were grouped as abdominalwall, gastrointestinal tract, and solid organ.RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (55%) experienced 157 abdominal complications.These involved the abdominal wall in 69 (44%), the gastrointestinal tract in 52(33%), and the solid organs in 36 (23%). Surgical intervention was required in36% of patients with abdominal wall complications, 19% of patients withgastrointestinal tract complications, and 14% of patients with solid organcomplications. Multivariate analysis identified diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001),emergent device placement (p = 0.019), and preimplant mechanical ventilation (p =0.045) as independent risk factors for developing an abdominal complication.Kaplan-Meier survival while receiving MCS was significantly reduced for patients with abdominal complications versus those without (p = 0.0142). Multivariateanalysis identified only solid organ abdominal complications (p = 0.001) as anindependent risk factor for death while receiving device support.CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal complications are common in patients supported with MCSdevices and significantly reduce survival. Surgical intervention is morefrequently required for complications related to the abdominal wall compared withother complications. Patients with significant comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, respiratory failure) requiring urgent or emergent device placement are at higher risk for the development of abdominal complications with an attendant reductionin device-related survival.2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
