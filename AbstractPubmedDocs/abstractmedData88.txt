As these patients progress toend-stage heart failure they pose a unique set of challenges. Heart transplantremains the standard of care; the donor pool, however, remains limited. Followingthe experience from the adult realm, the pediatric ventricular assist device(VAD) has emerged as a valid treatment option as a bridge to transplant. Due tothe infrequent necessity and the uniqueness of each case, the pediatric VAD inthe CHD population remains a topic with limited information. Given the experiencein the adult realm, we were tasked with reviewing pediatric VADs and their use inpatients with CHD and comparing this therapy to heart transplantation whenpossible.PMCID: PMC4231823 [Available on 2015-07-01]
