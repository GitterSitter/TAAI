J Heart Lung Transplant. 1992 Jan-Feb;11(1 Pt 1):103-16.Summary of the clinical use of the Symbion total artificial heart: a registryreport.Johnson KE(1), Prieto M, Joyce LD, Pritzker M, Emery RW.Author information: (1)Minneapolis Heart Institute, MN 55407.Several models of total artificial hearts have been used for transient orpermanent circulatory support in patients with decompensation. The mostsuccessful and widely used device, however, has been the Symbion total artificialheart. From Dec. 12, 1982, to Jan. 1, 1991, 180 Symbion total artificial heartswere implanted in 176 patients in 28 centers. Five patients received a Symbiontotal artificial heart as a permanent circulatory support device, whereas 171patients received the device as a bridge to heart transplantation. Of the 175bridge devices (171 patients) 141 were Symbion J7-70 hearts and 34 were SymbionJ7-100 hearts. Four patients received two total artificial hearts, the second oneafter the failure of a transplanted heart because of either rejection (twopatients) or donor heart failure (2 patients). Most of the recipients were males (152). The age was 42 +/- 12 years (mean +/- SD) with a weight of 74 +/- 14 kg.The most common indications for implantation included deterioration whileawaiting heart transplant (36%) and acute cardiogenic shock (32%). The cause ofheart disease was primarily ischemic (52%) and idiopathic (35%) cardiomyopathy.Duration of implantation ranged from 0 to 603 days (mean 25 +/- 64 days). Onehundred three (60%) patients had the device less than 2 weeks, 37 (22%) between 2to 4 weeks and 31 (18%) more than 4 weeks. Complications during implantationincluded infection (37%), thromboembolic events (stroke 7%, transient ischemicattack 4%), kidney failure requiring dialysis (20%), bleeding requiringintervention (26%), and device malfunction (4%). Of the 171 patients, 118 (69%)underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Actuarial survival for all patientswith implants was 62% for 30 days and 42% for 1 year, and for patients withtransplants was 72% for 30 days and 57% for 1 year. The main causes of death weresepsis (33%), multiorgan failure (21%), and posttransplant rejection (10%). Theresults indicate a relative success of this treatment for patients with anotherwise fatal prognosis. Moreover, as the demand for donor organs far exceedsavailability, continued investigation of total artificial hearts is justified.
