Am J Cardiovasc Drugs. 2008;8(3):147-53.Device therapy for heart failure: when and for whom?Shams OF(1), Ventura HO.Author information: (1)Department of Internal Medicine, Ochsner Medical Center, New Orleans,Louisiana 70121, USA.Surgical approaches to heart failure (HF) management have become a necessarystrategy in response to a waiting list that is expanding in the face of a limitedsupply of organ donors. Multiple studies have supported the safety and efficacyof device-based therapy. Among the device-based therapy options, ventricularassist devices (VADs) represent an alternative to heart transplantation with the capability to function as short-term support, bridge-to-transplantation orrecovery and as long-term support. VAD support may be considered in those withrefractory cardiogenic shock or those with decompensated chronic HF that isunresponsive to maximized medical therapy. Composite scoring scales may be usedto risk-stratify patients using clinical and laboratory values to allow moresystematic patient selection. As the pursuit for a perfect device continues, sodoes the search for the best objective index to guide referral. Technologicadvances will enhance device performance and extend VAD use into communitypractice. This discussion aims to highlight criteria for candidate selection and referral for VAD implantation.
