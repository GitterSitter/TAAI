Molecular remodeling, cytoskeletal disruption, and apoptosisactivation are associated with abnormal gene expression in the failingventricular myocardium of HF subjects and can normalize in response to medium-and long-term mechanical unloading in adults. However, there is little knowledge of the changes in gene expression after short-term mechanical support in childrenwith HF.METHODS: We evaluated left ventricular biopsies from 4 children with HF. Thechildren had implantation of a continuous- or a pulsatile-flow LVAD for 8 to 16days before undergoing heart transplantation. At the time of LVAD insertion andremoval, we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to study the expression of 326 genes encoding for structural, transcriptional, andsignaling pathways proteins, and immunoblot analysis on dystrophin and apoptotic factors.RESULTS: Short-term LVAD therapy significantly decreased brain natriureticpeptide (BNP) levels from pre-LVAD (3,584.5 +/- 378.3 pg/ml [95% CI]) topost-LVAD (447.5 +/- 52.7 pg/ml [95% CI]) in 2 patients in whom comparative BNPmeasurements were available. In addition, short-term LVAD therapy reduced HF and apoptosis markers, whereas it upregulated structural proteins, includingdystrophin, as well as pro-hypertrophic and pro-inotropic markers. Furthermore,LVAD therapy normalized expression of genes involved in calcium homeostasis, cellgrowth, and differentiation.CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that even short-term LVAD therapy inchildren with severe HF can reverse molecular remodeling. This favorable effectshould be taken into consideration in eligible children with significantventricular dysfunction.Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
