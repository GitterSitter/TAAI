However, outcomes depending on the preoperative level of stability can substantially differ, resulting in a limited analysis ofpotentialities and drawbacks of a given device. In the present study we sought tocompare in our single-center experience the survival results of thisthird-generation device with previous left ventricular systems taking intoaccount the different preoperative Interagency Registry for Mechanically AssistedCirculatory Support (INTERMACS) levels. Between February 1993 and March 2012, 287patients underwent assist device implantation in our university hospital(INTERMACS Level 1-2 = 158 patients; INTERMACS Level 3-4-5 = 129 patients).Assist devices implanted were: Group A (HVAD HeartWare, n = 52), group B(previous continuous-flow ventricular assist device [VAD], InCor [Berlin Heart,Berlin, Germany], n = 37; VentrAssist [VentraCor, Inc., Chatswood, NSW,Australia], n = 7; DeBakey [MicroMed Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX, USA],n = 32), and group C (pulsatile systems, n = 159). After cumulative supportduration of 54 436 days and a mean follow-up of 6.21 ± 7.46 months (range 0-45.21months), log-rank analysis revealed a survival for group A of 82.0%, 70.4%, and70.4%; for group B of 84.0%, 48.2%, 33.7%; and for group C of 71.6%, 46.1%,33.8%, at 1, 12, and 24 months respectively, with a significantly (P = 0.013)better outcome for group A. When stratifying the survival on the basis ofINTERMACS level, no significant survival improvement was observed among allpatients who underwent VAD implantation in INTERMACS 1-2 (P = 0.47). However,among patients who underwent elective VAD implantation (INTERMACS 3-4-5), group Ahad a significantly better outcome (P = 0.005) compared with the otherINTERMACS-matched groups (B,C) with a survival rate of 88.8% in group A versus34.2% in group B and 45.6% in group C at 24 months, respectively. Elective HVADsystem implantation shows improved survival benefit over the otherINTERMACS-matched devices. Moreover, preoperative unstable hemodynamics resulted in a poor prognosis independently from the pump generation.Copyright © 2013 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantationand Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
