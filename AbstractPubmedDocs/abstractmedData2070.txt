Int J Artif Organs. 1992 Feb;15(2):109-13.Clinical evaluation of right ventricular function in patients with leftventricular assist device (LVAD).Bennink GB(1), Noda H, Duncan JM, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Texas Heart Institute, Houston.Right ventricular function (RVF) during LVAD support can be a threat for patient survival. Despite extensive research, RVF and its interference with left heartfunction is unclear. This study examines RVF in a retrospective analysis of 14patients. Hemodynamic data were collected, including heart rate (HR), centralvenous pressure (CVP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), total cardiacoutput (CO), calculated stroke volume index (SVI) and right ventricular strokework index (RVSWI). In all patients, CO increased gradually throughout the study period; CVP showed no significant decrease; mPAP and PCWP decreased significantlyover the time period; SVI improved and RVSWI increased from the starting levelprior to implantation of the LVAD. We conclude that the CO improved with alowering of the right ventricular afterload combined with a decrease in totalcirculating volume. The improvement of RVF with LV assist makes this device anoption as a bridge to transplant.
