Due to shortage ofdonor organs in paediatric group, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is nowroutinely applied as bridging strategy to increase survival on the waiting listfor OTHx. We sought to assess the impact of MCS as intention to bridge to OHTx inpatients with CHD less than 16 years of age.METHODS: From 1998 to 2013, 106 patients received 113 episodes of MCS withparacorporeal devices as intention to bridge to OHTx. Twenty-nine had CHD, 15(52%) with two-ventricle (Group A) and 14 (48%) with single-ventricle physiology (Group B). In Group A, 5 children had venoarterial extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (VA ECMO), 6 left ventricular assist device (LVAD), 2 biventricularassist device (BIVAD), 1 VA ECMO followed by BIVAD and 1 BIVAD followed by VAECMO. In Group B, VA ECMO was used in 7 children, univentricular assist device(UVAD) changed to VA ECMO in 4, UVAD in 2 and surgical conversion totwo-ventricles physiology with BIVAD support changed to VA ECMO in 1.RESULTS: Twenty-one of 29 (72%) children survived to recovery/OHTx. Seven of 29(59%) survived to discharge. In Group A, 11/15 (73%) survived to recovery/OHTxand 9/15 (60%) survived to discharge. Four of 15 (27%) died awaiting OHTx. Onechild had graft failure requiring VA ECMO and was bridged successfully toretransplantation. One child dying after OHTx had acute rejection, was supported with VA ECMO and then BIVAD but did not recover. One patient had an unsuccessful second run on BIVAD 1 year after recovery from VA ECMO. In Group B, 10/14 (71%)survived to recovery/OHTx and 8/14 (57%) survived to discharge. Four of 14 (29%) died awaiting OHTx. Of deaths after OHTx, 1 occurred intraoperatively and 1 wasconsequent to graft failure and had an unsuccessful second run with VA ECMO.CONCLUSIONS: Children with CHD can be successfully bridged with MCS to hearttransplantation. Single-ventricle circulation compared with biventricularphysiology does not increase the risk of death before transplant or beforehospital discharge.© The Author 2014.
