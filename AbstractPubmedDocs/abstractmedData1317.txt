We hypothesized that anonpulsatile Jarvik 2000 LVAD (Jarvik Heart, Inc, New York, NY) would result incomparable outcomes to those of similarly ill patients implanted with a pulsatileLVAD (Novacor, WorldHeart Inc, Oakland, CA; and HeartMate XVE, Thoratec,Pleasanton, CA).METHODS: We retrospectively compared common pre-LVAD clinical characteristics andindicators of heart failure severity between 13 pulsatile and 14 nonpulsatileLVAD recipients. The outcomes analyzed were either heart transplantation, if the LVAD was intended as a bridge to transplantation, or hospital discharge if theintention was destination therapy.RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in pre-LVAD diseaseseverity indicators. Nonpulsatile LVAD recipients had a significantly smallerbody surface area (1.9 +/- 0.2 m2 versus 2.1 +/- 0.2 m2, p = 0.04) andcardiopulmonary bypass time was also significantly shorter (61 +/- 34 minutesversus 110 +/- 49 minutes, p = 0.01). Aside from duration of initial intensivecare unit stay (nonpulsatile, 10 +/- 16 days; pulsatile, 14 +/- 11 days; p =0.02), there was no difference in post-LVAD outcomes: 10 of 14 nonpulsatile and 8of 13 pulsatile LVAD patients achieved the combined end point (p = 0.69).CONCLUSIONS: Similarly ill congestive heart failure patients benefited equallywell from either a nonpulsatile or a pulsatile LVAD. This may support an expandedrole for nonpulsatile LVADs in the treatment of severe heart failure.
