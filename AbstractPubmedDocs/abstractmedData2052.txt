Intraaortic balloon pumps are technically feasible, but their efficacy has been questioned and their use has been limited in children.Over the last decade, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has become the mostcommonly used method of mechanical circulatory support in children who havesevere cardiac failure after cardiac operations. Additionally, a small number of infants and children have been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenationas a bridge to cardiac transplantation or as temporary support during reversible myocardial failure due to lesions such as viral myocarditis. More recently, asmall number of pediatric patients have been supported with centrifugal andpneumatic devices, particularly after cardiac operations. Surprisingly, many ofthese patients did well with left ventricular support only. The overallchildren's survival rates in the myocardial recovery group are better than those in adults. However, current pediatric devices do not provide support for greater than a few weeks, making bridging to transplantation less feasible than inadults.
