All patients sufferedfrom acute low-output syndrome refractory to inotropic support. Diagnosis wasconfirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR (reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction) from endomyocardial biopsy specimensrevealed parvovirus B19 in two patients and a coinfection with Chlamydiapneumoniae and parvovirus B19 in one patient. Midterm support with thebiventricular Thoratec system was preceded by implantation of an extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) device in two patients. Two patients regained fullcardiac function and were successfully weaned from the ventricular assist device (VAD) after 12 and 40 days. Heart transplantation was performed in anotherpatient without evidence of myocardial recovery after 53 days. One patient diedof cerebral hemorrhage on day 12 after VAD implantation. In summary, patientswith life-threatening fulminant myocarditis can be successfully bridged torecovery or transplantation with mechanical circulatory support.
