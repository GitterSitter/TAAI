Thisregulatory process requires a judicious balance between assuring safety andefficacy, while providing efficient review to facilitate access to innovativetherapies. Recent contrasting views of the regulatory process have emphasized thedifficulties in obtaining an optimal balance. Mechanical circulatory support has evolved to become an important therapy for patients who have advanced heartfailure with the advent of more durable, implantable ventricular assist devices. The regulatory oversight of these new technologies has been difficult owing tothe complexities of these devices, associated adverse event profile, and severityof illness of the intended patient population. Maintaining a regulatoryenvironment to foster efficient introduction of safe and effective technologiesis critical to the success of ventricular assist device therapy and the health ofpatients with advanced heart failure. Physicians representing key surgical andcardiology societies, and representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, Centers for Medicare and MedicaidServices, Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, and industry partners gathered to discuss relevant issues regarding the currentregulatory environment assessing ventricular assist devices. The goal of themeeting was to explore innovative ways to foster the introduction oftechnologically advanced, safe, and effective ventricular assist devices.
