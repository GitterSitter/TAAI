ASAIO J. 1995 Jul-Sep;41(3):M535-9.Hospital charges for conventional therapy versus left ventricular assist systemtherapy in heart transplant patients.Cloy MJ(1), Myers TJ, Stutts LA, Macris MP, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Cullen Cardiovascular Research Laboratories, Department of CardiovascularSurgical Research, Texas Heart Institute, Houston 77030, USA.An important goal of a left ventricular assist system (LVAS) is to providelong-term, safe, cost-effective mechanical circulatory support. The HeartmateLVAS (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA), used in recent clinical trials as a bridge to transplantation, has proven extremely reliable for long periods, and its use has improved the survival rates in patients who subsequently received adonor heart. Patients who have been implanted with an LVAS often havesignificantly improved physical status and can leave the intensive care unit(ICU) and be treated at less expense elsewhere in the hospital. In thispreliminary report, the authors analyzed hospital charges for three groups ofpatients: heart transplant patients who received conventional medical therapybefore transplantation (Group 1), transplant patients who received in-hospitalLVAS therapy (Group 2), and one patient who awaited transplantation at home whileundergoing LVAS support. Group 1 patients (n = 6) received intraaortic balloonpump (IABP) support and inotropic therapy in an ICU before transplantation. Group2 (n = 6) patients were receiving IABP support and inotropic therapy when theLVAS was implanted and eventually underwent heart transplantation. The length of hospital stay in Group 1 (51 days) was significantly shorter than in Group 2 (185days). Mean hospital charge in Group 1 was $5,150/day; in Group 2, $3,178/day.The patient living at home incurred an average medical expense of $27/day.Although LVAS supported patients remain in the hospital much longer than domedically treated patients, their average daily in-hospital charges are muchless. If the LVAS could be used as an alternative to transplantation, it mightoffer not only a longer, better quality life, but also a potential cost savingsto patients with end-stage heart failure.
