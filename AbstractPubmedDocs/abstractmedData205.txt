There are few currentpediatric data assessing the impact of VAD support on post-transplant survival.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric (≤18 years old, n =4,028) transplants performed between 1995 and 2011 and contained within theUnited Network for Organ Sharing data set. Transplants were divided into threeeras: early (1995 to 2002, n = 1,450); intermediate (2003 to 2007, n = 1,138);and recent (2008 to 2011, n = 1,440). VADs were present at transplant in 398patients (9.8%). Outcomes among patients with and without VADs were assessed and compared across eras.RESULTS: The use of VADs for bridge to transplant has increased (early 1.1%,intermediate 10.5%, recent 17.9%; p < 0.0001). Mean weight among VAD-supportedpatients (early 63.5 kg, intermediate 42.3 kg, recent 28.8 kg; p < 0.0001) hasdecreased during this period. VAD patients <10 kg had an increased risk of stroke(odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1 to 10.8) compared withnon-mechanical support patients. In multivariable analyses, extracorporeal VADswere the only type of VAD associated with higher post-transplant mortality (OR = 3.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 10.6). Other types of VAD had lower mortality (OR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.2 to 1.0). Long-term survival was unaffected by the use of a VADpre-transplant.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients bridged to transplantation with VADs areincreasingly younger and smaller. Complication rates remain high among patients<10 kg. Early post-transplant survival among intracorporeal and paracorporeal VADpatients is excellent and better when compared with unsupported patients. The useof short-term support devices is associated with higher post-transplantmortality. Long-term survival is unaffected by VAD use.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
