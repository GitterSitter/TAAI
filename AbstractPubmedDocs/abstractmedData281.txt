Electronic address:DJHamilton@houstonmethodist.org.In heart failure mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be responsible forenergy depletion and contractile dysfunction. The difficulties in procuring freshleft ventricular (LV) myocardium from humans for assessment of mitochondrialfunction have resulted in the reliance on surrogate markers of mitochondrialfunction and limited our understanding of cardiac energetics. We isolatedmitochondria from fresh LV wall tissue of patients with heart failure and reducedsystolic function undergoing heart transplant or left ventricular assist deviceplacement, and compared their function to mitochondria isolated from thenon-failing LV (NFLV) wall tissue with normal systolic function from patientswith pulmonary hypertension undergoing heart-lung transplant. We performeddetailed mitochondrial functional analyses using 4 substrates: glutamate-malate(GM), pyruvate-malate (PM) palmitoyl carnitine-malate (PC) and succinate. NFLVmitochondria showed preserved respiratory control ratios and electron chainintegrity with only few differences for the 4 substrates. In contrast, HFmitochondria had greater respiration with GM, PM and PC substrates and higherelectron chain capacity for PM than for PC. Surprisingly, HF mitochondria hadgreater respiratory control ratios and lower ADP-independent state 4 rates thanNFLV mitochondria for GM, PM and PC substrates demonstrating that HF mitochondriaare capable of coupled respiration ex vivo. Gene expression studies revealeddecreased expression of key genes in pathways for oxidation of both fatty acidsand glucose. Our results suggest that mitochondria from the failing LV myocardiumare capable of tightly coupled respiration when isolated and supplied with ample substrates. Thus energy starvation in the failing heart may be the result ofdysregulation of metabolic pathways, impaired substrate supply or reducedmitochondrial number but not the result of reduced mitochondrial electrontransport capacity.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
