The gold-standard therapy in end-stage heartfailure remains cardiac transplantation at the present time, but there is a greatexcess of eligible candidates compared with the number of donor organs. Advances in mechanical support, the development of the left ventricular assist device(LVAD), and the total artificial heart has reduced mortality and morbidity inpatients awaiting transplantation, and LVADs are now approved as an strategy for destination therapy. Miniaturization, increased device durability, and completeimplantability may render LVADs an option in earlier stages of heart failure, as a bridge to myocardial recovery or even as a viable alternative totransplantation. Alternative strategies under investigation are cell therapy and xenotransplantation. In the present article, current and potential futuretherapeutic options in end-stage heart failure are reviewed.
