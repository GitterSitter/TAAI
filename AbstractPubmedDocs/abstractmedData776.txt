They may be in need of a heart transplant, but because of the limitedamount of donor hearts available, other options need to be available. Because of the advancement of technology, there are now other options, and one optionavailable would be a mechanical circulatory and cardiac support device.Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been developed over the past 30 years.From larger, earlier pulsatile devices to smaller, hand-held, newer axial flow orrotary pump devices, VADs are implanted cardiac assist devices. They areimplanted to provide cardiac support and can be used temporarily as a bridge totransplant (for those awaiting a heart transplant) or implanted permanently,which is known as destination therapy. With the changes in the size of device,decrease in the size of drive line, increased length of battery life, as well as length of device life, thousands of people now have these implanted VAD devicesand are living quality lives and functioning at high levels. Currently, there are3 generations of the left ventricular assist devices being used throughout theworld. Five of the most well-known type of left ventricular assist devices arediscussed in this article.
