Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) is asignificant adverse event in these patients and treatment typically requiresreduction or elimination of AC or anti-platelet therapy. It is not known whether alterations in AC to treat GI bleeding influence subsequent risk ofthromboembolic (TE) events during LVAD support.METHODS: Between July 2003 and September 2011, 389 patients (308 male) underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD at the University of Michigan HealthSystem and the Mayo Clinic. Median age at implant was 60 years (range 18 to 79years). Outcomes were analyzed for the association of GI bleeding events andsubsequent TE events, defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, hemolysis or suspected or confirmed pump thrombosis.RESULTS: Median survival was 10 months (maximum 7.2 years, total 439patient-years). TE events occurring within the first 30 days were not counted.Overall survival and freedom from an outcome event were assessed using theKaplan-Meier method. Associations between GI bleeding and subsequent TE eventsand survival impact were analyzed as time-dependent covariates. One hundredninety-nine GI bleeding episodes occurred in 116 of 389 patients (30%) for anevent rate of 0.45 GI bleed/patient-year of support. One hundred thirty-eight TE events occurred in 97 of 389 patients (25%) for an event rate of 0.31 TEevent/patient-year of support. Median time from LVAD implant to first GI bleedwas 5 months (range 1 to 116 months) and to first TE event was 6 months (range 1 to 29 months). For patients who had a TE event after GI bleed, the medianinterval was 5 months (range 0.5 to 25 months). TE events were 7.4-fold morelikely in patients who had a prior GI bleed (range 4.9- to 11.1-fold) (p <0.001); however, neither the presence of GI bleeding (0.7 to 1.2) nor a TE event (0.8 to 2.0) portended a lower overall survival.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had GI bleeding were at significantly higher risk for asubsequent TE event. Although the exact cause of this relationship is unknown, itsuggests that a reduction in anti-coagulation and anti-platelet management totreat GI bleeds may contribute to this risk.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
