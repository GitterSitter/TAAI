Hepatic as well as nonhepatic iron overload is associated with increased infectious and postoperative complications, including cardiacdysfunction. In this case report, we describe a cirrhotic patient with alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency and nonhereditary hemochromatosis (non-HFE) that developedcardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support for twenty days after liver transplant. Upon further investigation, she was found to have significantiron deposition in both the liver and heart biopsies. Her heart regained completeand sustained recovery following ten days of mechanical biventricular support.This case highlights the importance of preoperatively recognizing extrahepaticiron deposition in patients referred for liver transplantation irrespective ofetiology of liver disease as this may prevent postoperative complications.PMCID: PMC4241562
