The purpose of thisinvestigation was to characterize the response of the failing myocardium tocontinuous flow support.METHODS: We compared echocardiographic and cellular markers of failing myocardiumat the time of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation andexplantation in 20 consecutive patients (12 pulsatile flow [Novacor] and 8continuous flow [DeBakey-Noon]).RESULTS: The use of mechanical support with both continuous- or pulsatile-typeLVADs resulted in a reduction of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension(LVEDD), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV) and left atrialvolume (LAV), as well as a decrease in mitral E/A ratio, tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) and pulmonary valve acceleration time (PVAT). Comparative analysesfor patients treated with a continuous- vs pulsatile-type LVAD support showed agreater degree of unloading with the latter type, as shown by the effect on LVEDD(-13.7% vs -33.7%, p = 0.0.004), EDV (-23.5% vs -41.2%, p = 0.015), ESV (-25.6%vs -57.6%, p = 0.001) and LAV (-25.2% vs -40.4%, p = 0.071). The hemodynamiceffects of continuous vs pulsatile LVAD support were similar, as shown by theireffect on mitral E/A ratio (-23.9% vs -39.9%, p = NS), TRV (-26.4% vs -23.8%, p =NS) and PVAT (28.5% vs 38.5%, p = NS). Only pulsatile support demonstrated astatistically significant percent change in mass (-6.3% vs -20.6%, p = 0.038).Continuous and pulsatile forms of mechanical support demonstrated equivalentreductions in myocardial tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), total collagen and mycocyte size.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that, although there are differences between these2 devices in magnitude of unloading, both forms of support effectively normalize cellular markers of the failing phenotype.
