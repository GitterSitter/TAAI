In this paper, we present our single-center report of adult patients in whom bridging was used with VAD.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 14 adult patients who underwentheart transplantation after insertion of a long-term VAD. The study spans fromFebruary 2006 until September 2010. The mean patient age was 44.28 ± 11.06 years.We used the Berlin Heart EXCOR VADs (n = 11; Berlin Heart AG Berlin, Germany), orthe Berlin Heart Incor (n = 2), or the Abiomed AB500 (n = 1). Preimplantationstatus of the subjects were critical cardiogenic shock (n = 6), deterioration on inotropes (n = 3), or stable but inotrope-dependent (n = 5).RESULTS: Mean VAD support time was 153.71 days (range, 25-517). Major adverseevents during VAD support included reexploration for bleeding (n = 3; 21.4%),neurologic events (n = 2; 14.3%), left VAD-related infection (n = 2; 14.3%),pneumonia (n = 1; 14.3%), or primary device failure (n = 1; 7.1%). One (7.1%)patient showed evidence of human leukocyte antigen sensitization. There were 2deaths (14.3%) over a mean of 324 days follow-up after heart transplantation: Onedue to biventricular failure in the early postoperative period and the other, at 69 days from pneumonia. Rejection was observed in 2 patients who hadInternational Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 2R withouthemodynamic deterioration. In our series, the 1-year mortality was 14.4% amongheart transplantations without VAD implantation and 14.2% among thebridge-to-transplantation group.CONCLUSION: We conclude that VAD implantation improved end-organ function before heart transplantation in critically ill patients.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
