The mean age,cardiac index (CI), and ejection fraction (EF) of our population were 42 years,1.83 L/min/m(2), and 20%, respectively. Two patients (group A) with ischemicdilated cardiomyopathy were bridged to heart transplant. Two patients (group B)with fulminan myocarditis and septic shock were bridged to recovery. One patient,with severe valvular cardiomyopathy who underwent aortic valve replacement andmitral valve annuloplasty, was supported to weaning from ECC.RESULTS: Mean support time was 9.8 +/- 2.3 days. Only one acute myocarditispatient died from a severe vasoplegic syndrome despite maximal inotropic andvasoactive support. Both group A patients were successfully transplanted. Amonggroup B, the second patient resolved the septic status and was slowly weaned fromthe device and discharged home with moderate improvement of LV function (EF =40%). Patient C was weaned from the IR100 and electively placed on the hearttransplant recipient list.CONCLUSIONS: IR100 is a device that in our experience can be utilized for variousindications for short-term support. In compromised patients where a traditionalLVAD is contraindicated, the IR100 showed good results, for it is minimallyinvasive and does not need ECC or systemic anticoagulation.
