In this report, we have presented our institution's clinicalexperience in the anesthetic management of ventricular assist device (VAD)implantation.METHODS: Between April 2007 and August 2012, VAD implantation was performed in 84adult patients with end-stage heart failure. The group included 75 male and 9female patients of overall mean age, 47.6 ± 13.4 years. Our retrospective review analyzed elements of perioperative anesthetic care, including preoperativecharacteristics, general anesthetic care, and blood product usage.RESULTS: The indications for VAD implantation were dilated (n = 59; 70%) orischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 25; 30%). An intra-aortic balloon pump had beenplaced in 16 patients. We monitored invasive arterial and central venouspressures as well as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Etomidatewas used as the induction agent in 79 of 84 patients (average dose, 18.75 ± 1.40 mg). Intraoperative fentanyl dose was 939.69 ± 212.44 μg. Anesthesia wasmaintained with sevoflurane (n = 55) or desflurane (n = 29). Dopamine,dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and levosimendan were used in 74, 79,60, 14, and 32 patients, respectively. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered to38 subjects (45%). The amounts of perioperative blood, fresh frozen plasma, andthrombocyte suspension transfusions were 3.96 ± 2.78, 1.91 ± 1.21, 1.80 ± 2.48 u,respectively. On average, patients were extubated 13 hours after arrival in theintensive care unit and discharged therefrom on day 8. Thirty-one patients weresuccessfully bridged to heart transplantation. While 27 patients (32%) diedduring the follow-up period, 26 are still living on VAD support.CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing VAD implantation, the anesthesiologistshould become familiar with the device and consider the severity of cardiac andother end-organ dysfunction.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
