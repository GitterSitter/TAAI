Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2003 May;23(5):748-54; discussion 754-5.The Jarvik 2000 is associated with less infections than the HeartMate leftventricular assist device.Siegenthaler MP(1), Martin J, Pernice K, Doenst T, Sorg S, Trummer G,Friesewinkel O, Beyersdorf F.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg,Germany. siegenth@ch11.ukl.uni-freiburg.deOBJECTIVES: Device-related infections remain a considerable problem ofleft-ventricular support. We compared the device-related-infections between theHeartMate left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and the Jarvik 2000 permanentLVAD, a device with a novel retroauricular power-supply.METHODS: Between December 2000 and September 2002 we implanted theHeartMate-vented, electrical-system in 11 patients and the permanent Jarvik 2000 in six patients. Total support time was 1626 patient-days (HeartMate, 26-271days) versus 1246 patient-days (Jarvik 2000, 8-411 days). As potential riskfactors for infection we analyzed age, preoperative hospital-days, total protein,cardiac index, maximal oxygen uptake, use of inotropes, LVAD risk-score-index andAaronson-Mancini-score, intubation time, and intensive care unit stay. We usedthe Center of Disease Control definitions for surgical site infections.RESULTS: HeartMate-patients were younger than Jarvik 2000 patients (46+/-13versus 58+/-6 years, P=0.056), there were no other differences in the riskfactors. Four HeartMate-patients needed late (>or=48 h) surgical revisions forbleeding/hematomas versus no revisions in the Jarvik 2000 patients. In theHeartMate-patients, there were seven (64%) driveline-infections, five (45%)device-pocket infections, and three (27%) bloodstream-infections, or 0.43device-related infections/100 patient-days. Infections occurred early (34+/-31days). Three patients required urgent transplantation due to bloodstreaminfection. There were no adverse outcomes in the HeartMate-group due toinfection. In the Jarvik 2000 patients, there was one driveline-infection (16%)after 270 days of support (0.08 device-related infections/100 patient-days),significantly less than in the HeartMate-group (P=0.044). Driveline infectionsresolved with antibiotics and local wound care in the Jarvik 2000 patient, butonly in one of seven HeartMate-patients.CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the Jarvik 2000 is associated with lessdevice-related infections than the HeartMate-LVAD. The power-supply of thepermanent Jarvik 2000 is suitable for long-term mechanical support.
