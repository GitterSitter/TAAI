J Heart Transplant. 1986 May-Jun;5(3):210-4.Use of the total artificial heart as an interim device: initial experience inPittsburgh with four patients.Griffith BP, Kormos RL, Wei LM, Borovetz HS, Trento A, Hardesty RL.The experimental use of the total artificial heart as an interim device beforeheart transplantation has demonstrated its potential usefulness. Once again therehas been a reaffirmation of the basic principle in transplantation that carefulselection of patients is a prerequisite for a high likelihood of success. Ourexperience suggests that advanced degrees of renal failure and liver dysfunction are not likely to be associated with a consistently useful interim support.Although our numbers of patients are quite small, we continue to be concerned by what appears to be the tendency for the development of severe thrombocytopenianot resulting from the use of heparin. Studies of platelet kinetics anddeposition are planned for the future. Although no recipient has had directevidence of thromboembolic events, systemic anticoagulation with heparin has beenaggressively applied, and bleeding complications have been common. All Jarvik-7hearts on which autopsies have been performed have demonstrated grossly evidentplatelet fibrin thrombi, especially around the inlet and outlet valve housings.It has not been our purpose to investigate the relative role for univentricularor biventricular assist. It is likely that a number of our patients might havebenefited from left ventricular assistance alone. It would appear that additionalpatients are needed before strong conclusions can be formed regarding thepotential benefits and risks of the current Jarvik-7 device or any totalartificial heart as an interim method of support before hearttransplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
