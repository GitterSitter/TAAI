This study reviews theresults of the US trial with specific attention to hemolysis, thromboticcomplications, and pump failure.METHODS: The US SUSTAIN trial was a multicenter, prospective, single-armobservational study in advanced heart failure patients listed fortransplantation. Follow-up was complete in 100% of the patients at 6 months.RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were enrolled at 23 centers. Forty-six patients(73%) reached the primary end points of survival to transplantation, alive on theoriginal device at 180 days and listed for transplantation, or explant forrecovery. Median duration of support was 267 days (range, 10 to 952 days) with a total support time of 46 patient-years. There was no clinical hemolysis reported during the study. Mean lactate dehydrogenase values peaked at day 4 andsignificantly decreased during support (435±236 U/L and 297±142 U/L on day 3 and day 180, respectively). There were no cases of pump thrombosis reported, and 3cases of pump thrombus "in transit" (0.06 events/patient-year) were observed.There were 6 (10%) cases of magnetic levitation system failure, all secondary to cable wire fractures (0.12 events/patient-year). All patients werehemodynamically stable with the backup hydrodynamic mode. Major adverse eventsincluded gastrointestinal bleeding (0.52 events/patient-year), ischemic andhemorrhagic strokes (0.17 events/patient-year and 0.09 events/patient-year,respectively), and driveline infections (0.67 events/patient-year).CONCLUSIONS: The DuraHeart demonstrated good hemocompatibility; however, thereliability of full magnetic levitation systems should be a high priority infuture pump designs.Copyright © 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
