Mechanical circulatory support by ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts have the potential to provide an alternative to hearttransplantation if a small, durable, biocompatible, and totally implantablesystem is available. In this article, current technologies for mechanicalcirculatory support by implantable devices are reviewed and the current statusand future prospects of the CorAide and MagScrew technologies, which have beendeveloped and tested at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, are presented.
