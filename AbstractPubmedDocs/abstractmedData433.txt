Prognosis in this patient group is poorand implantable ventricular assist devices have had limited success due to organ failure associated with the high dose immunosuppression required to treat ongoingrejection. We present a case from our institution and the world-wide experienceutilizing the SynCardia CardioWest Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t; SynCardiaSystems, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) for replacement of the failing graft, recovery ofpatient and end-organ failure with ultimate bridge to retransplantation. Wepresent our experience and review of world-wide experience for use of TAH-t inthis type patient.Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
