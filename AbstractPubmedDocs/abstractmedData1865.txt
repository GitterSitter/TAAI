A recent single-center investigation described decreasing survival benefit from transplantfor patients who survived an initial 6 months on the outpatient waiting list.METHODS: Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed for 80 patients from theHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) listed from July 1986 to January1991, and 132 patients from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) listedfrom September 1993 to September 1995. Survival from the time of outpatientlisting for the entire group (ALL) was compared to subsequent survival from 6months onward for those patients who survived the initial 6 months afterplacement on the outpatient list (6M). Both urgent transplant and leftventricular assist device implantation were considered equivalent to death;elective transplant was censored. RESULTS Survival for 6M was not significantlybetter than ALL at HUP (subsequent 12 months: 60+/-7 vs. 60+/-6% [mean+/-SD]; p =0.89) nor at CPMC (subsequent 12 months: 60+/-6 vs. 48+/-5%; p = 0.35). Survival for 6M at both centers was substantially lower than survival following transplantfrom the outpatient list in the United States in 1995.CONCLUSIONS: When high-risk patients are selected for nonurgent transplantlisting, mortality remains high, even among those who survive the initial sixmonths after listing. Time accrued on the waiting list remains an appropriatecriterion for donor allocation.
