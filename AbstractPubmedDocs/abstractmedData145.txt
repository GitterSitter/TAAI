We analyzed the midtermoutcome of patients implanted with these implantable LVADs at the University ofTokyo Hospital.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 31 patients who underwent implantation of LVADs(10 DuraHeart, 21 EVAHEART) as a bridge to transplantation at our institutionbetween April 2011 and August 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. All patientswere followed up through December 2013. Seven patients underwent conversions fromNIPRO paracorporeal LVAD (Nipro, Osaka, Japan) to an implantable LVAD. The meanobservation period was 483±239 days (41.0 patient years). Eight patients weretransplanted and one patient showed functional recovery with subsequent LVADexplantation. Four patients died due to cerebrovascular accident, empyema, ordevice malfunction due to pump thrombosis after cerebral bleeding. Kaplan-Meieranalysis revealed 6-, 12-, and 24-month survival rates of 93%, 86%, and 86%,respectively. The rates of freedom from cerebrovascular accidents anddevice-related infections at 1 year after LVAD implantation were 65% and 36%,respectively. Twenty-nine patients were discharged home after LVAD implantation. During the period of this study, there were 59 readmissions (53 urgent, 6elective) among 22 patients (76%). The overall and urgent readmission rates were 1.66 and 1.49 per patient year, respectively. The common reason for readmissionwas device-related infection (31%), followed by cerebrovascular accidents (17%). The total out-of-hospital time after the primary discharge was 90%.CONCLUSIONS: Our midterm survival rate after LVAD implantation is satisfactory.However, patients undergoing LVAD support were often readmitted with adverseevents.Copyright © 2014 Japanese College of Cardiology.
