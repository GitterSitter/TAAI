These devices provide either pulsatile orcontinuous blood flow. To determine eventual physiological effects of thesedifferent types of flow on the aorta,a computational fluid dynamics model of the aorta and its thoracic branches was implemented. Pulsatile and continuous flowfields were calculated by implementing a comprehensive computational frameworkwith a stabilized finite element method. The computed results revealed that thepulsatile pump support results in a lower mean shear stress and higheroscillatory shear stress index than the continuous pump support. The flowpatterns for the pulsatile pump support above the closed aortic valves show asimilar washout as for the continuous pump support. In summary, from the flowpattern simulation there was no particular preference for either pulsatile orcontinuous devices
