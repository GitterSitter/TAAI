All patients hadsymptoms of New York Heart Association class IV heart failure.RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a reduction of 48 percent in therisk of death from any cause in the group that received left ventricular assistdevices as compared with the medical-therapy group (relative risk, 0.52; 95percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.78; P=0.001). The rates of survival at oneyear were 52 percent in the device group and 25 percent in the medical-therapygroup (P=0.002), and the rates at two years were 23 percent and 8 percent(P=0.09), respectively. The frequency of serious adverse events in the devicegroup was 2.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.86 to 2.95) times that in themedical-therapy group, with a predominance of infection, bleeding, andmalfunction of the device. The quality of life was significantly improved at one year in the device group.CONCLUSIONS: The use of a left ventricular assist device in patients withadvanced heart failure resulted in a clinically meaningful survival benefit andan improved quality of life. A left ventricular assist device is an acceptablealternative therapy in selected patients who are not candidates for cardiactransplantation.
