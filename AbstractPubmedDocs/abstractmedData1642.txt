Our purpose is to summarize 3 cases of acute giant-cellmyocarditis that illustrate possible outcomes with mechanical support. Wereviewed the cases of 3 patients, aged 39 to 59 years, who had giant-cellmyocarditis (confirmed by myocardial biopsy). The indication for ventricularassist was circulatory failure despite maximal medical treatment with 2 or moreinotropic agents and intraaortic balloon pump support. Immunosuppression and abiventricular mechanical assist (BVS 5000) were used to treat all these patients.The mean duration of mechanical support was 15.7 days (range, 10 to 19 days). Onepatient had recovery of myocardial function and was weaned from mechanicalsupport. This case is, to our knowledge, the first reported of ventricularsupport leading to cardiac recovery after diagnosis of giant-cell myocarditis.The 2nd patient was not a candidate for further surgery and died of multisystemorgan failure. The 3rd patient underwent orthotopic heart transplantation after18 days of support and was discharged. We conclude that patients with giant-cell myocarditis tend to have biventricular involvement and can recover myocardialfunction on mechanical support and immunosuppression. If recovery is notobserved, transplantation is warranted. By avoiding left ventricular cannulation,the BVS 5000 is well suited for bridging to recovery, transplantation, orlong-term support.PMCID: PMC152837
