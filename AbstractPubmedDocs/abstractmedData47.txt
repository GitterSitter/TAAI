Wesought to characterize neurological events in children supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR(®) device.METHODS AND RESULTS: The multicenter prospective cohort consisted of all 204children implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR(®) device at 47 centers in NorthAmerica between May 2007 and December 2010. There were 73 neurological events in 59 patients, with 29% of the cohort experiencing ≥1 neurological event. Eventsincluded 52 strokes in 43 patients (21% of the cohort). The neurological eventrate was 0.51 events per 100 patient-days. Many of the neurological eventsoccurred early in the course of support, with 30 events recorded during the first14 days of support. The mortality rate in participants with at least 1neurological event was 42% (25 of 59), significantly higher than the 18%mortality rate (26 of 145) for those who did not have a neurological event(P=0.0006). Risk-factor analysis did not identify significant preimplantationpredictors of neurological injury.CONCLUSIONS: Of children treated with the Berlin Heart EXCOR(®) device as abridge to transplant, 29% experienced at least 1 neurological event. The majorityof neurological events were ischemic strokes, and many of those occurred early inthe course of support. Neurological injury was the leading cause of death afterimplantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR(®) device. Risk stratification for stroke or neurological injury is not possible based on baseline preimplantationcharacteristics.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.
