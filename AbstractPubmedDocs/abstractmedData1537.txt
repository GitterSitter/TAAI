APV is the power density valuesof pressure signals. High frequency (0.15 to 0.4 Hz) and low frequency (0.04 to0.15 Hz) components of APV are regarded as a function of the autonomic nervoussystem.METHODS: Arterial pressure signals were acquired every 2 hours at 100 Hz for 6minutes. Power spectral analysis was carried out, and APV was observed in 18patients with IABP and/or PCPS. APV was also observed in 3 patients with LVADs(Xemex, Zeon Medical, Japan) before their discharge from ICU for transfer toanother hospital for cardiac transplantation.RESULTS: Although the value gradually increased in 18 patients with IABP and/orPCPS, sustained low values of LFAnorm of APV in 6 patients were related toprolonged mechanical support, and 4 patients among them died consequently. Thenormalized power spectral component with low frequency (LFAnorm) was maintainedat relatively high values in 3 patients with LVADs.CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that power spectral analysis of systemicarterial pressure offers a reasonable means for the evaluation of the severity ofpatient cardiovascular condition and for the prediction of clinical outcome. Italso suggested that LVAD support exerts a favorable effect on ANS in patientswith severe heart failure before cardiac transplantation.
