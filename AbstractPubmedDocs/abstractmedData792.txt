This studyexamined the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-tissue inhibitors ofmetalloproteinases (TIMP) axis in the process of recovery after unloading in arat ischemic-induce heart failure (HF) model. Myocardial infarction model wascreated with the coronary artery ligation. The infarcted rats hearts wereunloaded by heterotopic cardiac transplantation (n=14). 2 weeks later, thefunction of normal and infarcted hearts with or without loading was evaluated by Langendorff perfusion model. The hearts were then harvested and prepared for the study of expression of MMPs and TIMPs. Developed pressure in the unloading group was higher than the loading group (P=0.0074). Unloading increased the ratio ofTIMP-1-MMP-1(1.38±0.11 vs. 0.76±0.09, P<0.05), TIMP-2-MMP-2 (1.06±0.10 vs.0.33±0.07, P<0.01), TIMP-3-MMP-9(1.07±0.08 vs. 0.59±0.06, P<0.05). AlthoughMMP-1, 2, 9 were downregulated (P<0.01, 0.01, 0.05, respectively), TIMP-2 andTIMP-3 upregulated (P<0.01, 0.05, respectively), MMP-7 and TIMP-1 was notaffected significantly. The infarcted cardiac function could be improved byunloading. It was attributed to downregulation of MMP-1, 2 and 9, andupregulation of TIMP-2 and -3, and furthermore, the ratio of TIMPs to MMPs wasincreased, which might be more sensitive than sole MMPs or TIMPs for the judgmentof myocardial matrix homeostasis.
