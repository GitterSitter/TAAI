The VAD system consists of a prosthetic ventricle with a 65-mL pumping chamber made from Thoratec'sBPS-215M polyurethane, cannulas for atrial or ventricular inflow and arterialoutflow connections, and a pneumatic drive console. The devices can be used forpartial or complete support of the pulmonary, systemic, or both circulations. In all patients (average age, 42 years; range, 11 to 64 years), the pumps wereplaced in a paracorporeal position on the anterior abdominal wall and connectedto the heart and great vessels by cannulas crossing the chest wall. Biventricularsupport was used in 120 patients (78%) and isolated left VADs were used in 34.Average flow rate was 5.0 +/- 0.9 L/min for the left VAD and 4.3 +/- 0.8 L/minfor the right VAD. The most frequent complications were bleeding (42% incidence, 7% mortality) and infection (36% incidence, 8% mortality). Ninety-eight patients (65%) recovered sufficiently to undergo heart transplantation after 8 hours to226 days of support (average, 17.5 days), and 3 are waiting on VADs fortransplantation. Eighty-two patients who received transplants have beendischarged. This is an 84% early post-transplantation survival and a 54% overall survival. The actuarial survival 1 year after transplantation is 82%, comparable with that of conventional heart transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
