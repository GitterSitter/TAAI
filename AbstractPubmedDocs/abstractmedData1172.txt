The period after LVAD support is associated with ventriculararrhythmias (VAs) despite ventricular unloading and such VAs can have adetrimental effect on survival. Despite the increasing use of LVAD, little isknown regarding post-LVAD VAs at the molecular level and in vivo.METHODS: Forty-two patients who received LVAD over a 24-month period wereevaluated and grouped on the basis of the presence or absence of VAs during LVAD support. We completed a comparative microarray analyses between six patients who developed ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) afterLVAD support and six patients who did not develop VAs after LVAD.RESULTS: VAs occurred in 15 patients (35.7%) during LVAD support at a medianpost-LVAD day of 25.2. VAs were strongly associated with nonusage of abeta-blocker post-LVAD (odds ratio of 7.04, P-value = 0.001). Analysis of asubset of patients who had VT or VF after LVAD placement showed a decrease in theexpression of connexin 43 (0.48 +/- 0.07), Na+/K+-ATPase (0.60 +/- 0.05), andvoltage-gated K+ channel Kv4.3 (0.42 +/- 0.04), and an increase in Na+/Ca2+exchanger (2.2 +/- 0.4) and the structural genes: Titin (2.1 +/- 0.2), laminin(1.7 +/- 0.4), calsequestrin (1.8 +/- 0.5), skeletal muscle isoform of troponin T(5.1 +/- 0.9), and skeletal muscle isoform of troponin I (3.9 +/- 0.7).CONCLUSION: After LVAD, the increased risk of VAs is strongly associated withnonusage of beta-blocker postoperatively.PMCID: PMC2752870
