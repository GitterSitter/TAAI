Epub 2009 Dec25.Ventricular assist device infection necessitating device exchange followingextensive myocardial resection.Adachi I(1), Matsumiya G, Sakaguchi T, Kuratani T, Miyagawa S, Yamauchi T, Saito S, Sawa Y.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Osaka UniversityGraduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, Japan.A 14-year-old boy undergoing long-term mechanical circulatory support with a leftventricular assist device (LVAD) developed myocardial abscess resulting fromcannula exit-site infection. This critically ill patient was successfully treatedwith LVAD replacement and omentopexy following extensive myocardial debridement. Although the use of artificial materials in the face of active infection is notideal, other options including LVAD explantation or urgent heart transplantation are not always feasible depending on the patient's cardiac function and theavailability of a donor heart. Under such circumstances, LVAD replacement mightbe the only measure available that could save patients who otherwise would notsurvive.
