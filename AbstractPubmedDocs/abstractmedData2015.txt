Artif Organs. 1994 Jul;18(7):490-3.Experience with the Berlin Heart Assist Device.Goullon A(1), Ries D.Author information: (1)Fehling Medical AG, Plant Berlin, Germany.Different mechanical circulatory support systems (MCSS) have been in clinical usesince 1987 to keep patients alive by assisting the heart during cardiac recovery after open heart surgery, myocardial infarction, acute graft failure after heart transplantation, or as a bridge to transplantation in heart transplantcandidates. Four different hospitals in Germany used the Berlin Heart AssistDevice. Up until 1993, there were 22 patients in the "recovery" group; 4 patientswere weaned from the system, and only 1 patient was discharged from the hospital.In 112 patients the Berlin Heart Assist Device was implanted for the purpose of abridge to transplantation, 68 were transplanted and 46 patients left thehospital. It was concluded that patients may be kept alive with this system forweeks and months after any kind of cardiogenic shock. Complete cardiac recoverymay be achieved in patients with early posttransplant graft failure. Reliableprediction of outcome in bridge-to-transplantation patients requires furtherexperience and improvement of system components.
