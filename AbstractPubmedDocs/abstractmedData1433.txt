Five patients who underwent coronaryartery bypass grafting and required LVAD implantation for post-cardiotomycardiogenic shock had coronary angiography during device support to assess graft patency. Positron emission tomography measurements were made in a separate cohortof LVAD patients with dilated cardiomyopathy to assess the effects of LVADsupport on MVO2 and myocardial blood flow. In this small series, LVAD unloadingled to a high rate of premature graft occlusion in post-cardiotomy cardiogenicshock patients supported with a device; whereas, positron emission tomographymeasurements showed significantly reduced MVO2 and myocardial flood flow indilated cardiomyopathy patients supported with an LVAD, compared with healthysubjects. Reduced myocardial blood flow may be implicated in the premature graft failure observed in post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock patients and may negativelyimpact the potential for myocardial recovery and device weaning in thispopulation.
