The goal of thepresent study was to determine whether combining a cardiac support device withcell-based therapy could prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling, more thaneither therapy alone.METHODS: The present study was completed in 2 parts. In the first part,mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rodent femurs and seeded on acollagen-based scaffold. In the second part, myocardial infarction was induced in60 rats. The 24 survivors were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: control, stem cell therapy, cardiac support device, and a combination of stem cell therapy and cardiac support device. Left ventricular function was measured with biweeklyechocardiography, followed by end-of-life histopathologic analysis at 6 weeks.RESULTS: After myocardial infarction and treatment intervention, the ejectionfraction remained preserved (74.9-80.2%) in the combination group at an earlypoint (2 weeks) compared with the control group (66.2-82.8%). By 6 weeks, thecombination therapy group had a significantly greater fractional area of changecompared with the control group (69.2% ± 6.7% and 49.5% ± 6.1% respectively, P = .03). Also, at 6 weeks, the left ventricular wall thickness was greater in thecombination group than in the stem cell therapy alone group (1.79 ± 0.11 and 1.33± 0.13, respectively, P = .02).CONCLUSIONS: Combining a cardiac support device with stem cell therapy preserves left ventricular function after myocardial infarction, more than either therapyalone. Furthermore, stem cell delivery using a cardiac support device is a novel delivery approach for cell-based therapies.Copyright © 2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
