Results from this programhave not been published.METHODS: All 70 VAD implants for BTT, 71 inotrope-dependent and 179 non-VADtransplant candidates, accepted for transplantation between April 2002 andDecember 2004, were prospectively monitored for survival to transplantation,survival overall and quality of life.RESULTS: Of the 70 VAD patients, 31 (44%) survived to heart transplantation, 4(6%) were bridged to recovery and 5 remained on support at the end of the study. Thirty patients (43%) died while on support. Overall survival from VAD implantwas 52% at 1 year. Ten percent of non-VAD inotrope-dependent patients and 9% ofroutine transplant candidates died while on the waiting list. For transplantrecipients, 12-month post-operative survival was 84%, 85% and 84%, respectively, for VAD, inotrope-dependent and routine transplant candidates. VAD and non-VADpatients had similar post-transplant adverse event rates.CONCLUSIONS: There was a role for VAD bridge to transplant for selected patients in the UK, despite the availability of an effective urgent transplant list. VADpatients who underwent transplantation had survival rates similar to othertransplant candidates.
