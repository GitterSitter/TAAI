Can J Surg. 1989 Sep;32(5):342-4.Prolonged ventricular support using a centrifugal pump.Hoy FB(1), Stables C, Gomez RC, Munns JR, Geiss DM, Flack D, Filko D, Zischler J,Schmidt D.Author information: (1)University of Illinois College of Medicine, Peoria.The Biomedicus centrifugal pump was required to provide prolonged ventricularsupport to 13 patients with hemodynamic instability: 11 after cardiovascularsurgical procedures, 1 after myocardial infarction and 1 after failure of a hearttransplant. The duration of support ranged from 3.5 hours to 9 days (mean 72hours). Complications included bleeding in six patients, renal insufficiency inthree and central nervous system deficit in three. Six patients (46%) weresuccessfully weaned from the pump. The patient with graft failure had hyperacute rejection of a second heart. Five patients were discharged from the hospital.There was one death 8 months postoperatively. Prolonged ventricular support with the centrifugal pump may allow recovery of potentially reversible ventriculardysfunction in selected patients after cardiac surgical procedures.
