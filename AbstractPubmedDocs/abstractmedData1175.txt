A review.Andrea G(1), Giuseppe B, Tiziano C, Maria F, Ettore V.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Disease "E. Malan", Cardiac Surgery Unit,Policlinico S. Donato Hospital, Milan, Italy. agaratti@tiscali.itPulmonary vascular hypertension (PVH) is a common complication of severe,long-lasting chronic heart failure. It is nowadays well recognized that PVH,nonresponsive to pharmacological approaches, is a risk factor for early and late mortality after heart transplant. Recent evidences in literature highlighted thatin these patients chronic unloading with left ventricular assist device resulted in significant reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance, thus ultimatelyleading them to successful heart transplant. We described the case history of a47-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent uncomplicated BerlinHeart Incor implant for severe chronic heart failure and fixed PVH. Chronicunloading determined a rapid and dramatic improvement of PVH, and the patientunderwent successful heart transplant after 5 months of mechanical support.
