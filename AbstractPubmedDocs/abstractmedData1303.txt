Transpl Infect Dis. 2007 Jun;9(2):114-20.Infections associated with ventricular assist devices: epidemiology and effect onprognosis after transplantation.Monkowski DH(1), Axelrod P, Fekete T, Hollander T, Furukawa S, Samuel R.Author information: (1)Section of Infectious Diseases, Temple University School of Medicine andHospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) can be used as a bridge toorthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) in people with severe congestive heartfailure. Although they can be inserted for an indefinite time period (unlikeballoon pumps), they do carry a substantial risk of infection. We studied theepidemiology, microbiology, and consequences of infection in patients with VADswho ultimately had cardiac transplantation.METHODS: Records of VAD-supported patients at our institution between January1995 and January 2005 were identified by ICD-9 code. Infection was classified as driveline infection, pocket infection, mediastinitis, or VAD endocarditis inincreasing severity of illness.RESULTS: Of 73 patients identified by ICD-9 code, 60 had charts available forreview. Of these 60, 72% had a VAD infection: 13 had VAD endocarditis; 3,mediastinitis; 25, pocket infection; and 29, driveline infection. The onlyassociation of infection (43 patients, 72%) and demography or underlying disease was that of endocarditis with older age (median age 59 vs. 53 years; P=0.02) and diabetes mellitus (13 patients, 30%; risk ratio 3.4; P=0.01). The duration of VADsupport was longer in infected patients (median 125 days) vs. uninfected ones (25days). Median survival measured from the time of VAD placement (although alsotrue from the time of transplantation) was shorter in patients with VADendocarditis (120 days) and pocket infection (350 days) vs. no infection (>2400days) with a significant P=0.017 for endocarditis. Four patients had infectionsafter transplantation that were caused by the same organism as their VADinfection. The predominant pathogens in VAD infection were Staphylococcus andEnterococcus spp.CONCLUSION: VAD use as a bridge to cardiac transplantation is associated with alarge number of device-related infections. Patients with infected VADs, onaverage, wait longer for transplantation than patients with uninfected VADs, and patients with VAD endocarditis have a shorter survival than patients with no VAD infection or simple driveline infection.
