Epub 2014 Jan 7.Use of left ventricular assist device (HeartMate II): a Singapore experience.Lim CP(1), Sivathasan C, Tan TE, Lim CH, Kerk KL, Sim DK.Author information: (1)National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore.Comment in    Artif Organs. 2014 Jun;38(6):521-3.Recent advances in medical and device therapies in heart failure have improvedthe survival of patients with heart failure. However, due to the limitedavailability of suitable heart donors, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)have become an important tool as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for patientswith refractory heart failure in Singapore. We report our experience with theHeartMate II (HMII) LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as abridge-to-heart transplant in our center from 2009 to 2012. This was aretrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who underwent HMII LVADimplantation in our center between May 2009 and December 2012. All patients were classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) levels 1 to 3 and underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge-to-hearttransplant. There were 17 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.6 yearsold (range 14 to 64). The etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heartdisease [8], idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [11], viral myocarditis [2], andchemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy [2]. Nine patients were INTERMACS level 1, 12patients level 2, and two patients level 3. All patients successfully underwentHMII LVAD implantation. There was no mortality within the first 30 postoperative days. Postoperative complications included stroke with full neurological recovery(21.7%), mediastinal infection (21.7%), cardiac tamponade or mediastinalcollection requiring reopening of the chest (39.1%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.0%), and pump thrombosis with pump replacement (4.3%). All patients were dischargedfrom hospital after LVAD implantation. Three patients experienced drivelineinfections during outpatient follow-up. There were 19 readmissions due to thefollowing conditions: sub-therapeutic anticoagulation (13.0%), gastrointestinalbleeding (13.0%), suspected pump thrombosis (13.0%), transient ischemic attack(8.7%), arrhythmia (8.7%), congestive cardiac failure due to severe aorticregurgitation (8.7%), right ventricular failure (4.3%), rhabdomyolysis (4.3%),and hematuria (4.3%). Post-LVAD implantation, 20 patients were functionally NewYork Heart Association (NYHA) class I, while 3 reported NYHA III symptoms. Three patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. One patient wassuccessfully explanted 11 months after LVAD implantation. There were twomortalities during the follow-up period. The average duration of LVAD support was522 days (range 47 to 1316 days). The HeartMate II LVAD has proven to beeffective in our Asian population. Driveline infection rate remains low even inthe tropical hot, humid climate in Singapore. With more patients ending up onextended periods of LVAD support, increased emphasis in the detection andmanagement of long-term complications of ventricular assist devices will beneeded.Copyright Â© 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantationand Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
