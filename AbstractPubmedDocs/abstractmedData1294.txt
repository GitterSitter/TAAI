ASAIO J. 2007 May-Jun;53(3):298-303.Identification of device malfunction in patients supported with the HeartMate XVEleft ventricular assist system.Haft JW(1), Suzuki Y, Aaronson KD, Dyke DB, Wright S, Poirier VL, Pagani FD.Author information: (1)Section of Cardiac Surgery, University of Michigan Health Systems, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Predicting end-of-life for left ventricular assist devices is important todetermine timing of device removal. A retrospective analysis was performed on 46 patients undergoing implantation of the latest HeartMate XVE from July 1, 2003,through March 31, 2006. Devices were assessed by analysis of motor currentwaveforms and quantification of the titanium or copper particles within dustlocalized to the driveline vent filter by optical, polarized light, scanningelectron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Assessments wereperformed monthly for patients supported > or =330 days or for unexpected device alarms. Thirty-one (67%) patients were supported for <330 days and 15 (33%) were supported for > or =330 days. No malfunctions occurred in patients supported <330days. For patients supported > or =330 days, five had abnormal current waveforms or copper and titanium dust localized to the vent filter. One underwent urgenttransplantation, three underwent device replacement (one death; two ongoing), andone is with ongoing support. Of the remaining 10 patients, seven underwenttransplantation; two remain on device; and one died while on left ventricularassist device support. There were no unexpected device failures. Bearing wear of the HeartMate XVE is predictable by analysis of current waveforms or titanium andcopper dust within the vent filter.
