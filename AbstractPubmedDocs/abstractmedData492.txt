Epub2013 Feb 4.Thrombolysis for suspected intrapump thrombosis in patients with continuous flow centrifugal left ventricular assist device.Muthiah K(1), Robson D, Macdonald PS, Keogh AM, Kotlyar E, Granger E, Dhital K,Spratt P, Jansz P, Hayward CS.Author information: (1)Heart Failure and Transplant Unit, Failure and Transplant Unit, St. Vincent’s Hospital, Victoria St., Darlinghurst, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia.The current recommended anticoagulation regimen during continuous flowcentrifugal left ventricular device support is a combination of antiplatelettherapy as well as oral anticoagulation. Despite this, pump thrombosis occurs in rare situations. We report the risk factors and nonsurgical management andoutcomes of five patients implanted with continuous flow centrifugal leftventricular assist devices who displayed clinical, hemodynamic, and laboratoryfeatures of intrapump thrombosis. This information may support the use ofintravenous thrombolytics for suspected pump thrombus in these newer generationdevices.© 2013, Copyright the Authors.
