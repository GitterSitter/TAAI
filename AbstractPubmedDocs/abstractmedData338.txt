At the time ofLVAD implant, a large proportion of patients have pulmonary hypertension, rightventricular (RV) dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). RV dysfunctionand TR can exacerbate renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy,edema, and even prohibit isolated LVAD implant. Repairing TR mandates increasedcardiopulmonary bypass time and bicaval cannulation, which should be reserved forthe time of orthotopic heart transplantation. We hypothesized that CF LVADimplant would improve pulmonary artery pressures, enhance RV function, andminimize TR, obviating need for surgical tricuspid repair.METHODS: One hundred fourteen continuous flow LVADs implanted from 2005 through2011 at a single center, with medical management of functional TR, wereretrospectively analyzed. Pulmonary artery pressures were measured immediatelyprior to and following LVAD implant. RV function and TR were graded according to standard echocardiographic criteria, prior to, immediately following, andlong-term following LVAD.RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in post-VAD mean pulmonary arterial pressures (26.6 ± 4.9 vs. 30.2 ± 7.4 mmHg, p = 0.008) with equivalent loadingpressures (CVP = 12.0 ± 4.0 vs. 12.1 ± 5.1 p = NS). RV function significantlyimproved, as noted by right ventricular stroke work index (7.04 ± 2.60 vs. 6.05 ±2.54, p = 0.02). There was an immediate improvement in TR grade and RV functionfollowing LVAD implant, which was sustained long term.CONCLUSION: Continuous flow LVAD implant improves pulmonary hypertension, RVfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation. TR may be managed nonoperatively during CFLVAD implant.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.PMCID: PMC4111248
