Epub 2012 Dec 8.A case of conversion of a NIPRO ventricular assist system to an EVAHEART leftventricular assist system.Ushijima T(1), Tanoue Y, Hirayama K, Nakashima A, Tominaga R.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.Bridge to bridge (BTB) is a promising strategy for the treatment of end-stageheart failure that involves the left ventricular assist system (LVAS). Wedescribe our experience with the conversion of an extracorporeal ventricularassist system (VAS), the NIPRO VAS, to an implantable LVAS, the EVAHEART LVAS. A 32-year-old man underwent a NIPRO VAS implantation as a bridge to decision for a condition consistent with Interagency Registry for Mechanically AssistedCirculatory Support profile 1. He was later diagnosed with secondarycardiomyopathy due to cardiac sarcoidosis. During the period in which he hadNIPRO VAS support, no significant bacterial cultures were obtained from thecannula-piercing site, and no systemic infection occurred. Approximately 5 monthsafter the NIPRO VAS implantation, he underwent an EVAHEART LVAS implantation as aBTB. The procedure required technical modifications, including the anastomosis ofoutflow grafts, trimming of the apical cuff, and creation of a pump pocket. Theoperation was completed uneventfully. The patient completed the discharge programfor awaiting heart transplantation at home. Approximately 6 months after theEVAHEART LVAS implantation, he continues to do well without any complications,including infection, and visits our hospital as an outpatient. Conversion to animplantable LVAS can be beneficial in carefully selected patients afterascertaining the operative indications and operation timing.
