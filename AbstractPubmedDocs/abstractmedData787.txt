There have been fewreports of LVAD implantation for more than a month in children weighing under5 kg. We report the case of a 4-month-old female infant who survived for 2 monthsafter being diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with extracorporealcentrifugal pump support. In recent years, although pumps designed for smallchildren have been introduced and are used as a bridge to transplantation orrecovery, mid-term or long-term mechanical support for small children with heart failure is still difficult. We managed to successfully provide support for alow-body-weight child with a centrifugal pump over a mid-term period. We achievedacceptable control of thrombosis, but eventually the infant died of sepsis.Autopsy revealed no prominent thrombosis in the perfusion cannula, drainagecannula, the pump, or the left ventricle. This is the first case report of LVADsupport with the centrifugal pump, ROTAFLOW(®) (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany), for2 months in a child weighing under 5 kg. Our method may potentially save severeheart failure children who need mid-term LVAD support.
