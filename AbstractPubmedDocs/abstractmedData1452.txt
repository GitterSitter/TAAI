The use of aprotinintherapy is generally accepted for reducing bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting procedures, heart transplantation, and insertion of a left ventricularassist device. We describe the case of a patient who had a suprasystemic increasein pulmonary artery pressure, caused by thromboembolic occlusion of the pulmonaryarterioles after urgent implantation of a left ventricular assist device. Thecomplications developed after the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and heparinization was reversed with protamine. Although the thrombosis wassuccessfully reversed with intraoperative administration of tissue plasminogenactivator directly to the pulmonary artery, the patient died of massivehemorrhage 6 hours later. To our knowledge, the direct application of tissueplasminogen activator into the pulmonary artery in such a catastrophic situation has not been used elsewhere.PMCID: PMC1163481
