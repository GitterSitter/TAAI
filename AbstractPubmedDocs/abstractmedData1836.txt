Tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine capable of producing pulmonary edema,dilated cardiomyopathy, and death. TNF-alpha is produced in the myocardium inresponse to volume overload; however, the effects of normalizing ventricularloading conditions on myocardial TNF-alpha expression are not known. Wehypothesize that chronic ventricular unloading by the placement of a leftventricular assist device (LVAD) may eliminate the stress responsible forpersistent TNF-alpha expression in human failing myocardium.METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocardial tissue was obtained from normal hearts and frompaired samples of 8 patients with nonischemic end-stage cardiomyopathy at thetime of LVAD implantation and removal. Tissue sections were stained forTNF-alpha, and quantitative analysis of the stained area was performed. We found that TNF-alpha content decreased significantly after LVAD support. Furthermore,the magnitude of the changes did not correlate with the length of LVAD support,although greater reductions in myocardial TNF-alpha content were found inpatients who were successfully weaned off the LVAD who did not requiretransplantation.CONCLUSIONS: These data show for the first time that chronic mechanicalcirculatory assistance decreases TNF-alpha content in failing myocardium;furthermore, we suggest that the magnitude of the change may predict whichpatients will recover cardiac function.
