This article defines and clarifies the majorclassification of these pumps as axial or centrifugal continuous-flow devices by discussing the difference in their inherent mechanics and describing how thesefeatures translate clinically to pump selection and patient management issues.Axial vs centrifugal pump and bearing design, theory of operation, hydrodynamicperformance, and current vs flow relationships are discussed. A review of axialvs centrifugal physiology, pre-load and after-load sensitivity, flow pulsatility,and issues related to automatic physiologic control and suction preventionalgorithms is offered. Reliability and biocompatibility of the two types of pumpsare reviewed from the perspectives of mechanical wear, implant life, hemolysis,and pump deposition. Finally, a glimpse into the future of continuous-flowtechnologies is presented.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
