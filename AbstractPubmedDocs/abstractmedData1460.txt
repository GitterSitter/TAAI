This prospective, multicenter trial was designed toevaluate the usefulness of the HeartMate vented electric (VE) LVAS as a bridge totransplantation in Japan. Between November 2001 and June 2003, six patients with end-stage heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV] weresupported with the LVAS and five of the six were able to implement the evaluation(one dropped out). The five were men with an average age of 38.6 years and weresupported for 2390 cumulative days (6.6 years). Average preimplant cardiac index improved from 1.93 l/min/m(2) to a 3.79 l/min/m(2) VAD flow index at the end ofthe clinical trial. All five patients improved to NYHA class I or II, survivedmore than 1 year, and one patient was discharged from the hospital. Mean LVASsupport duration was 478 days (range 390-575 days) and four patients remainsupported. One patient died from cardiac failure and sepsis. Device-relatedcomplications included: infections (four patients), thromboembolism (onepatient), hemolysis (two patients), and repeat operation for bleeding (twopatients). There was one case of inflow valve incompetence and two pump motormalfunctions. We conclude that the LVAS can effectively support patients as they await cardiac transplantation and offers improvement to the patient's quality of life.
