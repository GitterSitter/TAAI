ASAIO J. 1994 Jul-Sep;40(3):M454-9.Influence of longer term left ventricular assist device support on valvularregurgitation.Holman WL(1), Bourge RC, Fan P, Kirklin JK, Pacifico AD, Nanda NC.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294,USA.The authors previously published data that describe acute alterations inventricular dimensions and in the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (MR/TR) after initiation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pumping. In thecurrent study, measurements of ventricular size and regurgitant jet area acquiredafter LVAD implantation are presented. Eight patients had LVAD implanted pending cardiac transplantation (duration of assist 70-279 days; mean, 162 +/- 29 days). Echocardiograms were obtained at the time of LVAD implant and later during LVADsupport (mean time for late echo, 95 +/- 32 days post-implant). Comparisons ofpre-implant with late post-implant data showed: increased TR jet area (4.8 +/-1.0 cm2 vs. 8.0 +/- 1.7 cm2 P < 0.05); increased right ventricular (RV)end-systolic dimension (31 +/- 4 vs 40 +/- 5 mm, P < 0.05); and increased RVend-diastolic dimension (35 +/- 4 vs. 45 +/- 5 mm, P < 0.065). Decreased MR jetarea and decreased LV dimensions (P < 0.05) also were noted on comparison ofpre-implant and late post-implant data. There were no significant differencesbetween any immediate post-implant and late post-implant echocardiographicmeasurements. No patient had clinical evidence of RV failure. LV mechanicalassist causes an acute increase in TR, presumably by volume loading the RV. TRand RV enlargement persisted but did not discernibly worsen on subsequentpost-implant echocardiograms. LV dimensions and MR remained less than thepre-implant values on later post-implant determinations.
