From 1991 to 2003, a total of 42 patientsreceived a Thoratec VAD (Thoratec Laboratories Corporation Inc., Pleasanton, CA, U.S.A.) (Group T) and 12 patients received a Novacor VAD (WorldHeart Corporation,Ottawa, Canada) (Group N). Thirty Thoratec patients were transplanted compared tosix in the Novacor group. Four more Novacor patients are still supported. Of the transplanted patients, 87% survived to hospital discharge in Group T and 67% inGroup N. Infections affected 29% and 50% of Group T patients during support andpost-transplantation, respectively, compared to 25% and 0%, respectively, inGroup N. Neurologic complications affected 33% of patients in each group duringsupport. Reopening rates for bleeding during support were 45% and 42% in Groups Tand N, respectively. There were no significant differences in outcomes betweenthe two groups. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of VADs in bridgingmortally ill cardiac patients to successful heart transplantation.
