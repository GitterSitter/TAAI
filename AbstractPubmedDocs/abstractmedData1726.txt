The immediate effects of hemodynamic unloading via LVAD placementincluded a decrease in QRS duration from 117+/-6 to 103+/-6 ms (P<0.01), anincrease in absolute QT duration from 359+/-6 to 378+/-8 ms (P<0.05), and anincrease in the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) from 379+/-10 to 504+/-11 ms (P<0.01). None of these immediate changes were observed among 22 patientsundergoing routine coronary artery bypass grafting. With sustained cardiacunloading via LVAD support, there was a marked decrease in the QTc from 504+/-11 to 445+/-9 ms (P<0.001). Studies in isolated cardiac myocytes, obtained at thetime of transplantation, confirmed that delayed decreases in heart rate-adjusted QTc were the result of decreases in action potential duration after LVAD support.CONCLUSIONS: Acute electrocardiogram responses to LVAD placement demonstrate the dependence of QRS and QT duration on load in the failing human heart. Delayeddecreases in QTc and action potential duration reflect reversal ofelectrophysiologic remodeling in the failing heart. Shortening of the actionpotential duration likely contributes to the improved cellular contractileperformance observed after sustained LVAD support.
