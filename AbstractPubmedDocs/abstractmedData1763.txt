DeBakey Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,TX, USA.After years of development and preclinical testing, clinical trials of theMicroMed DeBakey VAD began in November 1998 in Europe and in June 2000 in theUnited States. As of August 2000, 44 patients in Europe and 3 patients in theUnited States have undergone implantation with the MicroMed DeBakey VAD. Inconclusion, data from the European clinical trial of the MicroMed DeBakey VADsupport the safety and performance of the device. Results show that the deviceprovides adequate left ventricular and circulatory support in patients withend-stage heart failure without unduly jeopardizing patient safety. Moreover, thedevice provides advantages not inherent to commercially available pulsatiledevices: (1) miniature size, enabling implantation in smaller patients; (2) ease of implantation; (3) reduced surgical bleeding; and (4) a low incidence ofpostoperative infections, often a limiting factor with other devices. TheMicroMed DeBakey VAD European clinical trial is the first demonstration of thecompatibility of continuous blood flow with adequate tissue perfusion and overallmaintenance of life for up to 4.5 months. This initial experience with theMicroMed DeBakey VAD suggests that the pump can provide circulatory support tobridge patients to cardiac transplantation and may provide an improved quality oflife for the patient with end-stage heart failure.
