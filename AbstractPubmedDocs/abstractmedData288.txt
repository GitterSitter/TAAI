We hypothesized that IL-33/ST2 pathway, a new mechanism regulated duringcardiac stress, may be involved in the functional worsening of end-stage HFpatients, candidates for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and potentially responsible for their outcome.METHODS: IL-33, ST2, and conventional cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) weredetermined in cardiac biopsies and plasma of 22 patients submitted to LVADimplantation (pre-LVAD) and compared with (1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at the moment of heart transplantation without priorcirculatory support (HT); (2) patients supported by LVAD at the moment of LVADweaning (post-LVAD).RESULTS: Cardiac expression of ST2/IL-33 and cytokines was lower in the pre-LVAD than in the HT group. LVAD determined an increase of inflammatory mediatorscomparable to levels of the HT group. Only ST2 correlated with outcome indicesafter LVAD implantation.CONCLUSIONS: IL-33/ST2 and traditional cytokines were involved in decline ofcardiac function of ESHF patients as well as in hemodynamic recovery induced byLVAD. IL-33/ST2 pathway was also associated to severity of clinical course. Thus,a better understanding of inflammation is the key to achieving more favorableoutcome by new specific therapies.PMCID: PMC3872445
