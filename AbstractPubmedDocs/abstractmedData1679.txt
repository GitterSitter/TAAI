The goal ofour study was to examine the expression characteristics of RTKs in ventricularmyocardium obtained from patients before and after mechanical unloading.METHODS: We extracted RNA from paired formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded leftventricular tissue blocks obtained at the time of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and explantation from a cohort of 36 patients (median age 51 years). The duration of LVAD support ranged from 1 to 314 days (median 95 days), 17 patients had ischemic and 19 non-ischemic cardiomyopathy at the time of LVADimplantation. Using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) we quantitated transcripts for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and tumornecrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), markers of heart failure, and the RTKsHer2/neu, Her4 and gp130, regulators of cardiac cell survival.RESULTS: In patients undergoing mechanical unloading, ANF and TNF-alpha mRNAlevels were independently suppressed. Her2/neu, along with Her4 was upregulated, mostly in cases of ischemic cardiomyopathy, whereas gp130 levels decreased.Post-LVAD transcript levels of Her2 correlated tightly with gp130 in patientswith non-pathologic entry values of gp130. Duration of treatment and age werealso determining factors in the change of expression of these genes.CONCLUSION: Real-time quantitative (Q)-RT-PCR can be used to quantitate geneexpression in archival myocardial tissue blocks. Mechanical unloading leads to a re-adjustment of RTK transcript levels, but not their reverting to control valuesin heart failure patients.
