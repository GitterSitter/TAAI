Increasing the frequency and durability of myocardial recovery could reduceor postpone the need for subsequent heart transplantation.METHODS: We enrolled 15 patients with severe heart failure due to nonischemiccardiomyopathy and with no histologic evidence of active myocarditis. All hadmarkedly reduced cardiac output and were receiving inotropes. The patientsunderwent implantation of left ventricular assist devices and were treated withlisinopril, carvedilol, spironolactone, and losartan to enhance reverseremodeling. Once regression of left ventricular enlargement had been achieved,the beta2-adrenergic-receptor agonist clenbuterol was administered to preventmyocardial atrophy.RESULTS: Eleven of the 15 patients had sufficient myocardial recovery to undergo explantation of the left ventricular assist device a mean (+/-SD) of 320+/-186days after implantation of the device. One patient died of intractablearrhythmias 24 hours after explantation; another died of carcinoma of the lung 27months after explantation. The cumulative rate of freedom from recurrent heartfailure among the surviving patients was 100% and 88.9% 1 and 4 years afterexplantation, respectively. The quality of life as assessed by the MinnesotaLiving with Heart Failure Questionnaire score at 3 years was nearly normal.Fifty-nine months after explantation, the mean left ventricular ejection fractionwas 64+/-12%, the mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 59.4+/-12.1mm, the mean left ventricular end-systolic diameter was 42.5+/-13.2 mm, and themean maximal oxygen uptake with exercise was 26.3+/-6.0 ml per kilogram of bodyweight per minute.CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, we found that sustained reversal ofsevere heart failure secondary to nonischemic cardiomyopathy could be achieved inselected patients with the use of a left ventricular assist device and a specificpharmacologic regimen.Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society.
