The clinical results of eightpatients, who underwent LVAD implantation with the Jarvik 2000 (median age 55.0years; six men) between 2005 and 2010, including two who participated in amulticenter clinical trial in Japan, were reviewed. Two patients underwent LVADimplantation as destination therapy. Four patients underwent Jarvik 2000implantation via median sternotomy, while the other four underwent implantationvia left thoracotomy. There were no major complications during surgery. Fourpatients were supported for more than 2 years. The longest support duration was1,618 days. Six patients successfully bridged to heart transplantation after amedian 725 days of support. One patient on destination therapy died of a cerebralinfarction. The other patient on destination therapy had had the LVAD for 1,618days. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100, 86, and 86%,respectively. The median postoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase level was860.5 U/L at 1 month, 735 U/L at 6 months, and 692 U/L at 1 year. There were nofatal device-related infections. We found that the Jarvik 2000 with pin bearingcould support patients with end-stage heart failure with acceptable mortality andmorbidity rates. Further evaluations of the prevalence of thromboembolic andhemolytic events in patients with the new conical-bearing Jarvik 2000 arerequired.
