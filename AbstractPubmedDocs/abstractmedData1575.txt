Overthe past 3 years the following management changes were made: (1) more aggressive use of mechanical cardiac assistance; (2) high priority listing fortransplantation; and (3) ABO incompatible transplants for infants. Outcomes for46 patients admitted between 1992 and 1999 (group I) were compared with 53patients between 2000 and March 2003 (group II).RESULTS: In group I, 12 (26%) patients received mechanical support with recovery in 3 and transplantation in 5 (1 died). In group II, 19 (36%) patients receivedextracorporeal membrane oxygenation, with recovery in 5 and transplantation in 12(all survived). The use of mechanical assistance was associated with highmorbidity related to bleeding, end-organ failure, and long-term mechanicalventilation. Five patients in group II received ABO incompatible transplants and all survived. There have been no episodes of rejection or need for increasedimmunosuppressive therapy. Hospital mortality has been significantly reduced(group I, 37% vs group II, 11%; P <.05).CONCLUSIONS: Recent refinements in the management of end-stage dilatedcardiomyopathy in children have significantly reduced early mortality.Identification of markers of early myocardial recovery and development ofmechanical devices for longer term and more physiologic support are essential to achieve further improvements in outcome.
