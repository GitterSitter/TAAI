Although support was occasionallyinstituted remotely post-transplant (5>1 year), in 39 (73%) instances it wasrequired within 1 week. Initial mode of support was extracorporeal membraneoxygenation in 43 patients (81%), biventricular assist device in 4 (7.5%), andright ventricular assist device in 6 (11%).RESULTS: Risk of requiring respiratory support was highest in those withrestrictive cardiomyopathy as indication for transplant, women, and those withelevated pulmonary pressure or renal failure. Complications of support, whichincreased progressively with its duration, included stroke in two patients(3.8%), infection in two (3.8%), and reoperation for bleeding (seven instances)in four (7.0%). Nineteen patients (36%) recovered and were removed from support, five (9.4%) underwent retransplantation (four after biventricular failure and oneafter acute rejection), and 29 died while on support (55%). Overall survivalafter initiating support was 94%, 83%, 66%, and 43% at 1, 3, 7, and 30 days,respectively. Patients requiring support for biventricular failure had bettersurvival than those having acute rejection or other indications (P=0.03).Survival after retransplantation or removal from support following recovery was88% at 1 year and 61% at 10 years.CONCLUSION: Severe refractory heart failure after transplantation is a rarecatastrophic event for which MCS offers the possibility of recovery or bridge to retransplantation, particularly for patients with biventricular failure in theabsence of rejection. Early retransplantation should be considered in patientswho show no evidence of graft recovery on MCS.PMCID: PMC3241119
