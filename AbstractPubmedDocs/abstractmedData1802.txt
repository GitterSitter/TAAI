This represents a dramatic change in the physician'sperception of the LVAD in the early 1990s. The creation of these mechanicalassist outpatient programs are possible for the following reasons: 1) confidence in the devices allow patients, their families, and health care providers to bemore comfortable with outpatient therapy; 2) the devices are simplified anddurable, allowing extended duration of support and more options for patients; and3) a change in the perception of the LVAD from a last-resort therapeutic optionto that of a safe and reliable bridge to recovery and transplant. With thesegeneral concepts in mind, programs have been created with specific safety nets,patient education goals, and discharge criteria. By using this construct, we havedeveloped a successful outpatient LVAD program in which 70% of our ventedelectric LVAD patients were discharged with a 0% mortality and minimal morbidity.From our experience and studies, we believe that not only is an outpatient LVADprogram safe and economical, but it is also socially, physically, andpsychologically beneficial to the patient. In the current economic environment ofcost containment, outpatient LVAD therapy is a necessary part of an LVAD program that should be sought by most cardiac mechanical assist programs.
