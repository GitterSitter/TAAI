The purpose of this study was todetermine pre- and peri-operative predictors of hospital LOS after LVADimplantation.METHODS: We analyzed adult primary continuous-flow LVAD patients implantedbetween June 23, 2006 and December 31, 2010 at 105 institutions from theInteragency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS).Retrospective analyses included measures of central tendency, frequencies,correlations and stepwise multivariable regression modeling (p ≤ 0.05).Independent variables included demographic characteristics, pre-implant clinical and behavioral variables and concomitant surgery.RESULTS: Characteristics of the patients (n = 2,200) included: mean age 54.6 ±12.6 years; 79% male; 69% white; 57% INTERMACS Profile 1 or 2; 37% diabetic; 21% with history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG); 7% with history of valvesurgery; and 37% with concomitant surgery. Median hospital LOS (implant todischarge) was 20 days. Significant predictors of an increased hospital LOSincluded demographic characteristics (older age and non-white), pre-implantclinical variables (history of CABG or valve surgery, diabetes, ascites,INTERMACS Profiles 1 and 2, low albumin, high blood urea nitrogen, high rightatrial pressure) and concomitant surgery, explaining 12% variance (F = 22.65,p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Demographic characteristics, pre-implant variables and concomitantsurgery partially explained hospital LOS after continuous-flow LVAD implant.These variables have implications regarding selection of patients for mechanical circulatory support.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
