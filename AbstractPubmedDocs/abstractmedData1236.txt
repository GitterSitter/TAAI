Leftventricular-assist devices (LVADs) are a technology designed to work in parallel with the heart but have yet to see widespread use since uncertainty remains as tothe cost-effectiveness of this evolving new technology. We have systematicallyreviewed evidence of cost-effectiveness for LVADs in the bridge-to-transplant andlong-term chronic support indications. A total of 18 studies reporting costs wereidentified. Of these, only four studies reported results in cost-effectivenessterms; two in cost per life-year saved and two in cost per quality-adjustedlife-year (QALY). The majority of the other studies were simple cost summations(cost per day or incremental cost) without consideration of efficacy. In thebridge-to-transplant indication, a Danish abstract reported a cost per life-year saved of DKK270k (US$48,000), a UK study reported a cost per QALY of GBpound39,787 (US$78,000) and a Canadian study reported a cost per life-year saved of Can$91,332 (US$86,000). Regarding the long-term chronic support indication,the same Canadian study reported a cost per life-year saved of Can$59,842(US$56,000), whereas a US study reported a cost per QALY of $36,255-60,057.Assuming a willingness to pay the threshold of GB pound30,000 (US$59,000) perQALY, there is arguably stronger evidence to support the cost-effectiveness ofLVAD technology for the long-term chronic support indication. However, themethodological quality of the majority of studies was poor, as was theirgeneralizability, raising concerns over the reliability of these figures. Withthe limited and declining availability of donor hearts for transplantation, itappears that the future of this technology is in its use as long-term chronicsupport. Further analyses should be undertaken, particularly alongsiderandomized, controlled trials and utilizing second- and third-generation devices.
