Six children haddilatative cardiomyopathy and 1 had congenital heart disease (hypoplastic leftheart, total cavopulmonary connections with extracardiac conduit). Six patientshave been successfully bridged to transplantation. Median support time was 75days (range, 1 to 136 days). One child is still under continuous mechanicalsupport. None of the patients suffered a thromboembolic event or an infection.CONCLUSIONS: The HeartWare assist system can be successfully used as a bridge to transplantation in children and adolescents with end-stage heart failure.Copyright © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
