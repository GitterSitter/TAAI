Occasionally, implantation of a total artificial heart is notfeasible for anatomical reasons. For this patient group, we have developed analternative technique using the paracorporeal Thoratec biventricular supportsystem (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as a modified total artificial heart. Adetailed description of the implantation technique is presented.
