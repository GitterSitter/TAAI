Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2002 Dec;50(6):342-6.Left ventricular assist stand-by for high-risk cardiac surgery.Schmid C(1), Welp H, Klotz S, Trösch F, Schmidt C, Wilhelm MJ, Scheld HH.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital,Münster, Germany. schmid@uni-muenster.deBACKGROUND: Patients with severely impaired left-ventricular pump function whoare eligible for heart transplantation increasingly undergo high-risk cardiacsurgery due to the scarcity of donor organs. If these patients also qualify forlong-term mechanical support, the latter can be used as back-up in case ofpostcardiotomy failure.METHODS: Since 1994, 36 patients (34 male, 2 female; mean age 51 +/- 7 years)underwent coronary bypass surgery/aneurysmectomy (n = 27), aortic valvereplacement (n = 4), both (n = 1), or partial left ventriculectomy (n = 4) with along-term mechanical assist device (Novacor, HeartMate, DeBakey) and were kept onstand-by with the device. Average left ventricular ejection fraction was 23 +/- 9%, NYHA 2.9 +/- 0.5, and CCS 2.7 +/- 0.9. An intraaortic balloon pump wasinserted prior to surgery in 13 patients.RESULTS: In 31 patients, high-risk surgery was performed, whereas 5 patientsunderwent immediate device placement as coronary revascularization was deemedimpossible. 6 patients had postcardiotomy failure after coronary bypass surgeryand were immediately provided with a long-term assist system. There were nosignificant differences in risk factors between the patient subsets. Allconservatively operated patients survived and left the institution after 9.4 daysand are currently at NYHA 1.5 +/- 0.5 or CCS 1.0 +/- 0, respectively. 6 of the 11LVAD patients could be bridged to heart transplantation after 43 - 418 days, and 1 patient is still on support.CONCLUSION: High-risk conventional surgery with LVAD stand-by is feasible andseems to be a valuable alternative for heart-transplant candidates.
