Almost half ofpatients with ventricular assist devices undergoing transplantation were upgradedto status 1A as a result of ventricular assist device-related complicationsoccurring more than 30 days after ventricular assist device implantation.Creatinine and total bilirubin levels were less in patients undergoingtransplantation after 2 to 4 weeks of mechanical support. One-year survival washigher in the nonventricular assist device than in the ventricular assist device group (85.7% vs 79.7%, P =.0004). Within the ventricular assist device group,survival was lower for patients undergoing transplantation within 2 weeks ofventricular assist device implantation compared with those undergoingtransplantation later (74.2% vs 84.2 %, P =.03). One-year survival among patientssupported with a ventricular assist device for more than 30 days withoutcomplications was 91.4%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantindependent effect of the time interval from ventricular assist deviceimplantation to transplantation on posttransplantation mortality and suggestedthat a period of lowest risk might exist between 1 and 3 months afterimplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Survival after cardiac transplantation is influenced by the timeinterval from ventricular assist device insertion to transplantation. Survival issignificantly lower when performed within 2 to 4 weeks of ventricular assistdevice implantation.
