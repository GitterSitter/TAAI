Myocardial gene expression was assessed pre- andpost-LVAD by RNase protection assay and compared to control donor hearts. Theexpression of Fas is markedly elevated at the time of LVAD support and is tightlycorrelated with TNF expression. While interleukin (IL)-6 was significantlyreduced by LVAD support, the impact of support on Fas was highly variable andtightly linked to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The role of Fas in predictingrecovery after LVAD support requires further investigation.
