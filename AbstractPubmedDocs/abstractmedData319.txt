Recently, VADs have similarly taken a prominentrole in the management of end-stage heart failure in children. The purpose ofthis review is to describe the indications for VADs in children, types of devicesavailable, current outcomes, and future directions of VAD therapy.RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a dramatic increase in VAD utilization inchildren over the last decade. For small children, paracorporeal pneumaticpulsatile pumps (e.g., Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD, Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin,Germany) are most commonly utilized for long-term support. In older children,intracorporeal continuous flow devices (e.g., HeartMate II Left VentricularAssist System, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, California, USA and HeartWareVentricular Assist System, HeartWare Incorporated, Framingham, Massachusetts,USA) have been used and allow the possibility of destination therapy. Otherdevices, such as the total artificial heart, can be utilized for selectedpatients. Although overall outcomes of pediatric VADs are favorable, complicationrates remain high. The utilization of VADs in complex circulations, such assingle ventricle patients, remains infrequent and is associated with a high rate of adverse outcomes.SUMMARY: VADs are well-established treatment for end-stage heart failure inchildren. Further investigation is needed to refine patient selection criteria,minimize complications, and develop additional pediatric-specific devices.
