Epub 2014 Mar 29.Mechanical ventricular assist device as a bridge to recoverypost-ABO-incompatible heart transplantation for failed Fontan circulation.Seitz S(1), Buchholz H, Rebeyka I, Ross D, West L, Urschel S.Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Stollery Children's Hospital, University of Alberta,Edmonton, AB, Canada.A girl received an ABO-incompatible heart transplantation (ABOiHTx) at the age of3.5 years for failed univentricular palliation with protein-losing enteropathy(PLE). She was born with a hypoplastic left heart syndrome and underwentmultistage palliation to a Fontan circulation at 2½ years of age. After theFontan surgery, she developed PLE, necessitating a Fontan revision, followed by aFontan takedown and eventually HTx, which was performed with a blood group Bheart into an O recipient. Right ventricular (RV) failure secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) evolved immediately after HTx. A temporaryright ventricular assist device (RVAD) was implanted and later switched to apneumatic pulsatile RVAD. With the adaption of PVR on the RVAD, the PLE resolved and the RVAD was explanted. In the following 12 months, she developed multiplerelapses of PLE which eventually resolved after exchange of the calcineurininhibitor.© 2014 Steunstichting ESOT.
