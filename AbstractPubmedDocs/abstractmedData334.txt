Pretransplantation recipient cardiac index (2.33±0.66L⋅min(-1)⋅m(-2) versus 2.33±0.68 L⋅min(-1)⋅m(-2)), serum creatinine (1.21±0.43mg/dL versus 1.26±0.57 mg/dL), and total bilirubin (1.34±3.45 mg/dL versus1.06±1.84 mg/dL) were comparable between the two groups (p>0.05 for allcomparisons). After transplantation, there were no significant differences infreedom from rejection or freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy.Posttransplant graft survival rates were similar between the HW-VAD group and theHMII-VAD group at 1, 2, and 3 years (88.4% versus 87.8%, 79.9% versus 83.8%, and 77.4% versus 79.9%, respectively; p=0.843).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest similar hemodynamic unloading, pretransplant end-organ function, and posttransplant outcomes in patients bridged totransplantation with both the HW-VAD and HMII-VAD.Copyright © 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
