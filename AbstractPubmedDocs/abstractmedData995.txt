Weobtained the in vitro pressure gradient response and compared it with those ofthe clinically used, unmodified MicroMed DeBakey pump, Jarvik 2000 FlowMaker and HeartMate II.RESULTS: The modified pump showed an increased response to changes in thepressure gradient at pump flow rates of between 2 and 4 liters/min. The maximumpressure responsivity of the modified pump was 2.5 liters/min/mm Hg; thecorresponding maximum responsivities of the Jarvik 2000, HeartMate II andMicroMed DeBakey ventricular assist devices (VADs) were 0.12, 0.09 and 0.38liters/min/mm Hg, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the inherent properties of non-pulsatile pumps, the CFTAHmay potentially respond to changes in inflow and outflow pressures whilemaintaining physiologic flow rates sufficient for normal daily activity. Inaddition, the hemodynamic interplay between the two optimized pumps should allow a physiologic response to normal flow imbalances between the pulmonary andsystemic circulations. Improved responsiveness to inflow pressure may furthersimplify and improve the CFTAH and affect its potential clinical use as ameaningful therapy for terminal heart failure.Copyright 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
