Circulation. 2001 Aug 7;104(6):670-5.Comparison of right and left ventricular responses to left ventricular assistdevice support in patients with severe heart failure: a primary role ofmechanical unloading underlying reverse remodeling.Barbone A(1), Holmes JW, Heerdt PM, The' AH, Naka Y, Joshi N, Daines M, Marks AR,Oz MC, Burkhoff D.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) reverse ventricular,myocardial, and systemic abnormalities characteristic of severe heart failure(reverse remodeling). The relative contributions of hemodynamic unloading andnormalized biochemical milieu to reverse remodeling are unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: Structural and functional characteristics were measured from53 hearts of patients undergoing transplantation without LVAD support (medicalsupport) and 33 hearts from patients receiving a median of 46 days of LVADsupport (range, 8 to 360 days). Compared with medical support alone, patientsreceiving LVAD support for >/=30 days had higher central venous pressures (11+/-6versus 8+/-5 mm Hg, P=0.04), lower pulmonary artery diastolic pressures (14+/-9versus 21+/-9 mm Hg, P=0.01), and higher cardiac outputs (5.1+/-1.6 versus3.7+/-1.0 L/min, P<0.001). In LVAD versus transplantation hearts, V(30) (ex vivo volume yielding ventricular pressure of 30 mm Hg) was decreased in the leftventricle (LV) (179+/-75 versus 261+/-118 mL, P=0.005) but not in the rightventricle (RV) (140+/-59 versus 148+/-52 mL, P=NS). LV myocyte diameter decreasedmore significantly after LVAD support (17%, P=0.05) than in the RV (11%, P=NS).Compared with transplantation, LVAD support increased normalized SERCA2a content in the LV (0.51+/-0.26 versus 1.04+/-0.34, P<0.001) but not in the RV (0.48+/-34 versus 0.67+/-0.55, P=NS). Finally, LVAD support improved force-frequencyrelations of isolated superfused LV trabeculae (P=0.01) but not RV trabeculae.CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of hemodynamic load is a primary factor underlying severalimportant features of reverse remodeling. These findings do not preclude apossible primary role of neurohormonal factors underlying other facets of reverseremodeling during LVAD support.
