Nihon Kyobu Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 1997 Aug;45(8):1203-7.[Implantation of the Novacor left ventricular assist device in a patient withdilated cardiomyopathy].[Article in Japanese]Hachida M(1), Saito S, Kihara S, Kitamura M, Koyanagi H.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart Institute of Japan, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.The Novacor left ventricular assist device has been widely applied as a bridge toheart transplantation. The patient, a 29-year-old, male had severe leftventricular failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. The heart failure hadprogressively worsened and showed severely reduced wall motion of the leftventricle with fraction shortening of 0.03. His cardiac catheterization data with7 r of dopamine infusion was as follows; RA(12), RV46/9EDP(12), PA(w)(31),cardiac Index 1.73 l/min/cm2. Novacor implantation was performed on March 11th,1996. After the implantation the patient was extubated on day 3 and recoveredrapidly. No complications, such as bleeding or thromboembolic episodes were seen.The patient was flown to the USA for cardiac transplantation on 24th, September, 1996. During the 11-hour flight from Narita to Los Angeles, he experienced noadverse effects. The patient underwent a successful cardiac transplant at UCLAMedical Center. His post-operative course was uneventful. We believe that either chronic circulatory support or the bridge to transplant using Novacor LVAS willbe a significant breakthrough for the treatment of Japanese patients withseverely deteriorated cardiomyopathy.
