This study aimed to determine the preoperative risk factors for severe rightheart failure needing biventricular mechanical circulatory support in childrenwith end-stage heart failure.METHODS: We reviewed data from 84 children supported with long-term VADs at theGerman Heart Institute Berlin between January 1999 and October 2010. Rightventricular assist device (RVAD) support was needed for 24 (29%) patients, andthe other 60 (71%) were implanted with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).RESULTS: The median age at implantation was 7 years (12 days-18 years), and themedian support time was 41 days (1-432 days). Of the 84 patients, the overallsurvival to transplantation or recovery of ventricular function was 69%. Comparedwith children implanted with LVAD, patients receiving biventricular support hadsignificantly higher postoperative mortality (P = 0.04). The multivariatelogistic regression indicated that decreased milrinone use was the onlypreoperative factor independently associated with increased requirement forbiventricular support (odds ratio: 0.1, 95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.64, P =0.01). Children treated with milrinone preoperatively showed improved survivalafter implantation (P = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric patients needing biventricular support had significantly higher postoperative mortality. Preoperative milrinone use might decrease therisk of severe right ventricular failure requiring additional RVAD insertion and improve postimplantation survival in children with advanced heart failure.
