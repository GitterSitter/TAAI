Previous research hasdemonstrated that insertion of the LVAD alone improves exercise capacity andquality of life (QOL). This study investigated whether supervised exercisetraining results in a further improvement.METHODS: This prospective, randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation,assessor blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis investigated the effect ofexercise training on exercise capacity and QOL in 14 patients who underwent LVAD insertion as a bridge to heart transplantation. Exercise training consisted of 8 weeks of gym-based aerobic and strengthening exercises 3 times a week, with aprogressive mobilization program, compared with the control group that completed mobilization alone. Exercise capacity was measured before and after theintervention using maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 6-minute walkdistance (6MWD). QOL was measured using the Short Form 36-item assessment.RESULTS: No adverse events were reported. There was a trend toward greaterimprovement in peak oxygen consumption (Vo(2)), 6MWD, and QOL in the exercisegroup (n = 7) compared with the control group (n = 7); however, no significantbetween-group difference was detected for improvements in peak Vo(2) [meandifference (exercise--control)] of 2.96 ml/kg/min (95% confidence interval, -1.04to 6.97), 6MWD at 54 meters (-51 to 159 meters), and QOL scores over time (p >0.05).CONCLUSION: Exercise training is feasible and safe in patients with a LVAD.Trends toward greater improvement in exercise capacity and QOL after exercisetraining warrant further investigation in a larger trial.Crown Copyright Â© 2012.
