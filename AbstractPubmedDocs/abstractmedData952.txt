Baseline dyssynchrony was evaluated by four speckle tracking strain methods; radial, circumferential, transverse, and longitudinal (>or =130 ms opposing wall delay for each). Pre-specified outcome variables were EFresponse and three serious long-term events: death, transplant, or leftventricular assist device. Of 120 patients (91%) with baseline dyssynchrony data,both short-axis radial strain and transverse strain from apical views wereassociated with favourable EF response 7 +/- 4 months and long-term outcome over 3.5 years (P < 0.01). Radial strain had the highest sensitivity at 86% forpredicting EF response with a specificity of 67%. Serious long-term unfavourable events occurred in 20 patients after CRT, and happened three times morefrequently in those who lacked baseline radial or transverse dyssynchrony than inpatients with dyssynchrony (P < 0.01). Patients who lacked both radial andtransverse dyssynchrony had unfavourable clinical events occur in 53%, incontrast to events occurring in 12% if baseline dyssynchrony was present (P <0.01). Circumferential and longitudinal strains predicted response whendyssynchrony was detected, but failed to identify dyssynchrony in one-third ofpatients who responded to CRT.CONCLUSION: Dyssynchrony by speckle-tracking echocardiography using radial andtransverse strains is associated with EF response and long-term outcome followingCRT.PMCID: PMC2903716
