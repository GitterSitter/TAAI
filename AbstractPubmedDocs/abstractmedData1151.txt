Interventions. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, internaljugular vein repair, Berlin Heart mechanical circulatory support, hearttransplantation, cardiac catheterization.OUTCOME MEASURES: Following surgical repair, the internal jugular vein wasstudied with bedside ultrasound for assessment of patency. When appropriate,subsequent vascular access of the vessel was attempted and the success wasreported.RESULTS: Follow-up ultrasound examination demonstrated vessel patency in allcases. In patients requiring subsequent catheterization (3/4), successful vessel entry and catheterization were performed.CONCLUSIONS: Repair of the internal jugular vein following use for short-termextracorporeal membrane oxygenation support can be accomplished with success. Thevessel can be used for subsequent vascular access when necessary.
