The patient responded to myocardial rest on a biventricularassist device, as well as immunosuppression that included eradication of T cells using OKT3 therapy, coupled with high-dose steroids. The patient was successfullyweaned off mechanical support, and ultimately discharged home, where he continuesto do well. Based on a review of the clinical and experimental literature, webelieve treatment with T-lymphocytic cytolytic therapy may be beneficial. Furtherstudies using this therapy in the treatment of GCM are warranted.
