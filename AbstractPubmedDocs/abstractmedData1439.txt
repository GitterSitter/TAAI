VADs arepowered pneumatically or electrically. Pneumatic and electric left ventricularassist devices (LVADs) and biventricular assist devices (BiVADs) provideexcellent hemodynamic support at rest, but differences in their effects onexercise tolerance are unclear. We sought to evaluate the effect of devices with varying operating parameters on exercise capacity.METHODS: Exercise physiology data obtained during maximal exercise with on-linegas-exchange analysis were collected for 38 consecutive VAD-implanted HF patientsreferred for exercise testing.RESULTS: Electric LVADs were implanted in 18 patients, and pneumatic LVADs in 10 patients. Percent of predicted peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO2%) wassignificantly greater in pneumatic LVAD patients (52.1 +/- 11.1% vs 38.2 +/-11.3%, p < 0.05). The 10 patients implanted with a pneumatically powered LVADwere compared to 10 patients implanted with a pneumatically powered BiVAD.LVAD-supported patients had a higher VO2% (52.1 +/- 11.1% vs 36.5 +/- 17.7%, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: HF patients supported with a pneumatic LVAD appear to have betterexercise tolerance than those receiving an electric LVAD. Patients on LVADsupport have better exercise tolerance than BiVAD-supported patients. Thishighlights the importance of right ventricular function to exercise tolerance in HF patients, and may have implications for future VAD design.
