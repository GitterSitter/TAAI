The Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatrics is utilized at our center as abridge to transplantation or bridge to recovery. This retrospective study reviewsour results regarding the safety of long-term support and outcome. Methods.Between January 2008 and December 2010, 12 patients (6 females and 6 males)underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device. The median weight was 14.2kg (range 4.2-51.6 kg) and the median age was 4.12 years (range 0.25-11.83years). All patients were on inotropes, five patients required mechanicalventilation and three patients experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation.Results. Eight patients received a left ventricular assist device and fourpatients received a biventricular assist device. Of the 12 patients, 8 werebridge to heart transplantation, in 2 patients explantation was possible, and 1patient died on support. The median support time for these 11 patients was 151days (range 4-488 days), with 2124 days of cardiac support. One patient is onsupport. Survival rate was 91.6%. Seven patients had a blood pump change once.Four patients had local signs of infection. There was no mediastinitis andthromboembolism. One patient had intracerebral hemorrhage. There was no deathafter heart transplantation or after explantation of the device. Conclusions. TheBerlin Heart EXCOR is effective in bridging children of almost all ages and sizesto cardiac transplantation or myocardial recovery. Our experience proved thatlong-term support is possible with a low rate of adverse events.
