While significant rates of infectionhave been reported in patients with pulsatile device support, incidence andoutcomes of this complication for the continuous-flow device patients remainunknown.METHODS: Between June 2005 and August 2009, 81 patients were implanted withcontinuous-flow LVADs at Washington University School of Medicine either asbridge to transplantation or as destination therapy. Outcomes of this studyincluded incidence of postimplantation infection, types of infection,microbiologic profile, and association of postimplantation infections withclinical endpoints.RESULTS: Forty-two patients (51.9%) had at least one type of infection oncontinuous-flow LVAD support with a mean follow-up period of 9.2 ± 9.2 months.Patients who had an infection on LVAD support had a significantly prolongedhospital stay (37.9 ± 32.0 versus 20.7 ± 23.0 days, p = 0.008) and a trend towardincreased mortality (33.1% versus 18.7% at 2 years, respectively, log rank p =0.102) compared with patients who did not. Subgroup analysis revealed thatpostimplantation sepsis was significantly associated with increased mortality in the continuous-flow LVAD cohort (61.9% versus 18.0% at 2 years, respectively, in septic and nonseptic patients, log rank p = 0.001). The majority of the sepsiscases occurred before hospital discharge, whereas most of the device relatedinfections occurred after discharge. Resistant Staphylococcus and Pseudomonasspecies were the most common pathogens leading to device- and nondevice-relatedlocal infections. Development of driveline or pocket infection had no effect onsurvival in patients with continuous-flow assist device support (p = 0.193).CONCLUSIONS: Even though better clinical outcomes have been achieved with thenewer generation continuous-flow devices, infection complications-in particularsepsis-are still a major risk for patients with continuous-flow LVADimplantation. Prevention strategies with aggressive medical and surgicalmanagement of infections may increase survival and decrease morbidity amongcontinuous-flow LVAD patients.Copyright © 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
