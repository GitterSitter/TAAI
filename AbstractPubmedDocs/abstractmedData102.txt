Although results reported have been excellent, older recipients and donors associated with significant comorbidities are now therule rather than the exception. Moreover, heart failure has become a significant public health problem with a growing population of patients in countries unableto answer the demand for transplantation. An emerging answer to this dilemmacomes from results reported with the use of continuous flow pumps where patientsurvival approaches 80% one and 2 years after implantation in selected patients. Is it time to triage patients to continuous flow pumps? Should we recommendcontinuous flow pump implantations in patients with various comorbidities, andoffer transplantation to a selected group of patients who will reach thelong-term benefit of the procedure?Copyright © 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
