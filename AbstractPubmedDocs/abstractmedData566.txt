There are no data specifically examining its late effects onpatients undergoing implantation with a ventricular assist device (VAD).METHODS: Between October 1996 and October 2010, 364 patients underwent primaryVAD implant and DSC was utilized in 184 (51%) patients for coagulopathy (n = 155;84%), hemodynamic instability (n = 103; 56%), isolated right ventriculardysfunction (n = 15; 8%) or unspecified reasons (n = 17; 9%).RESULTS: Median duration of DSC was 1 day (range 1 to 7 days). Patients with DSC were older (54.5 vs. 50.3 years, p = 0.002), had a higher incidence of previoussternotomy (42% vs. 28%, p = 0.005), pre-operative intra-aortic balloon pump (50%vs. 30%, p < 0.001), pre-operative temporary extracorporeal mechanicalcirculatory support (23% vs 10%, p < 0.001), lower platelet counts (171,000 vs.209,000, p < 0.001) and lower hematocrit levels (32% vs. 36%, p < 0.001).Operative (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.65) or late (2 years; 66 ± 7% vs 66 ± 7%, p = 0.720)mortality; composite incidence of mediastinitis, percutaneous drive-lineinfection, pocket infection and VAD-related endocarditis (15% vs. 16%, p = 0.79);re-exploration for bleeding (18% vs. 18%, p = 0.99); urgent transplantation forinfection (4% vs. 3%, p = 0.99); or need for device exchange (9% vs. 10%, p =0.16) was not increased after DSC when compared with immediate sternal closure.DSC increased ICU stay (10 vs. 5 days, p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: DSC was performed most commonly for coagulopathy and/or hemodynamic instability, and patients were older with a greater severity of illness as shown by the higher incidence of right-sided circulatory failure and history of priorsternotomy. Although DSC was associated with longer ICU stay, DSC was notassociated with a significantly increased risk of death or infection.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
