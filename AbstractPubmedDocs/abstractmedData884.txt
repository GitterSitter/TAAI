In the case ofrefractory LCO, extra corporeal life support (ECLS) extra corporeal membraneoxygenation (ECMO) or ventricle assist devices (VAD) is the final therapeuticoption. In the present study we have reviewed the outcomes of pediatric patients after corrective surgery necessitating ECLS and compared outcomes with pediatric patients necessitating ECLS because of dilatated cardiomyopathy (DCM).METHODS: A retrospective single-centre cohort study was evaluated in pediatricpatients, between 1991 and 2008, that required ECLS. A total of 48 patientsreceived ECLS, of which 23 were male and 25 female. The indications for ECLSincluded CHD in 32 patients and DCM in 16 patients.RESULTS: The mean age was 1.2 ± 3.9 years for CHD patients and 10.4 ± 5.8 yearsfor DCM patients. Twenty-six patients received ECMO and 22 patients received VAD.A total of 15 patients out of 48 survived, 8 were discharged after myocardialrecovery and 7 were discharged after successful heart transplantation. Theoverall mortality in patients with extracorporeal life support was 68%.CONCLUSION: Although the use of ECLS shows a significantly high mortality rate itremains the ultimate chance for children. For better results, ECLS should beinitiated in the operating room or shortly thereafter. Bridge to hearttransplantation should be considered if there is no improvement in cardiacfunction to avoid irreversible multiorgan failure (MFO).PMCID: PMC2993705
