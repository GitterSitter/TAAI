These designcharacteristics should make the HeartMate II more reliable and durable andbroaden the eligible population base. We implanted the HeartMate II in 43patients (average age, 42 yr). The indication for use was bridge-to-hearttransplantation in 26 patients and destination therapy in 17. The averageduration of device support was 258 days (range, 1-761 days), and cumulativeduration, more than 31 patient-years. Hemodynamic function improved in allpatients during support. By 48 hours after implantation, the mean cardiac indexhad increased from 1.9+/-0.27 L/(min.m(2)) (baseline) to 3.5+/-0.8 L/(min.m(2)), and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure had decreased from 24.8+/-11 mmHg to18.5+/-5.3 mmHg. Of the 43 patients, 35 were discharged from the hospital.Support is ongoing in 27 patients (longest duration, >700 days). Nine patientsdied during support. Four patients had sufficient heart recovery to undergo pump explantation. Three patients underwent transplantation. One patient underwentdevice replacement after the pump driveline was fractured in a skateboardingaccident; the device was removed in another patient because of a pump-pocketinfection after 749 days of support. Of the 10 patients in whom the HeartMate II replaced a failed HeartMate I, 8 were discharged from the hospital. We have seen excellent results with use of the HeartMate II. Functional status and quality of life have greatly improved in patients who survived the perioperative period.PMCID: PMC1995046
