Postoperatively the patient suffered postcardiotomy failure. Despite prolonged reperfusion and other methods of circulatory support, the patient could not be weaned from cardiopulmonarybypass (CPB). Therefore, an Impella intravascular flow pump was implanted, which is technically easy and has good weaning attributes. For implantation, a vascularprosthesis was sewn to the ascending aorta and the microaxial flow pump wasplaced under echocardiographic guidance across the pulmonary autograft into theleft ventricle. With this support, the patient could be weaned from CPB. Thereport evaluates the Impella microaxial hemopump as a device that is technically easy to implant with no injury to the pulmonary autograft in patients after Ross operation. Surgeons should consider the device as a short-term support inborderline indications.
