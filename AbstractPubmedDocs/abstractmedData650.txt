We review the incidence and outcomes of post-transplant MCS in ourinstitution.METHODS: MCS was classified as early (<1 month since transplant) or late (>1month since transplant) and the support offered was either veno-arterialextra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) or a ventricular assist device(VAD). From 2003 to the present, 100 children (<16 years) underwent OHTx. Fifteen(15%) had 17 episodes of MCS. MCS was instituted early in 10 and late in sevenepisodes. Two children required two episodes of support. VA-ECMO was used in 12episodes (71%). Two children required VAD support alone (12%). In three (17%)episodes ECMO was subsequently converted from VAD.RESULTS: Among 10 children with early failure, eight were successfully weanedfrom support with recovery of graft function. In the late failure group, three ofsix patients died. All but four patients underwent re-transplantation with noperioperative deaths. Overall survival to discharge was 66%. The early failuregroup shows a better survival rate to hospital discharge compared with the latefailure group (78 vs 50%; P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of post-transplant MCS for graft failure in ourpatients was 15%. Early graft failure has a better outcome than late failure.Re-transplantation has good mid-term outcomes in children. A stepwise approachwith a multimodality MCS strategy improves survival in this group of patients.
