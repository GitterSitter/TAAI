Ann Surg. 1991 Oct;214(4):471-6; discussion 476-7.Evolving experience with mechanical circulatory support.Kormos RL(1), Borovetz HS, Armitage JM, Hardesty RL, Marrone GC, Griffith BP.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15261.Since 1985 total mechanical circulatory support for mortally ill transplantcandidates has been progressively integrated into the authors' program. Duringthis period 379 patients underwent transplantation. Of this group of patients, 62required some form of mechanical support other than the intra-aortic balloonpump. Because intra-aortic balloon pump assist was limited in therapeutic effect and was associated with patient immobility and line-related sepsis, the nextlogical step toward support was the artificial heart. Of 20 patients implantedwith the Jarvik heart, 17 underwent transplantation, but only 9 of these survivedto discharge. In 1988, the authors abandoned the preferential use of the totalartificial heart because of excessive cumulative probability of death from wound infection. They began to use the Novacor electrical assist device with thepercutaneous power cord because they believed that univentricular support wouldbe adequate for most patients, because its heterotopic position would reduce the likelihood of infection, and because it had the potential for chronicimplantation. Twenty-three patients with biventricular failure (right ventricularejection fraction less than 20%, 18/23) received the electrical assist device foran average of 50.4 days (range 1-193 days). All 17 transplanted patients surviveduntil discharge. Only one of the five deaths that occurred after implantation,but without transplantation, was due to infection (candidiasis). Remarkably, all patients who survived the perioperative period ultimately survived withuniventricular support alone. Based on this experience, survival of mechanically supported patients is now comparable to that of those less mortally ill.PMCID: PMC1358550
