Over the past decade, left ventricular assist devices have been shown to improve thesurvival and quality of life. However, it is quite clear that very sick patients do not do as well, and it is therefore imperative to select patients at theproper time. In this article, we review both the indications for considering leftventricular assist device therapy as well as discuss the considerations andtherapy that should be done pre-operatively to possibly improve post-insertionoutcomes.
