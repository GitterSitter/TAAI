Despite significant progress in treatment strategies,the prognosis of heart failure patients remains poor. The golden standardtreatment for heart failure is heart transplantation after failure of medicaltherapy, surgery and/or cardiac resynchronisation therapy. In order to improvepatients' outcome and quality of life, new emerging treatment modalities arecurrently being investigated, including mechanical cardiac support devices, ofwhich the left ventricular assist device is the most promising treatment option. Structured care for heart failure patients according to the most recentinternational heart failure guidelines may further contribute to optimaldecision-making. This article will review the conventional and novel treatmentmodalities of heart failure.PMCID: PMC3303031
