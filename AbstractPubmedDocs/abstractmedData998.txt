The patient underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation 2 yearsearlier, and presented to our hospital with allograft failure 7 days afternon-compliance with tacrolimus. Because of persistent cardiogenic shock despiteintra-aortic balloon and inotropic support, we implanted an Impella 2.5percutaneous assist device for left ventricular support. Persistent rightventricular dysfunction necessitated insertion of a TandemHeart for rightventricular support. After a course of intravenous solumedrol and anti-thymocyte globulin, both the Impella and TandemHeart devices were successfully weaned andremoved. Nine months later, his left ventricular ejection fraction had stabilizedfrom 10% to 55%.Copyright (c) 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
