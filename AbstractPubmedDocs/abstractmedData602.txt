Both temporary and permanent mechanical supporthas been gaining wide clinical application in this patient population. Althoughmechanical circulatory support technology is rapidly evolving, this approach isassociated with multiple issues such as the optimal duration of temporarysupport, ideal timing to bridge these patients to a long-term device, andselection of the right device for the right patient. The currently availabledevices are categorized into two major groups: temporary and long-term devices(including destination therapy). Heart failure is a dynamic condition, and thetherapeutic approach may need to be modified depending on the patient'scondition. Furthermore, the patient's preexisting morbidity, age, socioeconomicstatus, and family support are confounding factors that need to be consideredwhen making such decisions. Clinical trials including prospective studies, aswell as meticulous analysis of existing data, may help develop universalguidelines to select the right device. This manuscript will review the mostwidely used ventricular assist devices.
