Whatare the appropriate indications for use and timing considerations for long-termVAD therapy in patients who qualify for transplant but are unlikely to obtain adonor? The authors suggest that VAD implantation for the indication of"maintenance therapy" where patients must remain on the VAD for two years before becoming transplant eligible, would constitute an appropriate clinical avenue to study these issues.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.
