We evaluated echocardiographic parametersassociated with adverse outcomes in this population.METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) before continuous-flow LVADimplantation were analyzed in 109 patients. Twenty-six 2-dimensional and Doppler parameters were assessed for their association with the primary outcome of 30-dayRVF, defined as a requirement of an RV assist device or ≥ 14 consecutive days of inotropic support, and the secondary composite outcome of 30-day death or RVF.Multivariate analysis adjusted for known clinical risk prediction models wasperformed.RESULTS: Overall, 25 (22.9%) and 27 (24.8%) patients reached the primary andsecondary end-points, respectively. An increased RV/LV diameter ratio was theonly TTE variable independently associated with both the primary (odds ratio [OR]= 5.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.40 to 12.40; p = 0.012) and secondary (OR = 2.70; 95% CI 1.06 to 6.22; p = 0.03) outcomes after multivariate analysis.Scatterplot analysis with regression determined the optimal cut-off value forRV/LV diameter to be 0.75. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, an increased RV/LV diameter ratio provided an additional predictive value toclinical risk scores.CONCLUSIONS: A TTE-measured RV/LV diameter ratio of ≥0.75 is independentlyassociated with a higher risk for RVF in patients with continuous-flow LVAD. Whenused alone, this simple, easily derived, practical echocardiographic measurement has a predictive value equivalent to known clinical risk scores, whereas theircombination provides stronger risk prediction for adverse outcomes.Copyright © 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
