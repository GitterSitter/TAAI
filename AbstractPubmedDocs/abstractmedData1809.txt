Its low cost and potential forinsertion without cardiopulmonary bypass make it an attractive option.METHODS: Nineteen status I patients failing inotropic support were treated withthe BVS 5000i with the intention of short-term bridge to transplant. Fourteenpatients received left ventricular support whereas 5 received biventricularsupport. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used in less than 50% of patients.RESULTS: Median support time was 7 days. The 2 myocarditis patients were weanedfrom support. Twelve patients were transplanted and there were 5 deaths onsupport. Overall 14 of 19 were transplanted or weaned. One-year survival was 79%.Median hospital stay was 31 days.CONCLUSIONS: The BVS 5000i can be used for short-term mechanical assist towardtransplantation in selected patients for whom a donor can be expected soon. Thedevice may provide a cost-effective, short-term strategy to optimize end-organfunction before orthotopic heart transplant, particularly for patients who arepredictably not ideal to be discharged with implantable left ventricular assistdevice treatment.
