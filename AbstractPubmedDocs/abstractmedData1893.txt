Inpatients with prolonged mechanical support, structural failure of the leftventricular assist device inflow valve can cause regurgitation into the leftventricle, which may affect adversely this process.METHODS: Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-volume relation of heartsexplanted from 8 patients with left ventricular assist device and 8 controlsubjects with idiopathic cardiomyopathy was determined ex vivo at the time oftransplantation.RESULTS: Duration of mechanical support ranged from 210 to 276 days (mean +/-standard deviation = 283 +/- 76 days) in 3 patients with inflow valveregurgitation versus 100 to 155 days (132 +/- 22 days) in 5 patients without (p =0.005). The end-diastolic pressure-volume relation of all hearts supportedmechanically was shifted to the left toward normal controls. This effect wasmarkedly attenuated in patients with inflow valve regurgitation.CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical assistance can cause reverse remodeling in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy as evidenced by the shift in the end-diastolicpressure-volume relation curve to the left. Inflow valve failure, associated withprolonged support, can attenuate changes in left ventricular structure anddimension. Ineffective pressure and volume unloading may explain theseobservations.
