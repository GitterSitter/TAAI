As more children are placed on mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to transplant, the risk factors for development of sensitization warrant further study. A single-centerretrospective review of 36 children who received MCS identified 22 patientssupported with either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (n = 15) orECMO-ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 7) with paired (pre-MCS/post-MCS) panelreactive antibodies (PRA) or only negative post-MCS PRAs. Four patients (18%)became sensitized post-MCS (one ECMO-only patient, three ECMO-VAD patients). Nodifference was found between sensitized and nonsensitized patients in terms ofcongenital heart disease versus primary cardiomyopathy (p = 0.096), duration ofMCS (38 days vs. 14 days, p = 0.233), or volume of blood product transfusions(358.6 ml/kg vs. 612.7 ml/kg, p = not significant). By multivariable analysis,the association of sensitization with older age at MCS (p = 0.076) and history ofhomograft (p = 0.064) approached significance. Pediatric patients supported with MCS are at low risk of developing HLA sensitization. Diagnosis, MCS duration, andvolume of transfused blood products do not appear to be associated with HLAsensitization, but there is a suggestion of an association with older age at MCS and history of a homograft.
