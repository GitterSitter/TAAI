While less common in adolescents, fulminant heart failuremay be rapidly fatal in these patients unless circulatory support can beinstituted.OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcomes and the utility of mechanical circulatoryassist devices for children.METHODS: A retrospective review of pediatric patients (18 years of age oryounger) who underwent circulatory support at the Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa,Ontario, from 1992 to 2001 was performed using chart audits.RESULTS: Seven patients (four boys, three girls) with a mean age of 14.9 +/- 0.9 years were supported with Thoratec ventricular assist devices (n=6) or aCardioWest total artificial heart (n=1). Preoperatively, the cardiac index was1.64 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2 on one or two inotropes with ejection fractions of 11 +/-2.2%. Mean duration of circulatory support was 59.3 +/- 17.2 days with a hospitallength of stay of 89.6 +/- 12.8 days. All seven patients underwent successfultransplantation and were discharged home.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with fulminant heart failure may be bridged tocardiac transplant successfully with mechanical circulatory support devices.
