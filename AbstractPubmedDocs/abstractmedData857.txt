Pre-existing native aortic insufficiency, aortic valveincompetence acquired during support, as well as previously placed prostheticaortic valves present unique problems for these patients.METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed data for 28 patients who underwent leftventricular outflow tract closure associated with HeartMate I (n =12) andHeartMate II (n = 16) LVAD insertion or exchange. Indications for valve closure, surgical technique, LVAD function, survival rates and complications wereretrospectively analyzed. Survival rates were compared with those of HeartMateLVAD patients (n = 104) who did not undergo aortic valve closure.RESULTS: Indications for closure included native aortic valve insufficiency (10patients), aortic valve deterioration after prolonged LVAD support (8 patients)and previously placed mechanical (9 patients) or bioprosthetic aortic prostheses (1 patient). There were 2 operative and 5 late deaths (mean 227 dayspost-operatively). Of the deaths, none were due to aortic valve closure.Actuarial survival was 78% at 1 year and 53% at 3 years, which was statistically better than for our patients with an intact aortic outflow (61% at 1 year, 45% at3 years; p < 0.05). Five patients had transplants, 1 patient was successfullybridged to recovery, and 15 patients remain on LVAD support. No patient withoutflow closure developed regurgitation, embolization or compromised LVADsupport.CONCLUSION: Outflow tract closure in LVAD-supported patients is safe, oftennecessary and well tolerated.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
