Throughout the 1970s, cardiovascular research aimed to achievelong-term circulatory support with such devices; later, as improved medicaltherapy decreased patients' chances of organ rejection or infection,transplantation became a viable alternative for the treatment of heart failure.At that point, left ventricular assist devices began to be used as bridges totransplantation. As left ventricular assist devices were used for longer periods of time, we realized that the ventricular function and overall health of thepatients awaiting transplant improved. Used as a bridge to transplantation, left ventricular assist devices often increased a patient's chances of survival andrecovery. Recently left ventricular assist devices have been used as bridges topartial left ventriculectomy (the Batista procedure). Our early experiences with this procedure in selected patients have been promising. Many patients recover toNYHA functional class I after prolonged left ventricular unloading, surgery, orboth. In addition, the native heart may be saved, especially in younger patients,eliminating the need for transplantations and decreasing the strain on thelimited organ donor pool.
