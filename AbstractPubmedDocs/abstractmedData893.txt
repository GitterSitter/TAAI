We studied229 consecutive class III to IV heart failure patients with ejection fraction ≤35and QRS duration ≥120 milliseconds for CRT. Dyssynchrony before CRT was definedas tissue Doppler velocity opposing-wall delay ≥65 milliseconds, 12-site SD (YuIndex) ≥32 milliseconds, speckle tracking radial strain anteroseptal-to-posteriorwall delay ≥130 milliseconds, or pulsed Doppler interventricular mechanical delay≥40 milliseconds. Outcome was defined as freedom from death, hearttransplantation, or left ventricular assist device implantation. Of 210 patients (89) with dyssynchrony data available, there were 62 events: 47 deaths, 9transplantations, and 6 left ventricular assist device implantations over 4years. Event-free survival was associated with Yu Index (P=0.003), speckletracking radial strain (P=0.003), and interventricular mechanical delay(P=0.019). When adjusted for confounding baseline variables of ischemic originand QRS duration, Yu Index and radial strain dyssynchrony remained independently associated with outcome (P<0.05). Lack of radial dyssynchrony was particularlyassociated with unfavorable outcome in those with QRS duration of 120 to 150milliseconds (P=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: The absence of echocardiographic dyssynchrony was associated withsignificantly less favorable event-free survival after CRT. Patients withnarrower QRS duration who lacked dyssynchrony had the least favorable long-termoutcome. These observations support the relationship of dyssynchrony and CRTresponse.PMCID: PMC3058421
