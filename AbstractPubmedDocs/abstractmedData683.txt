Part 2: Role of mechanical circulatory support.Westaby S(1), Anastasiadis K, Wieselthaler GM.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headley Way,Headington, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK. swestaby@ahf.org.ukThis Review explores contemporary circulatory support in profound postinfarction cardiogenic shock. Frequently, death is the only alternative to implantation of ablood pump, so prospective randomized trials of device versus medical treatmentare unacceptable and evidence is derived from clinical experience. Irrespectiveof ACC/AHA and European guidelines, no study has shown survival benefit for theintra-aortic balloon pump in patients with established shock. In the past 10years, the safety and durability of mechanical blood pumps has improvedconsiderably. New temporary and long-term rotary pumps have transformed outcomes for patients with acute heart failure. For urgent resuscitation, outreachsalvage, and transportation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is areliable, but time limited, first step. ECMO decompresses the venous system,provides flow, and ensures oxygenation, but does not unload the failing leftventricle. Myocardial stunning takes days, and sometimes weeks, to recover.Effective ventricular unloading is best achieved by surgical implantation of atemporary rotary or volume-displacement pump. After cardiopulmonaryresuscitation, hemodynamic stabilization allows assessment of cerebral injury andprognosis. Published series demonstrate that 50-75% of patients with profoundshock can be salvaged either through native heart recovery, urgenttransplantation, or switch to a long-term pump.
