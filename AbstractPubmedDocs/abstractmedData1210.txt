Major advancements in the medicaltherapy of HF, combined with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillatorsand cardiac resynchronization therapy, have substantially reduced the mortalityand morbidity of chronic HF, but mortality remains high, and the availability of donor hearts for transplantation is limited. Thus, there has been and continuesto be a need for alternative therapies to support the failing heart. Thedevelopment of mechanical pumps designed to assist or replace cardiac functionstarted three decades ago with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute'srequest for proposals to develop an artificial heart. Significant progress hasbeen made, with ventricular assist devices evolving from bulky extracorporealdevices to internalized miniaturized devices. Improvements in durability,thrombogenicity, ease of implantation, and patient selection have allowedexpanding indications for these devices.
