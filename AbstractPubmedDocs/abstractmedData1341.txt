Survival data were collected from chartreview.RESULTS: Inhaled nitric oxide was used to treat pulmonary and right ventricularfailure in patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT, n = 67),orthotopic lung transplantation (n = 45), cardiac surgery (n = 105), andventricular assist device placement (n = 66), and for hypoxemia in other surgery (n = 34) and medical patients (n = 59). Average follow-up was 2.9 +/- 1.0 years. Overall mortality was lowest when iNO was used after OHT (25.4%) and orthotopiclung transplantation (37.8%), intermediately after cardiac surgery (61%),ventricular assist device (62%), and other surgery patients (75%), and highestamong medical patients (90%; all p < 0.005). The cost of iNO therapy was lower intransplantation versus medical patients, with a trend toward shorter duration of use. In multivariate analysis, respiratory failure and use in non-OHT wereindependent predictors of mortality (both p = 0.001). A risk score greater than 1(score = non-OHT use 1, plus right ventricular failure 1) predicted a mortalityof 76.5% versus 37.2% (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Use of iNO for pulmonary hypertension in patients undergoing OHT andorthotopic lung transplantation was associated with a significantly lower overallmortality rate compared with its use after cardiac surgery or for hypoxemia inmedical patients. Inhaled nitric oxide does not appear to be cost effective when treating hypoxemia in medical patients with high-risk scores and irreversibledisease.
