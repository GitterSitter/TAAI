In the past mostly non-pulsatilesystems such as ECMO have been used to support pediatric patients with heartfailure for very limited periods of time. Only recently have miniaturizedpulsatile devices became available. This article describes the technicalcharacteristics of these devices which have been implanted at the DeutschesHerzzentrum Berlin since 1992. The Berlin Heart assist device has since been usedin 34 children between the ages of 6 days and 16 years. We report our strategy inpatient selection, perioperative care and subsequent heart transplantation. Thecurrent literature on mechanical circulatory support in children is reviewed.Copyright 1999 by W.B. Saunders Company
