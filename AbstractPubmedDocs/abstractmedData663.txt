A 9-year-old girl presented in cardiogenic shock complicated by an embolicstroke. Catheter-based thrombolysis partially reversed the neurologic deficit,but worsening cardiac failure prompted consideration of mechanical circulatorysupport (MCS). Limited available pericardial space, anticoagulation requirements,and thromboembolic potential favored the use of the HeartWare left ventricularassist device (HeartWare International, Inc, Framingham, MA). After deviceimplantation and intensive physical rehabilitation, the patient underwentsuccessful cardiac transplantation after 60 days of support.Copyright Â© 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
