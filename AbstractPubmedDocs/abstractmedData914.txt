The versatility of thedevice makes it ideal for pediatric patients because it can be tailored to thesize and needs of the patient. In this review, we will explore the broad range ofclinical applications of this device including bridge to cardiac transplantation,bridge to recovery, and bridge to bridge implantation where the need for cardiac transplantation may be unclear but long-term mechanical support may be required.
