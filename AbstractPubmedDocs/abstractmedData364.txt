Survival wasmodeled using the Kaplan-Meier method, and 2:1 propensity matching was used tocompare outcomes with a well-matched control cohort of nonbridged HTx recipients.RESULTS: Of the 803 small children who underwent HTx during the study period, 59 (7%) were bridged with a VAD. The proportion of recipients that were bridged witha VAD increased from 3% in 2004 to 9% in 2010 (p = 0.03). Kaplan-Meier 30-day,6-month, and 1-year survival was comparable between those bridged with a VAD and 118 well-matched nonbridged children. Rates of postoperative renal failure,reoperation, infection, and rejection were also comparable. Those bridged with a VAD had a significantly higher rate of postoperative stroke (8.5% vs 0.9%; p =0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Small children bridged to HTx with a VAD have early survival ratesthat are comparable to nonbridged children; however, this is achieved at theexpense of a higher rate of stroke. Identifying the risk factors for early death and stroke in small children bridged to HTx with VADs is prudent as moreexperience with this patient population accumulates.Copyright © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
