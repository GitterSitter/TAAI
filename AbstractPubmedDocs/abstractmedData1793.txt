The criteria forthe selection and management of these patients as applied at Muenster University Hospital are reviewed.METHODS: The study population consists of 631 patients referred to our center fortransplantation between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1996. Two hundredninety-seven patients were listed for transplantation and 157 were transplanted. Of 41 patients who underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device (n = 34,Novacor; n = 6, TCI HeartMate; n = 1, Medos), 39 received the device as a bridge to transplantation and 2 as permanent support. For the purpose of the analysis,the study population was divided into 3 groups (elective bridging, urgentbridging, emergency bridging) and compared with heart transplant candidates whodid not require mechanical circulatory assistance.RESULTS: Patients who underwent elective or urgent assist-device implantationwere younger and had greater hemodynamic compromise than the remainder ofpatients waiting for heart transplantation, as suggested by a higher functionalclass and lower mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, serum sodium, andpulmonary artery wedge pressure. Survival of patients who electively underwentimplantation of an assist device was better than that of patients who were stableon the waiting list and did not undergo heart transplantation during follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggests that earlier implantation of assist devicesmay facilitate resolution of organ dysfunction before heart transplantation.
