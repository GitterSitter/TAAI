In general, consideration for VAD implantationis appropriate in patients with endstage heart failure who are failing optimalmedical therapy and in whom no alternative traditional surgical treatment optionsare available. However, identifying when a particular patient has reached thispoint is not always straightforward. There are a broad range of medical andsurgical therapies for patients with overt heart failure, and this armamentarium is constantly expanding. The risks, benefits, and expected outcomes with VADtherapy have also undergone dramatic changes over the last decade. Advances intechnology have led to a proliferation of newer generation devices that aresmaller, lighter, easier to implant, and more reliable than previous generationdevices. This, in turn, has led to a markedly improved risk-benefit ratio, withincreased durability and reduced morbidity. The indications for the implantation of ventricular assist devices have also evolved over the last several years, and specific patient presentations and goals of therapy have led to specificindications. Device therapy has traditionally been classified as bridge torecovery, bridge to transplantation, and destination therapy. However, suchdesignations may not be well defined at the time of implantation, and recoveryand response following initiation of VAD support may allow patients to changefrom one classification to another. The current data regarding indications andtiming of device implantation are reviewed.
