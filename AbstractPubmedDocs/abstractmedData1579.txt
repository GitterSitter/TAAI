ASAIO J. 2003 Nov-Dec;49(6):748-50.Device related infections while on left ventricular assist device support do not adversely impact bridging to transplant or posttransplant survival.Morgan JA(1), Park Y, Oz MC, Naka Y.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, College ofPhysicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, Milstein Hospital 7GN-435, NewYork, NY 10032, USA.We conducted a retrospective review of our bridge to transplant experience overthe last 7 years using the Heartmate device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) bystudying patients who developed device related infections. Of the 174 patientswho underwent device implantation, 32 (18.4%) developed a device relatedinfection while on support (12 patients with drive line infections, 14 patientswith pocket infections, 4 patients with pump infections, and 2 patients withdevice endocarditis). There was no significant difference in rate of successfulbridging to transplant between patients with and without a device relatedinfection occurring in 23 (71.9%) patients with infection and 103 (72.5%)patients without infection (p = 0.406). In addition, posttransplant survival at1, 3, and 5 years was similar for both groups--95.6%, 86.2%, and 79.3%,respectively, for patients with infection, versus 90.9%, 88.1%, and 82.2%,respectively, for patients without infection (p = 0.911).
