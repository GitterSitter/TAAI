Can J Cardiol. 2005 Nov;21(13):1166-8.Left ventricular assist device: can Canada afford this?Carrier M(1).Author information: (1)Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Canada. michel.carrier@icm-mhi.orgHeart transplantation remains a limited option in the treatment of patients with end-stage heart failure because of the shortage of donors and the high incidence of heart failure disease in the Canadian population. The current use ofmechanical circulatory support systems is directed primarily at patients atimminent risk of death who are temporarily supported as a bridge to cardiactransplantation. Newer left ventricular assist devices, namely, the axial andcentrifugal flow pumps, are smarter and more compact devices. Although used asbridge to transplantation, these devices are now seriously considered to becomean option in the chronic treatment of patients with severe and unresponsivecongestive heart failure.
