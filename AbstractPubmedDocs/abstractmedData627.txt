Expansion of the donor pool requires an understanding of the impact onsurvival likely to result from extending one or more high risk factors. Use ofextended donor pool results in shorter waiting list times and limits themorbidity and mortality associated with long-term mechanical support needed tosupport diseased organs. In this report, we present one such example of expandingdonor pool in which a pediatric patient donated a solid organ after two hearttransplants and successful use of ECMO and VAD.Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
