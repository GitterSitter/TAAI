(2)Transplant Unit,Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK steven.tsui@papworth.nhs.uk.Advanced heart failure is a rare but important complication of hypertrophiccardiomyopathy (HCM). The only definitive treatment is heart transplantation and the role of ventricular assist devices remains uncertain. We describe the use of implantable biventricular assist devices in the treatment of a patient with'end-stage' non-dilated HCM.Â© The Author 2014.
