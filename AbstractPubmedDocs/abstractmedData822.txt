DeBakeyDepartment of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.The development of mechanical circulatory support devices for infants and smallchildren with heart failure has significantly lagged behind the development ofdevices for adults. In the United States, there was really very little activityfocused on the development and implementation of durable mechanical assistdevices for small children until the early part of this millennium. At present,the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device (Berlin Heart Inc.,The Woodlands, TX) is currently the only device available to provide long-termsupport to small children awaiting cardiac transplantation; this device is onlyavailable through either compassionate use solicitation or within the confines ofan ongoing investigation device exemption trial. There are several other devices being developed at this time, but it will be years before they are tested inclinical trials. In this article, we will review the current status of mechanicalcirculatory support devices and therapy strategies for infants and small childrenpresenting in acute heart failure.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.
