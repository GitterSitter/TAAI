There is a paucity of data, however, regarding the ability ofcontinuous flow (CF) pumps to adequately decompress the LV to induce similarreverse remodeling. We sought to evaluate the effects of CF-LVADs on LV reverseremodeling. From March 2006 through July 2011, one hundred patients with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of CF-LVAD (93 HeartMate II LVADs and seven HeartWare LVADs) as bridge-to-transplant (n = 68) and destination therapies (n = 32). Echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations were reviewedpreoperatively and at 1 and 6 months post-LVAD implantation. Mean age was 52.1 ± 12.1 years; etiology of heart failure was ischemic cardiomyopathy in 34 patients and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in 66 patients. Median LVAD support timewas 378.3 days; 371.5 days for patients who received bridge-to-transplant therapyand 422.2 days for patients who underwent destination therapy. Left ventricularend-diastolic dimension significantly decreased at 1 month post-LVAD implantationfrom 71.6 ± 12.4 to 58.3 ± 13.8 mm (p < 0.001). Severity of MR also significantlydecreased from 76.0% of patients having moderate or severe MR preoperatively to8.0% with moderate or severe MR at 1 month post-LVAD (p < 0.001). Thesereductions were maintained at 6 months. These data demonstrate the ability of aCF-LVAD to significantly decompress the LV, leading to significant reductions in LVEDD and severity of MR. This reverse remodeling was apparent in the earlypostoperative period and was sustained at 6 months. Further studies are warrantedto investigate whether this correlates with clinical LV recovery.
