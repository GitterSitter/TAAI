Wedescribe the use of a surgically implanted, percutaneous, continuous-flowcentrifugal pump (the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device) as partof a planned, pre-emptive approach for postcardiotomy support in a patient withsevere mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and biventricular failure. To our knowledge, this report documents the 1st use of a percutaneousventricular assist device as an elective support device in a patient undergoinghigh-risk mitral or tricuspid valve surgery.PMCID: PMC2170497
