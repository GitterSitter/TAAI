Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2013 Spring;25(1):56-63. doi:10.1053/j.semtcvs.2013.02.002.Current status of left ventricular assist device technology.Molina EJ(1), Boyce SW.Author information: (1)Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Program, Department of Cardiac Surgery, MedStar Heart Institute, MedStar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC20010, USA.The use of long-term left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has revolutionizedthe treatment of end-stage heart failure. The most significant advance in thisfield has been the longer durability of devices secondary to a simpler pumpdesign with fewer or no mechanical bearings and valves. Continuous-flow LVADshave recently been shown to provide safe and effective circulatory support andhave replaced the first-generation fill-to-empty devices. The Thoratec HeartMate II and the HeartWare HVAD are currently the 2 most commonly implanted LVADsworldwide. As LVAD technology moves forward and new miniaturized, more durable,and reliable pumps are being developed, the number of recipients who will benefitfrom this technology continues to grow. Elimination of the driveline with fullyimplantable pumps, implantation of miniature pumps with minimally invasivesurgical techniques, wireless data transmission, and improved patient selectionwill further transform this field in the next few years.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.
