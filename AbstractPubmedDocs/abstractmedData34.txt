However, there are only limited data on MV support among children after ventricular assist device(VAD) implantation. We report the duration of MV after VAD placement, indicationsfor respiratory support in the postimplantation period, and associated patientfactors.METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 43 consecutive children (aged <18 years) with end-stage heart failure who were supported with a VAD as a bridge to transplantation from January 2005 to December 2011. Multivariableanalysis was performed using the multiple Poisson regression model for theduration of MV.RESULTS: Overall, 33% (n = 14) remained on MV until heart transplant or death. Ofthose requiring pre-VAD extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, 63%(n = 12 of 19) remained on MV until heart transplant or death compared with 8%(n = 2 of 24) among those not on ECMO before VAD (p < 0.001). Patients withmoderate or severe mitral regurgitation while on VAD support had 1.7-times moreMV days compared with those with none or trivial on-VAD mitral regurgitation. In addition, previous support on ECMO, those with moderate or severe tricuspidregurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants had an increased risk ofprolonged MV.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VAD recipients previously supported onECMO, those with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, moderate or severetricuspid regurgitation, and those with only left VAD implants had an increasedrisk of prolonged MV. Future studies in larger cohorts are necessary to confirmthe findings from this single-institutional experience.Copyright © 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
