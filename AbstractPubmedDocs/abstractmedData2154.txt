J Biomater Appl. 1986 Jul;1(1):13-38.Restoring cardiac function: an emerging spectrum of therapeutic options.Kantrowitz A(1).Author information: (1)L.VAD, Inc./Surgical Research Laboratory, Sinai Hospital of Detroit, MI 48235.A spectrum of techniques for restoring cardiac function is emerging. Amongpatients with global congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiac transplantation may help a small minority for whom allografts are available; the total artificialheart may eventually benefit a larger number. For patients with left-sided CHF,parallel-assist techniques maximally augment cardiac output. In-series techniquescan help others without major arrhythmias and some residual cardiac output. Ascompared with parallel assist, in-series methods offer lesser hemodynamicaugmentation but greater intrinsic reliability and the possibility ofdeactivation of support for hours or days without increased risk. Additionaladvantages include simplicity of management and documented long-term clinicalefficacy.
