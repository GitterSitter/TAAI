All left ventricular assist devices wereimplanted as a bridge to transplantation with a very proactive program ofpromoting myocardial recovery. A total of 40 patients were bridged to recoveryand 52 to transplantation. Of the bridged to recovery (explanted) group, 33 were men (age, 32.8 ± 11.8 years), 37 had dilated cardiomyopathy (familial in 3,peripartum cardiomyopathy in 3) and 3 had myocarditis. Of the bridged totransplantation (transplanted) group, 42 were men (age, 42.3 ± 12.5 years; P <.0005 vs bridged to recovery). The diagnosis was ischemic heart disease in 24,dilated cardiomyopathy in 21 (only 13 received drug therapy), hypertrophicobstructive cardiomyopathy in 2, arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 2, myocarditis in 1, and congestive heart disease in 2.RESULTS: The survival rate was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%, 78.3, and 78.3%in the explanted and transplanted groups at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively. Intotal, 12 (23%) patients bridged transplantation either died from, or requiredventricular assist device support, for primary graft failure. Of the explantedpatients, 4 (10%) subsequently required transplantation at 34, 512, 1019, and1213 days (2 died 25 and 1867 days after transplantation and 2 were well after1523 and 3199 days). The rate of transplant or ventricular assist device-freesurvival less noncardiac death for the bridged to recovery and bridged totransplantation groups, respectively, was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%,78.3%, and 78.3% at 1, 3, and 7 years. At latest follow-up (1394 ± 1195 days for the bridged to recovery and 1913 ± 941 days for the bridged to transplantationgroup), 5 of the bridged to transplantation patients (9.6%) had malignancy, 34(65.4%) had hypercholesterolemia, 25 (48.1%) had hypertension, and 7 (13.5%) had coronary disease. The creatinine was 125.5 ± 43.5 vs 95.2 ± 16.5 μmol/L for thebridged to transplantation and bridged to recovery groups (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: The outcome after explantation for myocardial recovery iscomparable, if not better than, after bridge to transplantation.Copyright © 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
