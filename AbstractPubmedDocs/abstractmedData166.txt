Electronic address: erwan.flecher@chu-rennes.fr.Cardiac transplantation remains the gold standard for end stage heart failurehowever results of long-term mechanical circulatory support have dramaticallyimproved over the last 10years. One should now clearly consider a leftventricular assist device as bridge to transplant or destination therapy inrefractory isolated left heart failure. Mechanical biventricular support remains more challenging with lower survival and may be proposed as bridge to transplant.Correct patient's selection and appropriate follow-up are mandatory in suchcritical patients.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.
