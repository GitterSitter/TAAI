We hypothesized that descending thoracicaortomyoplasty with conditioned (fatigue-resistant) latissimus dorsi muscle couldprovide diastolic augmentation that would improve left ventricular function. Six mongrel dogs were studied. The left latissimus dorsi muscle was wrapped clockwisearound the descending thoracic aorta. Left ventricular volume was measured with aconductance catheter. Aortic and left ventricular pressures were measured with a micromanometer. The following were measured after descending thoracicaortomyoplasty at baseline and with the descending thoracic aortomyoplastystimulated 1:1 with the heart rate: stroke work, stroke volume, left ventricular peak pressure, maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure, diastolicrelaxation time constant, peak rate of pressure decay, left ventricularend-diastolic pressure, endocardial viability ratio, mean diastolic aorticpressure, peak diastolic aortic pressure, and time-averaged aortic diastolicvelocity. Before data collection, the latissimus dorsi was stimulated (5 pulsesdelivered at 33 Hz at a rate of 28 per minute for 4 weeks) with burst stimulationto induce fatigue resistance. Results (expressed as the mean +/- the standarderror of the mean) showed significant improvement in the indices of ventricularcontractility (maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure, 1,217 +/-83 to 1,414 +/- 91 mm Hg/s) and diastolic relaxation mechanics (peak rate ofpressure decay, 1,152 +/- 92 to 1,282 +/- 79 mm Hg/s; diastolic relaxation timeconstant, 43 +/- 2 to 38 +/- 2 ms). Significant differences were noted withstimulation at 1:1 in the endocardial viability ratio (0.90 +/- 0.05 to 1.14 +/- 0.04), an index of myocardial oxygen supply. Systemic diastolic pressures (peakdiastolic aortic pressure, 95 +/- 6 to 107 +/- 5 mm Hg; mean diastolic aorticpressure, 92 +/- 6 to 102 +/- 6 mm Hg) and the time-averaged aortic diastolicvelocity (1.5 +/- 0.6 to 3.3 +/- 1.0 m/s) increased significantly. We concludethat descending thoracic aortomyoplasty stimulation with conditioned latissimusdorsi muscle can improve indices of ventricular contractility, diastolicrelaxation mechanics, diastolic pressures, and diastolic aortic velocity in thenonfailed canine heart. Further studies with the chronic failed heart model arerequired.
