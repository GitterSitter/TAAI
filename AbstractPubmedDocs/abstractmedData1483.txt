Hereinwe present a 54-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy and dextrocardia withnormal position of the abdominal organs who presented with an exacerbation ofcongestive heart failure requiring inotropic support as well as mechanicalventilation. An implantable, wearable left ventricular assist device was placedin this patient to allow for ambulation and eventual discharge home. The patient survived 4 months before he developed pneumonia and expired.
