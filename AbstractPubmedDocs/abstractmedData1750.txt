Indeed, whenfirst used, ventricular assist devices were inserted to bridge patients unable tobe separated from cardiopulmonary bypass to eventual recovery. Many successeswith ventricular support systems have been recorded in individuals withpostcardiotomy cardiogenic shock, acute myocarditis, and in the periinfarctionperiod where stunning of potentially viable myocardial tissue contributed tosevere heart failure. From an experimental standpoint, recovery of myocytefunction and restoration of more normal myocardial geometry and constitution havebeen noted. There are many explanations for this, but principally, benefit isrelated to amelioration of circulatory insufficiency with attenuation ofperturbed humoral networks and reduction of myocardial wall stress. It isimportant to understand how ventricular assist device implantation in selectadvanced heart failure patients might precipitate recovery of depressedmyocardial function.
