How will it impact hospitals?[No authors listed]Although heart transplantation remains the most effective treatment for severeheart failure, there are far fewer donor hearts available than there are patientswho could benefit from them. One approach to addressing this shortfall is thetotal artificial heart, or TAH. To date, however, no TAH design has been able to achieve one of the ultimate goals of heart replacement: to allow a patient tolive a reasonably normal life without being connected to external machinery. Anew design, the AbioCor TAH developed by Abiomed Inc., may make this goalachievable. Thanks to a power system that transfers energy through the skinwithout the aid of wires, the AbioCor--currently undergoing clinical trials inthe United States--allows the patient to be completely mobile. The lack oftranscutaneous wires also eliminates the primary source of the infections thathave plagued TAH patients in the past. Though it is not without drawbacks, theAbioCor could represent a crucial advance in TAH technology. In this TechnologyOverview, we describe the operation of the AbioCor and discuss its likely impact on hospitals if it is approved for marketing in the United States. We alsodiscuss a related cardiac-support technology: ventricular assist devices (VADs), which may also be used for permanent cardiac support someday.
