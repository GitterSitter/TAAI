DeBakey Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, OneBaylor Plaza, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.Dilated cardiomyopathy is a cardiac disease of unknown origin which ischaracterized by the gradual development of cardiac failure associated withfour-chamber dilatation of the heart. Heart transplantation has been consideredas the last resort for this disease. However, some patients who received support with a ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge-to-transplantation and thenrecovered without transplantation have been reported. This new concept oftreating heart failure is termed bridge-to-recovery. A VAD can inhibit the heart failure compensatory mechanisms by extreme ventricular unloading. Also, heartfailure is a complex neurohormonal/autocrine-paracrine syndrome, and thesemechanisms consecutively lead to inflammatory response by proinflammatorycytokines; interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta),interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha). Furthermore, the existence of anti-beta1-adrenoceptor autoantibodies(A-beta1-AABs) in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy has been reported. These proinflammatory cytokines and this antibody accelerate a ventricular remodelingand a contractile dysfunction over the long term. Apheresis can also inhibit the vicious cycle in heart failure by removing the factors that are produced byactivated neurohormonal/autocrine-paracrine compensatory mechanisms. Therefore,we propose that the combined therapies, therapeutic VAD and therapeuticapheresis, will provide a prominent outcome for a patient who is suffering fromend-stage heart failure.
