Tex Heart Inst J. 2005;32(3):263-70.Echocardiographic evaluation of the Jarvik 2000 axial-flow LVAD.Stainback RF(1), Croitoru M, Hernandez A, Myers TJ, Wadia Y, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)The Department of Adult Cardiology, Texas Heart Institute, Houston, Texas77030, USA.From April 2000 through September 2001, we studied 11 patients with the Jarvik2000--a left ventricular assist device with an axial-flow pump that providescontinuous blood flow--to determine the echocardiographic characteristics. Allpatients underwent complete echocardiographic examination, includingoutflow-graft flow evaluation 24 hours after implantation and each monththereafter for the duration of support. Data were obtained at each pump setting(8000-12000 rpm in 1000-rpm increments) and with the pump off. Left ventriculardimensions and shortening fraction and the duration of aortic valve systolicopening decreased as pump speed increased. Although the aortic valve remainedclosed at higher pump speeds, pump outflow-graft flow remained pulsatile, becauseof the systolic thrust of the assisted ventricle. Systolic dominance of phasicflow was more pronounced at lower pump speeds, due to normalization of thediseased heart's Starling response. When the aortic valve was closedcontinuously, echocardiographic contrast (indicating blood stasis) was noted inthe aortic root. Because of the pump outflow graft's proximity to the chest wall,device output could be measured independently of cardiac contributions. Mean peakoutflow-graft flow velocities were 0.75 +/- 0.30 m/s (systolic) and 0.41 +/- 0.13 m/s (diastolic). When the pump was turned off briefly there was minimalregurgitation through the device into the left ventricle. This 1stechocardiographic heart function analysis of the Jarvik 2000 confirms that thedevice unloads the ventricle and increases cardiac output. Cardiac responses todevice-speed changes can be evaluated readily with echocardiography in the early and late postoperative period.PMCID: PMC1336693
