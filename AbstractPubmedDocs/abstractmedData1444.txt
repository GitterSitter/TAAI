ASAIO J. 2005 Jul-Aug;51(4):456-60.Left ventricular assist devices as bridge to heart transplantation in congestive heart failure with pulmonary hypertension.Haddad H(1), Elabbassi W, Moustafa S, Davies R, Mesana T, Hendry P, Masters R,Mussivand T.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ontario, Canada.Severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been considered a significantcontraindication to cardiac transplantation. Ongoing clinical experience,however, has shown that temporary support using left ventricular assist devices(LVADs) in these patients can result in significant reductions in PH. Acomprehensive review of the available literature regarding the use of LVADs inheart failure patients with PH was conducted. The existing literature to datesupports the use of LVADs in heart failure patients with PH and demonstrates thatsignificant reductions in PH in these patients can be achieved. This subsequentlyallows for safe and effective cardiac transplantation in patients who werepreviously excluded from this modality. For heart failure patients with severePH, the use of LVADs can provide significant benefits by significantly reducingPH and allowing subsequent staged transplantation.
