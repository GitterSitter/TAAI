We report the deployment and successful weaning from LVADin young children with severe heart failure (HF).DESIGN: From 2004--2009, 13 children suffering from HF were placed on LVAD. Allpresented with a dilated left ventricle (LV) with severely reduced contractility,secondary to myocarditis, atrial arrhythmia or idiopathic HF. This study reports their outcomes and longitudinal follow-up.RESULTS: Of 13 young children with HF (ages 1 month--6 years; mean 19.2 months)placed on LVAD: eight weaned to recovery and successful hospital discharge, onewas transplanted and four died. Echo follow-up in the weaned patients (mean age22.1 months) revealed significant improvements from pre-LVAD measurements: LVend-diastolic dimension (LVED) mean z-score decreased from +4.8 to +0.95 (P <.001); fractional shortening (FS %) improved from a mean of 9.3% to 33% (P <.001); and the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR) significantly improved (P <.05). Time to LVAD deployment from HF diagnosis was more likely to be less than30 days in the successfully weaned patients (100%) than patients who died or weretransplanted (20%); P = .007.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD support can be utilized as a bridge to recovery in youngchildren with HF. Following LVAD weaning, children sustain improvements in LVsize, function and degree of MR. LVAD deployment less than 30 days from HFdiagnosis improves the likelihood of successful weaning and illustrates thatchildren with acute etiologies of HF are more likely to achieve recovery.© 2011 Copyright the Authors.
