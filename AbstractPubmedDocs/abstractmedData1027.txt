With medical treatmentshampered by significant limitations, physicians caring for patients with advancedheart disease have turned to cardiac transplantation and durable mechanicalcirculatory assist devices as definitive therapies. These advanced therapeuticmodalities are not widely available outside the United States and Europe, butnevertheless offer enormous potential for patients in the Arab Gulf sufferingfrom end-stage heart failure. This review will discuss the management ofend-stage heart failure in the Gulf States, with an emphasis on therapies bestutilized within a framework of regional cooperation and coordination.PMCID: PMC2881434
