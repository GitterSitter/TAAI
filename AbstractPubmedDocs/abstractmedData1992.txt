One hundredthirty-nine patients were male and 33 were female with a mean age of 59.7 years. Reasons for support were postcardiotomy cardiac failure (129 patients), cardiacallograft failure (17 patients), bridge to transplantation (10 patients),resuscitation (7 patients), postpercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastyemergent (2 patients), and other (7 patients). Support was by left ventricularassist device in 108 patients, right ventricular assist device in 20 patients,and biventricular assist device in 44 patients. Eighty-four patients (48.8%) wereweaned from the ventricular assist device, and 88 patients (51.2%) were notweaned. Thirty-four patients (20.0%) were discharged from the hospital.Complications included coagulopathy, renal insufficiency/failure, respiratoryinsufficiency/failure, neurological deficits, sepsis, arrhythmias, anddevice-related complications. Overall causes of death were ventricular failure(55.1%), triage (13.0%), arrhythmias (9.4%), graft failure (5.9%), coagulopathy(4.3%), sepsis syndrome (2.9%), device-related (0.7%), and other (0.7%).BioMedicus centrifugal ventricular support can be implemented rapidly and easily.Device-related complications are few (1.2%), and it is relatively inexpensivewhen compared with other ventricular assist systems. This series demonstratesthat a substantial number of patients may benefit from temporary centrifugalventricular support.
