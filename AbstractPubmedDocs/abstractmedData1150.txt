KL2384@columbia.eduThe landmark Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance in the Treatment ofCongestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial demonstrated that the implantation ofleft ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as an alternative to hearttransplantation, or destination therapy (DT) is superior to any known medicaltherapy in patients with end-stage heart failure who are not eligible fortransplantation. In this article, we review results of the first United Statesand European clinical trials of DT, including the REMATCH, the Investigation ofthe Non-Transplant Eligible Patients who are Inotrope Dependent (INTREPID), andthe Clinical Utility Baseline Study (CUBS) trials, as well as the outcomes of thefirst DT implantations in the post-REMATCH era in the United States. The article summarizes the current state of knowledge and future directions in the field ofpermanent mechanical circulatory support therapy as an alternative to hearttransplantation.
