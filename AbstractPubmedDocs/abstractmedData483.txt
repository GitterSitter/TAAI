These patients have anincreased risk of developing heart failure. Implantation of a ventricular assist device may be the only therapeutic option for patients who are nottransplantation candidates. The technical aspects of implanting a mechanicaldevice into the RV have not been well described, however. We describe ourexperience with one such case and describe our operative strategy in obtainingoptimal placement of the inflow cannula.
