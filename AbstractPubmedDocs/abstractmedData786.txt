Epub2011 May 19.Validation of mortality risk stratification models for cardiovascular disease.Nakayama M(1), Osaki S, Shimokawa H.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School ofMedicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan. nakayama@cardio.med.tohoku.ac.jpRisk stratification models are effective tools for the management ofcardiovascular diseases. Although several risk scores have been proposed, therelevance and superiority of these predictive models have not been fullyvalidated in an independent and nonclinical trial-based population. We studied2,472 consecutive patients initially hospitalized in our institution from April2004 to December 2009. Risk scores were calculated for each patient using 4 risk score models, including the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), AcuteDecompensated Heart Failure National Registry regression model, the AmericanHeart Association Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure score, and theAssociation of Health Aging and Body Composition Heart Failure score. Thepredictive ability for the composite end point, including total death, hearttransplantation, and left ventricle assist device implantation, was assessed bycalculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for eachmodel. During the follow-up period after admission (median 924.5 days), thecombined end point occurred in 295 patients (11.8%), including 27 in-hospitaldeaths (1.1%). Compared with the other 3 risk score models, the SHFM risk scoredemonstrated a greater area under the curve for the combined end point at theoverall, in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up point (0.741 to0.890). The survival rate predicted by SHFM demonstrated an excellent correlationwith the actual survival rate (R(2) = 0.990). In conclusion, these resultssuggest that the SHFM risk score is the most suitable for the discrimination and calibration of mortality risk stratification in patients with cardiovasculardisease.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.
