J Biomater Appl. 1986 Jul;1(1):39-105.Thermedics' approach to ventricular support systems.Szycher M(1), Clay W, Gernes D, Sherman C.Author information: (1)Thermedics, Inc., Woburn, MA 01888-1799.Temporary and permanent ventricular assist systems, developed by Thermedics,Inc., are described, including rationale, design, operation and surgicalapplications. Clinical data are presented for pneumatically driven temporary leftventricular assist devices (LVAD). Usefulness of this device rests on theassumption that tissue of a weakened heart can recover if relieved for a time by an LVAD. The surgical implantation of an LVAD is reported in a case where thepatient later received a heart transplant. The concept and technology of thesubsystems of a permanent ventricular assist system (VAS), now ready forpreclinical trials, are discussed. Design of a low-speed, torque-motor drivenblood pump is described. Details are presented on transcutaneous energytransmission by means of a transformer, one of whose coils is embedded under the skin. Though less efficient than percutaneous transmission, the method eliminatesinfection risk. Special types of polyurethanes are analyzed in respect to theirbiocompatibility. It is concluded that flocking of the polyurethane surfaceallows the growth of a biological lining which is highly antithrombogenic.Sintered metal powders are found to be most efficient for fabrication of rigidpump components. A lenticular pump design is proposed to solve the problem ofpressure differentials in the sealed device. Cardiac endocrine functions arecited in support of using assist devices that leave the heart in place.
