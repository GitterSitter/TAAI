Epub 2011 Sep 28.Dofetilide reduces the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and implantablecardioverter defibrillator therapies.Baquero GA(1), Banchs JE, Depalma S, Young SK, Penny-Peterson ED, Samii SM,Wolbrette DL, Naccarelli GV, Gonzalez MD.Author information: (1)Heart & Vascular Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey,Pennsylvania, USA.BACKGROUND: Patients with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) andventricular arrhythmias leading to ICD therapies have poor clinical outcomes and quality of life. Antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation are needed tocontrol these arrhythmias. Dofetilide has only been approved for the treatment ofatrial fibrillation. The role of dofetilide in the control of ventriculararrhythmias in patients with an ICD has not been established.OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of dofetilide in a consecutive group of patients with an ICD and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/ orventricular fibrillation (VF) after other antiarrhythmic drugs have failed tosuppress these arrhythmias.METHODS: We studied 30 patients (age 59 ± 11; 5 women) with symptomatic VT or VF and ICDs for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. These patients had an average of 1.8 ± 4.5 episodes of VT/VF per month despite antiarrhymic therapy.Twenty-one patients (70%) had recurrent appropriate ICD therapies prior toinitiation of dofetilide, and 9 (30%) VTs below the programmed detection rate of the ICD. Twenty-three patients (77%) had coronary artery disease. Mean ejectionfraction was 30 ± 14% and 26/30 (87%) had congestive heart failure. All patients had previously failed 2 ± 1 antiarrhythmic drugs including amiodarone (n = 19)and sotalol (n = 10).RESULTS: During the first month of treatment, 25 patients (83%) had completesuppression of VT/VF and of the 21 patients with ICD therapies 16 (76%) had notherapies during the first month of treatment. During a follow-up period of 32 ± 32 months, dofetilide reduced the monthly episodes of VT/VF from 1.8 ± 4.5 to 1.0± 3.5 (P = 0.006). Monthly ICD therapies decreased from 0.9 ± 1.4 to 0.4 ± 1.7 (P= 0.037). In 9 patients that presented with slow VTs under the ICD detectionzone, dofetilide reduced monthly VT/VF episodes from 0.7 ± 0.6 to 0.1 ± 0.1 (P = 0.01) and 6 (67%) had no further ICD therapies. Dofetilide was discontinued in 13patients (43%) after 24 ± 30 months due to failure to control VT/VF (n = 7),placement of a left ventricular assist device (n = 3), catheter ablation (n = 1),heart transplantation (n = 1), and left ventricular restoration surgery (n = 1). There were 7 documented deaths (2 patients died suddenly; 3 patients ofprogressive heart failure; and 2 of non-cardiac causes).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an ICD and ventricular arrhythmias, dofetilidedecreases the frequency of VT/VF and ICD therapies even when other antiarrhythmicagents, including amiodarone, have previously been ineffective. Recurrences stilloccur in some patients requiring catheter ablation, mechanical support, or heart transplantation.© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
