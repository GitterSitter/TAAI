We investigated if perioperative use ofantifibrinolytics such as aprotinin and tranexamic acid can decrease the rate of rejection after heart transplant and their effect on transfusion.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the data from patients whoreceived a first heart transplant at Papworth Hospital between 2000 and 2005.Transplant registry and audit data were used for the study. Rejection biopsyresults and treatment were used to designate rejection episodes as mild (grades1A, 1B or 2 untreated) or severe (grades 2 treated, grades 3 and 4). Therelationship between antifibrinolytics and rejection episodes was assessed using univariate and multiple Poisson regression. Kaplan-Meier methods andKruskal-Wallis tests, respectively, were used to analyse survival/time to firstrejection and transfusion.RESULTS: There were 225 patients who underwent a first heart transplant betweenJanuary 2000 and December 2005. Of these, 101 patients (44.9%) had receivedaprotinin, 63 (28.0%) tranexamic acid, 2 (0.9%) both (aprotinin and tranexamicacid) and 59 (26.2%) no antifibrinolytics. There was no difference in time tofirst rejection by antifibrinolytic treatment (p=0.20). There was no differencein the rate of treated rejection per 100 patient-days between aprotinin andtranexamic acid groups between 0 and 3 months post-transplant, (0.6 in both), butaprotinin had a small clinical effect when compared to no treatment (0.6 vs 0.8, p=0.54). Between 4 and 6 months, the treated and severe rejection rates werelower in the patients receiving aprotinin as compared to those receivingtranexamic acid, but these differences again did not reach statisticalsignificance (0.1 vs 0.3, p=0.14, 0.2 vs 0.4, p=0.18). Aprotinin was associatedwith higher postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in the subgroupof patients that had a ventricular assist device, prior sternotomy oranticoagulant therapy.CONCLUSIONS: The use of aprotinin in heart transplant surgery may be associatedwith a small decrease in the incidence of treated/severe rejection within 6months of transplantation. The perioperative use of antifibrinolytics did notinfluence time to first rejection or reduce blood transfusion.
