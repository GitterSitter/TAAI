Cheaper and lessinvasive short-term devices have been used in this setting. We report ourexperience with the Levitronix CentriMag short-term ventricular assist device as a potential bridge prior to deciding whether a more expensive device should beused or whether transplantation should be undertaken.METHODS: Since August 2003, 16 moribund patients (14 males; age 32.7 +/- 14.9[range 16 to 62] years) have been supported with the CentriMag device as a"bridge to decision." Twelve patients had an intra-aortic balloon pumppre-operatively, 13 had multi-organ failure, 11 had septic shock, and in 5patients the neurologic status was uncertain at the time of insertion of thedevice.RESULTS: Operative mortality was 18.7% (3 patients). Seven patients (43.7%) were reoperated for bleeding. The mean support duration was 46.9 +/- 32.3 (range 6 to 111) days. There were 2 late deaths during Levitronix utilization. Follow-up was 12.8 +/- 12.5 (range 0.6 to 43) months. Eleven patients (68.7%) are currentlyalive and well: 2 patients recovered and had the Levitronix device explanted; 6patients were upgraded to a long-term device; and 3 patients were bridgeddirectly to transplantation. The actuarial survival at 1, 6 and 12 months was85.7%, 64.9% and 64.9%, respectively. There were no instances of device failure.CONCLUSIONS: The Levitronix device is effective in rescuing critically ill"moribund" patients and can provide an opportunity for low-cost support andoptimization of their condition prior to deciding whether a more expensive deviceshould be placed or if transplantation should be undertaken. Better candidateselection for further procedures can then be allowed.
