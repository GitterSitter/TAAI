Anesth Analg. 2007 Mar;104(3):538-40.The hemostatic history of a 15-month-old child implanted with a Berlin heart leftventricular assist device.Steenwyk BL(1), Kirklin JK, Gurley WQ, Nielsen VG.Author information: (1)Department of Anesthesiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham,Birmingham, AL 35294-2172, USA.We documented the hemostatic changes associated with placement of a EXCOR Berlin Heart left ventricular assist device in a 15-month-old child before hearttransplantation. The development of hypercoagulability was rapid, manifestedfirst by a plasmatic and subsequently platelet-mediated increase in coagulationkinetics and strength that persisted for weeks. The patient had no thromboticcomplications for 6 wk before transplant but required extraordinary blood productadministration to achieve hemostasis secondary to aggressive, multimodalanticoagulation. In summary, when proscribing anesthetic and surgical management of patients with a Berlin Heart, consideration of hypercoagulable features andanticoagulant therapy must be made to maximize patient safety.
