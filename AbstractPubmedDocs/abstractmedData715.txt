We sought to evaluate the relationship betweenserial measurements of functional MR and reverse remodeling and outcomes inpatients undergoing CRT.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 266 consecutive patients undergoing CRT withavailable baseline echocardiograms and subsequent clinical and echocardiographic follow-up were included in the analysis. Long-term follow-up included all-causemortality, heart transplantation, and implantation of a left ventricular (LV)assist device. Temporal changes in MR severity and LV end-systolic volume index(LVESVi) were evaluated by linear mixed-model analysis. CRT led to an immediatesustained decrease in MR (P<0.0001), with no significant subsequent change. Theamount of MR decrease correlated with a greater decrease in LVESVi late(P≤0.0001), but not early (P=0.14), after CRT began. Patients with severe MRbefore CRT experienced a larger LVESVi decrease (P=0.005). Although baseline MRseverity was not associated with adverse events (P=0.13), a larger MR decrease(P=0.001) and a smaller residual MR after the initial 6 months of CRT (P=0.03)were predictive of better outcome in a multivariable model.CONCLUSIONS: Early reversal of functional MR was associated with reverse cardiac remodeling and improved outcomes. Patients with moderately severe to severe MRbefore CRT experienced relatively more reverse remodeling than patients withlesser degrees of MR.
