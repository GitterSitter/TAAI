Compared with optimal medical management, LVAD implantationsignificantly improved the survival and quality of life of these terminally illpatients. To date, however, there have been no analyses of the cost related tothe LVAD survival benefit. This paper addresses the cost of hospital resourceuse, and its predictors, for long-term LVAD patients.METHODS: Detailed cost data were available for 52 of 68 REMATCH patientsrandomized to LVAD therapy. We combined the clinical dataset with Medicare data, standard billing forms (UB-92), and line item bills provided directly by clinicalcenters. Charges were converted to costs by using the Ratio-of-Cost-to-Chargesfor each major resource category.RESULTS: The mean cost for the initial implant-related hospitalization was$210,187 +/- 193,295. When implantation hospitalization costs are comparedbetween hospital survivors and nonsurvivors, the mean costs increase from$159,271 +/- 106,423 to $315,015 +/- 278,713. Sepsis, pump housing infection, andperioperative bleeding are the major drivers of implantation cost, established byregression modeling. In the patients who survived the procedure (n = 35), bypass time, perioperative bleeding, and late bleeding were the drivers of cost. Theaverage annual readmission cost per patient for the overall cohort was $105,326.CONCLUSIONS: The cost of long-term LVAD implantation is commensurate with otherlife-saving organ transplantation procedures like liver transplantation. As anevolving technology, there are a number of opportunities for improvement thatwill likely reduce costs in the future.PMCID: PMC1360116
