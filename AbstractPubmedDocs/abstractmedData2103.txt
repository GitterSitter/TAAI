ASAIO Trans. 1990 Jul-Sep;36(3):M703-5.LVAS pump performance following initiation of left ventricular assistance.Kormos RL(1), Borovetz HS, Pristas JM, Lavee J, Armitage JM, Stuart RS, MarroneGC, Hardesty RL, Griffith BP.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,Pennsylvania.Prevention of disturbed flow (e.g., flow stasis) and consequent thrombosis inheart pumps is based upon design characteristics determined during laboratorybench tests. These tests employ optimal filling and emptying characteristics,such as the full-fill to complete empty mode in the Novacor left ventricularassist system. Filling characteristics of the Novacor LVAS were examined duringthe first 48 hours after implantation in 14 patients. Fill volume of the pump wasreduced in pathologic states, such as cardiac tamponade, and following theinitiation of right ventricular mechanical circulatory support. In addition,multiple regression analysis revealed that right ventricular function measured bythe amount of inotropic support required, the right ventricular ejectionfraction, and the total pulmonary resistance, significantly predicted leftventricular assist pump fill volume during the first 48 hours of support. Flowvisualization simulating these clinical conditions of incomplete filling suggest inadequate valve washing, particularly around the inlet valve and its conduit,which may predispose to thrombus formation.
