Expert Rev Med Devices. 2006 Mar;3(2):195-205.Currently available ventricular-assist devices: capabilities, limitations andfuture perspectives.Ohuchi K(1), Takatani S.Author information: (1)Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Department of Artificial Organs,Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. ouchi.ao@tmd.ac.jpThe continuous progress in ventricular-assist device (VAD) technology and themanagement of patients with VADs has broadened the treatment options forend-stage heart failure patients. The available line-up of clinical devicesprovides the current optimal therapies to meet the specific needs of eachpatient. The extended durability, safety, efficacy and improved quality of lifeof the patients provides sufficient proof for the VAD to be a likely alternative therapy to heart transplantation. The sequential progress from the first-, to thesecond- and to the third-generation VAD technology is expected to bringincreasing benefits to clinical outcomes. This article reviews the currentstatus, capabilities, limitations and future perspectives of currently available VADs by generally classifying them via support duration, alignment of pumpdevices and via pulsatile or nonpulsatile mode of perfusion. Furthermore, thefuture direction of research and development for next-generation VADs ispresented based on the lessons learned from currently available VADs.
