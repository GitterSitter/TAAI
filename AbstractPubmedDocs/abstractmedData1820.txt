These systems provide far greater patient mobility and independence than external pumpswith bulky control consoles. Patients with implantable LVAS can be dischargedfrom hospital and are able to return to work and resume active sports. Mostpatients have received these systems as a bridge to heart transplantation.Clinical status and quality of life improve dramatically after deviceimplantation and survival on support (60-70% after approx. 100 days of support)is acceptable compared with transplant candidates on medical therapy. Patientselection and adverse events, primarily bleeding, thromboembolism and infection, are important issues with LVAS. In the future, long-term support and bridging to myocardial recovery may become important indications for LVAS.
