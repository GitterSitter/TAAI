Circ Heart Fail. 2014 Jul;7(4):696.BACKGROUND: We describe the characteristics and outcomes of peripartumcardiomyopathy (PPCMP) patients who received durable mechanical circulatorysupport and compared it with other etiologies of advanced heart failure.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 1258 women who were registered in InteragencyRegistry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support between June 2006 andMarch 2012. Baseline characteristics, implant strategies, hemodynamics,echocardiographic data, and outcomes were compared. Ninety-nine women had PPCMPand 1159 had non-PPCMP as primary diagnosis. PPCMP women were younger (P<0.001), more likely to be blacks, and had less comorbidities than non-PPCMP patients.PPCMP women had better survival than non-PPCMP women (P=0.01) with a 2-yearsurvival of 83%. Multivariable risk factor adjustment analysis showed that theimproved survival was likely because of younger age and fewer comorbidities. At36 months, a proportion of 48% PPCMP received heart transplantation. Recoveryoccurred at a frequency of 6% and 2% in the PPCMP and non-PPCMP groups (P=0.1).Adverse event rates were similar in PPCMP and non-PPCMP patients except forhigher cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure in the non-PPCMP in the first 3 months post implant.CONCLUSIONS: PPCMP women who receive durable mechanical circulatory support have a better survival than women with non-PPCPM. The improved survival observed inPPCMP is likely related to their fewer comorbidities and younger age. Myocardial recovery was uncommon and less than half of women with end-stage PPCPM receivedheart transplantation after 3 years of mechanical support.
