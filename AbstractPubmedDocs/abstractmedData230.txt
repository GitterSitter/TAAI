We compared results of 67 patientswho received first-time left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) with sealedinflow and outflow grafts (S-graft group) with a preceding 65 patients whoreceived an LVAD with nonsealed grafts (NS-graft group). Overall, the amount ofblood product transfusions was less in the S-graft group than that in theNS-graft group (red blood cells, 4.9 ± 4.5 vs. 8.0 ± 9.4 units, p = 0.022;fresh-frozen plasma, 5.0 ± 3.0 vs. 8.7 ± 9.3 units, p = 0.004; platelets, 2.9 ±1.1 vs. 4.5 ± 3.5 units, p = 0.001; and cryoprecipitate, 1.2 ± 0.9 vs. 2.01 ± 1.9units, p = 0.002). Within a follow-up period of 6 months, no device-relatedinfections or strokes occurred in the S-group, but the NS-group had one (1.5%)driveline infections and four (6%) strokes. The 30 days survival rate was notsignificantly different between groups (p = 0.053), but favored the S-group (97%)over the NS-group (88%). Use of a HMII with a sealed graft on the inflow andoutflow conduits is associated with less postoperative bleeding and may havehelped to decrease the frequency of postoperative adverse events.
