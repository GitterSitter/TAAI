The caspase cascade is the central element of theapoptotic process in cells. We therefore tested expression shifts of leftventricular mRNA of caspases and their endogenous inhibitors from 15 patientswith VAD support and successful bridging to transplantation usingsemiquantitative RT-PCR. Cardiac unloading was shown by the reduction inventricular Pro-ANP mRNA under VAD. No alteration of mRNA expression under VADcould be observed for initiator caspases, for their selective inhibitors or forapoptotic signal molecules from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Only twounselective cardiac IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) were increased underVAD with better recovery in younger patients. In conclusion, our findingsindicate that successful hemodynamic unloading by VAD support causes only minor, age-dependent recovery in the expression of IAPs, while presumed alterations inantiapoptotic modulator systems upstream of the caspase cascade still remain tobe identified.
