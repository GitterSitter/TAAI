Safetyand efficacy data were gathered at enrollment and during follow-up.RESULTS: No serious device-related adverse events or device failures wereobserved. Three patients died during the follow-up period, and 2 patientsunderwent heart transplantation. There was a significant improvement in the NewYork Heart Association (NYHA) functional class from 3.0 +/- 0.3 at baseline to2.1 +/- 0.7 at 6 months (p = 0.001). Both LV end-diastolic and end-systolicvolumes had decreased at follow-up. The LV ejection fraction significantlyincreased in the Myosplint alone group (from 17.1 +/- 4.0% at baseline to 21.8+/- 4.1% at 3 months and 23.1 +/- 7.2% at 6 months) but not in the Myosplint and mitral valve repair group. The mitral regurgitation (MR) grade had a significant (p = 0.002) linear relationship with the NYHA functional class.CONCLUSIONS: The initial clinical experience of the Myosplint device demonstratedboth safety and feasibility, validating the LV shape change concept in humans. A remodeling solution must, however, include MR resolution, to illustrate the need for a device that can simultaneously reduce or eliminate functional MR off-pump.
