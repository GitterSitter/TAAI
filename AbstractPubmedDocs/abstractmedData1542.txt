Curr Opin Cardiol. 2004 May;19(3):270-7.The response of the failing heart to chronic mechanical unloading.Wallace CK(1), Koerner MM, Thohan V, Loebe M, Lafuente J, Noon GP, Torre-AmioneG.Author information: (1)Methodist DeBakey Heart Center, The Winter's Center for Heart Failure Researchand the Gene and Judy Campbell Laboratories for Transplantation Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The authors present a comprehensive analysis of the evidencein support of improvements at the cellular, structural, and hemodynamic levelsafter left ventricular assist device support.RECENT FINDINGS: The use of left ventricular assist devices as a strategy tobridge patients to cardiac transplantation and, more recently, as a form ofdestination therapy has provided a great opportunity to study failing myocardium at various time points. Specifically, myocardial samples can be obtained frompatients at the time of left ventricular assist device implantation and again at explant, thereby allowing comparisons between paired samples of failingmyocardium obtained before and after mechanical unloading.SUMMARY: A body of knowledge has been generated that illustrates the ability ofthe myocardium to "heal." This information may give us better insight intocellular and molecular mechanisms of heart failure and potential new therapiesfor patients with end-stage heart failure.
