However, it is unknown how the timing ofbiventricular assist device insertion affects outcomes. We hypothesized thatplanned biventricular assist device insertion improves survival compared withdelayed conversion of left ventricular assist device support to biventricularassist device support.METHODS: We reviewed and compared outcomes of 266 patients undergoing leftventricular assist device or biventricular assist device placement at theUniversity of Pennsylvania from April 1995 to June 2007. We subdivided patientsreceiving biventricular assist devices into planned biventricular assist device(P-BiVAD) and delayed biventricular assist device (D-BiVAD) groups based on thetiming of right ventricular assist device insertion. We defined the D-BiVAD groupas any failure of isolated left ventricular assist device support.RESULTS: Of 266 patients who received left ventricular assist devices, 99 (37%)required biventricular assist device support. We compared preoperativecharacteristics, successful bridging to transplantation, survival to hospitaldischarge, and Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival between the P-BiVAD (n = 71) andD-BiVAD (n = 28) groups. Preoperative comparison showed that patients whoultimately require biventricular support have similar preoperative status. Leftventricular assist device (n = 167) outcomes in all categories exceeded bothP-BiVAD and D-BiVAD group outcomes. Furthermore, patients in the P-BiVAD grouphad superior survival to discharge than patients in the D-BiVAD group (51% vs29%, P < .05). One-year and long-term Kaplan-Meier survival distributionconfirmed this finding. There was also a trend toward improved bridging totransplantation in the P-BiVAD (n = 55) versus D-BiVAD (n = 22) groups (65% vs45%, P = .10).CONCLUSION: When patients at high risk for failure of isolated left ventricularassist device support are identified, proceeding directly to biventricular assistdevice implantation is advised because early institution of biventricular supportresults in dramatic improvement in survival.PMCID: PMC3232461
