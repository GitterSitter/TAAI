These devices are frequently used in community hospitals, with subsequent referral to tertiary care centers. We sought to determine the outcomes of suchreferrals and identify prognostic variables that may influence managementdecisions.METHODS: We performed a single-institution retrospective review of 59 consecutivepatients transferred on temporary, extracorporeal MCS from 1997 to 2008.Demographics, medical history, laboratory data, and clinical status wereobtained, with survival determined from the medical record and the SocialSecurity Death Index. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed andsurvival estimates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Median age was 49.6 years (range, 14 to 77 years). Forty-five patients(76%) were supported for postcardiotomy failure, and 34 (58%) requiredbiventricular support. Twenty-five (42%) survived to hospital discharge, 11 aftercardiac recovery (44%), 9 with long-term implantable MCS devices (39%), and 5after heart transplantation (22%). Eight patients discharged with implantable MCSdevices underwent heart transplantation and 1 remains alive on long-termimplantable MCS support. Survival was 42% +/- 6% at 1 year and 38% +/- 6% at 5years. Age and renal function were independent predictors of death.CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of all patients transferred on temporary extracorporeal MCS survive to discharge. Most of the long-term survivors received a hearttransplant. Age and renal function were independent predictors of death,suggesting that survival is maximized by considering eligibility for cardiactransplantation.PMCID: PMC2825555
