We tested the hypothesis that a new continuous flowcirculatory assist device could be employed safely to relieve symptoms of heartfailure and evaluated the potential to prolong life.METHODS AND RESULTS: An intracardiac axial flow pump was implanted in 17 heartfailure patients [idiopathic dilated (12), ischaemic (4), or amyloidcardiomyopathy (1)]. All were deemed ineligible for transplantation. Implantationof the device was by left thoracotomy (15) or median sternotomy (2). Powerdelivery was by a skull-mounted titanium pedestal. All patients survived surgery.None needed right ventricular support. There were three hospital deaths, twoearly from subdural haematoma and aortic thrombosis, one late after switching to transplantation. A total of 14 patients left hospital with a cumulativesupport-time of 15.9 years (median: 293 days, interquartile range: 286 days, 1-44months). Actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year survivals were 56, 47, and 24%,respectively. There was no pump failure. Quality of life scores improved. Twosuperficial pedestal infections were successfully treated. Four patients hadcerebral thrombo-embolism: two early events attributed to inadequateanticoagulation and two late with near-complete resolution. An improvedanticoagulant regime addressed this problem. Late death occurred in five patientsfrom battery disconnection, subdural haematoma, bowel ischaemia, respiratoryfailure, and after cardiac transplantation.CONCLUSION: Continuous flow blood pumps provided symptomatic relief of severeheart failure with high quality of life. Event-free survival reached 4 years.Analysis of adverse events led to improved management strategies. There ispotential for widespread use of blood pumps in the community. A controlled trial is required.
