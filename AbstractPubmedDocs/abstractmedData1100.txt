The device was connected via the pulmonary arterial maintrunk and the left atrium, thereby creating a septostomy-like shunt with theunique addition of gas exchange abilities in parallel to the lung. Using thisapproach, all four patients were successfully bridged to bilateral lungtransplantation and combined heart-lung transplantation, respectively. Althoughall patients presented in cardiogenic shock, hemodynamic unloading of the rightventricle using the low-resistance LAD stabilized the hemodynamic situationimmediately so that no pump support was subsequently required.
