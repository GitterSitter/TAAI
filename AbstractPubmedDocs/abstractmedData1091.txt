We reviewed ourrecent experience with these two technologies with particular focus on earlyoutcomes.METHODS: Data for 55 consecutive children undergoing BTT between 2001 and 2008were abstracted from an institutional database. The analysis excluded 13 patientsbecause EXCOR was not used for acute postcardiotomy BTT. Patients were dividedinto ECMO (n = 21) and EXCOR groups (n = 21). Specific end points includedsurvival to transplant, overall survival, and bridge to recovery. Incidences ofadverse events and the duration of support were determined.RESULTS: Groups were similar in weight, age, and etiologies of heart failure.Likewise, the incidences of stroke and multisystem organ failure were similar.Survival to transplant, recovery, or continued support was 57% in ECMO and 86% inEXCOR (p = 0.040). EXCOR patients had overall significantly better survival (p = 0.049). Two ECMO patients and 1 EXOR patient were bridged to recovery. The meanduration of support was 15 +/- 12 days in the ECMO group and 42 +/- 43 days inthe EXCOR group (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In children requiring BTT, EXCOR provided substantially longersupport times than ECMO, without significant increase in the rates of stroke ormultisystem organ failure. Survival to transplant and long-term survival washigher with EXCOR.
