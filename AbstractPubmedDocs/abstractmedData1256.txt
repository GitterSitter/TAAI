In 6 anesthetized sheep, themain pulmonary artery (PA) and right atrium (RA) were exposed through a leftfourth intercostal thoracotomy. A 12-mm outer diameter vascular graft wasanastomosed (end-to-side) to the main PA, and a VAD atrial cannula was placedinto RA through the RA appendage. The pump and gas exchange device wereinterposed in circuit for RA-PA support.RESULTS: All 6 sheep survived OxyRVAD insertion. Four sheep survived the 5-dayexperiment. One was euthanized at 48 hours owing to pump electrical failure(wiring) and another at 72 hours owing to pump bearing failure (broken heparinpurge line). One sheep needed replacement of a BioLung due to internal thrombi.OxyRVAD flow was stable (range, 3.57-4.30 liters/min). Carbon dioxide removal wasconstant during experiment (range, 88.35 +/- 6.12 ml/min at onset to 141.38 +/-5.48 ml/min at the 96th hour). Oxygen transfer decreased from 161.8 +/- 8.8 to79.7 +/- 31.4 ml/min at the 96th hour (p = 0.045).CONCLUSION: Our ambulatory OxyRVAD provided total assistance of right heart andlungs in normal awake sheep for up to 5 days.
