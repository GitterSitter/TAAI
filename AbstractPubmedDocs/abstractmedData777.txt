Ayala-Anayal, Javier [corrected toAnaya-Ayala, Javier].Mycotic aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is one of thecomplications associated with infective endocarditis. However, there are noprevious case reports in the literature describing mycotic SMA aneurysm afterleft ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. We describe the case of a31-year-old male diagnosed with congestive heart failure due to nonischemicdilated cardiomyopathy who underwent LVAD implantation for bridge to hearttransplantation. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient wasmaintained on anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. There were no signs ofpump failure or device-related infections. However, 7 months post-LVAD support,the patient complained of abdominal symptoms (nausea and vomiting) with low-gradefever. Computed tomography identified an aneurysmal change of the SMA (2.2 × 1.8 cm). There was no evidence of thrombus or septic vegetation inside the heart.Aneurysm and segmental small bowel resection was performed. Pathological studyrevealed typical findings of mycotic aneurysm with significant infiltration ofinflammatory cells. The patient, however, expired due to concurrent brainhemorrhage. Postmortem study indicated no sign of pump thrombus or septic emboli inside the pump or inflow/outflow conduit. This case report presents a raremycotic aneurysm that developed in the SMA after chronic LVAD support.© 2011, Copyright the Authors.
