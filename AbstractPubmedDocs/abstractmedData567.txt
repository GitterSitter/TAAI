We report on our experience in the pediatric population.METHODS: Retrospective review of 27 consecutive children offered mechanicalsupport with Berlin Heart as a bridge to heart transplant, and Jarvik 2000 as adestination therapy from February 2002 to October 2011.RESULTS: The median patient age was 4.8 years (range = 75 days to 20.5 years).The median patient weight was 18.6 kg (range = 2.9-63 kg). We divided thepatients in two groups, including in group I patients assisted for bridging toheart transplantation and in group II patients with Duchenne's dystrophy assistedas destination therapy. In the group I, 11 patients required biventricularmechanical support (BVAD), but in all other cases, a single left VAD provedsufficient (56%). The median duration of VAD support was 48 days (1 to 192 days).The median pre-VAD pulmonary vascular resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5to 14.4 WU/m(2)). Twelve patients (48%) were successfully bridged to hearttransplantation after a median duration of mechanical support of 63 days (range =2-168 days). Ten deaths occurred (40%), three for neurological complications, twofor sepsis, two for multiorgan failure, and three other for devicemalfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our patients has increased from 33% to 75%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from 89% to 23%. In the group II,two patients with mean age of 15.3 years were assisted with Jarvik 2000, and bothof them are alive in a follow-up of 10.4 months. In two patients with Rpi > 10WU/m(2), unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilatator therapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2 WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of BVAD support, respectively. Six patients (32%) required at least one pump change. Of 12 patients undergoing hearttransplantation, five developed an extremely elevated (>60%) panel-reactiveantibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed by Luminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of rejection in the first month afterheart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The survival rate after hearttransplantation was 100% with a median follow-up of 34.4 months (45 days to 8.7years).CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in children with end-stage heart failure is aneffective strategy as a bridge to heart transplantation with a reasonablemorbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer an additional means to reverseextremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.
