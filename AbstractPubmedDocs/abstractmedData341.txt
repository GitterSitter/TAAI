Successful heart transplantation in a patient with HC has only beenreported once (J Heart Lung Transplant 2004: 23: 902). The combination of HC withconcurrent LVNC has only been described three times (Int J Legal Med 2009: 123:47; Hum Pathol 2005: 36: 403; Pediatr Dev Pathol 2012: 15: 397). We report tworare cases of HC with LVNC in two infants presenting with cardiogenic shock, one requiring ECMO support who was successfully bridged to orthotopic hearttransplantation with a Berlin Heart LVAD.Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
