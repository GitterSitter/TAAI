Currentexperience with temporary left ventricular assist devices suggest that apermanent, totally, or near totally implantable device may be a viablealternative.METHODS: We analyzed data from the 1997 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry and other literature on heart transplantationand compared survival and complication rates with our experience and that ofothers with temporary ventricular assist devices. From these data, we attemptedto identify those patients who would benefit most from permanent left ventricularassist systems (LVASs).RESULTS: Among heart transplant candidates, United Network for Organ Sharing(UNOS) status II, O blood type, weight >180 lb, older age, and preformedantibodies are negative factors for receipt of donor hearts. Of patientstransplanted, women and nonwhites have poorer outcomes. Success with wearableLVAS's suggest some of these patients might be better served with an LVAS thanwith cardiac transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Because LVAS's could be made readily available without the need for a waiting list, they might compete well with the strategy of cardiactransplantation.
