The devices implanted have been:pneumatic VAD in 145 cases (56%), electromechanical LVAS in 15 cases (6%), TAH in78 cases (30%) and centrifugal pumps in 20 cases (8%). The patients weresupported for period ranging from 2 h to 623 days (mean 18.3 days +/- 43.2). The type of support was: LVAD 50 cases (20%), RVAD 3 cases (1%), BVAD 127 cases(49%), and TAH 78 cases (30%). Bleeding occurred in 84 patients (32.5%),infections in 83 patients (32.1%); 21 embolic complications were reported in 16patients (6%). Renal failure occurred in 64 cases (25%) requiring dialysis in 33 (13%); respiratory failure in 47 cases (18%); neurological impairment was notedin 22 patients (9%). One hundred-sixty patients were transplanted (62%) and 104ultimately discharged (40% out of total 258 patients and 65% out of 160transplanted patients). Among postoperative parameters, renal failure, TAH,neurological impairment and infection shown statistical power. Some pre- andpost-operative variables were identified as independent risk factors for overall mortality: age, indication for graft failure, all indications different fromcardiomyopathy, neurological impairment, renal insufficiency, infection, bleedingand any type of support different from LVAD. The improvement in the success rate in the last 2 years is statistically significant (P = 0.0282) considering boththe percentage of transplanted patients and of discharged patients.CONCLUSIONS: The results are encouraging if mechanical support is performed inpatients with deterioration while awaiting transplant, when LVAD is feasible and effective, when an ideal timing of transplant during support period isidentified.
