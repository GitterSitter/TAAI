We have used the CentriMag VAD as a bridge to decision device. Wedescribe our experience with device placement, use and outcomes.METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients who underwent CentriMagplacement at our institution from January 2007 to August 2009. Sixty-threepatients had placement of a CentriMag device, with 43% (n = 27) of these beingplaced due to failure of medical management. These cases were the focus of ourstudy.RESULTS: Primary diagnoses were ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 17), dilatedcardiomyopathy (n = 7) or other (n = 3). Mean age was 47.1 (range 7 to 72) years.Prior to implant, 85% of patients were on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)support, 70% were on vasopressors, and 44% were on more than one inotrope.INTERMACS score was 1 in 67% of patients and 2 in 33% of patients. Six patientswere bridged to a long-term device, 8 to transplantation and 10 to recovery.Eighty-nine percent (24 of 27) of patients survived to explant and 74% (20 of 27)survived to hospital discharge, with a 1-year survival of 68%. Thromboemboliccomplications occurred in 10 patients, including 6 strokes. Compared withpatients who survived to discharge, those who died had a significantly higherbody mass index (30.8 vs 24.1 kg/m(2), p = 0.003). Survivors to dischargedemonstrated significant improvements in hepatic and renal function over thecourse of device support while non-survivors did not.CONCLUSIONS: The CentriMag demonstrates promising results when used in patientswith acute heart failure refractory to medical management.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
