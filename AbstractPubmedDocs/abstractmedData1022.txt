Epub 2009 Sep19.The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with therapyrefractory cardiogenic shock as a bridge to implantable left ventricular assistdevice and perioperative right heart support.Scherer M(1), Moritz A, Martens S.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, J.W. Goethe University,Frankfurt/Main, Germany. M.Scherer@em.uni-frankfurt.deImplantation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to recovery or transplantation is a widely accepted treatment modality. Preexisting organdysfunction is thought to unfavorably affect patient survival after implantation of a ventricular assist device (VAD). We present our experience usingextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with cardiogenic shock to stabilized organ function prior to LVAD implantation. Between September 2006 and March 2008, five patients in cardiogenic shock with preexisting organ dysfunction(impaired liver and kidney function) were supported with ECMO before LVADimplantation. ECMO-LVAD interval was 8 +/- 4 days. All patients were transferred to a LVAD. At the LVAD implantation time, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT)decreased from 206.25 +/- 106.93 Ul (-1) to 70.6 +/- 32.9 U l(-1),glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) decreased from 333.5 +/- 207.3 U l(-1) to77.8 +/- 39.7 U l(-1), and creatinine decreased from 2.2 +/- 0.9 mg dl(-1) to 1.2+/- 0.2 mg dl(-1). One patient died while on LVAD support due to not devicerelated sepsis. One patient received successful heart transplantation. Overallsurvival was 80%. In all patients, we removed the ECMO 3 days after LVADimplantation. After removal of the ECMO there was no right heart failure. ECMOsupport can immediately stabilize circulation and provide organ perfusion inpatients with cardiogenic shock. After improvement of organ function, LVADimplantation can be performed successfully in this patient collective. To avoidright ventricular failure, the ECMO should not be removed at the time of LVADimplantation, and used as a right ventricular support for the immediatepostoperative period.
