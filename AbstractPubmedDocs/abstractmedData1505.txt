We present our experience of HTx in the presence of device-related infection (DRI) including driveline exitsite with pocket infections. From May 1996 to April 2003, mechanical circulatory support with the HeartMate VAD was performed in eight patients, and with theThoratec VAD in seven patients. Although 151 patients underwent HTx during thatperiod, only 8 of the 15 patients had suitable donors and underwent orthotopicHTx. Six of the eight patients developed DRI. Their ages ranged from 18 to 59years (mean = 36 +/- 14 years). The duration of VAD support ranged from 8 to 287 days (mean = 125 +/- 117 days). The general condition and cardiac functionimproved gradually under VAD support. At the time of HTx, all six male patientswere suffering from DRI. The causative microorganisms were Acinetobacterbaumannii (n = 3) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), andEnterococcus faecium (n = 1). All patients underwent successful HTx, and weredischarged in good condition. It is concluded that under the coverage ofappropriate antibiotics, HTx can be successfully performed for the patients forVAD support with DRI. It is important to prevent the spread of infection duringHTx. Adequate debridement and drainage of the infected materials preventspostoperative wound infections.
