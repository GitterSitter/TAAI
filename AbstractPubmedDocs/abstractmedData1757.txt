The mean age was 52 years (range 21 to 68 years) and 14 of 17 were male. The indications for implantation were postcardiotomy shock (12 of17, 70%), decompensated cardiomyopathy (2 of 17, 12%), viral myocarditis (2 of17, 12%), and acute myocardial infarction (1 of 17, 6%).RESULTS: The mean duration of support was 8.5 days (range 1 to 28 days). In thegroup of 17 patients, 8 were weaned from the device and 2 underwenttransplantation. Four of the weaned patients (4 of 8, 50%) and 1 of thetransplant patients (1 of 2, 50%) survived. The overall weaning and survivalrates were 58% (10 of 17) and 29% (5 of 17). There were no major device-relatedcomplications and no major device malfunctions.CONCLUSIONS: The AB-180 provides reliable circulatory support for reversibleforms of heart failure.
