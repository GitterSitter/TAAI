Continuous-flowLVADs have been shown to improve outcomes, including survival, and reduce device failure compared with pulsatile devices. Although LVADs have been shown to be agood option for patients with end-stage heart failure, unanticipatedcomplications may occur. We describe dynamic left atrial and left ventricularchamber collapse related to postural changes in a patient with a recentcontinuous-flow LVAD implantation.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
