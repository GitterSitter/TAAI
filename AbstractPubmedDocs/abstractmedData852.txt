The patient had been stable for 6 months, until she started to developheart failure symptoms due to severe pulmonary insufficiency. Pulmonary valveclosure and BiVAD conversion to implantable rotary pumps was performed. ADuraHeart centrifugal pump (Terumo Heart Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) was used for leftventricular assist, and a Jarvik 2000 axial-flow pump (Jarvik Heart Inc., NewYork, NY) was used for right ventricular assist. Although strict management wasrequired to balance the flow rates of the two different types of devices, herpostoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged home.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
