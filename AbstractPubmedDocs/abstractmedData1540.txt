VADs are an essential component oftransplantation programs as they successfully bridge individuals who wouldotherwise die. Recently left ventricular VAD (LVAD) therapy has been proposed as alternative to heart transplantation (HTx) for patients who are not transplantcandidates. Other indications have now expanded into areas such as postcardiotomyfailure, acute myocarditis, and acute massive myocardial infarction. From 1988 toMay 2003, 80 patients received left or biventricular mechanical circulatorysupport including 78 as a bridge to and two as an alternative to HT. All patientssurvived the operation. Mean duration of VAD support was 77 +/- 150 days.Fifty-one points (63.8%) underwent heart transplantation; 3 (3.8%) recovered and were weaned from VADs. Major bleeding episodes occurred in 11 patients (13.8%)and major neurologic events occurred in 8 (10%). Sixteen patients (20%) weredischarged home while waiting for HTx. Twenty-two patients (27.5%) died on VAD.In conclusion, VAD therapy proved effective in bridging patients with end-stageheart failure to HTx. While on LVAD support patients who were assisted withimplantable wearable devices could be discharged at home, improving their qualityof life.
