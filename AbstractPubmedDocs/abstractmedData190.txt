We evaluated our experience todescribe the bleeding complications among pediatric VAD recipients. Wehypothesized that those with bleeding requiring exploration had abnormalcoagulation profile compared with those without bleeding. The retrospective studyincluded 43 consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure supported onpediatric mechanical cardiac support as a bridge to transplantation.Day-/event-based analysis on factors below associated with (i) bleeding and (ii) bleeding in next 48 h. Cases with bleeding were compared with day-matchedpatients without bleeding complications. Among 43 subjects bleeding occurred in47% of cases, which necessitated exploration or chest tube placement. Twenty of34 interventions for bleeding occurred in the first seven post-operative days. Nodifferences in coagulation parameters or use of antiplatelet agents were notedamong those who had bleeding vs. those who did not. Our results indicate that (i)re-bleeding requiring re-exploration was common, (ii) most of the bleedingoccurred early post-implantation, (iii) there were no differences in coagulation parameters or the use of antiplatelet agents within 48 h of bleeding comparedwith those who did not bleed on each successive post-operative day.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
