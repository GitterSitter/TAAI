The latter can be operated at a low-speed setting to allowpulsatility or at a high-speed setting to create continuous flow. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of continuous flow and pulsatile flow onperipheral vascular reactivity.METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients were divided into two groups based on thetype of LVAD they received. Ten patients had a pulsatile flow LVAD, and 10 had anaxial flow LVAD. For the purpose of the study protocol, the axial flow deviceswere operated at a high speed to ensure continuous flow. The patients' peripheralartery vasoreactivity was assessed with an ultrasound vascular transducer thatmeasured flow-mediated dilation (FMD).RESULTS: The FMD of the patients supported with pulsatile flow (15.6 +/- 5%) was higher than the FMD of the patients supported with temporary continuous flow (1.8+/- 3%). The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Pulsatile flow is associated with a better peripheral vascularreactivity than continuous flow. Patients supported by axial flow devices should be kept on the lowest speed setting to allow maximum pulsatility.
