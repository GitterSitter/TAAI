Unlike pulsatile assist devices, continuous-flow pumps havea simplified pumping mechanism and they do not require compliance chambers orvalves. In the 1980s, clinical experience with the Hemopump proved a high-speed, intravascular, continuous-flow pump could safely augment the circulation.Subsequently, a decade of animal experiments with a larger, longer-termcontinuous-flow pump (the Jarvik 2000) confirmed the safety and efficacy ofintraventricular placement, leading to its clinical application.METHODS: We analyzed the physiologic and anatomic effect of using the Jarvik 2000pump for cardiac support in 23 patients in whom the device was applied as abridge to transplant under the protocol approved by the Food and DrugAdministration Investigational Device Exemption. The device was used as a bridge to transplantation in 20 patients and as destination therapy in 3 patients.RESULTS: In the bridge-to-transplant group, 14 patients underwenttransplantation, 5 died during the circulatory support period and 1 is in anongoing study. The support period lasted an average of 90 days. For thesurvivors, the follow-up period has averaged 16 months. Within the first 48postoperative hours, the average cardiac index increased by 65% (from 1.77 +/-0.24 to 2.92 +/- 0.60 L. min(-1). m(-2), p = 0.00000002), the systemic vascularresistance decreased by 42% (from 1604 +/- 427 to 930 +/- 330 dynes/sec percm(2), p = 0.00001), and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) decreased by 41.8% (from 23 +/- 5.1 to 13.4 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, p = 0.00009). Similar resultswere seen for the patients undergoing destination therapy. Cardiac indexincreased 89.5% (from 1.9 +/- 0.1 to 3.6 +/- 0.6, p = 0.046) and PCWP decreasedby 52.2% (from 23 +/- 10 to 11 +/- 2, p = 0.22). In that group, 1 patient diedunexpectedly from an accident 382 days after device implantation. The 2 survivorsremain in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I at 700 to 952 daysafter implantation.CONCLUSIONS: The Jarvik 2000 can offer effective long-term support for patientswith chronic heart failure and NYHA class IV status. However, the new physiology produced by continuous offloading of the heart throughout the cardiac cycle hasintroduced unique clinical problems. The understanding of the problems generated by this biotechnological interface is essential for obtaining optimal clinicaloutcomes.
