Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2000 Jul;12(3):229-37.Clinical experience with long-term use of implantable left ventricular assistdevices: indications, implantation, and outcomes.Kasirajan V(1), McCarthy PM, Hoercher KJ, Starling RC, Young JB, Banbury MK,Smedira NG.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cleveland ClinicFoundation, OH, USA.We describe our clinical experience with 205 implantable left ventricular assist devices at the Cleveland Clinic between December 1991 and January 2000, alongwith manufacturers' data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. Inpatients with end-stage cardiac failure who are suitable candidates fortransplantation, these devices serve as excellent bridges to transplantation.Recent modifications have increased pump reliability and reduced thromboembolicrates. The vented electric HeartMate (Thermocardiosystems Inc, Woburn, MA) andthe Novacor (Baxter-Novacor, Oakland, CA) left ventricular assist systems allowpatients to be discharged from the hospital while awaiting a donor heart.Experience with long-term support is providing insights into permanentimplantation of these devices as destination therapy. Although infection remains a major impediment to long-term support, patient-pump interactions leading tochanges in the coagulation and immune systems are being recognized, and theseinteractions may have important implications with respect to thromboembolism,infection, and sensitization to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Betterunderstanding of these factors may eventually lead to the development ofpermanently implantable pumps as an alternative to transplantation.
