This practice raises ethical and logistic concerns and has led us to investigate the short- and long-term outcomes for this patient population. Methods andresults We examined our adult bridge-to-transplant left ventricular assist devicepopulation over a 6-year period to characterize those patients with acutecardiogenic shock who received left ventricular assist devices on an emergencybasis (ie, placement of a device within 24 hours of being listed for cardiactransplantation). Outcomes before and after transplant were compared with thoseof candidates with nonemergency evaluations by Kaplan-Meier survival curves andthe Fisher exact test where appropriate. Of the 115 patients who required leftventricular assist device support, 73 (63%) patients required emergencyplacement; 70% of these patients survived to transplant compared with 83% ofthose with nonurgent device implantation (not statistically significant).Posttransplant survival curves were similar for patients with emergency deviceplacement and those with nonurgent placement (not statistically significant).Twenty-two patients having emergency device placement did not undergo hearttransplantation because of multisystem organ failure (14), device supportwithdrawal from irreversible neurologic injury (4), device or technical problems (2), and left ventricular assist device explant due to myocardial recovery (2).CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, the majority of left ventricular assist devices are placed on an emergency basis. Few of these patients require discontinuationof device support due to undetected conditions during abbreviated preoperativeevaluation. Survival before and after transplant is comparable with those ofpatients who undergo nonurgent left ventricular assist device placement ormedical therapy.
