We have noted, inour years of experience, that aortic valve commissures may fuse in patientssupported by LVADs. These observations may be important in the use of these pumpsas long-term destination therapy.METHODS: We examined 33 hearts (both explants and autopsy specimens) frompatients supported either with vented-electric (VE) HeartMates (n = 21) or withimplantable pneumatic HeartMates (n = 12). We noted commissures involved, fusion length (mm), duration of LVAD support, and type of LVAD. As controls, we examined49 explanted hearts from patients with heart failure who were not supported byLVADs.RESULTS: We found commissural fusion in 17 of the 33 hearts. Of those 17 hearts, 4 (23.5%) had 2 commissural fusions, and 13 (76.5%) had only 1 fusion. Fusionlength ranged from 5 mm to 17 mm (mean, 9.9 mm). The lesion was more common inpatients fitted with VE HeartMates (p < 0.0002). We found small amounts ofcommissural fusion in 8 of the 49 control hearts.CONCLUSIONS: Acquired commissural fusion is common in patients supported byLVADs, particularly the VE HeartMate. The lesion also occurs occasionally infailing hearts of patients not supported by LVADs. The significance of the lesionin patients who require long-term LVAD support either as a bridge totransplantation or as destination therapy is unclear.
