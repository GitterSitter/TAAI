[Epub ahead of print]Clinical and Molecular Comparison of Pediatric and Adult Reverse Remodeling With Ventricular Assist Devices.Weia BC(1), Adachi I, Jacot JG.Author information: (1)Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.Ventricular assist device (VAD) support induces reverse remodeling of failingmyocardium that leads to occasional functional recovery of the adult heart. Whilethere have been numerous clinical reports in adult patients with end-stagecardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which hasincreasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardiumalso promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due toits greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) tosummarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recoveryfollowing VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatricmyocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients.Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions oftheir cohorts were weaned off from device support, but a lack of informationabout the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability todetermine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure orjust recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult geneexpression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40% of genes to beoppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct.These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinicalstrategies for bridge-to-recovery in children.Copyright Â© 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantationand Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
