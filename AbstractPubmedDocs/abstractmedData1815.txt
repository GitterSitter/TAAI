In Japan, however, cardiac transplantationhas not been performed since the first case in 1968, and even now, afterlegislation for the approval of brain death was passed in 1997, it is still notperformed regularly. Following long and steady efforts to enlighten Japanesesociety about the concept of brain death and the importance of organtransplantation, the first cardiac transplantation under the new legislation was successfully performed at Osaka University Hospital on February 1999. The patientwas 47-year-old male in the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had been supported with an implantable left ventricular assist device. This articlebriefly reviews the situation prior to the first case of cardiac transplantation under the new legislation and discusses the current status of the therapy inJapan.
