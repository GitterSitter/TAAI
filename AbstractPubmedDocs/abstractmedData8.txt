[Epub ahead ofprint]Biventricular failure in dextro-transposition of the great arteries correctedwith the Mustard procedure: VAD support of the systemic ventricle is enough.Schweiger M(1), Falk V, Biry M, HÃ¼bler M, Wilhelm MJ.Author information: (1)Department of Congenital Cardiovascular Surgery, University Children'sHospital Zurich, Zurich - Switzerland.INTRODUCTION: Miniaturization and surgical progress in the field of ventricularassist device (VAD) therapy will lead to an increasing use in grown-up patientswith congenital heart disease (GUCH). VAD implantation in such patients,especially biventricular VAD (BVAD) placement, can be very challenging,potentially associated with high morbidity and mortality.METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on a 47-year-old male patient in terminalbiventricular failure with pulmonary hypertension 40 years after a Mustardprocedure. The patient was successfully provided with a HVAD (HeartWare;HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) into the systemic ventricle as bridge totransplantation, with the sub-pulmonary ventricle left unsupported.DISCUSSION: We present our institutional strategy for VAD selection in thesepatients and highlight intra-corporeal VAD implantation technique.
