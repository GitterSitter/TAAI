Forlanini n.1, Rome 00151, Italy. antonioloforte@yahoo.itAn approach is reported for right ventricle temporary mechanical support inlong-term axial left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients preoperativelyjudged at high risk of right ventricular (RV) failure. The timing for RV assistdevice (RVAD) weaning and the technique for its removal through a rightmini-thoracotomy are described. This strategy provides a good outcome in LVADrecipients avoiding the risk of immediate postoperative RV failure.
