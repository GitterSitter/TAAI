However, the effect of long-term CF with lack of peripheral arterial wall motions on blood pressureregulation and end-organ arterial wall sclerosis, especially in the case oflong-term support (> 3 years), remains unclear.METHODS: Tissue samples obtained at autopsy from liver, kidney, coronaryarteries, and brain from 27 VAD recipients supported for > 180 days between 2000 and 2010 were histologically examined to assess vascular alterations, includingperivascular infiltrate, intravascular infiltrate, wall thickness, thrombosis,endothelial cell swelling, vessel wall necrosis, and peri-vascular fibrosis.Pulsatile-flow (PF) devices had been inserted in 9 patients and CF devices hadbeen inserted in 16. The pathologist was blinded to the group distribution.Demographic, pharmacologic, and clinical data were retrospectively analyzedbefore surgery and during the follow-up period of up to 24 months.RESULTS: Median duration of support was 467 days (range, 235-1,588 days) in thePF group and 263 days (range, 182-942 days) in the CF group. Demographic andclinical data before and after surgery were similar. Amiodarone was more oftenused during follow-up in CF group than in the PF group (61% vs 10%, p = 0.009).Throughout the follow-up period, mean arterial pressure did not differ betweenrecipients of the 2 pump types, nor did systolic and diastolic pressure, exceptat 2 weeks after VAD implantation, when systolic blood pressure was higher (p =0.05) and diastolic lower (p = 0.03) in the PF group. Histologic studies did not identify any relevant differences in arterial wall characteristics between the 2 groups.CONCLUSION: Long-term mechanical circulatory support with CF devices does notadversely influence arterial wall properties of the end-organ vasculature.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
