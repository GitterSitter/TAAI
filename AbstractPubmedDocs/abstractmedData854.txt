This increase is based largely on the results of severalrecently completed clinical trials with the new second-generation continuous-flowdevices that showed significant improvements in survival, functional capacity,and quality of life. Additional information on the use of the first- andsecond-generation left ventricular assist devices has come from a recentlyreleased report spanning the years 2006 to 2009, from the Interagency Registryfor Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored collaboration between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the scientific community. Theauthors review the latest clinical trials and data from the registry, with tight integration of the landmark molecular, cellular, and genomic research thataccompanies the reverse remodeling of the human heart in response to a leftventricular assist device and functional recovery that has been reported in asubset of these patients.Copyright Â© 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
