Ann Thorac Surg. 1997 Nov;64(5):1303-8.Mechanical support in dilated cardiomyopathy: signs of early left ventricularrecovery.Westaby S(1), Jin XY, Katsumata T, Taggart DP, Coats AJ, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Oxford Heart Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital,England.BACKGROUND: Recent reports have documented left ventricular recovery in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy off-loaded long term with a left ventricular assistdevice. We sought to document the natural history of left ventricular recovery.METHODS: We implanted the TCI left ventricular assist device without theintention to perform transplantation in 2 patients with dilated cardiomyopathywho had been rejected for transplantation. Both were in New York HeartAssociation functional class IV and had renal failure. One was a diabetic. Westudied left ventricular function with detailed echocardiography at 4, 6, and 8weeks postoperatively.RESULTS: With the left ventricular assist device turned off, we observed aprogressive increase in myocardial contractility beginning as early as 4 weeksafter implantation and improving progressively. Histologic examination showedresolution of myocytolysis in both patients.CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular recovery begins earlier than was previouslysuspected. Mechanical bridge to myocardial recovery is a potential approach totherapy for such patients.
