Preoperatively, patients undergoing LVAD and transplant had markedly reduced exercise time (mean 5.1 minutes [45%predicted] and 5.0 minutes [44% predicted], respectively), low peak oxygenconsumption (VO2; mean 11.5 mL · kg · min [43% predicted] and 11.9 mL · kg · min [38% predicted]), and abnormal ventilatory gas exchange (ratio of minuteventilation to carbon dioxide production [VE/VCO2] nadir 39.4 and 37.4). AfterLVAD and transplant, there were similar improvements in exercise time (mean Δ+1.2 vs. 1.7 minutes, respectively, P = .27) and VE/VCO2 nadir (mean Δ -3.7 vs.-4.2, P = .74). However, peak VO2 increased posttransplant but did not changepost-LVAD (mean Δ +5.4 vs. +0.9 mL · kg · min, respectively, P < .001). Mostpatients (72%) had a peak VO2 < 14 mL · kg · min post-LVAD.CONCLUSIONS: Although improvements in exercise capacity and gas exchange are seenafter LVAD and heart transplant, peak VO2 doesn't improve post-LVAD and remainsmarkedly abnormal in most patients.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
