AACN Clin Issues Crit Care Nurs. 1990 May;1(1):13-30.Update on ventricular assist devices.Barden C, Lee R.Ventricular assist devices serve as a valuable adjunct to therapy in the setting of profound heart failure. The two largest patient groups--postcardiotomy andthose being bridged to transplant--show an average 40-50% survival rate afterventricular assist. Several devices exist including centrifugal, pneumatic, andelectrical pumps. Options for ventricular assist include right (RVAD), left(LVAD), and biventricular (BiVAD) support. Knowledge regarding the devices andthe pathophysiology of severe heart failure is crucial for the critical carenurse caring for these patients. Critical care nursing interventions forbleeding, renal failure, infection, and other complications will be outlined.
