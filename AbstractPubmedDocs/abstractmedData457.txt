There was more interstitial fibrosis in both ICM and DCM compared with NF hearts.Hydroxyproline concentration was also significantly increased in DCM comparedwith NF samples. The expression of CTGF, transforming growth factor (TGF) β1,collagen (COL) 1-α1, COL3-α1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, and MMP9 mRNA in ICM and DCM were also significantly elevated compared with NF samples. AlthoughTGF-β1, CTGF, COL1-α1, and COL3-α1 mRNA levels were reduced by unloading, therewas only a modest reduction in tissue fibrosis and no difference in protein-boundhydroxyproline concentration between pre- and post-LVAD tissue samples. Thepersistent fibrosis may be related to a concomitant reduction in MMP9 mRNA andprotein levels following unloading.CONCLUSIONS: CTGF may be a key regulator of fibrosis during maladaptiveremodeling and progression to HF. Although mechanical unloading normalizes mostgenotypic and functional abnormalities, its effect on ECM remodeling during HF isincomplete.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
