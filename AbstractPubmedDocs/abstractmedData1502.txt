This issueis especially important as LVADs are now approved as destination therapy foradvanced heart failure patients who are not transplant candidates. In this study,we assess the association between BMI and outcomes after LVAD implantation.METHODS: A total of 222 patients who underwent LVAD placement (190bridge-to-transplant [BTT] and 32 destination therapy) were divided into fourgroups based on BMI (kg/m2) quartiles (group 1, <22.9; group 2, 22.9 to 26.3;group 3, 26.4 to 29.4; and group 4, >29.4) and were compared for outcomes.RESULTS: Eighty-four patients died on LVAD support. Six- and 12-month survival onLVAD for the four groups was 35%, 60%, 65%, and 73%, and 26%, 34%, 50%, and 66%(both p < 0.01), respectively. Similar trends were seen for the compositeendpoint of survival on LVAD and within 30 days posttransplant among BTTpatients. Infectious, neurological, respiratory, or bleeding complications werenot related to BMI. Patients with higher BMI tended to have a greater risk ofreoperations (43%, 49%, 53%, and 61%, p = 0.06) and renal complications (16%, 33%23%, 43%, p = 0.03). Age and history of thoracotomy were independently associatedwith mortality whereas higher BMI was not. Survival was worst for patients withlowest BMI.CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI did not adversely affect survival after LVAD implantationand therefore relative obesity should not be considered a contraindication forLVAD placement. Further work is needed to understand and manage risks for low BMIpatients.
