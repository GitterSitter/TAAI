We present our nearly 20-year experience withpediatric ventricular assist devices.METHODS: Between 1990 and April 2009, Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart AG,Berlin, Germany) was implanted in 94 children. Patients were compared accordingto period of treatment: group I, implantation between 1990 and 2001 (n = 45), andgroup II, implantation since 2002 (n = 49).RESULTS: Preoperative serum creatinine (1.2 vs 0.7 mg/dL, P = .002) and bilirubin(1.5 vs 1 mg/dL, P = .002) were lower in period II, and fewer patients wereartificially ventilated before surgery (26 vs 13, P = .002). In period I, morepatients were supported with biventricular assist devices (64% vs 22.5%, P <.001). Median time on support was shorter in period I (10 vs 40 days, P < .001). Success (weaning from system or heart transplant) was achieved in 49% and 69%,respectively (P = .043). Whereas in period I 17% of children younger than 1 year were discharged home after transplant or weaning, rate during period II was 93%(P < .001), in particular because of improvement in discharge rate of patientswith postcardiotomy heart failure (13% vs 50%). Rates of pump exchange forthrombus formation were 0.029/d in period I and 0.014/d in period II (P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONS: Recent results show significant improvements in survival anddischarge rate, especially for children younger than 1 year. Pediatric BerlinHeart EXCOR ventricular assist device may provide a safe mechanical supportstrategy in children with cardiogenic shock.Copyright © 2011. Published by Mosby, Inc.
