Acute myocarditis has a high mortality rateand may necessitate heart transplantation. The best short-term therapy available to support the patient may be a percutaneous left ventricular assist device. One such unit, the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device, can enablepatients to recover in a few days. Two of our patients who experienced profound, therapy-resistant heart failure arising from acute myocarditis were successfully supported by the TandemHeart. To the best of our knowledge, these are the 1streported cases in which the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist deviceserved as a bridge to recovery from acute fulminant myocarditis.PMCID: PMC1894709
