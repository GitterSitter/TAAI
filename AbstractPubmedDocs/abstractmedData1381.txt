Cardiac transplantation is a potentially lifesaving intervention for approximately 4000 advanced heart failure patients per year; however, the demand for donor hearts far exceeds the supply. Ventricular assist devices providetemporary support for patients with severe heart failure until myocardialrecovery occurs or a donor heart becomes available. For those ineligible fortransplantation, ventricular assist devices may be used permanently and havedemonstrated reduced mortality and an improved quality of life compared withcontinued medical therapy. Nonetheless, these devices are under-used, in part dueto the frequency of complications. Device-related infections are one of the most frequent sequelae of ventricular assist device placement and occur in 18-59% ofcases. Infections can involve any part of the device and confer substantialmorbidity and mortality. Here, we provide an introduction to ventricular assistdevices, explore the nature and pathogenesis of ventricular assist device-relatedinfections, discuss problems with diagnosis, and present treatment and preventionstrategies.
