We hypothesized thataxial-flow devices without biologic membranes or textured surfaces (HeartMate II;Thoratec; and DeBakey; MicroMed Cardiovascular, Inc, Houston, Tex) would causeless allosensitization than devices with such membranes and surfaces.METHODS: HeartMate II and DeBakey (n = 24) and HeartMate I (n = 36) devices were implanted from 1999 to 2006 in patients with severe heart failure cohort-matched for age, etiology, and support duration. Serum samples reacting with more than10% of the HLA reference panel were considered positive for anti-HLA antibodies. Endomyocardial biopsy samples were collected after transplant.RESULTS: There were no significant cohort differences in age, etiology, sex,blood transfusion, or support duration. Anti-HLA antibodies were not detected at implantation of either HeartMate II and DeBakey or HeartMate I devices; however, significant increases in anti-HLA antibodies were present within 1 and 3 monthsof support with HeartMate I but not HeartMate II and DeBakey devices. Overall,fewer patients with HeartMate II and DeBakey devices demonstrated positiveanti-HLA antibodies during support (8% vs 28%, P = .02), and fewer episodes ofacute rejection per patient were seen within the first 9 posttransplantmonths(0.31 vs 0.69, P = .052). Long-term posttransplant survival was notdifferent between groups.CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic support with HeartMate II and DeBakey devices producedless allosensitization than did HeartMate I devices. Device selection may improveclinical outcomes for high-risk patients.
