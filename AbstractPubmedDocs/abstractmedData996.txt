Right ventricular failure was defined as requiring a right ventricular assist device, 14 or moredays of inotropic support after implantation, and/or inotropic support startingmore than 14 days after implantation. Demographics, along with clinical,laboratory, and hemodynamic data, were compared between patients with and withoutright ventricular failure, and risk factors were identified.RESULTS: Overall, 30 (6%) patients receiving left ventricular assist devicesrequired a right ventricular assist device, 35 (7%) required extended inotropes, and 33 (7%) required late inotropes. A significantly greater percentage ofpatients without right ventricular failure survived to transplantation, recovery,or ongoing device support at 180 days compared with patients with rightventricular failure (89% vs 71%, P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that acentral venous pressure/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio of greater than 0.63 (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.3; P = .009), need forpreoperative ventilator support (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval,2.3-13.2; P < .001), and blood urea nitrogen level of greater than 39 mg/dL (oddsratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.1; P = .02) were independentpredictors of right ventricular failure after left ventricular assist deviceimplantation.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of right ventricular failure in patients with aHeartMate II ventricular assist device is comparable or less than that ofpatients with pulsatile-flow devices. Its occurrence is associated with worseoutcomes than seen in patients without right ventricular failure. Patients atrisk for right ventricular failure might benefit from preoperative optimizationof right heart function or planned biventricular support.2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
