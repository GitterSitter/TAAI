Crit Care Nurs Clin North Am. 1994 Mar;6(1):165-74.Mechanical support for congestive heart failure in infants and children.Jensen C, Hill CS.Pharmacologic therapy is the primary intervention for congestive heart failure inchildren. When pharmacologic support is unsuccessful, however, the use ofmechanical support is becoming more common. The use of intraaortic ballooncounterpulsation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ventricular assistdevices, and abdominal compression devices in infants and children isincreasingly becoming a viable option in pediatrics. Despite these advances,development of mechanical support for refractory CHF must continue for thedevelopment of ventricular assist devices and artificial hearts for infant andchildren as a bridge to transplant.
