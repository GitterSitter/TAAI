DeGasperis, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital,Milan, Italy. agaratti@tiscali.itInfection remains one of the most common causes of mortality during leftventricular assist device (LVAD) support, and poses major challenges to surgeons implanting these devices. We describe the case of a patient supported with anaxial-flow pump for dilative cardiomyopathy, who experienced drive-line exit-siteinfection and was treated with extensive surgical debridement and reconstruction by applying vacuum-assisted therapy. He remained infection-free after woundhealing and, after 7 months of mechanical support, had native heart functionrecovery and underwent LVAD removal.
