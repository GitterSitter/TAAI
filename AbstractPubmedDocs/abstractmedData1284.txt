Epub 2007 Jul 1.Caspofungin-resistant Aspergillus flavus after heart transplantation andmechanical circulatory support: a case report.Eschertzhuber S(1), Velik-Salchner C, Hoermann C, Hoefer D, Lass-Florl C.Author information: (1)Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Innsbruck MedicalUniversity, Innsbruck, Austria. stephan.eschertzhuber@uibk.ac.atInvasive aspergillosis (IA) is a severe complication in the post-transplantperiod in recipients of solid organs. Therefore, early diagnosis and specifictherapy of fungal infections in these patients are indispensable. We report thecase of a 49-year-old patient, who suffered from IA after cardiactransplantation, which was complicated by post-transplant right heart failurerequiring mechanical circulatory support using veno-arterial extracorporealmembrane oxygenation and a right ventricular assist device. Despite antifungaltreatment, the patient died 3 weeks after transplantation because of multi-organ failure secondary to IA. The isolated Aspergillus strains exhibited in vitroresistance to caspofungin.
