The surgical procedures includedcongenital heart surgery (n=35), heart transplantation (HTx) (n=21), coronaryartery bypass operation (CABG) and/or valvular operation (n=33), other operations(n=6) and 13 patients with ECMO support for bridge to recovery.RESULTS: The mean supporting time was 5.1±5.6 days. Overall, 30-day-survival was 40.2%. Best survival rates were seen after congenital heart surgery (24/35,65.7%) and after HTx (9/21, 42.9%); the worst rates were in the group of CABGand/or valvular operations (5/33, 15.2%), only ECMO support (3/13, 23.1%) andother operations (1/6, 16.7%). Fifty-four patients died while supported by ECMO, 15 were weaned from ECMO but died in hospital, 39 patients were weaned andsurvived. Causes of death were multi-organ failure (40.6%), bleeding (23.2%),persistent cardiac low output (21.7%), thrombembolic events (8.7%), and graftfailure (5.8%). Markers for adverse outcome were identified as older age, highbody weight, increased AST/GOT levels, and lower thrombocyte count in adults; andas higher levels of serum creatinine in pediatric patients.CONCLUSIONS: ECMO support showed best results in pediatric patients aftercongenital heart surgery and in patients after HTx in contrast to multimorbid,older patients with often irreversible myocardial damage.
