Routine postoperative careencompasses patients who have undergone emergency ventricular assist device (VAD)implantation for acute cardiogenic shock, as a bridge to decision making, andsemi-elective patients who have undergone VAD implantation for end-stage heartfailure, either as destination therapy or as a bridge to heart transplantation.Early postoperative management should focus on haemodynamic optimisation,including fluid and inotrope therapy, VAD settings and support of rightventricular function. Echocardiography is an essential tool in optimisinghaemodynamics and identifying complications. Early postoperative complicationsinclude bleeding, arrhythmias, right ventricular failure and infection. Latepostoperative problems include bleeding, thrombosis and thrombo-embolism, device failure and psychological problems. In a small percentage of patients, weaningand explantation of the VAD are possible. For patients undergoing VADimplantation for destination therapy, end-of-life care planning should form part of the multidisciplinary care of the patient.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
