In May 2012 theopening of a new heart failure and transplant unit with 9 beds together with the procurement of necessary devices at Semmelweis University accomplished this need.AIM: The aim of the authors was to report their initial experience obtained inthis new cardiac assist device program.METHOD: Since May, 2012, mechanical circulatory support system was applied in 89 cases in 72 patients. Indication for support were end stage heart failurerefractory to medical treatment and acute left or right heart failure.RESULTS: Treatment was initiated for acute graft failure after hearttransplantation in 27 cases, for end stage heart failure in 24 cases, for acutemyocardial infarction in 21 cases, for acute postcardiotomy heart failure in 14cases, for severe respiratory insufficiency in 2 cases and for drug intoxication in one case. Among the 30 survivor of the whole program 13 patients weresuccessfully transplanted.CONCLUSIONS: The available devices can cover all modalities of current bridgetherapy from short term support through medium support to heart transplantationor long term support and destination therapy. These conditions made possible the successful start of a new cardiac assist device program.Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher.
