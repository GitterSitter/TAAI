In children, particularlyin small infants, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and centrifugal pumps have been most widely used in the past. These systems are preferred for support after cardiac operations and for use in patients who have concomitant respiratoryfailure, but they are suitable for short-term application only and intensive careis obligatory. VADs are designed for long-term application and allow patients to be discharged home. Pneumatic pulsatile VADs have been available in pediatricsizes since 1992. Currently at our institution, 74 children have been supportedwith pediatric extracorporeal VADs for up to 14 months. In the past five yr, anotable rise in survival has been achieved by improvements in pump design andpre- and post-operative management. We have been able to discharge 78% of theinfants under one yr old. In this review, our current VAD experience in children will be presented in the light of improvements in decision-making, devicetechnology, and implantation techniques, and in coagulation monitoring andanticoagulation. Additionally, new developments in the field of pediatric assist devices will be presented.
