Epub 2008 Dec 26.Successful ABO-incompatible heart transplantation in a child despite blood-group sensitization after ventricular assist device support.Urschel S(1), Dalla Pozza R, Loeff M, Schmitz C, Sodian R, Schmoeckel M, KowalskiC, Netz H.Author information: (1)Pediatric Cardiology and Intensive Care, Klinikum Grosshadern, LudwigMaximilians University, Munich, Germany. simon.urschel@med.uni-muenchen.deIn the first two yr of life blood-group incompatible (ABO-incompatible) hearttransplantation can be performed leading to immune tolerance to donor bloodgroup. Antibody titers should be below 1:4. VAD use is correlated withsensitization toward blood-group antigens. A boy was diagnosed with dilatedcardiomyopathy at nine months of age and listed for 0-compatible transplantation.Progressive heart failure required implantation of a left VAD. His listing wasextended for ABO-incompatible transplantation despite antibody titers of 1:32anti-A and 1:8 anti-B. After 26 days on VAD, he was transplanted with a B donorheart. No hyperacute or acute rejection occurred in 12 months post-transplant.Anti-B antibodies rose to a maximum of 1:2. No use of rituximab or plasmapheresiswas required. There are no signs of graft vasculopathy. This indicates thatinclusion criteria for ABO-incompatible transplantation may be extended toimmediate cases. This is the first case with a healthy immune system to showsigns of tolerance development after ABO-incompatible heart transplantation with increased prior antibody titers and without specific treatment.
