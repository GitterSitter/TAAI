Left ventricular assist systems have been applied tothese patients with increasing frequency and support duration. This situationcalls for more reliably applied long-term support devices and is also stimulatingthe investigation of destination therapy or bridge to recovery use of the device.This is particularly relevant in countries where organ shortages are crucial.However, reports in this area are still limited, and there exist several problemsto be solved before wider application of these strategies is possible in clinicalpractice. We review currently available devices with special reference to theirrespective roles and limitations quoting our own experiences over the pastseveral years, and discuss future perspectives of ventricular assist devices.
