ASAIO Trans. 1988 Jul-Sep;34(3):284-9.Development of an epicardial circulatory assist device.Uchida N(1), Jacobs G, Chen JF, Fujimoto LK, Kasick J, Emoto H, Sakakibara N,Nos√© Y.Author information: (1)Department of Artificial Organs, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44106.The overall purpose of this project was to develop a circulatory assist devicethat could be used as a bridge to heart transplantation. Although heart muscledamage was one of the disadvantages with the original epicardial assist devices, as long as no bleeding occurs, such trauma would be of secondary importance inthis particular application. The development of the proposed epicardialcirculatory assist device (ECAD) was evolutionary in nature, with the secondprototype design based on the lessons learned from that of the first. In vivoresults from both phases of the project are reported. ECAD prototype 1 (ECAD-1)was composed of a flexible outer housing and two driving balloons. Fixation tothe heart was adjustable for various heart sizes using Velcro fasteners. Thedesign of the ECAD prototype 2 (ECAD-2) was based on the results of ECAD-1.Fixation to the heart was accomplished by suturing the outer housing onto theheart along the anterior descending artery and at the posterior atrioventricular groove. Each device was tested in five dogs. ECAD-1 was able to maintain thesystemic circulation for 5 hours. However, unstable fixation and myocardialdamage due to rubbing were the major problems. ECAD-2 passive effects on natural heart filling were acceptable. Under conditions of severe heart failure, a flowof more than 85% of control was obtained with a driving rate of 90-110 beats/min and 30% systole. The longest pumping was conducted for 8 hours. The ECAD wasdemonstrated to be a device useful in assisting the failing heart for shortperiods. Proper design will play a fundamental role in successful extended use.
