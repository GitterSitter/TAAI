Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2000 Jul;12(3):220-8.Mechanical support for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock.Goldstein DJ(1), Oz MC.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY,USA.Postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS) results in substantial morbidity andmortality. Despite intraaortic balloon pump and inotropic support, some patients with PCCS continue to have a refractory low cardiac output. For these patients,more effective ventricular assistance is imperative to prevent death. Multiplesystems are available for the short-term support of patients with PCCS.Regardless of the device employed, only 25% of these patients survive and aredischarged home. Two strategies, however, may improve the outcome of PCCS. One islong-term support by an implantable assist device, which can allow optimalventricular unloading. Unfortunately, not all cardiac surgery centers offer this type of support. Therefore, the other strategy is the creation of postcardiotomy referral centers that offer long-term support or heart transplantation. Suchcenters would conserve scarce donor organs, maximize the chance of myocardialrecovery, and yield expertise applicable not only to device recipients but alsoto critically ill heart-failure patients who do not need an implantable pump.
