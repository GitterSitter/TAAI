Rapidhemodynamic deterioration occurred despite maximal medical treatment, and she wassupported initially with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation converted to aBerlin Heart EXCOR left ventricular assist device. Long-distance airtransportation of the patient was accomplished 3 wks after implantation fromMarseille, France, to Denver, Colorado. No adverse hemodynamic effects wereencountered during the 13.5-hr flight (8770 km). The patient did not recoversufficient cardiac function and underwent successful orthotopic hearttransplantation 3 months after the initial event.CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that long-distance air transportation ofpediatric patients using the Berlin Heart EXCOR mobile unit as a bridge torecovery or transplantation is feasible and appears safe.
