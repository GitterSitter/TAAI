Electronic address: jkirklin@uab.edu.BACKGROUND: Comorbidities complicate recovery and contribute to mortality afterimplant of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Coexistent cardiac and renal dysfunction (so-called cardiorenal syndrome) increases the risk of death, bothwith advanced heart failure and after LVAD implantation. We analyzed patientsfrom the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assist Circulatory Support tobetter estimate postimplant mortality according to the severity of renaldysfunction.METHODS: Patients with a continuous-flow LVAD were grouped according to theirpre-implant level of renal dysfunction: severe was defined as dialysis and/orestimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min; moderate if eGFR was 30 to 59 ml/min or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was > 60 mg/dl; and mild or no renaldysfunction if eGFR was ≥ 60 ml/min and BUN was < 60 mg/dl.RESULTS: Of the 4,917 patients with a continuous-flow LVAD implanted between June2006 and March 2012, 3,160 (64%) were identified with mild or no renaldysfunction, 1,475 (30%) with moderate dysfunction, and 282 (6%) with severedysfunction. Worsening renal dysfunction correlated with decreased survival, withnearly a 20% reduction in the 2-year survival going from low to severedysfunction. The major negative survival effect occurred during the first 3months. Combination of severe renal dysfunction and cardiogenic shock predictedthe highest early mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Pre-implant renal dysfunction predicts higher mortality after LVADimplant. The progressive reduction in survival with higher grades of renaldysfunction supports consideration of LVAD implant before cardiorenal syndrome isadvanced. For patients with severe renal dysfunction and other majorcomorbidities, initial support with a temporary device while awaiting organrecovery before implanting a durable pump could be considered.© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published byInternational Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.
