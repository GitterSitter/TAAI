This report describes the midterm follow-up of66 patients who were allowed to leave the hospital under left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support with Novacor or HeartMate systems. Between May 1994 andJanuary 2000, 66 patients (9 women, 57 men, between 15 and 68 years old) underLVAD support fulfilled our criteria for being discharged home on the device.Intent to treat comprised bridging to transplantation in 59 patients, bridging torecovery in 5 patients, and alternative to transplantation in 2 patients.Forty-four patients received support with Novacor, 18 patients with the VEHeartMate, 2 patients with centrifugal pumps and Novacor, and 1 patient each withNovacor and Thoratec/Medos HIA-VAD. The mean out-of-hospital (OOH) follow-upperiod was 162 +/- 187 days, with a cumulative OOH experience of 30 patientyears. Twenty-nine patients were not readmitted, and 37 patients were readmitted 54 times (23 patients were readmitted once, 11 patients twice, and 3 patients 3times). The primary reasons for readmission included neurologic disorders andinfection complications. At 229 days, 50% of all patients were free fromreadmission. The readmission rate was 1.8 patient/year. Sixteen patients diedwhile on LVAD support (24%). Our midterm follow-up results show the safety andefficacy of this therapeutic option. Acceptable hospital readmission ratesstrongly support the future use of this technology as an alternative totransplantation in managing end-stage heart failure patients.
