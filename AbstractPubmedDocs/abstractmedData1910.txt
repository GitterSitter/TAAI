The success of such devices in the short and medium term as abridge to transplantation has led to their evaluation as a long-term destination therapy for end-stage heart disease.METHODS: Between August 1990 and February 1997, 85 patients with end-stage heart disease underwent insertion of implantable LVADs. Fifty-two patients underwentpneumatic device insertion and 32 patients received a vented electric device.RESULTS: Patients were supported for a mean of 109+/-13 days for an overallsurvival to transplant (54) or explant (3) of 73%. Nineteen patients weredischarged from the hospital on a mean of postoperative day 41+/-4 (range, 17-68)for an outpatient support time of 108+/-30 days (range, 2-466). Of 12 patientssupported after postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock, 10 (82%) survived to hospitaldischarge. Perioperative right ventricular failure was treated in most patientswith inotropic agents and inhaled nitric oxide with only six patients requiringright ventricular assist device support. Thromboembolic rate was low (0.016events/patient-month) despite minimal or no anticoagulation in all cases.CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular assist device support has evolved to become anoutpatient therapy with excellent survival rates and an acceptable morbidity.Accordingly, wearable LVADs should be studied as permanent treatment options for patients who are not transplant candidates.PMCID: PMC1191061
