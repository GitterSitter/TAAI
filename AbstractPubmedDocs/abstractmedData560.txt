With an increasing demand on the supply of organs available for heart transplant, alternative strategies arebeing sought to maintain patients with end-stage cardiac failure for longerperiods of time. Devices that support a failing heart, allowing cardiac recovery in some cases, or more commonly accommodate the time to source a suitable donorheart for transplantation, provide crucial therapeutic options. Extra-corporealmembrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices are the mainstay of suchbridging therapy. Although providing essential support to critically illpatients, they are not without their own significant associated risks.Therapeutic advances aim to reduce the risks associated with these bridgingsystems, and new artificial devices are being developed to improve thissupportive care.
