ASAIO J. 2003 Jul-Aug;49(4):475-9.Biventricular support in patients with profound cardiogenic shock: a singlecenter experience.Magliato KE(1), Kleisli T, Soukiasian HJ, Tabrizi R, Coleman B, Hickey A, CzerLS, Blanche C, Cheng W, Fontana GP, Kass RM, Raissi SS, Trento A.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA,USA.Options for managing heart failure patients with cardiogenic shock refractory to inotropic and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy are limited. Ventricularassist devices (VADs) can bridge these patients to heart transplantation.However, controversy exists over whether extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) before VAD placement is beneficial. We report our use of biventricularassist devices (BiVADs) as a direct bridge to transplant. Since July 1999, 19Thoratec BiVADs were implanted for heart failure unresponsive to medical therapy.Patient ages ranged from 20 to 67 years. Causes of heart failure includedidiopathic 32%, ischemic 26%, postcardiotomy 21%, and other 21%. All patientswere in cardiogenic shock, and three were receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) before implant. Preimplant conditions included IABP 89%, mechanicalventilation 68%, three or more inotropes 84%, hyperbilirubinemia 59%, acute renalfailure 63%, and hemodialysis 16%. Fifty-nine percent of patients bridgedsuccessfully to transplantation, with 90% posttransplant survival. Duration ofBiVAD support ranged from 0 to 91 days, with two patients currently on supportawaiting transplantation. Complications included bleeding requiring reoperation26%, stroke 11%, infection (any positive culture) 68%, and cannula site infection5%. The Thoratec BiVAD can successfully be used as a direct bridge totransplantation in heart failure patients with cardiogenic shock.
