Epub 2012 Feb 10.Prognosis of right ventricular failure in patients with left ventricular assistdevice based on decision tree with SMOTE.Wang Y(1), Simon M, Bonde P, Harris BU, Teuteberg JJ, Kormos RL, Antaki JF.Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. yajuanwan@gmail.comRight ventricular failure is a significant complication following implantation ofa left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which increases morbidity and mortality.Consequently, researchers have sought predictors that may identify patients atrisk. However, they have lacked sensitivity and/or specificity. This studyinvestigated the use of a decision tree technology to explore the preoperativedata space for combinatorial relationships that may be more accurate and precise.We retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 patients with initial LVADimplantation at the Artificial Heart Program, University of Pittsburgh MedicalCenter, between May 1996 and October 2009. Among those patients, 27 laterrequired a right ventricular assist device (RVAD+) and 156 remained on LVAD(RVAD-) until the time of transplantation or death. A synthetic minorityoversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to the RVAD+ group to compensate forthe disparity of sample size. Twenty-one resampling levels were evaluated, withdecision tree model built for each. Among these models, the top six predictors ofthe need for an RVAD were transpulmonary gradient (TPG), age, internationalnormalized ratio (INR), heart rate (HR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),prothrombin time, and right ventricular systolic pressure. TPG was identified to be the most predictive variable in 15 out of 21 models, and constituted the firstsplitting node with 7 mmHg as the breakpoint. Oversampling was shown to improvethe senstivity of the models monotonically, although asymptotically, while thespecificity was diminished to a lesser degree. The model built upon 5X synthetic RVAD+ oversampling was found to provide the best compromise between sensitivityand specificity, included TPG (layer 1), age (layer 2), right atrial pressure(layer 3), HR (layer 4,7), INR (layer 4, 9), alanine aminotransferase (layer 5), white blood cell count (layer 5,6, &7), the number of inotrope agents (layer 6), creatinine (layer 8), AST (layer 9, 10), and cardiac output (layer 9). Itexhibited 85% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 0.87 area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (RoC), which was found to be greatly improvedcompared to previously published studies.
