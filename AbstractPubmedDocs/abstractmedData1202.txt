The authors present the case of a 61-year-old man, with a past history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure, who came to the emergency room due to acute decompensation. During hospital stay hedeveloped cardiogenic shock and inotropic support was initiated, followed bymechanical circulatory assistance with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, as a bridge to heart transplantation. The authors discuss theoretical considerationsconcerning subtypes and etiology of AHF, and indications for the use ofmechanical support and heart transplantation.
