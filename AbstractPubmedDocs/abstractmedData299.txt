Therefore, the development of a ventricular assist device (VAD) specific to these cases is extremely important for therapeutic effectiveness. We present 5 cases of severe heart failure that were managed by ventricular assistdevice implantation, as a bridge to transplantation.METHODS: We examined the clinical course of 5 patients (4 boys, 1 girl; mean age,10.6 ± 1.5 years; range, 8-12 years) who underwent implantation of a pneumaticextracorporeal ventricular assist device between February 2004 and May 2009. Fourpatients had dilated cardiomyopathy and one had corrected transposition of thegreat arteries.RESULTS: The mean period between onset of heart failure and ventricular assistdevice implantation was 594 ± 750 days (range, 94-1702 days), and the meanduration of ventricular assist support was 112 ± 98 days (range, 44-284 days).Four patients underwent heart transplantation overseas and one died of cerebralhemorrhage.CONCLUSIONS: Careful management of pediatric VAD patients and development of adevice designed specifically for pediatric patients are essential for improvingclinical outcomes in the future.
