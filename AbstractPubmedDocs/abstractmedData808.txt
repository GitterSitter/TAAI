Epub 2011 Apr 13.Biventricular cannulation is superior regarding hemodynamics and organ recoveryin patients on biventricular assist device support.Schlensak C(1), Schibilsky D, Siepe M, Brehm K, Klemm R, von Wattenwyl R,Berchthold-Herz M, Benk C, Beyersdorf F.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, University Medical Center, Freiburg,Germany. christian.schlensak@uniklinik-freiburg.deBACKGROUND: Adequate pump flow is a prerequisite for recovery of end-organfailure and outcome in patients treated with a biventricular assist device(BiVAD). We hypothesized that hemodynamics and organ recovery would improve afterbiventricular, apical cannulation compared with right atrial cannulation.METHODS: Between 2003 and 2009, we treated 31 patients (21 men, 10 women; meanage, of 43 ± 15 years) with a paracorporeal BiVAD (Thoratec BVAD, Pleasanton,CA). In 15 of 31 patients, the inflow cannula of the right VAD (RVAD) waspositioned inside the right ventricle (RV) through the RV apex (biapical) insteadof the right atrium (conventional). We analyzed pump flow, driving pressure, and vacuum of the Thoratec driving console and recovery of kidney (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) and liver function (bilirubin).RESULTS: Mean duration of BiVAD support was 84 ± 72 days. BiVAD weaning wassuccessful in 4 of 31 patients (13%), 12 underwent cardiac transplantation (39%),and 15 (48%) died. We observed significantly higher pump flow of the LVAD andRVAD in patients after biapical cannulation compared with those with conventionalcannulation (LVAD, 5.6 ± 0.4 vs 5.1 ± 0.3 liters/min, p = 0.002; and RVAD: 4.9 ± 0.3 vs 4.2 ± 0.3 liters/min, p < 0.001). This superior circulatory supportcorrelated with faster recovery of kidney function.CONCLUSION: Cardiac support with a BiVAD is hemodynamically more effective after biventricular apical cannulation compared with conventional right atrialcannulation. Consequently, higher pump flow results in better end-organ recovery using biapical cannulation.Copyright © 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
