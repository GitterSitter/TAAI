The core category was support and self-preservationin close relatives. We constructed the support cascade model illustrating supportfrom close relatives to the patient (main obligation) and to other family members(other obligations), and support from personal and professional relations to the close relatives.CONCLUSIONS: Support from close relatives potentially benefits patients, family, healthcare providers, and society in general.
