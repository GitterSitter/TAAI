Preoperative patient condition such asNYHA functional class IV, depressed contractility, and decompensation requiringan emergency procedure were associated with reduced event-free survival. Otherrisk factors included early date of surgery, lack of experience, and extendedmyocardial resection. Performance of PLV reached a peak by 1998 and was largelyabandoned by 2000 except in Asia, where experienced institutes continue toperform PLV in patients in better condition with preserved myocardialcontractility.CONCLUSION: Avoidance of delineated risk factors appears to improve recentsurvival and may help stratify high- or low-risk patients for PLV. An integrated approach with mechanical and biological circulatory assist may improve prognosis for patients with dilated failing hearts. While frequency of PLV has decreased,the concept of ventricular volume reduction has been extended to other volumereduction procedures and less invasive procedures now under clinical trial.
