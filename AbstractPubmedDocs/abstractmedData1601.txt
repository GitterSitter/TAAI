Five of 7 in the transplantgroup achieved survival to discharge (71%), relative to 5 of 15 in thenontransplant group (33%). Complications between the two groups were similar,although the transplant group experienced a higher rate of renal insufficiency(57% versus 13%, P = 0.05).CONCLUSION: Severe acute rejection with cardiogenic shock and primary graftfailure are two conditions that may warrant mechanical ventricular support in thecardiac transplant patient. Transplant patients with these conditions have a highrate of ventricular functional recovery, greater than nontransplant patientssupported with the same device and for a similar period of time. Although theincidence of renal insufficiency was higher, the majority of transplant patients who were supported with the BVS5000 achieved survival to discharge.
