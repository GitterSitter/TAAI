The purpose ofthe present investigation was to determine the prognostic ability of severalestablished peak Vo(2) prediction equations in a large heart failure cohort.METHODS AND RESULTS: One thousand one hundred sixty-five subjects (70% males;age, 57.0+/-13.8 years; ischemic etiology, 43%) diagnosed with heart failureunderwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Percent-predicted peak Vo(2) wascalculated according to normative values proposed by Wasserman and Hansen(equation), Jones et al (equation), the Cooper Clinic (below low fitnessthreshold), a Veteran's Administration male referral data set (4 equations), and the St James Take Heart Project for women (equation). The prognostic significanceof percent-predicted Vo(2) values derived from the 2 latter, sex-specificequations were assessed collectively. There were 179 major cardiac events (117deaths, 44 heart transplantations, and 18 left ventricular assist deviceimplantations) during the 2-year tracking period (annual event rate, 10%).Measured peak Vo(2) and all percent-predicted peak Vo(2) calculations weresignificant univariate predictors of adverse events (chi(2)> or =31.9, P<0.001)and added prognostic value to ventilatory efficiency (VE/Vco(2) slope), thestrongest cardiopulmonary exercise testing predictor of adverse events(chi(2)=150.7, P<0.001), in a multivariate regression. The Wasserman/Hansenprediction equation provided optimal prognostic information.CONCLUSIONS: Actual peak Vo(2) and the percent-predicted models included in this analysis all were significant predictors of adverse events. It seems that thepercent-predicted peak Vo(2) value derived from the Wasserman/Hansen equationsmay outperform other expressions of this cardiopulmonary exercise testingvariable.PMCID: PMC2747756
