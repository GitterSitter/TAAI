Z Exp Chir Transplant Kunstliche Organe. 1984;17(2):89-97.[Animal experiments using the left-ventricular-assist system].[Article in German]Oldag D, Urbaszek W, Böttcher M, Krüger A, Behrens P, Scharf W, Behrend D, NebeB, Graf B.The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was tested in 27 sternotomied dogsusing hemodynamic parameters. The left ventricular failure was attained by thestarvation of the coronary vessels. The use of cannulae and ventriculi fittingfor the size of the animals, and a diastolic vacuum were an essential premise foran effective support of the left heart. By variation of the latent period, thesystole duration, and the operating pressures were selected for optimal pumpingconditions. The effectiveness of the LVAD was shown by the detected pressure and flow parameters.
