Epub 2011 Sep 13.Myostatin is elevated in congenital heart disease and after mechanical unloading.Bish LT(1), George I, Maybaum S, Yang J, Chen JM, Sweeney HL.Author information: (1)Department of Physiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America. bish@mail.med.upenn.eduBACKGROUND: Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass whoseactivity is upregulated in adult heart failure (HF); however, its role incongenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown.METHODS: We studied myostatin and IGF-1 expression via Western blot in cardiactissue at varying degrees of myocardial dysfunction and after biventricularsupport in CHD by collecting myocardial biopsies from four patient cohorts: A)adult subjects with no known cardiopulmonary disease (left ventricle, LV), (AdultNormal), (n = 5); B) pediatric subjects undergoing congenital cardiac surgerywith normal RV size and function (right ventricular outflow tract, RVOT),(n = 3); C) pediatric subjects with worsening but hemodynamically stable LVfailure [LV and right ventricle (LV, RV,)] with biopsy collected at the time oforthotopic heart transplant (OHT), (n = 7); and D) pediatric subjects withdecompensated bi-ventricular failure on BiVAD support with biopsy collected atOHT (LV, RV, BiVAD), (n = 3).RESULTS: The duration of HF was longest in OHT patients compared to BIVAD. Theduration of BiVAD support was 4.3±1.9 days. Myostatin expression wassignificantly increased in LV-OHT compared to RV-OHT and RVOT, and was increased more than double in decompensated biventricular HF (BiVAD) compared to both OHTand RVOT. An increased myostatin/IGF-1 ratio was associated with ventriculardysfunction.CONCLUSIONS: Myostatin expression in increased in CHD, and the myostatin/IGF-1ratio increases as ventricular function deteriorates. Future investigation isnecessary to determine if restoration of the physiologic myostatin/IGF-1 ratiohas therapeutic potential in HF.PMCID: PMC3172210
