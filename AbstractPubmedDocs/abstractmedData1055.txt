Microcirculation was investigated using ahand-held Sidestream Dark Field imaging device. Perfused capillary density (PCD) and capillary red blood cell velocity (cRBCv) were assessed before deviceimplantation (T0), immediately after implantation (T1), and 1 day afterimplantation (T2).RESULTS: Median patient age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR] 38-52 years) and 70% were men. MCS significantly decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0.04). Median cardiac power index increased (0.29 [IQR, 0.21-0.34] W/m(2) atT0 vs 0.48 [IQR, 0.39-0.54] W/m(2) at T1, p = 0.005) as well as median centralvenous oxygen saturation (54% [IQR, 46%-61%] at T0 vs 78% [IQR, 67%-85%] at T1, p= 0.007). There was a 3-fold increase in tissue perfusion index (sub-lingual PCD x cRBCv) during mechanical circulatory support (573 [IQR, 407-693] at T0 vs 1909 [IQR, 1771-2835] at T1, p = 0.005). Microcirculatory parameters remained improvedat T2.CONCLUSION: Mechanical circulatory support for severe heart failure is associatedwith a consistent, significant, and sustained improvement in tissue perfusion, asmeasured at the bedside by a 2-dimensional microcirculation imaging technique.
