A 29-year-old woman had undergone anthracycline-based chemotherapy as ateenager in 1991 and 1992 and received a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy 10years later. Optimal medical therapy had initially controlled the symptoms ofheart failure. However, in June 2006, the symptoms worsened to New York HeartAssociation functional class IV status. We implanted a continuous-flow leftventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation; of note, a leftventricular core biopsy at that time showed no replacement fibrosis. Thepatient's clinical status improved thereafter, enabling left ventricular assistdevice ex-plantation after 17 months. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of left ventricular assist device support to reverse chronicanthracycline-induced heart failure.PMCID: PMC3423291
