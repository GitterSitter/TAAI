J Formos Med Assoc. 2000 Apr;99(4):336-40.HeartMate left ventricular assist device for long-term circulatory support.Hsu RB(1), Chu SH, Chien CY, Ko WJ, Chou NK, Chen YS, Wang SS.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.We describe three successful cases of HeartMate left ventricular assist device(LVAD; Thermo Cardiosystems, Woburn, MA, USA) implantation in patients withend-stage heart failure for long-term circulatory support. Patient 1 was a34-year-old woman with postpartum cardiomyopathy. Patients 2 and 3 were bothmales with dilated cardiomyopathy, 50 years and 21 years of age, respectively.They all presented in cardiogenic shock with decreased sensorium and anuria.Temporary mechanical support with an intra-aortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was needed for life support. Because bleeding andright ventricular failure often occur after HeartMate LVAD implantation, we used a Vascutek tube (Vascutek Ltd, Inchinnan, Scotland) graft to wrap inflow andoutflow valve conduits and ECMO as a bridge to HeartMate LVAD implantation.Following surgery, cardiac output increased from 2.70, 2.06 and 2.53 L/min to4.50, 5.80 and 5.00 L/min in the three patients. HeartMate LVAD can provide safe and stable long-term circulatory support without the need for anticoagulation.One of the patients remained on HeartMate for 287 days before undergoingsuccessful heart transplantation. Patients with HeartMate LVAD are ambulatory andmay be discharged while awaiting heart transplantation. Heart function mayrecover after long-term ventricular unloading with HeartMate LVAD.
