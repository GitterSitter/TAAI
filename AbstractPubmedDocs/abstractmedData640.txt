Epub 2012 Apr 27.The potential to avoid heart transplantation in children: outpatient bridge torecovery with an intracorporeal continuous-flow left ventricular assist device ina 14-year-old.Lowry AW(1), Adachi I, Gregoric ID, Jeewa A, Morales DL.Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Lillie Frank Abercrombie Section of PediatricCardiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX77054, USA. lowry@bcm.eduPediatric mechanical circulatory support has evolved considerably in the pastdecade. Improvements in device design and availability have led to increasedshort-, medium-, and long-term support options for pediatric patients with heart failure. Most pediatric mechanical circulatory support is utilized as a bridge totransplant and as a bridge to recovery in patients with temporary etiologies ofheart failure (i.e., myocarditis). Described herein is our recovery program, and we report our experience as an independent pediatric ventricular assist deviceprogram with an intracorporeal continuous-flow device employed as anout-of-hospital bridge to recovery for a child with end-stage chronic heartfailure.Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
