Epub 2014 Aug 29.Gender differences in continuous-flow left ventricular assist device therapy as abridge to transplantation: a risk-adjusted comparison using a propensityscore-matching analysis.Weymann A(1), Patil NP, Sabashnikov A, Mohite PN, García Sáez D, Amrani M,Bahrami T, De Robertis F, Wahlers T, Banner NR, Popov AF, Simon AR.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical CirculatorySupport, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of Cardiac Surgery, Heart Center, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.The purpose of this study was to evaluate gender differences regarding outcomeafter continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cfLVAD) implantation. Thestudy was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Included were24 consecutive female cfLVAD recipients and 24 male recipients (62.5% HeartMateII, 37.5% HeartWare) who received their devices between July 2007 and May 2013.Subjects were matched using propensity score analysis based on age, diagnosis,body surface area, preoperative mechanical circulatory support, heart failureseverity score (INTERMACS class), and comorbidities. Female patients weresignificantly sicker before operation. After propensity score matching, therewere no statistically significant differences in demographics or clinicalbaseline characteristics between male and female LVAD recipients. Also, there wasa trend towards a longer postoperative intensive care unit stay in the femalegroup (median 9 days [interquartile range 5-17] versus 15 days [interquartilerange 8-33]; P < 0.061) and higher postoperative bilirubin values (median14 mmol/L [interquartile range 10-17] versus 21 mmol/L [interquartile range13-30]). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups interms of outcome (P < 0.569). The overall survival was comparable between the twogroups (log rank P < 0.389). Half (50%) of female patients required inotropicsupport for more than 7 days compared with 21.7% in the male group (P < 0.048).Half (50%) of female recipients required short-term postoperative rightventricular assist device implantation compared with 16.7% in the male group(P < 0.014). In conclusion, cfLVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation isassociated with longer duration of inotropic support and higher requirement forpostoperative mechanical right ventricular support in women with similar survivalrates. Further studies are required to identify additional demographic andclinical factors that modulate outcomes and will enhance the ability torisk-stratify cfLVAD recipients.Copyright © 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantationand Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
