AAs requiring treatment were recorded, regardless of symptoms. Using Cox models with and without a 60-day blanking period, risk factors for early and late AAs weredetermined.RESULTS: In total, there were 271 AAs in 231 patients (21%), most of whichoccurred within the first 60 days. Patients with and without AAs had similarsurvival (p = 0.16). Serum creatinine (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.49 per unitincrease, 1.18 to 1.88; p < 0.001) and ejection fraction (HR = 0.98 per 1%increase, 0.95 to 0.999; p = 0.04) were associated with AAs in a multivariablemodel. Although quality of life (QoL) and functional status improved in allpatients, those with AAs had worse unadjusted QoL (p < 0.001) and a decreasedrate of improvement in six-minute walk distance over six to 24 months postimplant(p = 0.016).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-fifth of LVAD patients have AAs, most commonlywithin the first 60 days of support. Preoperative creatinine is a strong riskfactor for early and late AAs. Although AAs do not impact survival, they areassociated with decreased functional status and QoL improvements during LVADsupport.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
