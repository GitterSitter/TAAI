Patients with emergency LVAD placement werecompared with the remainder in a retrospective manner. Parameters studiedincluded underlying heart disease, preimplantation dysfunction of kidney, liver, lung, and cerebrum, interval of mechanical support, outcome, and complications.RESULTS: Patients with emergency LVAD placement predominantly were seen withpostcardiotomy heart failure (47%) or acute myocarditis (20%) (group A) whereaselective and urgent candidates for LVAD implantation mainly had dilativecardiomyopathy (67%) or ischemic heart disease (30%) (group B). The incidence of secondary organ failure was significantly higher for all organs in group Apatients (p < .01). Mean support interval in patients who underwent emergencyLVAD implantation was lower (74+/-79 days vs 115+/-80 days), and fewer patientscould be forwarded to heart transplantation in this group (22% vs 78%, p < .01). Moreover, bleeding complications were increased in group A (66% vs 30%, p < .01),but not thromboembolism and infection.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the overall success rate after emergency LVADimplantation was lower, with bleeding being the most frequent complication. Toachieve acceptable outcomes in disastrous situations, LVADs should be placed asearly as possible.
