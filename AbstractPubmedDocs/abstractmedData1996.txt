Crit Care Nurs Q. 1995 May;18(1):65-76.Bridge to cardiac transplantation: current practice.Nastala CJ.Cardiac transplantation is primarily limited by the undersupply of donor organs. An estimated 20% of all heart transplant candidates will die before a donor heartbecomes available. This high pretransplant mortality rate has prompted theinstitution of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to transplant forthose who develop severe cardiac failure before cardiac transplantation.Actuarial survival in MCS patients after cardiac transplantation is equal to thatof transplant recipients treated with more conventional therapies. These results have encouraged researchers in the field to investigate portable devices and morepermanent implants. Current practice at one transplant center offers the Novacor (Baxter Healthcare), Thoratec (Thoratec Laboratories, Inc), and Cardiowest(Cardiowest Technologies, Inc) bridge-to-transplant devices. This article willdiscuss each device in detail. Other areas addressed include patient selection,patient management, and quality of life (QOL).
