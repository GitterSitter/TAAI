We aimed to identifyfactors associated with HLA antibodies during continuous flow (CF)-VAD supportand assess the effect on transplant probability and outcomes.METHODS: We included 143 consecutive heart failure patients who received a CF-VADas a bridge-to-transplant at 3 institutions. Factors associated with post-VADpeak panel reactive antibodies (PRA) among several measurements were identifiedusing multivariable linear regression. A parametric survival model was used toassess transplant waiting time and probability, risk of rejection, and acomposite outcome of rejection, graft failure, and death.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (25%) were female; mean age was 47 ± 13 years.Eighty-one patients (57%) had a pre-VAD PRA of 0%, and 16 were highly sensitized (PRA > 80%). Age, female sex, and pre-VAD PRA were independently associated with post-VAD PRA. A 10-year increase in age was associated with a 5% decrease inpost-VAD PRA (p = 0.03). Post-VAD PRA was 19% higher in women vs men (p < 0.01). A 10%-increase in pre-VAD PRA was associated with a 4.7% higher post-VAD PRA (p <0.01). During a mean follow-up of 12 ± 11 months, 90 patients underwent cardiactransplantation. A 20% increase in post-VAD PRA was associated with 13% lowerprobability of transplant (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval,0.76-0.99). A high PRA was not associated with adverse post-transplant outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, female sex, and pre-VAD PRA were independent predictorsof elevated PRA post-VAD. Higher PRA was significantly associated with lowertransplant probability but not increased rejection, graft failure, or death aftertransplant.Copyright © 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
