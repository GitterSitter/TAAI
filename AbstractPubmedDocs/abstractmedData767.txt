Epub 2011 Dec 12.A novel approach to percutaneous right-ventricular mechanical support.Takayama H(1), Naka Y, Kodali SK, Vincent JA, Addonizio LJ, Jorde UP, WilliamsMR.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA.OBJECTIVE: We report our initial experience with our newly developed percutaneousright-ventricular assist device (VAD) with CentriMag (perc CM-RVAD).METHODS: A flexible outflow cannula placed from the right internal jugular veinto the pulmonary artery and an inflow cannula placed from the femoral vein to theright atrium constituted the perc CM-RVAD. When needed, biventricular support wasprovided with left VAD (LVAD), either with a percutaneous LVAD placed throughaxillary or femoral artery access or with a fully implantable LVAD.RESULTS: Between January 2009 and June 2010, all of the attempted patientssuccessfully received perc CM-RVAD (n = 8). Mean blood pressure, heart rate, and central venous pressure showed a trend toward improvement after the perc CM-RVAD,with less inotrope/vasopressor requirement. Mixed venous oxygen saturation(SvO(2)) increased significantly from 64 ± 20 Torr to 78 ± 6 Torr (P < 0.01). Thepercutaneous VADs were explanted after myocardial recovery in seven patients;however, in three of these, perc CM-RVAD was used as a temporary bridge to other devices. One patient was bridged to a surgical biventricular assist device(BiVAD) and transferred back to the referring hospital on support. One deathoccurred due to multiple-organ failure 8 days after explantation of the RVAD withrecovery.CONCLUSIONS: Perc CM-RVAD was feasible and provided hemodynamic improvement.
