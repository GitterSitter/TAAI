Over the last 25 years great progress has been made in the medical management of heartfailure with the recognition of the benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade,modulation of the renin-angiotensin and mineralocorticoid axes and judiciousdiuretic therapy. In addition, cardiac resynchronization therapy and prophylacticimplantation of cardiac defibrillators have been responsible for measurablebenefits in terms of functional status and dysrhythmia-related mortality,respectively. Unfortunately, progressive cardiac dysfunction often results inactivity limitation, symptoms at rest, hospital admission, end-organ dysfunction and death despite maximal implementation of standard therapies. Hearttransplantation has been a dramatic and effective therapy for end-stage heartfailure, but it remains limited by a shortage of donor organs, strict criteriadefining acceptable recipients and often unsatisfactory long-term success.Mechanical alternatives to support the failing circulation have been sought forthe last 50 years. The history of device development has been marked in generalby the slow progress achieved by a few dedicated and persevering pioneers. In thepast decade, however, evolving technology has dramatically changed the field and broadened the options for the treatment of advanced heart failure. This reviewwill detail the important milestones and the current state of the art, with anemphasis on implantable devices for intermediate to long term support.
