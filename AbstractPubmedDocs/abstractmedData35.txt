To assess long-term freedom from DLinfection associated with this technique, a multicenter SSI registry wasinitiated. It was hypothesized that the modified tunneling technique isassociated with at least 50% reduction in DL infection at 1 year post-implantcompared with the velour-to-skin method used in the HeartMate II (HMII)Destination Therapy (DT) trial.METHODS: SSI is a retrospective and prospective registry of patients who havereceived the HMII device. Results are reported from the retrospective cohort,which consists of 200 patients who were implanted during the period 2009-2012with the SSI tunneling method and on HMII support for at least 10 months at thetime of enrollment. The prevalence and incidence of DL infection after leftventricular assist device implantation in the SSI retrospective cohort weredetermined and compared with a control group of 201 patients also on HMII supportfor at least 10 months from the HMII DT clinical trial who were implanted during the period 2007-2009 using the traditional method in which a small section of thevelour portion of the DL was externalized.RESULTS: The 1-year and 2-year prevalence rates of DL infection were 9% and 19%in the SSI patient group compared with 23% and 35% in the control group (hazardratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.73, p < 0.001). The event-per-patient year was 0.11 and 0.22 for the SSI and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Based on a multivariate analysis, age and DL exit side were the only independent variables associated with DL infection. Effects of management changes over theeras were not studied and could have contributed to the findings.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that leaving the entire DL velour portionbelow the skin is associated with 50% reduction in DL infection compared withresults from the HMII DT trial.Copyright Â© 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
