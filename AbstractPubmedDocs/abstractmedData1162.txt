Thepre-transplantation diagnosis was used to divide patients into 3 groups: primary cardiomyopathy (CM), 103; hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), 154; and other complex congenital heart disease (CCHD), 160. These groups were compared andanalyzed for differences in early and late morbidity and mortality.RESULTS: Operative mortality was significantly lower in the CM group comparedwith the HLHS (p < 0.02;) and CCHD groups (p < 0.01). Long-term actuarialrecipient survival, however, was similar for all groups. The 15-year actuarialsurvival was 59% for the CM Group, 57% for the HLHS Group, and 50% for the CCHDGroup. Actuarial survival after retransplantation is not statistically different from that with primary cardiac transplantation.CONCLUSION: Although peri-operative survival was lower in infants and childrenwith HLHS and CCHD compared with those with CM, long-term survival has been thesame for all groups. Late survival after retransplantation was not statistically different than among those with primary cardiac transplantation.
