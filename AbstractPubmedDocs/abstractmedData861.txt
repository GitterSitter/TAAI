We created biVAD using the artificial muscles (AMs) that supports both ventricles at the same time. We developed thetest bench (TB) as the in vitro evaluating system to enable the measurement ofperformance. The biVAD exerts different pressure between left and right ventriclelike the heart physiologically does. The heart model based on child's heart wasconstructed in silicone. This model was fitted with the biVAD. Two pipettescontaining water with an ultrasonic sensor placed on top of each and attached to ventricles reproduced the preload and the after load of each ventricle by thereal-time measurement of the fluid height variation proportionally to the exertedpressure. The LabVIEW software extrapolated the displaced volume and the pressuregenerated by each side of our biVAD. The development of a standardized protocolpermitted the validation of the TB for in vitro evaluation, measurement of theperformances of the AM biVAD herein, and reproducibility of data.
