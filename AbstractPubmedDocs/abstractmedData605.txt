The evolution and subsequent approval of larger pulsatile and,more recently, continuous flow mechanical circulatory support (MCS) technologyfor destination therapy (DT) offers the potential for triage of some patientsawaiting cardiac transplantation to DT.METHODS: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) is a nationalmulti-institutional study of long-term MCS. Between June 2006 and December 2011, 127 pulsatile and 1160 continuous flow pumps (24% of total primary leftventricular assist devices [LVADs]) carried an initial strategy of DT therapy.RESULTS: By multivariable analysis, risk factors (P < .05) for mortality after DTincluded older age, larger body mass index, history of cancer, history of cardiacsurgery, INTERMACS level I (cardiogenic shock), dialysis, increased blood ureanitrogen, use of a pulsatile flow device, and use of a right ventricular assistdevice (RVAD). Among patients with a continuous flow LVAD who were not incardiogenic shock, a particularly favorable survival was associated with nocancer, patients not in cardiogenic shock, and blood urea nitrogen less than 50mg/dL, resulting in 1- and 2-year survivals of 88% and 80%.CONCLUSIONS: (1) Evolution from pulsatile to continuous flow technology hasdramatically improved 1- and 2-year survivals; (2) DT is not appropriate forpatients with rapid hemodynamic deterioration or severe right ventricularfailure; (3) important subsets of patients with continuous flow DT now enjoysurvival that is competitive with heart transplantation out to about 2 years.Copyright Â© 2012 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
