These devices are now usedto treat patients with terminal heart failure not only as a bridge totransplantation but also for a bridge to recovery in certain carefully selectedpatients. More recently we have developed a strategy of combining LVAD supportwith pharmacologic therapies to produce maximal reverse remodeling followed bythe induction of physiologic cardiac hypertrophy using clenbuterol, a selectivebeta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (the Harefield protocol). The purpose of thiscommunication is to provide a brief review of remodeling, reverse remodeling, andthe rationale for the use of clenbuterol to enhance the efficacy of the LVAD.
