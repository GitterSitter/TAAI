Epub 2012Feb 19.The relationship of QRS morphology and mechanical dyssynchrony to long-termoutcome following cardiac resynchronization therapy.Hara H(1), Oyenuga OA, Tanaka H, Adelstein EC, Onishi T, McNamara DM, SchwartzmanD, Saba S, Gorcsan J 3rd.Author information: (1)The Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Scaife 564, 200Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2582, USA.AIMS: Because benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) appear to beless favourable in non-left bundle branch block (LBBB) patients, this prospectivelongitudinal study tested the hypothesis that QRS morphology andechocardiographic mechanical dyssynchrony were associated with long-term outcome after CRT.METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-eight consecutive New York HeartAssociation class III and IV CRT patients with QRS ≥120 ms and ejection fraction ≤35% were studied. The pre-specified primary endpoint was death, hearttransplant, or left ventricular assist device over 4 years. Dyssynchrony assessedbefore CRT included interventricular mechanical delay (IVMD) and speckle-trackingradial strain using pre-specified cut-offs for each. Of 254 with baselinequantitative echocardiographic data available, 128 had LBBB, 81 hadintraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), and 45 had right bundle branch block(RBBB). Radial dyssynchrony was observed in 85% of the patients with LBBB, 59%with IVCD*, and 40% with RBBB* (*P < 0.01 vs. LBBB). Of 248 (98%) with follow-up,LBBB patients had a significantly more favourable long-term survival thannon-LBBB patients. However, non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a morefavourable event-free survival than those without dyssynchrony: radialdyssynchrony hazard ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-4.53 (P =0.0008) and IVMD hazard ratio 4.9, 95% CI 2.60-9.16 (P = 0.0007). Right bundlebranch block patients who lacked dyssynchrony had the least favourable outcome.CONCLUSION: Non-LBBB patients with dyssynchrony had a more favourable long-termsurvival than non-LBBB patients who lacked dyssynchrony. Mechanical dyssynchrony and QRS morphology are associated with outcome following CRT.PMCID: PMC3485574
