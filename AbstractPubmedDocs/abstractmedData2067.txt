Int J Artif Organs. 1992 Mar;15(3):147-50.Mechanical bridge to transplantation with the Vienna heart in TAH and LVADconfiguration.Moritz A(1), Rokitansky A, Schima H, Prodinger A, Laufer G, Hiesmayer M, WolnerE.Author information: (1)2nd Surgical Department, University of Vienna, Austria.The Vienna heart uses a vacuum formed, pellethane pulsatile ventricle and isavailable in left ventricular assist (LVAD) and total artificial heart (TAH)configurations. This device was used as mechanical support of the failing heartin nine patients intended for heart transplantation. In two patients withcardiomyopathy an orthotopic TAH was implanted; one survived despite severepreoperative ischemic liver damage, and the other died of sepsis. In sevenpatients an atrio-aortic LVAD was implanted; six had suffered an acute myocardialinfarction with cardiogenic shock, and one could not be weaned off bypass. Three patients survived. These included one 65-year-old with incipient ARDS atoperation, and a 40-year-old with preoperative liver and kidney insufficiency whowas transplanted in septicemia. In this patient the septic focus, natural andartificial heart, were removed at transplantation. Four patients died. In one we were unable to establish satisfactory circulation, one died after failure of the transplanted heart, one suffered a lethal cerebral embolism and one developedmulti-organ failure after repeated attacks of ventricular fibrillation. With the Vienna heart sufficient circulatory support could be established with cardiacoutputs between 6 and 8 l/min for the TAH and 3.5 to 4.5 l/min for the LVAD. Withthis type of support an overall survival rate of 44% could be achieved.Mechanical hemolysis was not a clinical problem and no device failure occurred.
