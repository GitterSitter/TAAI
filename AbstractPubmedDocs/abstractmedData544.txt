Tex Heart Inst J. 2012;39(5):615-7.Implantation of left ventricular assist device complicated by undiagnosedthrombophilia.Szarszoi O(1), Maly J, Turek D, Urban M, Skalsky I, Riha H, Maluskova J, Pirk J, Netuka I.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, 140 21 Prague 4, Czech Republic. onsz@medicon.czA patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and no history of thromboembolic eventsreceived a surgically implanted axial-flow left ventricular assist device. After implantation, transesophageal echocardiography revealed a giant thrombus on thelateral and anterior aspects of the left ventricle. The inflow cannula insertedthrough the apex of the left ventricle was not obstructed, and the devicegenerated satisfactory blood flow. Laboratory screening for thrombophilia showed protein S deficiency, heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, and heterozygousMTHFR C667T mutation. During the entire duration of circulatory support, nosignificant suction events were detected, and the patient was listed for hearttransplantation. Ventricular assist device implantation can unmask previouslyundiagnosed thrombophilia; therefore, it should be necessary to identifythrombophilic patients before cardiac support implantation.PMCID: PMC3461681
