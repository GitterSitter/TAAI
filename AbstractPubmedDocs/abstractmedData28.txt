Theanalysis was repeated within the subgroup of INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) class 1 patients.RESULTS: Receiver operating curve analysis showed that the HMRS correlated with90-day mortality with an area under the curve of 0.70. Stratification in low,mid, and high HMRS groups identified patients with increasing hazard of 90-daymortality, increasing long-term mortality, increasing rate of gastrointestinalbleeding events, and increasing median number of days spent in the hospital inthe first year post implant. Within INTERMACS class 1 patients, those in thehighest HMRS group were found to have a relative risk of 90-day mortality 5.7times higher than those in the lowest HMRS group (39.1% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: HMRS is a valid clinical tool to stratify risk of morbidity andmortality after implant of Heartmate II devices in unselected patients and can beused to predict short-term mortality risk in INTERMACS class 1 patients.Copyright © 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
