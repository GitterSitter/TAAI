The clinical data of sixpatients bridged to HTx with Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric device were analyzedretrospectively. Information about graft function, CA results, and EMB findingsas well as appearance DSA was collected. Also, information about growth andcognitive function was analyzed. These findings were compared with age-, gender-,and diagnosis-matched HTx patients. During the median follow-up time of four and half yr after HTx, the prognosis including graft function, number of rejectionepisodes, and incidence of coronary artery vasculopathy, growth and cognitivedevelopment did not differ between VAD-bridged HTx patients compared with controlpatients. In both groups, one patient developed positive DSA titer after HTx. Oursingle-center experience suggests that the prognosis of pediatric HTx patientstreated with VAD before transplantation is not inferior to that of other HTxpatients.© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
