The mean age of this groupwas 66.2+/-4.1 (60-77) years. The patients presented with the following features by the time of LVAD implantation: failure of weaning from inotropic support(78%), either profound cardiogenic shock (37%) or instable hemodynamic status(22%), high-dose inotropic (52%) or intraaortic balloon pump support (11%),dialysis (15%), artificial ventilation (15%), and at least one previous cardiacprocedure (44%).RESULTS: The cumulative survival rate for the whole group was 63% at 30 days, 30%at 180 days, and 22% at 2 years. The presence of preoperative cardiogenic shockwas associated with a higher perioperative mortality rate. Late complications(n=7) included replacement of two thrombosed DeBakey LVADs and five late deathssecondary to thrombembolism/intracranial hemorrhage (DeBakey LVAD, n=3) orsepticemia (n=2). As of May 15, 2003, six patients remain on LVAD support for an average of 653 (339-953) days, three patients now for more than 2 years. Tenpatients were discharged home to spend 73% of their life span on out-of-hospital long-term LVAD support.CONCLUSION: This study reports the first single-center experience of permanentLVAD support in patients of advanced age. For this initial experience, manypatients with critical circulatory status and previous cardiac operations wereincluded and a high postoperative mortality rate was encountered among them.Older age and associated multimorbidity are the key determinants rendering theconditions of LVAD therapy for this patient cohort to be different from thebridge-to-transplant experience. The LVADs employed in this study showeddifferent capabilities with regard to long-term support. Our experience showsthat permanent mechanical circulatory support does have the potential to evolveas a treatment option in selected elderly patients with end-stage heart failure.
