Clin Cardiol. 1992 Sep;15 Suppl 1:I28-36.Management of the patient awaiting cardiac transplantation.Mills RM Jr(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Florida, College ofMedicine, Gainesville 32610.The spectacular clinical success of heart transplantation (HTTX) in thecyclosporine era has engendered challenging new clinical problems that includelong-term management of patients with severely compromised systolic function,preparation of potential HTTX recipients for major surgery followed byimmunosuppression, and ethical and rational distribution of limited numbers ofdonated organs. The magnitude of these challenges may seem overwhelming.Fortunately, clinicians have the luxury of dealing with the issues involved onepatient, and one step, at a time. The continued efforts of clinical investigatorshave clarified important management principles. There is a growing appreciationof the pivotal importance of mitral valve function in determining the response tomedical therapy and long-term prognosis in this patient population. Enthusiasmfor pharmacologic control of asymptomatic ventricular ectopy has waned; instead, the restoration and maintenance of normal atrial function has clearly takenprecedence. In preparation for surgery, new endoscopic techniques offer greatadvantages. The use of high-technology support devices as "bridges totransplantation" has been re-examined in view of the relatively poorer short- andlong-term prognosis of patients managed with these devices. Increasingly, theoptimal scenario for HTTX entails transplantation of a severely compromised butmedically stable patient. As specific therapy, HTTX today has relatively limited application to the vast majority of patients with heart failure (HF). Seventeenhundred heart transplants will do little to directly affect the 400,000 patients in the United States who each year develop symptomatic HF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
