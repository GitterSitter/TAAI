At the time of admission to our hospital, hecould not be registered as a candidate for heart transplantation because ofsevere renal failure with a serum creatinine level of 4.6 mg/dl. We consideredthat he was a marginal candidate for heart transplantation; thus, it wasessential to understand the etiology of renal failure and estimate whether it wasreversible. Cardiac catheterization revealed poor hemodynamic function with asystemic pressure of 107/60 mmHg, cardiac index of 2.5 l/min/m(2), and pulmonary artery pressure of 63/27 mmHg, despite intense medical treatment. Contrary tobiochemical examination findings of blood, renal biopsy findings showed nosignificant glomerular abnormality. Furthermore, the severity of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis in the cortex was mild. These pathological findingssuggested that the renal dysfunction in this case was possibly attributable to a hemodynamic factor. His symptoms gradually deteriorated despite an increasingdose of inotropic support; thus, we planned implantation of a Jarvik 2000axial-flow pump (Jarvik Heart Inc., New York, NY, USA) as a bridge toeligibility, and informed consent was obtained. Because of a tight adhesion onthe anterior wall, we placed the device on the lateral wall of the leftventricle, making sure not to direct the pump at the septum. Postoperatively, theimplantable left ventricular assist device provided relief from heart failuresymptoms as well as recovery of renal function, with serum the creatinine levelat 1.2 mg/dl, which allowed the patient to become an appropriate candidate forheart transplantation. At an 18-month follow-up examination, his status wasuneventful, and he is now at home awaiting heart transplantation.
