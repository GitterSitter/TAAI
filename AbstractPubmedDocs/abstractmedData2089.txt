Curr Opin Cardiol. 1991 Apr;6(2):269-73.Cardiac transplantation and ventricular assist devices.Shumway SJ(1), Bolman RM 3rd.Author information: (1)The University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinic, Minneapolis.During the last decade, heart transplantation has become an almost routineclinical entity limited only by the number of donors available. Temporaryventricular support has also gained acceptance for two particular groups ofpatients: 1) those in cardiogenic shock with reversible ventricular failure and2) those with irreversible ventricular failure who require a bridge totransplantation. We review the experimental work, clinical research, results,specific cases and experiences in cardiac transplantation, and the use ofventricular assist devices during the past year.
