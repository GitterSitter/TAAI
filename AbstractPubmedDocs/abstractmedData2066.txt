Am J Cardiol. 1992 Apr 1;69(9):955-8.Outcome and complications of prolonged intraaortic balloon counterpulsation incardiac patients.Lazar JM(1), Ziady GM, Dummer SJ, Thompson M, Ruffner RJ.Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, Presbyterian University Hospital, Pennsylvania15213.The risks and benefits of prolonged intraaortic balloon support for themanagement of refractory congestive heart failure and ischemia were studied inpatients with end-stage heart disease who needed support for greater than orequal to 5 days. Fifty-two insertions were performed by the percutaneous femoral route in 49 patients. The duration of insertion ranged from 5 to 46 days (mean11.3). Clinical outcome including hemodynamic parameters and complications wererecorded. Mean systemic arterial pressure did not change with balloon insertion(74 +/- 19 vs 76 +/- 11 mm Hg; p = not significant). Both the mean pulmonaryartery and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures decreased (33 +/- 8 to 26 +/- 9 mm Hg [p less than 0.01], and 25 +/- 8 to 17 +/- 6 mm Hg [p less than 0.01],respectively). Over time, both parameters tended to increase, but remainedsignificantly less than those before insertion. Cardiac index increased from 1.6 +/- 0.4 to 2.2 +/- 0.5 liters/min/m2 on insertion and continued to increase to2.7 +/- 0.5 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.01) before removal. Definite ballooncatheter infection developed in 7 patients, and hemorrhage occurred in anadditional 7. Eleven patients had vascular compromise, with loss of pulse in 6,thrombosis of the femoral artery in 1, and pseudoaneurysm in 2. Lacerated femoralartery occurred in 1 patient, and mesenteric artery thrombosis in another. Twentypatients died from progressive heart failure and multiorgan system failure, and19 survived to receive left ventricular assist device and heart transplantation. Only 10 patients were weaned off the balloon. In conclusion, prolongedintraaortic balloon pump support may be successfully used in end-stage heartdisease.
