The average ageof these patients was 57.6 years. Eleven patients were suffering primarily fromleft ventricular dysfunction and were supported with a left ventricular assistdevice (LVAD). Eight of these patients were weaned from device support, a nd 6survived to hospital discharge (54%). In contrast, 6 patients presented withbiventricular failure and were supported with biventricular VADs (BiVADs). Noneof these BiVAD patients could be weaned from device support. Two BiVAD patientsunderwent cardiac transplantation, and only one survived.CONCLUSION: In the presence of left ventricular failure producing cardiogenicshock after myocardial infarction, LVAD support can produce a 54% survival ratein those patients w ho are failing medical management. However, in patients inbiventricular failure after myocardial infarction, BiVAD support may be used tostabilize the patient until transplantation, but the overall prognosis remainspoor.
