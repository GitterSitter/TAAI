This may be of therapeutic relevance in identifying novelpharmacological targets for therapies that could facilitate recovery after VADimplantation.METHODS: Twenty-two patients bridged to heart transplantation (HTx) with VAD wereincluded in the study. A group of patients underwent moderate intensity aerobicexercise (GT), while another group of patients did not receive exercise training (CG). Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRα1) protein and total (t) andphosphorylated (p) protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)kinase signalling were measured in myocardial tissue by western blotting atpre-VAD and pre-HTx period. In addition, Thyroid hormone (TH) levels weremeasured in plasma.RESULTS: Peak oxygen consumption (VO2) at pre-HTx period was higher in patientssubjected to training protocol [18.0 (0.8) for GT when compared with 13.7 (0.7)for CG group, P = 0.002]. N-terminal-prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP) levels were 1068 (148) for CG vs 626 (115) for GT group, P = 0.035. Aswitch towards up-regulation of physiological growth signalling was observed: theratio of p-Akt/t-Akt was 2-fold higher in GT vs CG, P < 0.05 while p-JNK/t-JNKwas 2.5-fold lower (P < 0.05) in GT vs CG, in pre-HTx samples. This response was accompanied by a 2.0-fold increase in TRα1 expression in pre-HTx samples withconcomitant increase in circulating T3 in GT vs CG, P < 0.05. No differences inpeak VO2, NT-proBNP, T3, TRα1, p/t-AKT and p/t-JNK were found between groups inthe pre-VAD period.CONCLUSIONS: The unloaded failing myocardium responded to physical training byenhancing thyroid hormone signalling. This response was associated with anup-regulation of Akt and suppression of JNK activation.PMCID: PMC3781806
