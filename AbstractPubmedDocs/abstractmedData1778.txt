Indications werepostcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS) (n = 60), bridge to cardiacretransplantation (n = 1), and right ventricular failure (n = 1). Patients' ages ranged from 23 to 78 years; 40 were men (65%), and 22 were women (35%).Twenty-two patients (35%) had a left ventricular assist device; 9 patients (15%) had a right ventricular assist device; and 31 patients (50%) had a biventricular assist device. Length of support ranged from 1 day to 19 days.RESULTS: Forty-two patients (68%) were weaned successfully; 27 patients survived to discharge (44%). Complications included bleeding (n = 41, 66%), renal failure (n = 28, 45%), and respiratory failure (n = 26, 42%). Currently, 23 patientssurvived 10 or more years (n = 1), 6 to 10 years (n = 7), 1 to 5 years (n = 10), and less than 1 year (n = 5).CONCLUSIONS: Centrifugal pumps are available, easy to use, and relativelyinexpensive. Our experience justifies their continued use as a bridge to recoveryfor patients with postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock, despite the availability and increasing use of more expensive devices.
