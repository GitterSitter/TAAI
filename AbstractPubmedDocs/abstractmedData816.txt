Epub 2011 Apr 9.The experience of parents and children where children have been supported with a ventricular assist device as a bridge to heart transplantation.Gilmore H(1), Newall F.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, 3052,Australia. hollie.gilmore@rch.org.auThere is little information to assist in understanding the experience endured by parents and children where children have been supported with a ventricular assistdevice (VAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation. Consequently, the aims of thisstudy were to gain an understanding of children's and parents' experience wherechildren have been supported with a VAD as a bridge to heart transplantation and to use this information to improve the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) VADprogram. This study employed a qualitative approach using purposive sampling.Semistructured interviews were conducted with children aged 13 years or more and their parents to determine their experience of having required VAD support as abridge to transplantation. Results demonstrated a lack of information thatprepared families and children for the anticipated course of treatment on VADsupport. Recommendations to improve the VAD program for parents and childreninclude more information through meetings, as well as in a written format, andspeaking to other families who had already experienced VAD. For children inparticular, a visual of the VAD, its associated equipment, and an image of where it is placed in the body is vital information that is necessary prior to VADsupport. Overall, the recommendations are important and should be made available to improve the experience for children and parents, not only of the RCH VADprogram but for all hospitals offering VAD therapy.
