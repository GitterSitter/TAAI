The current generation of LVASs in clinical evaluation has design features enabling longer and more reliable support durations. We describe theoperating characteristics of the DuraHeart LVAS (Terumo Heart, Inc., Ann Arbor,MI). The DuraHeart LVAS is a magnetically-levitated centrifugal pump that began aFDA-approved clinical trial for evaluation of bridge to transplant indication in July of 2008. Magnetic levitation of the spinning-pump impeller is hypothesizedto improve long-term mechanical reliability and biological compatibility of thepump. Other design features make the DuraHeart LVAS particularly suited forimplantation without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A description of the implantprocedure for the first six American implants of the DuraHeart LVAS both on-CPBand off-CPB, including CPB techniques employed, are discussed. While it is still very early in the DuraHeart LVAS experience, the initial outcomes of the firstsix patient implants would suggest that the device is a safe and effective LVAS.
