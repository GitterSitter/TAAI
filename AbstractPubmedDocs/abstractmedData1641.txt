Anticipating increasedlong-term MCS, a policy to discharge patients home has been instituted. Thisstudy compares the results of outpatient on MCS to a group of patients remaining hospitalized.METHODS: We report our 10-year experience with 108 patients on MCS, who weresupported for more than 3 months. Group A consisted of 38 patients (25 Novacor,13 Berlin Heart) who underwent assist implantation from 1996 to 2001. They had a mean support time of 454 days (range 100 to 1074 days) and spent a mean of 326days (range 20 to 769 days) at home. Group B consisted of 70 patients (24Novacor, 46 Berlin Heart) who underwent assist implantation between 1991 and2000. They had a mean support time of 234 days (range 95 to 795 days) and werenot discharged. The patients were monitored for complications, hospitalreadmissions, and causes of death including infections and thromboembolic andbleeding events during the MCS time.RESULTS: Group A total mortality was 16% (6/38). Two patients died from cerebral embolism, one from cerebral hemorrhage, two from systemic infection, and one frommultiorgan failure. Thirty-two patients (84%) required 95 readmissions to thehospital due to cerebral embolism (n = 9), bleeding (n = 1), wound infections (n = 23), coagulation disorder (n = 13) for heart transplantation (n = 5), and (n = 44). In group B the mortality was 43% (30/70) for noncardiac reasons and thussignificant higher (p = 0.004, chi2 test). Causes of death were cerebral embolism(n = 5), cerebral hemorrhage (n = 7), systemic infection (n = 14, significantlyhigher, p = 0.04, chi2 test), and multiorgan failure (n = 4).CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that MCS can be used in outpatientswithout increased mortality and with an acceptable rate of readmissions(2.8/patient). It ensures the survival of the patient, enables recovery frommultiorgan failure, and offers an acceptable quality of life.
