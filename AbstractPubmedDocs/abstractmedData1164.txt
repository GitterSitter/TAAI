The patient was anticoagulatedusing unfractionated heparin, acetylsalicylic acid and dipyridamole. Contact and tissue factor-activated thromboelastometry revealed increased clot firmness,although anticoagulation assessed by APTT was in accordance with the treatmentprotocol. Strength of polymerized fibrin was also increased. We saw no clinicalsigns of thrombosis. Thromboelastometry normalized after heart transplantation.Our results suggest that hypercoagulability is due to excess fibrin formation.Monitoring anticoagulation using APTT may, therefore, be misleading duringmechanical cardiac assist.
