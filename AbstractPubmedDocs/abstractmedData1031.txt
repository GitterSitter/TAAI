Michael.firstenberg@osumc.eduLeft ventricular free wall rupture can be a catastrophic problem. Although small lacerations can be managed with various techniques of primary closure, larger andmore complex defects can be difficult to treat. We present and discuss 2 cases ofchronic, complex ventricular pseudoaneurysms managed successfully with long-term mechanical support.
