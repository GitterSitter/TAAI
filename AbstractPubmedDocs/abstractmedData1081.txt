Often resistant to maximal medical therapy,this condition frequently requires mechanical circulatory support until recovery or retransplantation. We present a 52-year-old patient with multiorgan failuresecondary to acute graft rejection after orthotopic heart transplantation.Maximal medical therapy was not successful, and the patient was bridged torecovery with an Impella LP 5.0 (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA) left ventricularassist device (LVAD). The relative merits of this therapeutic approach areoutlined and discussed. The patient was discharged 3 weeks after LVAD removal andremains clinically stable.
