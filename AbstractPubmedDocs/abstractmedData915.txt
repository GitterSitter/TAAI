However, unloading of the heart with a left ventricular assist device(LVAD) can lead to reversal of many of the remodelling changes even in patientswith advanced heart failure. LVAD unloading can also lead to improved myocardial function and this improvement can be sufficient to allow removal of the deviceleaving the patient to lead a normal life. We review the molecular changes thathave been demonstrated with LVAD unloading in patients bridged to transplantationand also those that have occurred in the myocardium of patients that haverecovered their myocardial function enough to have the device removed. Changes inboth the myocyte and the matrix are reviewed.
