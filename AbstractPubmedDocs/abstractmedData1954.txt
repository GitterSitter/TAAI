ASAIO J. 1996 Sep-Oct;42(5):M570-3.Age related outcome after implantable left ventricular assist system support.Smedira NG(1), Dasse KA, Patel AN, Vargo RL, Massad MG, McCarthy PM.Author information: (1)Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Department of Thoracic and CardiovascularSurgery, OH 44195, USA.To examine the relationship between age and outcome after implantable leftventricular assist system support, the authors investigated the results of 223patients from 17 centers who were supported with a HeartMate (ThermoCardiosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA) pneumatic left ventricular assist system between1986 and 1994. In addition, the authors examined a single center's experiencewith 67 patients between 1992 and 1996. Ages are separated by decile and rangedfrom 10 to 69 years. Men dominated all age groups, averaging 82% of the total(range, 64-91%). Viral, idiopathic, and post partum cardiomyopathies were theindication for support in 88% of the patients younger than 39 years of age.Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the cause of myocardial failure in the majority ofpatients older than 40 years of age (40-49 years, 54%; 50-59 years, 57%; and60-69 years, 67%). Patients aged 40-59 accounted for 64% of the patientssupported, and had the best outcomes both on support and after transplantation.Survival to transplantation was not significantly different among the groups,although the patients older than 60 and younger than 69 years of age had highermortalities on support, most commonly from cardiac failure. At the ClevelandClinic Foundation, the survival to transplantation and survival to discharge wereindistinguishable between age groups. Age does not appear to be significant risk factor for outcome after implantable left ventricular assist system support.These results predict acceptable mortality for patients supported who are olderthan the age of 60.
