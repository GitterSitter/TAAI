Karima@gosh.nhs.ukOBJECTIVE: Infants and young children are considered the most difficult group to bridge to orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) and data regarding outcomes are scarce.METHODS: We reviewed our patients ≤ 10 kg with those who were bridged to OHTusing ventricular assist device (VAD) Berlin Heart (BH) Excor ± extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) between 2004 and 2009.RESULTS: Eleven children ≤ 10 kg with end-stage heart failure (cardiomyopathy or myocarditis) were treated with VAD as bridge to OHT: the median weight was 8.0(range 3.9-10.0 kg)kg and median age was 12.3 (range 1.2-33.9 months) months.Five (45%) required ECMO support pre-BH and six were on mechanical ventilationand inotropes. In 9/11 (82%), the support mode was left ventricular assist device(L-VAD) (all alive): one of two patients needing Bi-VAD support died. On BH, the median support time was 27 days and time to extubation was 8 days. Two out of 11 (18%) suffered strokes confirmed on brain imaging; both recovered and oneunderwent resection of infarcted small bowel. Ten out of 11 (91%) weretransplanted, one remains in hospital and nine are at home in good health. Whencompared to patients >10 kg bridged with BH (n = 15), the mortality (p = 0.51)and rates of neurological complications (p = 0.54) were similar. Post-transplant recovery (ventilation times and time to home discharge) was similar between thebridged children ≤ 10 kg and non-bridged children ≤ 10 kg who underwent OHT.CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical bridging to transplantation is clinically feasible inchildren ≤ 10 kg, achieving excellent outcomes. Judicious use of VADs in smaller children will optimise the use of donor organs; however, the effect on overallOHT waiting times, if mechanical bridging was extended to a large number of smallchildren, is unknown.Copyright © 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
