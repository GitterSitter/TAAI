Epub 2013 Apr 25.Milrinone in advanced heart failure: dose and therapeutic monitor outsideintensive care unit.Charisopoulou D(1), Leaver N, Banner NR.Author information: (1)1Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, UK.Advanced chronic heart failure (ACHF) patients often require inotropes beforetransplantation or ventricular assist device implantation. Milrinone, an inotropeand vasodilator, may accumulate in cardiorenal syndrome with serious adverseeffects. We investigated the potential for therapeutic drug monitoring ofmilrinone levels using High Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry(HPLC-MS). 22 ACHF patients (15 males, 49±9 years) received milrinone 50 µg/kgintravenously (i.v.) during heart catheterization. Milrinone levels were 216±71ng/ml (within the reported therapeutic range: 100-300 ng/ml), followed byimprovements in cardiac index, pulmonary artery and wedge pressures (p < 0.005). 18 ACHF patients (17 males, 50±12 years, 13 had renal dysfunction) receivedcontinuous i.v. milrinone (5-26 days) at 0.1-0.2 µg/kg/min, titrated according toplasma milrinone levels. No adverse events occurred. Therapeutic levels wereachieved with doses of 0.2±0.06 µg/Kg/min, below those recommended in Summary of Product Characteristics. Milrinone therapy can be noninvasively monitored byHPLC-MS, while avoiding toxicity in ACHF.
