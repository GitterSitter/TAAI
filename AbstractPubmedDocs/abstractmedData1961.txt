Design considerations and systemcharacteristics.Kung RT(1), Champsaur GL.Author information: (1)ABIOMED R&D, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, USA.A clinical need exists for the short-term use of pediatric ventricular assistdevice in children and small infants who are critically ill with heart failureunresponsive to pharmacologic support or, in the case of irreversible heartfailure, as a bridge to a transplant device. The design considerations and devicecharacteristics of a tubular pump are presented. The device consists of anintegrally formed inflow valve, pump chamber, and outflow valve in a tubularconstruction. This design approach was selected due to its simplicity offabrication, which can result in a reliable and low cost device. The inflow valveand pump are actuated pneumatically through a single drive line. The outflowvalve can be either actively actuated or operated passively. A 5 ml stroke volumedevice was built and characterized in vitro and in vivo. This pump can generate0.5 L/min at 100 beats per minute. Larger stroke volume devices can be and havebeen fabricated using the same principle.
