We evaluated the blood pressure (BP) response to exercise and exercise performance in patients with a TAH compared to those with a with acontinuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD).METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 37 patients whoreceived a TAH and 12 patients implanted with an LVAD. We measured the BPresponse during exercise, exercise duration and change in tolerated exerciseworkload over an 8-week period.RESULTS: In patients with a TAH, baseline BP was 120/69 ± 13/13, exercise BP was 118/72 ± 15/10 and post-exercise BP was 120/72 ± 14/12. Mean arterial BP did not change with exercise in patients with a TAH (88 ± 10 vs 88 ± 11; p = 0.8), butincreased in those with an LVAD (87 ± 8 vs 95 ± 13; p < 0.001). Although the meanarterial BP (MAP) was negatively correlated with metabolic equivalents (METs)achieved during exercise, the association was not statistically significant (β = -0.1, p = 0.4). MAP correlated positively with METs achieved in patients withLVADs (MAP: β = 0.26, p = 0.04). Despite the abnormal response to exercise,patients with a TAH participated in physical therapy (median: 5 days;interquartile range [IQR] 4 to 7 days) and treadmill exercise (19 days; IQR: 13to 35 days) early after device implantation, with increased exercise intensityand duration over time.CONCLUSIONS: During circulatory support with a TAH, the BP response to exercisewas blunted. However, aerobic exercise training early after device implantationwas found to be safe and feasible in a supervised setting.2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
