Initially, failure to wean fromcardiopulmonary bypass was the primary indication for VAD support. However, VADrole has expanded to include patients with ventricular failure due to myocardial infarction and patients awaiting cardiac transplantation. A greater number ofnurses, both in the intensive care and general floors, are required to care forpatients supported with VADs. Therefore, a self-study guide was developed tofacilitate learning. Heart failure physiology, mechanical device descriptions,patient selection, potential complications, and nursing care of patients whorequire VAD support are reviewed.
