[Epubahead of print]Left ventricular assist device withdrawal: an ethical discussion.McLean S(1), Dhonnchu TN, Mahon N, McQuillan R, Gordijn B, Ryan K.Author information: (1)Palliative Care Service, St Francis Hospice, Dublin, Ireland.Specialist palliative care (SPC) services are increasingly integrated withchronic heart failure (CHF) services. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)represent an advance in the management of advanced CHF, but may pose ethicalchallenges for SPC services providing care to this population.The patientreceived an LVAD as 'bridge-to-heart-transplant,' but subsequently experiencedmultiple cerebral haemorrhages, resulting in neurological deficits, and severefunctional impairment. The risk of further cerebral events precluded ongoinganticoagulation, and she was transferred to an SPC inpatient unit for symptomcontrol and end-of-life care. Following discussion within the multi-disciplinary team and with the patient's family, LVAD support was withdrawn, and the patientdied peacefully. This piece reviews the ethical considerations that informeddecision-making, in particular, autonomy, informed consent and futility. Inaddition, the question of the nature of LVADs is debated and how the perceptions of the patient, and others, of the device may influence decision-making aroundwithdrawal of treatment.
