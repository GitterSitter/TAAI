J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1989 Nov;98(5 Pt 2):935-40; discussion 940-1.Mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation.Joyce LD(1), Emery RW, Eales F, Von Rueden TJ, Kiser JC, Hoffman FM, Johnson KE, Toninato CJ, Kersten TE, Nicoloff DM, et al.Author information: (1)Minneapolis Heart Institute, MN 55407.From December 1985 through April 1988, 11 patients (three female and eightmales), 33.1 +/- 3.9 (+/- SEM) years of age (range, 15 to 50 years), underwentheart transplantation preceded by the use of mechanical circulatory support. The causes of cardiac failure were ischemic (four), viral cardiomyopathy (three),idiopathic cardiomyopathy (two), congenital heart disease (one), and valvularheart disease (one). All patients were preterminal. Mechanical circulatorysupport consisted of intra-aortic balloon pump (eight), the total artificialheart (seven), biventricular assist (three), and left ventricular assist (two).Seven patients had more than one form of support. The duration of mechanicalcirculatory support was 12.2 +/- 4.1 days (range, 1 to 44 days). Once listed for transplantation, patients waited for 8.1 +/- 2.4 days for a donor. Seven patientsreceived OKT3 monoclonal antibody as prophylaxis, in addition to triple-drugimmunosuppression. There were four rejection episodes and 12 serious infections. In addition, eight patients suffered a major posttransplant complication of adistant organ system: central nervous system (three), renal (two), andrespiratory (three). Post transplant hospitalization was 48 +/- 22 days (range,15 to 248 days). Two patients (18%) died after transplant, one of severe acuterejection (29 days) and one of multisystem failure (248 days). All patientssurviving transplant hospitalization are alive 6 to 34 months after thetransplant procedure. Eight patients are in functional class I and 1 patientclass II. This patient attends school full-time but has a premechanical supportsystem neurologic defect. In follow-up of 163 patient-months except for yearlycatheterization, these nine patients required only 5 hospital days. Although the use of the mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation canresult in a prolonged, complicated hospitalization after transplant, thelong-term results are gratifying.
