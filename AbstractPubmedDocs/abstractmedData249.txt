Electronic address:pramod.bonde@yale.edu.Left ventricular assist device therapy has radically improved congestive heartfailure survival with smaller rotary pumps. The driveline used to power today'sleft ventricular assist devices, however, continues to be a source of infection, traumatic damage, and rehospitalization. Previous attempts to wirelessly powerleft ventricular assist devices using transcutaneous energy transfer systems havebeen limited by restrictions on separation distance and alignment between thetransmit and receive coils. Resonant electrical energy transfer allows powerdelivery at larger distances without compromising safety and efficiency. Thisreview covers the efforts to wirelessly power mechanical circulatory assistdevices and the progress made in enhancing their energy sources.Copyright Â© 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
