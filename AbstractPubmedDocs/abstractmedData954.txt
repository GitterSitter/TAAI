Cardiopulm Phys Ther J. 2010 Jun;21(2):13-21.Total artificial heart and physical therapy management.Nicholson C(1), Paz JC.Author information: (1)Cleveland Clinic, Division of Physical Therapy, Walsh University.PURPOSE: To describe the total artificial heart (TAH) device as a bridge to hearttransplantation (BTT), and related physical therapy management, while comparisonsto left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are made.SUMMARY: The SynCardia CardioWest Temporary TAH System is the only TAH approvedby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada and Consultants Europe(CE) for BTT. CardioWest implantation involves cardiectomy thus avoidingpulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, inotropic or anti-arrhythmic agents,myocardial and valve related problems. CardioWest has a fixed beat rate andcardiac output is dependent upon venous return and preload. Both TAH and LVADsare adaptive with exercise, increasing cardiac output during activities, allowingfor conditioning to occur peripherally. Left ventricular assist devices haveportable drivers permitting discharge home, while the CardioWest's large driverconsole necessitates inpatient therapy. Exercise progression, positioning, andmonitoring of exercise intolerance are similar with LVAD and TAH. Ventricularfill volumes in TAH dictate cardiac output and require close attention.Cardiectomy in TAH prevents electrocardiography, telemetry, and native pulse ratemonitoring.CONCLUSION: While mechanical differences exist between TAH and LVAD, physicaltherapists can provide evidence-based treatment for patients with TAH usingpreviously established guidelines for patients with heart failure and mechanical circulatory support.PMCID: PMC2879422
