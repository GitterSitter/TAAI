The impact of PH subtype on clinical outcome in CRT isunknown.METHODS: The study population consisted of 101 patients (average age 66 ± 13years, left ventricular ejection fraction 0.23 ± 0.07, and New York HeartAssociation functional class 3.2 ± 0.4) who underwent right heart catheterizationin the 6 months before CRT. PH was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure≥25 mm Hg; a significant pre-capillary contribution to elevated mean pulmonaryartery pressure was defined as a transpulmonary gradient (TPG) ≥12 mm Hg.Clinical endpoints were assessed at 2 years and included all-cause mortality and a composite of death, left ventricular assist device, or cardiac transplantation.RESULTS: Patients with TPG ≥12 mm Hg were more likely to experience all-causemortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 7.4; p = 0.009) and the composite outcome (HR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.4 to 6.3; p = 0.004)compared with patients with TPG <12 mm Hg. After multivariate adjustment forhemodynamic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables, only TPG ≥12 mm Hg andbaseline right ventricular (RV) dilation (RV end-diastolic dimension >42 mm) wereassociated with the composite clinical outcome (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: High TPG PH and RV dilation are independent predictors of adverseoutcomes in patients with LVSD who are receiving CRT. RV pulmonary vasculardysfunction may be a therapeutic target in select patients receiving CRT.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by ElsevierInc. All rights reserved.
