In the next decade, the paradigm will shift to a more widespread use of such devices in patients without subsequent transplantation. Achievement of the ultimate goals of improvedsurvival and quality of life for patients with advanced heart disease may depend on the strategic use of support devices more frequently than on the totalreplacement heart.
