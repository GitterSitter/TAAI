Pre-operative and post-operativefactors associated with NCs in patients with LVADs were investigated.METHODS: We reviewed 307 consecutive patients undergoing LVAD surgery (167HeartMate I and 140 HeartMate II devices) at Columbia University Medical Centerbetween November 2000 and December 2010. Clinical characteristics and hemodynamicand laboratory indexes were analyzed. NC was defined according to the InteragencyRegistry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support definition of neurologicdysfunction, including transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic orhemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA).RESULTS: NCs developed in 43 patients (14.0%) at 91.8 ± 116.3 dayspost-operatively. The frequency of NC development was similar in HeartMate I and II patients. Patients with NC showed a higher frequency of pre-LVAD CVA history(27.9% vs 15.5%, p = 0.046), lower pre-operative sodium (129.0 ± 7.0 vs 132.1 ±8.1 mg/dl, p = 0.018) and albumin concentrations (3.5 ± 0.7 vs 3.7 ± 0.6 mg/dl, p= 0.049), lower post-operative hematocrit (34.9% ± 5.1% vs 37.8% ± 6.1%, p =0.0034), sodium (131.6 ± 7.7 vs 134.4 ± 6.4 mg/dl, p = 0.010) and albuminconcentrations (3.7 ± 0.5 vs 3.9 ± 0.5 mg/dl, p = 0.0016), and higher frequencyof post-operative infection (39.5% vs 19.3%, p = 0.003) than those without NC.Multiple regression analysis revealed that CVA history (odds ratio, 2.37, 95%confidence interval, 1.24-5.29; p = 0.011) and post-operative infection (oddsratio, 2.99, 95% confidence interval, 1.16-10.49; p = 0.011) were highlyassociated with NC development. The combination of CVA history, pre-operative andpost-operative sodium and albumin, and post-operative hematocrit and infectioncould discriminate patients developing NCs with a probability of 76.6%.CONCLUSIONS: Previous stroke, persistent malnutrition and inflammation, severity of heart failure, and post-LVAD infections are key factors associated withdevelopment of NCs after LVAD implantation.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
