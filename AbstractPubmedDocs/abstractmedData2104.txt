ASAIO Trans. 1990 Jul-Sep;36(3):M700-3.Oral anticoagulation in patients with ventricular assist devices.Szukalski EA(1), Reedy JE, Pennington DG, Swartz MT, McBride LR, Miller LW.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, St. Louis University Medical Center, Missouri63110-0250.Nine men aged 25-63 years (mean 42 years) received pulsatile ventricular assistdevices (VADs) as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Duration of support rangedfrom 8-266 days (mean 70.7 days); seven patients (pts.) were bridged with a LVAD and two received BVADs. All pts. were maintained on oral anticoagulants afterinitial intravenous (IV) heparin or dextran therapy. During warfarin therapy,supplemental IV heparin was used only if the prothrombin time fell below 1.5times control (approximately 30% activity). In 639 days of support, there was onethromboembolic event due to mechanical failure, and one pt. had thrombus in theVAD which did not embolize.
