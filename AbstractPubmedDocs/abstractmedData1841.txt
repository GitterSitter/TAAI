Trials evaluating circulatory assist forpermanent circulatory assist device implications are underway. A population ofpatients is beginning to emerge who are resuscitated using readily available"acute" devices and need long-term supporting "chronic" device to bridge eithercardiac transplantation or permanent device implantation. Careful management ofthis new acute-to-chronic bridge group will maximize the chances of a successful long-term outcome. The best strategies for management may only unfold by lateranalysis of larger populations. This article summarizes the current utilizationof acute and chronic devices, as well as the small but growing population ofacute-to-chronic bridge patients, and suggests what seem today to be soundmanagement principles for them.
