The number ofheart transplants reported to the International Society of Heart and LungTransplantation registry worldwide has been 3,500-4,000 annually, but has notbeen increased over the past 2 decades because of donor shortage despite thegrowing number of patients with HF. This imbalance between the supply of donorhearts and the demand of patients with endstage HF has led to increased use ofmechanical circulatory support as destination therapy, because the supply ofmechanical devices is virtually unlimited. Although mechanical circulatorysupport technology is improving, heart transplantation remains the preferredtreatment for many patients because of major complications, such as stroke,bleeding and infection, and because of limited quality of life related to thedriveline and the need for battery change. Therefore, significant efforts havebeen made to maximize the number of heart transplants and to ensure goodoutcomes.
