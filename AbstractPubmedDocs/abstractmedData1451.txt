We reviewed our experience with pulsatile versusnon-pulsatile temporary mechanical support at our institution to determineoptimal strategy for survival. From January 2001 to December 2003, mechanicalsupport for cardiogenic shock was instituted in 38 patients. Non-pulsatiledevices (NP group) were used in 22 patients and pulsatile devices (P group) in 16patients. Indications for the NP group were post-cardiotomy shock (PCS) in 17,myocardial infarction in 2, and isolated post-cardiotomy right ventricularfailure in 3 patients. In the P group, 9 had the device placed for PCS, 3 forviral myocarditis, 1 after myocardial infarction, and 3 for right ventricular(RV) failure. Overall, bleeding, limb ischemia, and multi-system organ failurewere higher in NP group with 5 weaned and 3 surviving to discharge (14%). In the P group, survivors included 7 weaned and 3 transplanted patients (63%). With the exception of isolated RV failure, we obtained a dismal survival result withECMO/centrifugal circuits for treatment of cardiogenic shock. For refractory pumpfailure, improved survival was achieved by using intermediate-term pulsatiledevices with early transition to a chronic device and/or heart transplantation.
