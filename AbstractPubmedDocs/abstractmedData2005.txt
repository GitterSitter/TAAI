We studied changes in New York Heart Association class, mean arterial pressure, resting cardiac output, end-organ function, exercise oxygenconsumption, and exercise cardiac output in 12 LVAD recipients. In addition,resting levels of neurohormonal factors were evaluated 4 to 16 weeks afterimplantation. Two of the 12 patients died of right heart failure and 1 ofaspiration; all deaths occurred in the first 2 weeks after LVAD implantation. Of the other 9 patients, 8 improved to New York Heart Association class I and 1 toclass II, all of whom were in class IV preoperatively. The 4 patients whounderwent exercise testing achieved an exercise oxygen consumption of 15.0 +/-2.7 mL.kg-1.min-1, which was paralleled by an increase in resting cardiac output from 3.07 +/- 0.9 L.min-1 preoperatively to 5.66 +/- 1.1 L.min-1 at 2 months, andmean arterial pressure from 60 +/- 8 to 91 +/- 10 mm Hg at 2 months, a benefitthat was maintained for up to 10 months. End-organ function revealed comparableimprovement at 2 months for both creatinine (1.68 +/- 0.7 to 1.0 +/- 0.19mg.dL-1) and total bilirubin (1.37 +/- 1.17 to 0.54 +/- 0.26 mg.dL-1) levels.Levels of neurohormones were within normal limits. Adverse clinical events after the perioperative period were minimal, and no thromboembolic complicationsoccurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
