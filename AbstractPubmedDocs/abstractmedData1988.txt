ASAIO J. 1995 Jul-Sep;41(3):M539-43.Protocol for releasing Novacor left ventricular assist system patientsout-of-hospital.Pristas JM(1), Winowich S, Nastala CJ, Gifford J, Conner EA, Borovetz HS,Griffith BP, Portner PM, Kormos RL.Author information: (1)Artificial Heart Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA15213-2582, USA.Between September 1984 and April 1995, the Novacor left ventricular assist system(LVAS) has provided more than 13,000 days of mechanical circulatory support tocardiac transplant candidates in the United States and Europe. The duration ofsupport of these 312 patients has ranged between 1 and 370 days, with an average support of 40 days, including use of the console based system and the wearablesystem. Of this group, 21% have been supported for more than 60 days, with anaverage support of 118 days. We have seen that patients who have been supportedfor more than 30 days have recovered from the effects of LVAS implant surgery andhave shown a potential for rehabilitation from morbid congestive heart failure.Few changes to the pump settings or the medical orders have been needed after thethird postoperative week. The reliability of the LVAS and the degree to whichpatients can be rehabilitated suggest that restricting patients to a hospitalenvironment is unnecessary. In addition, the increasing wait for a donor heart,the quality of life that can be achieved, and the high cost of inpatient caremake it desirable to discharge patients from the hospital and allow them to awaita donor heart in a more home-like setting.
