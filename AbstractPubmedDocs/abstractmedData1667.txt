In addition, the cost as compared tocurrent ventricular assist devices was determined.RESULTS: Between July 2000 and November 2001, 4 patients have been managed withambulatory IABP in our combined University of Wisconsin and William S. Middleton Veterans Administration programs. All 4 patients had ischemia as their mode ofheart failure, and each had a relative contraindication to standard ventricularassist device use. All 4 patients had ambulatory IABPs successfully placedthrough the left axillary artery without complication, and were able to ambulate early after ambulatory IABP placement, and increased their rehabilitation status before transplantation. Ambulatory IABP support ranged from 12 to 70 days. All 4 patients have been successfully transplanted and discharged from the hospital.Use of the ambulatory IABP support, even with multiple replacements, translatedto 10- to 50-fold savings for each of the reported patients versus standardventricular assist device use.CONCLUSIONS: As a result of our initial experience, we believe that ambulatoryIABP is an excellent mode of support in selected patients, and is cost-effective,as compared to conventional ventricular assist device therapy.
