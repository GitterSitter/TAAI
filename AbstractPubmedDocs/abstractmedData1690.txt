Sinceits introduction in the 60's, its indication has expanded from acute respiratory failure to acute cardiac failure refractory to conventional treatments. Thetarget group involves mainly those patients presenting with a cardiogenic shockfollowing cardiac surgery or acute myocardial infarction. The advantages of this form of circulatory support, when compared with long-term ventricular assistdevices, are its less invasive aspect, its ease of implantation and its reducedcost. However, its main limitation lies in its limited duration of 7 to 10 days, in particular because of hemorrhage complications. Currently, ECMO provides atemporary hemodynamical stability in order to perform an invasive cardiactreatment (coronary bypass or percutaneous dilatation), or to assess theeligibility of the patient for a long-term ventricular assist device, which will enable to wait for the availability of an allograft. The latter scenario iscrucial nowadays because of the severe lack of organ donors, which is the leadingcause of death among patients waiting for a heart transplant.
