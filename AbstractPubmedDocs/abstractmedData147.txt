(2)From the Departments of Surgery(H.T., L.S., B.K., L.K.T., T.O., S.C., Z.K., Y.N.) and Medicine (N.U., P.C.,D.M.M., U.P.J.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.BACKGROUND: Mortality for refractory cardiogenic shock remains high. In thispatient cohort, there have been mixed results in mechanical circulatory supportdevice use as a bridge-to-decision therapy. We evaluated a continuous-flowexternal ventricular assist device (VAD), CentriMag VAD (Thoratec Corp.,Pleasanton, CA), in patients with various causes of refractory cardiogenic shock.METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective review of adult patients whounderwent surgical CentriMag VAD insertion as bridge-to-decision therapy. FromJanuary 2007 through June 2012, 143 patients received CentriMag VAD. The cause ofrefractory cardiogenic shock was failure of medical management in 71 patients,postcardiotomy shock in 37, graft failure post-heart transplantation in 22, andright ventricular failure post-implantable left VAD in 13. Mean age was 52±16years, and 71% were in INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) profile 1. Among 158 device runs, device configuration wasBiVAD in 67%, isolated right VAD in 26%, and isolated left VAD in 8%. Medianduration of support was 14 days (interquartile range, 8-26). Survival was 69% at 30 days and 49% at 1 year. The next destination after the CentriMag VAD wasmyocardial recovery in 30%, device exchange to an implantable VAD in 15%, andheart transplantation in 18%. The failure of medical management and the graftfailure post-heart transplantation groups had higher 30-day survival comparedwith the postcardiotomy shock group. Major bleeding events occurred in 33% andcerebrovascular accidents in 14%. There was no CentriMag pump failure orthrombosis.CONCLUSIONS: Bridge-to-decision therapy with CentriMag VAD is feasible in avariety of refractory cardiogenic shock settings. Patients with postcardiotomyshock have inferior survival.© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.PMCID: PMC4369383
