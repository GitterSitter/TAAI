The RV exhibits a greater capacity for rapid recovery than the left ventricle,making devices designed specifically for temporary RV MCS attractive. We reportour experience with the Impella Right Direct (RD) and Right Peripheral (RP)temporary ventricular assist devices (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) in patients withARVF.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the clinicaloutcomes of consecutive patients supported with the Impella RD or RP at 2institutions during a 6-year period.RESULTS: During the study period, 18 patients (67% men; mean age 57 ± 10 years)received MCS, 15 with the Impella RD and 3 with the Impella RP. Before RV MCS,all patients required intravenous inotropes, 7 (39%) required inhaled nitricoxide, 7 (39%) required intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, and 2 (11%) hadexperienced a cardiac arrest. Device implantation resulted in an improvement incardiac index (2.1 ± 0.1 liters/min/m(2) pre-implant vs 2.6 ± 0.2 liters/min/m(2)post-implant, p = 0.04) and reduced central venous pressure (22 ± 5 vs 15 ± 4 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Fourteen (78%) patients recovered sufficient RV function tofacilitate device explanation after 7 days (range, 2-19 days) of support, and 4(22%) patients died on support after 6 days (range 1-11 days). Survival to 30days was 72% and to 1 year was 50%. At 1-year follow-up, the mean New York Heart Association functional classification was 1.3 ± 0.5, and only 1 patientdemonstrated severe RV dysfunction on echocardiography.CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with ARVF rapidly recover sufficient RV function tofacilitate device explantation, highlighting an expanding role for minimallyinvasive temporary RV assist devices optimized for the treatment of recoverableARVF.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
