Results of themulticenter clinical trial are reviewed.METHODS: Between October 2001 and June 2004, a total of 39 patients at 12institutions were supported with the Thoratec Implantable Ventricular AssistDevice. Twenty-four patients (62%) received left ventricular assist devices and15 (38%) received biventricular assist devices. Indications included bridge totransplantation (n = 30) and postcardiotomy failure (n = 9). The control groupincluded 100 patients from the Food and Drug Administration approval submissions for the paracorporeal version of the ventricular assist device.RESULTS: Twenty-eight male and 11 female patients, with mean age of 48 years(16-71 years) and body surface area of 1.9 m(2) (1.3-2.4 m2) were supported for3938 patient-days (10.8 patient-years). Mean left ventricular assist device flow index on the first postoperative day was 2.5 +/- 0.5 L/(min x m2). Mean duration of support was 101 days (9-597 days). Eighteen patients were discharged after amean duration of 96 days. There were no ventricular assist device failures.Complications included 13 cases of bleeding requiring reexploration (33.3%), 1embolic and 2 hemorrhagic strokes (7.7%), 5 driveline infections (12.8%), and 2pocket infections (5%). Support to successful outcomes was 70% for bridge totransplantation and 67% for postcardiotomy recovery, versus historical resultsfor the paracorporeal ventricular assist device of 69% for bridge totransplantation and 48% for postcardiotomy recovery.CONCLUSION: The Thoratec Implantable Ventricular Assist Device is a newimplantable pulsatile ventricular assist device that allows hospital dischargefor patients as a bridge to transplantation or for postcardiotomy failure. It is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved implantable ventricular assistdevice with biventricular capability.
