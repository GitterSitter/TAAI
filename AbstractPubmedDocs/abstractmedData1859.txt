In order to assess deviations inboth groups from normal values, thirty-two healthy subjects served as referencegroup.RESULTS: Patients undergoing Novacor bridging had higher C-reactive protein,leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte levels at all three times, and exhibitedlower CD3 +, CD4+, CD3+/CD45 RO T-cell and natural killer cell counts thanmedically treated patients awaiting transplantation 2 months after the LVASimplantation/listing decision. In comparison to controls, both groups had higher levels of inflammatory activation and lower levels of immunocompetence at allthree times.CONCLUSIONS: While both groups of endstage heart failure patients showimmunological alterations compared to controls, patients who have to be bridgedby the Novacor LVAS exhibit a more pronounced activation of inflammatory markers.This may be due to more advanced heart failure but the device itself also maycontribute to more pronounced inflammation and a temporary suppression ofimmunocompetent cells.
