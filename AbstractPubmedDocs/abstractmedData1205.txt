The number ofmechanical circulatory assist devices to encounter this life-threateningcondition is steadily growing. These devices enable physicians to treat patients with acute cardiac failure refractory to conventional therapy. Mechanicalcirculatory assist devices are considered last resort to prevent or to reverse a cardiogenic shock. Different centrifugal, pulsatile or nonpulsatile (axial) flow pumps are available to rescue patients in different scenarios. These mechanicalcirculatory assist devices can be placed percutaneously or surgically asextracorporeal or intracorporeal mechanical circulatory assist devices.RECENT FINDINGS: Percutaneous mechanical circulatory assist devices are useful toestablish rapid life-saving circulatory support under different circumstances. A stabilized patient can then be transferred to an intensive care unit, acatheterization laboratory or an operating room for further assessment andadditional treatment with possible change to a mid-term or long-term mechanicalcirculatory assist device.SUMMARY: Percutaneous mechanical circulatory assist devices can be implanted inan emergency setting in patients with acute cardiogenic shock refractory toconventional therapy irrespective of the given location. The choice for aspecific mechanical circulatory assist device should be based on the underlyingcondition and individualized prognosis. Based on the findings of this review,circulatory or axial-flow pumps should be considered first-line devices.
