Although temporary support could lead to successful RVADweaning in certain patients, the data remain scarce.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 398 patients who underwent implantable LVAD insertion between January 2000 and December 2012. Of these patients, 44 (11%)required unplanned RVAD support due to severe RV failure after LVAD insertion.For comparison, 37 patients who underwent planned biventricular assist device(BiVAD) insertion were identified during the same study period. We analyzed theearly and late outcomes in these patients.RESULTS: The mean duration of RVAD support was 21 Â± 23 days. Of the 44 patients, 21 (49%) were weaned from the RVAD (weaning group), whereas 23 (51%) requiredcontinued biventricular support (failure group). The failure group had ongoingend-organ dysfunction after RVAD insertion. Hospital mortality was significantly lower in the weaning group (24%) and in the planned BiVAD group (30%) as comparedto the failure group (74%, p = 0.0009). The 6-month actuarial survival rate was75% in the weaning group, 62% in the planned BiVAD group and 13% in the failuregroup (p < 0.0001). Successful bridge to transplant was achieved in 14 patients(67%) in the weaning group as compared with 8 patients (35%) in the failure group(p = 0.03). On multivariate logistic regression analyses, pre-operative whiteblood cell (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.50, p =0.016) and creatinine (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.079 to 0.88, p = 0.03) levels weresignificant predictors for RVAD removal.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who developed acute RV failure after LVAD insertion, only half could be weaned from the temporary RVAD support. An alternativestrategy is necessary in patients who require continuous RVAD support.Published by Elsevier Inc.
