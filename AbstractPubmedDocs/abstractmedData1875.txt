Ischemic cardiomyopathy represents numerically the greatest share as the reasonfor illness in heart transplantation today; their results are not different forpatients following cardiac transplantation due to primary cardiomyopathy. Sinceheart transplantation has become a clinical routine method today, the discrepancybetween the number of the available donor organs and the number of the neededorgans becomes more and more obvious. The longer waiting lists and the longerwaiting times are responsible for the increased use of bridging systems. Todaythe long-term results after heart transplantation are not worse in patients afterbridging. With more experience in the field of mechanical support, betterdevices, and proved indications, frequent improvement of prerequisites fortransplantation can be achieved in this group of patients. The implantableventricles give the patient the change of full mobilization and, therefore, high clinical acceptance of this management can be registered.
