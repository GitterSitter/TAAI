Although the role of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in supporting the failing LV is established, the indications and outcomes of using LVAD in asystemic RV remain unclear. We assessed the role of a third-generation LVAD forsystemic RV support.METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 36 years) received the HeartWare (HeartWareInternational Inc, Framingham, MA) VAD for systemic RV failure (congenitallycorrected transposition of the great arteries in 1 and after atrial switch in 6).Four patients (57%) had severe subpulmonic LV failure, and aggressiveperioperative diuresis with or without hemofiltration was used to offload thesubpulmonic LV. The indications of VAD were (1) bridge to transplant in 3 and (2)bridge to decision for a high transpulmonary gradient in 4. Transplantationoutcome was compared with systemic RV failure without VAD bridge in 19 patients(years 1989 to 2013).RESULTS: Systemic RV support alone was achieved in all patients, with no earlydeaths (≤30 days). Overall, 6 (86%) returned home, 3 (44%) received a transplant,2 (28%) died of noncardiac causes, and 2 (28%) continue on VAD support (mediansupport, 232 days). Repeat catheterization (n = 4) showed an improved mediantranspulmonary gradient in 3 patients (median 18.5 mm Hg pre-VAD vs 8.0 mm Hgpost-VAD). Two bridge-to-decision patients received transplants at 640 and 685days. The stroke rate on VAD support was 43% (2 thromboembolic and 1 hemorrhagic;3 with satisfactory recovery). De novo aortic regurgitation was 29% (n = 2; 1valve replacement). All patients (n = 3) survived transplantation (vs 10.5% earlymortality without VAD bridge; p = 1.00) and were well at follow-up (range, 53 to 700 days).CONCLUSIONS: The third-generation VAD provides durable support for systemic RVfailure as a bridge to transplant and as a strategy to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance. Although concomitant subpulmonic LV failure is common, systemic RVsupport alone was achieved in all patients.Copyright © 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
