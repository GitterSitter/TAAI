Mechanical circulatory support wasindicated if the hemodynamic and clinical status deteriorated despitepharmacotherapy with catecholamines, vasodilators, and intravenous use of thephosphodiesterase inhibitor enoximone. Sequelae of cardiogenic shock such asrenal, hepatic and respiratory insufficiency were not considered acontraindication for mechanical support. The analysis of preimplant data such as serum creatinine, liver enzymes and pulmonary gas exchange did not identify anypredictive indicator of irreversible organ damage. Functional recovery ofpreexisting respiratory, hepatic and renal dysfunction was found in 91%, 90%, and85%, respectively. Subsequent transplantation, however, was affected by thenumber of failing organs prior to mechanical support. Of 17 patients withisolated organ failure prior to assist, 14 (82%) were transplanted. By contrast, 9 (75%) of 12 with combined failure of two organs, and only 6 (54%) of 11patients with clinical patterns of three failing organ systems receivedtransplants. In all patients who underwent successful transplantation,transplantability was associated with rapid organ recovery within 10 to 15 daysafter initiating mechanical assistance.
