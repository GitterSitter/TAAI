Hershey Medical Center, Penn State HersheyCollege of Medicine, Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, Hershey, PA17033-0850, USA. aundar@psu.eduExtracorporeal life support (ECLS) and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) have become indispensable treatment tools for pediatric patients with congenital heartdefects undergoing peri-operative or end-stage heart and/or lung failure. ECLSand MCS can serve as bridges to recovery, transplantation (heart or lung),destination therapy, or "bridge to bridge" long-term MCS. Dependent on patientcondition, venoarterial ECMO (V-A ECMO) for heart and lung support, venovenousECMO (V-V ECMO) for respiratory support, and MCS for uni- and biventricularsupport can be selected properly. Considering small patient body size, the accesssites and cannulation should be selected carefully to obtain adequate blood flow,minimum injury, and easy management. The applying equipment, including tubing,cannulae, oxygenator and blood pump, need to be selected optimally in order toenable rapid setup and priming, successful cannulation and early support, and to reduce the risk of device-related morbidity and mortality. The aim of this reviewmanuscript was to discuss briefly the current devices for pediatric ECLS and MCS available in US.
