The present study reviewed our resultsfollowing VAD implantation. We retrospectively reviewed patients that underwentimplantation of a VAD between October 2004 and October 2008. Data collectedincluded age at implantation, gender, weight, underlying disease, pre- andpostdevice clinical status, complications, and outcome. Fifteen patients wereidentified (9 female and 6 male, average age: 8.8 years, range 0.3-14.8; average weight 31.1 kg, range 5.2-86.4). Indications for VAD support were dilatedcardiomyopathy in 14 patients and progressing heart failure with a singleventricle physiology (bidirectional Glenn shunt) in one patient. Three patients(20%) were bridged from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to VAD. Averagesupport was 29 (1-108) days. Fourteen patients were on a bi-VAD, one patient(single ventricle) had single VAD support. Three patients developedmediastinal/pericardial fluid collections, requiring surgical exploration in two,and drain insertion in one. Three patients presented with neurological symptoms. In two patients, a total of three blood pumps were exchanged due to thrombusformation. No patient was weaned off the VAD; two patients (13%) died on the VAD.All surviving patients are neurologically intact at follow-up. In our experience,VAD support provides an effective means of bridging children with advanceddilated cardiomyopathy or heart failure to transplantation with a relativelysmall number of complications and deaths given the complexity of the patientpopulation.© 2010, Copyright the Authors.
