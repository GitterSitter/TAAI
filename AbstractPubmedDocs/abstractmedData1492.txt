ASAIO J. 2004 Nov-Dec;50(6):621-3.Emergency reinforcement of cracked paracorporeal blood pumps.Schima H(1), Reindl C, Stoiber M, RÃ¶thy W, Wieselthaler G.Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Engineering and Physics, Medical University ofVienna, Vienna, Austria.In a patient with biventricular paracorporeal cardiac support, severe cracks inthe outer pump housing occurred for unknown reasons (possibly because of theapplication of solvent). Pump replacement was considered but estimated to be avery high risk for this particular patient. Therefore, it was decided to glue theventricles. Gluing was done after pilot tests in a two stage procedure: first,with a special glue that hardens under exposure to ultraviolet light and thenwith a two component low exothermic epoxy resin. The procedure resulted in verysatisfying stability for the remainder of the bridging period, and the patientcould be transplanted successfully 59 days after the event. It is concluded that a carefully selected gluing procedure (caveats: with previously tested glue, avalidated procedure, and as a last resort only) may bring less risk in such rare cases of pump cracks than a pump exchange.
