The angiogenic ligand PlGF and its target receptor fms-like tyrosine kinase 1modulate vascular growth and function, but their relevance in human HF isundefined.METHODS: We measured plasma PlGF and sFlt-1 in 1,403 patients from the Penn HeartFailure Study, a multicenter cohort of chronic systolic HF. Subjects werefollowed for death, cardiac transplantation, or ventricular assist deviceplacement over a median follow-up of 2 years.RESULTS: The sFlt-1 was independently associated with measures of HF severity,including New York Heart Association functional class (p < 0.01) and B-typenatriuretic peptide (p < 0.01). Patients in the 4th quartile of sFlt-1 (>379pg/ml) had a 6.17-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes (p < 0.01). Thisassociation was robust, even after adjustment for the Seattle Failure Model(hazard ratio: 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76 to 2.27, p < 0.01) andclinical confounders including HF etiology (hazard ratio: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.06 to2.63, p = 0.03). Combined assessment of sFlt-1 and B-type natriuretic peptideexhibited high predictive accuracy at 1 year (area under the receiver-operatorcharacteristic curve: 0.791, 95% CI: 0.752 to 0.831) that was greater than eithermarker alone (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). In contrast, PlGF was not an independent marker of disease severity or outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a role for sFlt-1 in the biology of human HF.With additional study, circulating sFlt-1 might emerge as a clinically usefulbiomarker to assess the influence of vascular remodeling on clinical outcomes.Copyright Â© 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
