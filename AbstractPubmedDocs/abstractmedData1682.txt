Most clinical experience to date has involved theshort-term support of patients weighing 6 kg and larger. For cases of VADimplementation in pediatric patients, the assist device showed tremendous promisein reversing cardiac failure and providing adequate support as a bridge tocardiac transplantation. The Medos-HIA system, Berlin Heart, MedtronicBio-Medicus Pump, Abiomed BVS 5000, Toyobo-Zeon pumps, and Hemopumps have proven successful for short-term circulatory support for the pediatric population. TheJarvik 2000 and Pierce-Donachy pediatric system further demonstrate the potentialto be used for pediatric circulatory support. The clinical and experimentalsuccess of these support systems provide encouragement to believe that long-term support is possible.
