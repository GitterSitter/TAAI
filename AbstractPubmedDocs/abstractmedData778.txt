Concerns includethe patient's adaptation to life on a device and the ethical, clinical, andpractical issues associated with living on mechanical support. On the basis ofour experience treating 175 consecutive VAD patients, we have developed a modelto address the ethical and psychosocial needs of patients undergoing VADimplantation. Patient preparation for VAD implantation encompasses three phases: 1) initial information regarding the physical events involved in implantation,risks and benefits of current device technology, and the use of VAD as a rescuedevice; 2) preimplant preparation including completion of advance directivesspecific to BTT/DT, competency determination, and identifying a patientspokesperson, multidisciplinary consultants, and cultural preferences regardingdevice withdrawal; and 3) VAD-specific end-of-life issues including plans fordevice replacement and palliative care with hospice or device withdrawal. Thisthree-phase 10-point model addresses the ethical and psychosocial issues thatshould be discussed with patients undergoing VAD support.
