Epub2013 Oct 10.A history of devices as an alternative to heart transplantation.Stewart GC(1), Mehra MR.Author information: (1)Center for Advanced Heart Disease, Brigham and Women's Hospital, HarvardMedical School, 75 Francis Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.Erratum in    Heart Fail Clin. 2014 Apr;10(2):xiii.The rapid evolution of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has extended survivaland improved quality of life for patients suffering from the most advanced heart failure (HF). Survival at one year after placement of a left ventricular assistdevice exceeds 80%. MCS and transplant have developed in counterpoint to eachother. Patients with HF now have a meaningful option for lifelong support even ifthey are not candidates for heart transplant.
