Currently, health care providers have limited experience inmanaging this complex patient population. Thus, we created a standardized method of initial evaluation and algorithmic approach of management to help in themanagement of emergencies in this unique patient population. We present acomprehensive overview of the types of mechanical assist devices, theircomplications, and an algorithmic approach to the emergency management in thepatients with mechanical circulatory support. A systematic method is crucial inprompt and early recognition of emergencies to ensure appropriate management ofthese patients.
