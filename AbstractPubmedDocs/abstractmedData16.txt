Twenty-six of these were out of hospitalcardiac arrests and were excluded from this analysis. The median age was 43years,in the range of 11 to 73years.RESULTS: The median duration of ECMO support was 4.5days. Mortality whilesupported by ECMO was 50% with a median support time of 2days. Weaning from ECMO was achieved for 49 patients with the following outcomes: cardiac recovery (60%),heart transplantation (26%), and VAD implantation (14%). Median duration ofsupport before weaning was 8days. Hospital survival was 83%, 61.5% and 71% forcardiac recovery, heart transplantation and VAD implantation, respectively. ECMO weaning was significantly improved in all patients who had normalized their renalfunction, and when duration of support>6days (HR: 4.255 [1.255-14.493], p=0.02and HR: 2.164 [1.152-4.082], p=0.02, respectively). A creatinine level>14mg/l theday of weaning was a significant predictor of death (HR: 5.807 [1.089-30.953];p=0.04). Median follow up was 2.4years; one-year survival rate was 78%, 51% and75% for cardiac recovery, heart transplantation and VAD implantation,respectively.CONCLUSION: With at least 6days of support, ECMO allowed a better patientselection for myocardial recovery, VAD implantation or heart transplantation.Whether VAD implantation or heart transplant in those patients is a betterindication remains to be evaluated.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
