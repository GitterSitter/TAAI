Four successful clinical implants are presented.METHODS AND RESULTS: Four male patients had end-stage left heart failure andreceived a DuraHeart VAD as a left ventricular assist device forbridge-to-transplantation. The pump showed good performance with flow rates of4.9+/-0.5 L/min after gradual weaning of extracorporeal circulation. The pumpflow was then maintained at 6.1+/-0.5, 5.5+/-0.3, 5.5+/-0.1, 5.7+/-0.1, 5.5, 6.4 and 6.5 L/min at the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th and 24th postoperative week,respectively. No significant elevation of mean plasma-free hemoglobin wasdetected. The patients were discharged on the 18th, 42nd, 41st and 31stpostoperative day, respectively, and all were successfully transplanted on the202nd, 84th, 128th and 96th postoperative day, respectively. At the time oftransplant surfaces of the removed pumps were free from thrombus formation,although intraventricular pannus growth was observed around the inflow cannulaein all patients.CONCLUSION: The DuraHeart VAD showed stable and sufficient circulatory supportfor the bridge-to-transplant procedure in this cohort of 4 patients.
