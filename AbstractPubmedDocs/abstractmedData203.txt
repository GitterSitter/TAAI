There is rapidgrowth in the use of left ventricular assist device therapy (LVAD) for advancedheart failure, with a movement to pursue device intervention earlier in thedisease spectrum before comorbidities escalate. With this increase in LVAD usehave come new challenges, including unanticipated adverse events and highreadmission rates. Simultaneously, complications encountered during LVAD support and an increased number of patients supported with a goal for transplant have hadan important effect on the allocation of cardiac allografts. Still, the fieldcontinues to evolve and address these challenges in systematic fashion to providenovel solutions and meet the needs of a growing population with advanced heartfailure. This has led to an extensive body of literature, ranging from casereports to multicenter clinical trials, which will enhance the future of LVADtechnology and patient outcomes. This review summarizes important publications inmechanical circulatory support during the past 24 months.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
