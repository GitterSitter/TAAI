We report on 2years of experience with this device, which we implanted for the first time inOctober 1999.METHODS: Since October 1999, 6 male patients between 55 and 69 years of age (mean65 +/- 6 years) have received the device at our center; all were in New YorkHeart Association functional class IV and ineligible for heart transplantation.RESULTS: All surgical procedures were uneventful, with a timely extubation in 5of 6 patients. Duration of support was 17 to 670 (mean 245 +/- 138) days, with a cumulative experience of 4.5 years. Three patients recovered to be dischargedfrom hospital under support and are long-term survivors. Three patients died 17, 31, and 112 days after implantation from multiple organ failure without beingdischarged to their homes. The survival rate is 50% after 18 months. There wereno major system-related problems or any device-related infections, which areotherwise commonly found among vertricular assist device patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary experience demonstrates the reliability and efficacyof the different parts of the system. Nevertheless, further sophistication isneeded to reduce the size of its components, which so far still constitutes alimiting factor.
