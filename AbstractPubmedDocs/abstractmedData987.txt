Acute right ventricular dysfunction or rightventricular failure after LVAD implantation has important influence on morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to assess the management of rightventricular dysfunction after LVAD implantation.METHODS: The study group comprised 21 patients with implanted HeartMate II LVADsince December, 2006 to April, 2009. We evaluated in retrospective fashionbaseline parameters of cardiovascular and other organ systems before LVADimplantation, applied pharmacological and mechanical support for the rightventricle, and important clinical outcomes to the end ofJune, 2009.RESULTS: LVAD was implanted in 18 men and 3 women with mean age of 48.7 +/- 11.2 years. The most frequent diagnosis was dilatational cardiomyopathy (9 patients;42.9%), and the most frequent indication for implantation wasbridge-to-transplantation (19 patients; 90.4%). Pharmacological support of theright ventricle after LVAD implantation comprised dobutamine (21 patients; 100%),milrinone (21 patients; 100%), isoproterenol (1 patient; 4.8%), and levosimendan (5 patients; 23.8%). In 2 (9.5%) cases there was a need for repeated application of levosimendan during postoperative course. Inhalational nitric oxide was usedin 14 (66.7%) patients. Despite extensive pharmacological support, 3 (14.3%)patients needed right ventricular assist device (RVAD) implantation. Mostpatients (9; 42.8%) survived to heart transplantation; in one (4.8%) case LVADwas successfuly explanted; 6 (28.6%) patients is living with LVAD; 5 (23.8%)patients died during LVAD support.CONCLUSION: After LVAD implantation there is a need for aggressivepharmacological, and in some cases mechanical, support of the right ventricularfunction to provide adequate blood flow to LVAD in order to minimize morbidityand mortality.
