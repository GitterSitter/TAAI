Therapiesinclude cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support, as wellinotropic agents for the short-term. Despite a growing armamentarium ofresources, the clinician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of eachtherapy to develop an optimal treatment strategy. While cardiac transplantationremains the only true "cure" for end-stage disease, this resource is limited and the demand continues to far outpace the supply. For patients who aretransplant-ineligible or likely to succumb to their illness prior to transplant, ventricular assist device therapy has now become a viable option for improvingmorbidity and mortality. Particularly for the non-operative patient, intravenous inotropes can be utilized for symptom control. Regardless of the treatmentsconsidered, care of the heart failure patient requires thoughtful dialogue,multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized care. While survival isimportant, most patients covet quality of life above all outcomes. An oftenoverlooked component is the patient's control over the dying process. It is vitalthat clinicians make goals-of-care discussions a priority when seeing patientswith advanced heart failure. The use of palliative care consultation iswell-validated and facilitates these difficult conversations to ensure that allpatient needs are ultimately met.PMCID: PMC4347211 [Available on 2016-02-01]
