Short-term circulatory supportwith the newest generation of magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow pumpsaffords several potential advantages. Herein, we present our experience with sucha pump-the CentriMag Levitronix LLC; Waltham, Mass) centrifugal-flow ventricular assist device-in 4 critically ill patients who were in cardiogenic shock. FromNovember 2007 through March 2008, 3 patients were supported after cardiacsurgery, and 1 after chronic heart failure worsened. Two patients were bridged toheart transplantation, and 2 died during support. Perfusion during support wasevaluated in terms of serum lactic acid levels and oxygenation values. In all of the patients, the CentriMag's pump flow was adequate, and continuous mechanicalventilation support was provided. Lactic acid levels substantially improved with CentriMag support and were maintained at near-normal levels throughout. At thesame time, arterial pH, PO2, and carbon dioxide levels remained within acceptableranges. No thromboembolic events or mechanical failures occurred. Our experience indicates that short-term use of the CentriMag ventricular assist device duringacute heart failure can restore and adequately support circulation until recoveryor until the application of definitive therapy.PMCID: PMC2565526
