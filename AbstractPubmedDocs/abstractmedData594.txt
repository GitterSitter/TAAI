Thiscondition represent a new era of heart failure surgery.METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 159 patients from 1998 to 2011 with amean age of 40.0 years (range = 5-65), who were mostly diagnosed as dilatedcardiomyopathy (n = 113). After April 2007, 67 patients underwent vascular assistdevice (VAD) implantation surgery for acute or chronic end-stage heart failure.We performed 69 heart transplantation with 27 on VAD systems beforetransplantation.RESULTS: Early mortality was 13.3% with 21 patients after the hearttransplantation. The 67 patients supported with VAD did not experience anintraoperative death. The mean support time was 214 days (range = 3-1035).Twenty-four patients (35.8%) are still on pump support. The overall survivaluntil transplantation or weaning was 77.6% at mean of 250.7 days survival reached90% with Heartware (Hartware Inc, Miramar, Fla, USA) continuous flow pumps.CONCLUSION: After the introduction of VAD in 2007, the overall picture has beenrestructured radically for heart failure surgery, reducing patient loss on thewaiting list. Especially, since 2009 nearly 80% of donor hearts were used forpatients on mechanical circulatory support.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
