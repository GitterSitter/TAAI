J Heart Transplant. 1990 Mar-Apr;9(2):160-74.Simple electrical model of the circulation to explore design parameters for askeletal muscle ventricle.Voytik SL(1), Babbs CF, Badylak SF.Author information: (1)Biomedical Engineering Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.To efficiently investigate a variety of designs for an accessory skeletal muscle ventricle for circulatory assistance, we developed an electrical model of thehuman circulatory system. Heart and blood vessels were modeled asresistive-capacitive networks, pressures as voltages, blood flow as electriccurrent, and the cardiac valves as diodes. Pumping of blood was simulated by the application of damped rectangular voltage pulses to the capacitances of thecardiac ventricles and the skeletal muscle ventricle. Three configurations of askeletal muscle ventricle were studied: the apico-aortic, in which the skeletalmuscle ventricle is interposed between the left ventricle and the abdominalaorta; the aorto-aortic, in which the skeletal muscle ventricle is interposedbetween the thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta; and the atrial-aortic, inwhich the skeletal muscle ventricle is interposed between the left atrium andabdominal aorta. The three skeletal muscle ventricle designs were tested ascounterpulsatile assist devices in simulations of the normal circulation andcongestive heart failure. Performance of the various skeletal muscle ventricledesigns was evaluated by comparing total output, mean left ventricular powerexpenditure, mean skeletal muscle ventricle power expenditure, and mean perfusionpressure of the skeletal muscle comprising the pouch. Under both normal heart andheart failure conditions, the apico-aortic design was superior to theaorto-aortic and to the atrial-aortic designs. With optimal stimulationparameters, the apico-aortic design reduced left ventricular minute work to 16%of normal during simulated heart failure while maintaining a viable restingcardiac output of 3.4 L/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
