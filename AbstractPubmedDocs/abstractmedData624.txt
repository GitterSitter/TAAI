We review our experience with emergent peripheral cardiopulmonary support as a bridge todecision in these patients.METHODS: A retrospective review from January 2009 through December 2010 wasconducted of 26 consecutive adult patients at a single institution with acuterefractory cardiogenic shock who underwent salvage peripheral cardiopulmonarysupport.RESULTS: There were 18 men and 8 women with a mean age of 54 years (range 18 to76). Indications for support: acute myocardial infarction (n = 16), decompensatedchronic heart failure (n = 2), refractory arrhythmic arrest (n = 3), acutevalvular pathology (n = 4), and unknown (n = 1). Patients with primarypostcardiotomy shock were excluded. Median duration of support was 3 days (range 1 to 14). Decisions included: withdraw of support (n = 4), recovery (n = 5), and bridge to a procedure (n = 17). The procedures were percutaneous coronaryintervention (n = 4), left ventricular assist device (n = 9), hearttransplantation (n = 1), and miscellaneous cardiac surgery (n = 3). Overallsurvival to discharge was 65%. In the recovery and bridge to a procedure group,78% were discharged from the hospital and survival at three months was 72%.CONCLUSIONS: Salvage peripheral cardiopulmonary support is a useful tool torapidly stabilize acute refractory cardiogenic shock permitting an assessment of neurologic and end-organ viability.© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
