The objective of this study was to evaluateoutcomes of pediatric patients supported by the HMII LVAD.METHODS: This was a retrospective review of the Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) of patients supported with a HMII from April 2008 to September 2011. The primary cohort comprised pediatric patients aged 11 to 18 years. Outcomes were compared with a group of young adultsaged 19 to 39 years who underwent HMII implant during the same period. Ischemicetiologies for heart failure were excluded.RESULTS: There were 28 pediatric patients, of whom 19 (68%) were males, 14 (46%) were African American, and 7 (25%) underwent device placement in a pediatrichospital. Competing outcomes analysis showed that at 6 months of follow-up, thecomposite of survival to transplantation, ongoing support, or recovery was 96%for the pediatric group, which was not significantly different from the youngadult group (96%, p = 0.330). The 2 groups had similar INTERMACS profiles butdiffered in diagnosis, weight, and morbidities. Bleeding complications requiring surgical intervention were more common in the pediatric group.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric outcomes with a HMII LVAD are comparable to that of young adults. As we continue to monitor this growing group, more sophisticatedcharacterization and comparisons will be possible. Also, as technology progressand second- and third-generation devices are introduced, the number of childrenwho will benefit from mechanical support will continue to grow.Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.
