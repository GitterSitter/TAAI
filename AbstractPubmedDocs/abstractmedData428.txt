Patients approaching death, or their surrogates, may request withdrawal of LVAD support. We sought to studythe attitudes and practices of heart failure clinicians regarding withdrawal ofLVAD support in patients approaching death.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using internet-based and secure methods, we surveyed membersof the European Society of Cardiology-Heart Failure Association (ESC-HFA), theInternational Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), and the HeartFailure Society of America (HFSA) to assess their attitudes and practicesregarding LVAD withdrawal for patients approaching death. The results indicatedthat clinicians have varied attitudes and practices regarding withdrawing LVADsupport in these patients. Furthermore, ESC-HFA clinicians (primarily European)and ISHLT and HFSA clinicians (primarily North American) differed in theirattitudes and practices regarding withdrawal of LVAD support, particularly itsethical and legal permissibility. For example, more European clinicians thanNorth American clinicians regarded withdrawing LVAD support as a form ofeuthanasia.CONCLUSION: Opinions and level of comfort with LVAD withdrawal vary amongclinicians. Clinicians should be aware of suggested approaches or guidelines for managing requests for withdrawal of LVAD therapy.PMCID: PMC4023318
