ASAIO J. 1999 May-Jun;45(3):218-25.Quality of life outcomes in left ventricular assist system inpatients andoutpatients.Dew MA(1), Kormos RL, Winowich S, Nastala CJ, Borovetz HS, Roth LH, Sanchez J,Griffith BP.Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.This study empirically evaluates the quality of life (QOL) effects associatedwith hospital discharge among heart transplant candidates whose lives aremaintained by left ventricular support systems (LVAS). Thirty-five LVASinpatients (18 Novacor, 17 Thoratec) received structured QOL assessmentsapproximately 1 month after device implant. Ten of the patients (8 Novacor, 2Thoratec) were subsequently discharged to either home or a home-like outpatientfacility where their QOL was reassessed. The QOL of LVAS patients, before andafter discharge, was compared with that of demographically similarnonhospitalized heart transplant candidates (n = 55) and recipients (n = 97).Their caregivers' QOL was also assessed. The QOL of LVAS outpatients showedstatistically significant (p<0.05) advantages over remaining LVAS inpatients and nonhospitalized heart candidates. Advantages appeared in physical, emotional, andsocial functioning domains. The QOL of LVAS outpatients also improved (p<0.05)over their own QOL before discharge, with the greatest change in physicalfunctional and emotional status. The QOL of LVAS outpatients most closelyresembled QOL in the transplant recipients. Family caregivers to LVAS outpatientsreported some increases in caregiving burden after patient discharge, but theiroverall well being was not adversely affected. These data provide an empiricbasis for the provision of outpatient programs as appropriate care for eligibleLVAS patients.
