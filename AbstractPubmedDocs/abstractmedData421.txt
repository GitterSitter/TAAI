Amiddle age woman with 'burnt out' hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had mitral valverepair for mitral regurgitation. She needed LVAD to support severe decompensatingheart failure. Repaired mitral valve posed a risk of restricted flow through the device. Mitral commissurotomy was performed on beating heart through the leftventricular apical hole created for insertion of inflow cannula of LVAD.PMCID: PMC3698071
