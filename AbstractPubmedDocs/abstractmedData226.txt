We performed aretrospective review of data from patients who had undergone left axillary IABPimplantation between 2007 and 2012.RESULTS: Fifty patients who received a left axillary IABP as a bridge totransplantation were identified, of whom 42 (84%) underwent heart orheart-multiorgan transplantation. Cumulative survival on IABP support was 92%,and post-transplant 90-day survival was 90%. Median duration of support was 18days. Four of 50 patients (8%) died while on IABP support, and 3 (6%) receivedgreater mechanical circulatory support. Four patients (8%) had clinicallysignificant thromboembolic or bleeding events without long-term sequelae. Themost common minor adverse event was IABP malposition, in 22 patients (44%).Prolonged IABP support in the heart-transplantation cohort was associated withsignificant improvements in mean pulmonary artery pressure and in creatinine and total bilirubin concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous insertion of an IABP through the left axillary arteryis a feasible and relatively well-tolerated strategy to bridge patients withend-stage heart failure to heart transplantation. This form of mechanical-device treatment permits upright sitting and ambulation in those requiring extendedsupport.Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
