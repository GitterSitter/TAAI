The BNP is produced in themyocardium in response to chronic volume overload, but the effects on it ofventricular unloading by VADs are largely unknown.METHODS: Twenty-one patients diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy andsupported by VADs were evaluated for echocardiographic data and blood chemistryincluding BNP. They were divided into patients who died while on mechanicalsupport (group I; n = 9), patients who were transplanted (group II; n = 8) andpatients who were successfully weaned off the system and did not requiretransplantation (group III; n = 4).RESULTS: Brain natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations decreased significantly after initiation of mechanical circulatory support (p = 0.017). Furthermore, the changes in BNP plasma concentrations showed a faster decrease to normal levelswithin the first week after implantation of the VAD in patients who were weanedoff the system (group III) compared to patients in group I and group II.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that ventricular unloading with VADs decreases BNP plasma concentrations in patients who suffer from end-stage heart failure.Furthermore, we hypothesize that an early decrease of BNP plasma concentrationmay be indicative of recovery of ventricular function during mechanicalcirculatory support.
