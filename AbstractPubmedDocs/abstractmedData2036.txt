Circulation. 1993 Nov;88(5 Pt 2):II309-18.Influence of left ventricular assist on valvular regurgitation.Holman WL(1), Bourge RC, Fan P, Kirklin JK, Pacifico AD, Nanda NC.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294.BACKGROUND: The effects of mechanical left ventricular assist on the nonassisted right ventricle have not been fully elucidated. Current information indicatesthat the right ventricle benefits from a lower left atrial pressure; however,ventricular septal shifting and increased venous return caused by leftventricular assist impair right ventricular function. Acute intraoperativealterations in mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation (MR and TR, respectively)may occur as a result of mechanical left ventricular assist but have not yet beendocumented.METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight patients undergoing implantation of a left ventricularassist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation were studied during surgeryby transesophageal echocardiography. MR was present in seven of eight patients,and TR was present in eight of eight patients before LVAD implant (mean MR jetarea, 10.6 +/- 2.4 cm2, mean TR jet area, 4.8 +/- 1.0 cm2). Immediately afterLVAD placement, MR was still present in seven of eight patients, and TR waspresent in eight of eight patients (mean MR jet area, 4.2 +/- 0.9 cm2; mean TRjet area, 8.4 +/- 1.9 cm2) (P < .05 preimplant versus postimplant jet area).These changes in MR and TR were associated with a decrease in left ventricularend-systolic dimension (62 +/- 4 versus 48 +/- 3 mm) and an increase in rightventricular end-systolic dimension (31 +/- 4 versus 40 +/- 5 mm) (P < .05preimplant versus postimplant end-systolic dimension). No patients developedprogressive right ventricular failure during 70 to 279 days of LVAD support.CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical left ventricular assist causes an acute decrease inpreexisting MR. However, left ventricular assist may acutely worsen TR,presumably by shifting the ventricular septum leftward and increasing venousreturn to the right ventricle.
