Ann Thorac Surg. 1993 Jan;55(1):295-8.Ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts: a combined registryexperience.Pae WE Jr(1).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine,Hershey 17033.Data submitted voluntarily to the combined registry for the past 6 years on theuse of ventricular assist devices for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock in 965patients and for circulatory support in conjunction with cardiac transplantation in 544 patients were analyzed. Of those patients whose ventricular function wasexpected to recover, approximately 45% were weaned from circulatory support and25% were discharged from the hospital. Weaning status and hospital discharge werenot different regardless of the type of original operative procedure or the pump design used. In the potential cardiac transplant group, 69% ultimately underwent transplantation and 66% were discharged from the hospital. The demographics (age and sex) of this group parallel those of patients undergoing isolated cardiactransplantation, and the 1- and 2-year survival estimates for patients requiring only univentricular support were equivalent to those of patients having isolated orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Ventricular assist devices are able toprovide reasonable and safe circulatory support in both the postcardiotomycardiogenic shock and the bridge-to-transplantation applications.
