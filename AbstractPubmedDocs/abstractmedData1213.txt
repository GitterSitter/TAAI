The purpose of this trial was to investigate the safety andefficacy of the VA in elderly patients with end-stage heart failure.METHODS: In this prospective trial, patients requiring circulatory support eitheras destination therapy (DT) or as a bridge to transplant (BTT) were implantedwith a VA device.RESULTS: Between June 2003 and August 2006, 9 elderly patients (mean age 65years) were implanted. The median support time was 454 (range 73 to 977) days forthe DT and 35 (range 26 to 508) days for the BTT cohort. All patients survivedimplantation; 30-day mortality was 22% (n = 2). The adverse event profile wasencouraging, with no embolic neurologic events and minimal sepsis. Cumulativetrial support time was 7.3 patient-years.CONCLUSIONS: The VentrAssist shows promise as a safe and reliable"third-generation" VAD. Having demonstrated potential as a DT and prolonged BTTdevice, extended clinical trials are warranted.
