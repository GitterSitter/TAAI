Recognizing that organ allocation in the higheststatus patients remains controversial, we sought to compare outcomes of patients with VADs and those receiving advanced medical therapy.METHODS: The United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to compare survival on the waiting list and posttransplantation survival in status 1A heart transplantation patients receiving VADs or high-dose/dual inotropic therapy or anintraaortic balloon pump( IABP), or both. Adjusted survival was calculated using Cox's proportional hazard model.RESULTS: Adjusted 1-year posttransplantation mortality was higher among patients with VADs compared with patients receiving inotropic agents alone (hazard ratio[HR], 1.48; p<0.05). Survival remained better for patients receiving inotropicagents alone in the post-2008 era (HR, 1.36; p=0.03) and among those withisolated left-sided support (HR, 1.33; p=0.008). When patients who received IABPswere added and analyzed after 2008, the left ventricular assist device (LVAD)group had similar survival (HR, 1.2; p=0.3). Survival on the waiting list,however, was superior among patients with LVADs (HR, 0.56; p<0.05). In a therapy transition analysis, failure of inotropic agents and the need for LVAD supportwas a consistent marker for significantly worse mortality (HR, 1.7; p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Although posttransplantation survival is better for patients who arebridged to transplantation with inotropic treatment only, the cost of failure of inotropic agents is significant, with a nearly doubled mortality for those wholater require VAD support. Survival on the waiting list appears to be improvedamong patients receiving VAD support. Careful selection of the appropriatebridging strategy continues to be a significant clinical challenge.Copyright Â© 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
