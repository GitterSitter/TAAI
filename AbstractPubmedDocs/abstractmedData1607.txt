We hypothesized that matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), would be implicated in the mechanisms that underliedeteriorating heart failure.METHODS: Gridded macro-array filters were used to provide a broad overview of MMPand TIMP mRNA expression in heart failure. Precise mRNA levels of TIMP1, MMP1,and beta-spectrin were determined using quantitative real-timereverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of myocardial samplesfrom 27 patients with deteriorating heart failure who underwent LVADimplantation, from 17 patients with stable ESF who underwent elective hearttransplantation, and from 28 donor organs with good hemodynamic function.RESULTS: Gridded macro-arrays analysis of pooled failing heart samples determinedthat TIMP1 mRNA was the most readily detectable TIMP in failing myocardium.Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression levels in individual patients weresimilar in patients with stable ESF (1.00 +/- 0.24, n = 17) and in donor organsamples (1.49 +/- 0.22, n = 28) but were significantly increased in thedeteriorating heart failure group (5.38 +/- 0.32, n = 26, p < 0.0001 comparedwith patients with ESF). Similarly, MMP1 levels did not differ between donor and ESF groups but increased in the deteriorating failure group (6.04 +/- 0.50, n =27, p < 0.001 compared with the ESF group). Levels of beta-II spectrin were thesame in all 3 groups. Both TIMP1 and MMP1 showed positive correlation with eachother and with previously determined levels of mRNA for both interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) and IL-6 in this patient series when considering all patientsindividually, but neither correlated with tumor necrosis factor alpha.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with deteriorating heart failure have increased expression of TIMP1 and MMP1 mRNA. Correlation with pro-inflammatory cytokines suggestscommon pathways of regulation and potential activation by IL-6 and IL1-beta.
