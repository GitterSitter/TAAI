Epub 2013 Feb 18.Panel reactive antibody monitoring in pediatric patients undergoing ventricleassist device as a bridge to heart transplantation.Grutter G(1), Amodeo A, Brancaccio G, Parisi F.Author information: (1)Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, Bambino Gesù PediatricHospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy. grutter@opbg.netWe describe the incidence and patterns of anti-human leukocyte antigens antibody production in a pediatric population undergoing ventricular assist device (VAD)implantation. Serial panel reactive antibody was obtained prior to VAD implant,during VAD support, and after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Sevenchildren (median age 15 months) underwent VAD support as bridge to OHT.Posttransplant sensitization occurred in 42% of VAD patients and in 14% duringVAD support.© 2013, Copyright the Authors.
