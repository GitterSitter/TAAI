Key features of thesystem include an electrohydraulic energy converter, an automatic control system that produces a Frank-Starling response, and dual ventricles composed ofgraphite-epoxy and titanium with gelatin blood contacting surfaces. The system iscontrolled by a single substrate, hybridized microcircuit (the hybrid).Fabrication of the TAH control hybrid has recently been completed and testingbegun. Its design emphasizes simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. Particular attention was given to optimizing thermal management. Externally controlled TAHsystems have been used in eight in vivo experiments of up to 120 days' duration. In the last two of these experiments, a variable volume device was also implantedwith excellent results. In vivo use of the system has demonstrated theFrank-Starling pump response, but the systems quickly reach maximum output withthe bovine animal models. Human fitting studies, including adult patientsundergoing heart transplantation, demonstrated satisfactory fit of the pumpwithin the pericardium without compression of the vascular structures or chestwall. Measurements of chest circumference, plain chest films, and transesophagealechocardiograms should provide reliable predictions of pump fit in the majorityof patients.
