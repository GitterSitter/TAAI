We report ourinitial experience with the DuraHeart as a bridge to heart transplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, 23 patients (17 males; mean age 35years, range 16-53 years) with endstage heart failure underwent implantation withthe DuraHeart LVAD at Osaka University Hospital. Of those, 7 underwent conversionsurgery from a Nipro paracorporeal LVAD to the DuraHeart. There were no deathsduring the mean support period of 559±241 days (176-999 days). In total, 17patients (74%) remain with the LVAD and 5 (22%) underwent heart transplantationafter 580±302 days (176-982 days) of support. Major adverse events included 8(34%) driveline/pocket infections, 4 (17%) cerebrovascular accidents, 4 (17%)right heart failures requiring mechanical support, and 3 (13%) mechanical device failures (magnetic levitation failure caused by driveline fracture). Of the 5patients who developed pump pocket infection, 3 underwent previous conversionsurgery from the Nipro LVAD.CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with the DuraHeart LVAD in Japan demonstratedexcellent long-term survival with acceptable rates of adverse events. Withrefinement of the system, including mechanical durability, this pump will furtherenhance the quality of life for patients who require long-term mechanicalcirculatory support.
