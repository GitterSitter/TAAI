Becausecirculating WBCs demonstrate similar SCN5A splicing patterns, we hypothesizedthat these WBC-derived splice variants might further stratify patients with HFwho are at risk for arrhythmias.METHODS: Simultaneously obtained myocardial core samples and WBCs were comparedfor SCN5A variants C (VC) and D (VD). Circulating variant levels were comparedamong patients with HF, divided into three groups: HF without an implantablecardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), HF with an ICD without appropriateintervention, and HF with an ICD with appropriate intervention.RESULTS: Myocardial tissue-derived SCN5A variant expression levels stronglycorrelated with circulating WBC samples for both VC and VD variants (r = 0.78 and0.75, respectively). After controlling for covariates, patients with HF who hadreceived an appropriate ICD intervention had higher expression levels of bothWBC-derived SCN5A variants compared with patients with HF with ICDs who had notreceived appropriate ICD intervention (odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.64-6.45; p =0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that circulatingSCN5A variant levels were highly associated with the risk for appropriate ICDintervention (area under the curve ≥0.97).CONCLUSIONS: Circulating expression levels of SCN5A variants were stronglyassociated with myocardial tissue levels. Furthermore, circulating variant levelswere correlative with arrhythmic risk as measured by ICD events in an HFpopulation within 1 year.
