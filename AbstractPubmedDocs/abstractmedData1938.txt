Approximately one-third of them who could benefitfrom circulatory support while waiting for transplantation also require asupporting system for the right ventricle. In addition, the small number ofavailable donor organs means that only those patients with the best prognosis canbe transplanted. From January 1993 to December 1995, 36 patients (33 men, 3women) mean age 41 years (range 19-60) were treated with a total artificial heartsystem, CardioWest at the La Pitié Hospital in Paris and at the Laennec Hospital in Nantes, France. Heart assist lasted 1 to 138 days (mean 31 days). Indications were terminal heart failure due to dilated (n = 21) or ischemic (n = 11)cardiomyopathy and 4 high-risk indications (chronic rejection, primary failure,hereditary heart disease, polyvalve disease). Twenty-two of these patients(61.1%) were transplanted. By using strict selection criteria, the totalartificial heart CardioWest was able to maintain satisfactory hemodynamicconditions until transplantation without compromising the small number of donororgans available. The total artificial heart is the best system available fortotal circulatory support in case of dual ventricular failure. The risk ofinfection is low and the rate of thrombo-embolic events is reduced when care istaken in controlling coagulation, allowing long-term support. Independently ofthe experience of the different teams, CardioWest is the only device currentlyavailable allowing total heart support; its use is justified in particular whenother assist devices are unsuccessful.
