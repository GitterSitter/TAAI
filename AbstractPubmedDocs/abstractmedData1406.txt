Heart transplantation currentlyremains the gold standard option for end-stage heart failure patients. Hearttransplantation is also one of the most limited therapies, not only with regardto the lack of donor hearts but also because of the surgical limitations inherentto the clinical aspects of this severely ill patient population. Mechanicalcirculatory support systems have been developed as effective adjuvant therapeuticoptions in these terminally ill patients. Over the past two decades, mechanicalcirculatory support devices have steadily evolved in the clinical management ofend-stage heart failure, and have emerged as a standard of care for the treatmentof acute and chronic heart failure refractory to conventional medical therapy.Future blood pumps should be smaller and totally implantable, as well as moreefficient, biocompatible, and reliable.
