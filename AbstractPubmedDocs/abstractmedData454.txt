Epub 2013Apr 21.The effect of long-term left ventricular assist device support on myocardialsympathetic activity in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.George RS(1), Birks EJ, Cheetham A, Webb C, Smolenski RT, Khaghani A, Yacoub MH, Kelion A.Author information: (1)Heart Science Centre, Imperial College, London, UK.AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients have abundant levels ofnorepinephrine secondary to failure of the norepinephrine transporter uptakemechanism. Little is known about the effects of an LV assist device (LVAD) oncardiac sympathetic innervations and norepinephrine transporter dysfunction. Thisstudy examines the effects of continuous-flow HeartMate II LVAD on cardiacsympathetic innervations using [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine ([(123)I]MIBG)nuclear imaging.METHODS AND RESULTS: After injecting 431 ± 21 MBq of [(123)I]MIBG, planarscintigraphy was performed at 15 min and 4 h in 14 consecutive non-diabeticnon-ischaemic DCM patients. Scans were executed early post-LVAD implantation (T1)and prior to either device explantation for myocardial recovery or transplantlisting (T2). [(123)I]MIBG measured parameters included early and delayedheart-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate (W/O). Catecholamine levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Following 208.4 ± 85.5days of LVAD support, both early and delayed H/M ratios increased by 42.1% (P <0.001) and 54.7% (P < 0.001), respectively. The W/O rate decreased by 46% (P =0.003). Plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine decreased significantly in correlation with [(123)I]MIBG parameters. Ten patients had recovered and hadtheir device explanted as they had demonstrated a higher percentage change indelayed H/M ratio, W/O rate, and norepinephrine levels. Linear regressionanalysis revealed a strong correlation between percentage changes in bothnorepinephrine and epinephrine and myocardial recovery.CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with LVAD and drug resulted in enhancement of[(123)I]MIBG uptake in DCM patients.
