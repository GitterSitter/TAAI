At some experienced centers, doctors have refrained from earlieroperation after MI to allow for a period of hemodynamic and end-organstabilization.METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the effect of preoperative MI on thesurvival rates of 25 patients who received a Thermocardiosystems IncorporatedLVAD either <2 weeks (Early) (n = 15) or >2 weeks (Late) (n = 10) after MI.Outcome variables included perioperative right ventricular assistance (andright-sided circulatory failure), hemodynamic indexes, percent transplanted orexplanted, and mortality.RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were demonstrated betweendemographic, perioperative or hemodynamic variables between the Early and Lategroups. Patients in the Early group demonstrated a lower rate of perioperativemechanical right ventricular assistance, but had a higher rate of perioperativeinhaled nitric oxide use. In addition, 67% of patients in the Early groupsurvived to transplantation and 7% to explantation, findings comparable to those in the Late group (60% and 0% respectively).CONCLUSIONS: This clinical experience suggests that patients may have comparable outcomes whether implanted early or late after acute MI. These data thereforesupport the early identification and timely application of this modality inpost-MI LVAD candidates, as this strategy may also reveal a subgroup of patients for whom post-MI temporary LVAD insertion may allow for full ventricularrecovery.
