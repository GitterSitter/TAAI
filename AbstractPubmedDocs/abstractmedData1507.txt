Epub 2004 Nov 22.Identification of a gene expression profile that differentiates between ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy.Kittleson MM(1), Ye SQ, Irizarry RA, Minhas KM, Edness G, Conte JV, Parmigiani G,Miller LW, Chen Y, Hall JL, Garcia JG, Hare JM.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins UniversitySchool of Medicine, Baltimore, Md, USA.BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling refines diagnostic and prognosticassessment in oncology but has not yet been applied to myocardial diseases. Wehypothesized that gene expression differentiates ischemic and nonischemiccardiomyopathy, demonstrating that gene expression profiling by clinicalparameters is feasible in cardiology.METHODS AND RESULTS: Affymetrix U133A microarrays of 48 myocardial samples fromJohns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) and the University of Minnesota (UM) obtained (1) attransplantation or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement (end-stage;n=25), (2) after LVAD support (post-LVAD; n=16), and (3) from newly diagnosedpatients (biopsy; n=7) were analyzed with prediction analysis of microarrays. Atraining set was used to develop the profile and test sets to validate theaccuracy of the profile. An etiology prediction profile developed in end-stageJHH samples was tested in independent samples from both JHH and UM with 100%sensitivity and 100% specificity in end-stage samples and 33% sensitivity and100% specificity in both post-LVAD and biopsy samples. The overall sensitivitywas 89% (95% CI 75% to 100%), and specificity was 89% (95% CI 60% to 100%) over210 random partitions of end-stage samples into training and test sets. Age,gender, and hemodynamic differences did not affect the profile's accuracy instratified analyses. Select gene expression was confirmed with quantitativepolymerase chain reaction.CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiling accurately predicts cardiomyopathyetiology, is generalizable to samples from separate institutions, is specific to disease stage, and is unaffected by differences in clinical characteristics. Thisstrongly supports ongoing efforts to incorporate expression profiling-basedbiomarkers in determining prognosis and response to therapy in heart failure.
