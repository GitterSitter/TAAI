Only sST2 concentrations were associated withadverse events (186.7 versus 92.2 ng/mL; P = 0.01). In age-adjusted Coxproportional hazards analysis, an elevated sST2 during the first 48 hoursfollowing ICU admission independently predicted 90-day outcomes (Hazard Ratio =5.53; P = 0.03) superior to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score for thisapplication; in Kaplan-Meier analysis the risk associated with elevated sST2concentrations was present early and sustained through the duration of follow-up (log rank P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing HF therapy guided by invasive monitoring,sST2 concentrations were associated with impending failure to reduce fillingpressures and predicted impending events. Elevated sST2 values early in the ICUcourse theoretically could assist therapeutic decision-making in advanced stageHF patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00595738.PMCID: PMC3580720
