The primary goals of thisanalysis were to describe serial post-MCS changes in estimated glomerularfiltration rate (eGFR) and determine their association with all-cause mortality.METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) with serial creatininelevels available (n=3363) were studied. Early post-MCS, eGFR improvedsubstantially (median improvement, 48.9%; P<0.001) with 22.3% of the populationimproving their eGFR by â‰¥100% within the first few weeks. However, in themajority of patients, this improvement was transient, and by 1 year, eGFR wasonly 6.7% above the pre-MCS value (P<0.001). This pattern of early improvementfollowed by deterioration in eGFR was observed with both pulsatile andcontinuous-flow devices. Interestingly, poor survival was associated with bothmarked improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval[CI], 1.19-2.26; P=0.002) and worsening in eGFR (adjusted HR, 1.63; 95% CI,1.15-2.13; P=0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Post-MCS, early improvement in renal function is common but seems tobe largely transient and not necessarily indicative of an improved prognosis.This pattern was observed with both pulsatile and continuous-flow devices.Additional research is necessary to better understand the mechanistic basis forthese complex post-MCS changes in renal function and their associated survivaldisadvantage.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
