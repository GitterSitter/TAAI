In this prospective study, we attempted to determine whether PS+microparticle levels correlate with clinical outcomes in LVAD-supported patients.METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients undergoing implantation of the HeartMate II LVAD(Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) and 10 healthy controls who provided referencevalues for the microparticle assays. Plasma was collected before LVADimplantation, at discharge, at the 3-month follow-up, and when an adverseclinical event occurred. We quantified PS+ microparticles in the plasma usingflow cytometry.RESULTS: During the study period, 8 patients developed adverse clinical events:ventricular tachycardia storm in 1, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 2, arterial thrombosis in 2, gastrointestinal bleeding in 2, and stroke in 3. Levelsof PS+ microparticles were higher in patients at baseline than in healthycontrols (2.11% ± 1.26% vs 0.69% ± 0.46%, p = 0.007). After LVAD implantation,patient PS+ microparticle levels increased to 2.39% ± 1.22% at discharge and thenleveled to 1.97% ± 1.25% at the 3-month follow-up. Importantly, levels of PS+microparticles were significantly higher in patients who developed an adverseevent than in patients with no events (3.82% ± 1.17% vs 1.57% ± 0.59%, p <0.001), even though the 2 patient groups did not markedly differ in otherclinical and hematologic parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an elevation of PS+ microparticle levelsmay be associated with adverse clinical events. Thus, measuring PS+ microparticlelevels in LVAD-supported patients may help identify patients at increased riskfor adverse events.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
