The postoperative humoral responses to the two treatments have not yetbeen compared. All patients were treated with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) onweaning from cardiopulmonary bypass as they presented with pulmonaryhypertension. We investigated atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriureticpeptide (BNP), cGMP, endothelin (ET)-1, big endothelin (big ET), and hemodynamic parameters after LVAD implantation (15 patients; age 51 +/- 8 years) or HTx (10patients; age 53 +/- 6 years) preoperatively, on cardiopulmonary bypass andpostoperatively up to 72 hrs after cessation of iNO. Preoperatively, cardiacindex (CI), pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP),central venous pressure (CVP), and mean atrial pressure (MAP) were similar forboth groups. Similarly, ANP, BNP, cGMP, ET-1, and big ET were comparable beforesurgery. Seventy-two hours after weaning from iNO, the administered epinephrinedose was higher in the HTx group (P = 0.003); whereas the CVP (P = 0.04) andpulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; P = 0.03) were lower. The following humoralparameters differed markedly: ANP (preoperatively: LVAD, 99 +/- 123 pg/ml; HTx,197 +/- 199 pg/ml; P = 0.14; vs. 72 hrs after iNO: LVAD, 110 +/- 106 pg/ml; HTx, > 640 +/- 0 pg/ml; P = 0.003) and cGMP (preoperatively: LVAD, 4.4 +/- 5.8 pg/ml; HTx, 5.0 +/- 3.0 pg/ml; P = 0.35; vs. 72 hrs after iNO: LVAD, 8.0 +/- 10.8 pg/ml;HTx, 26.2 +/- 15.8 pg/ml; P = 0.02). Although the hemodynamic effects of bothLVAD implantation and HTx in the treatment of end-stage heart failure arecomparable, except for the effects on CVP and PVR, the humoral responses withrespect to ANP and cGMP were strikingly different. These effects are independent of volume status, iNO, and ETs, suggesting a physiologic response to maintaincirculatory homeostasis.
