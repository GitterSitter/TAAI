In the combined BiVAD groups, pre-VAD cardiac index(BiVAD, 1.4 +/- 0.6 L/min per square meter, vs LVAD, 1.6 +/- 0.6 L/min per squaremeter) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (BiVAD, 27 +/- 8 mm Hg, vs LVAD, 30+/- 8 mm Hg) were significantly lower than those in the LVAD group, and pre-VADcreatinine levels were significantly higher (BiVAD, 1.9 +/- 1.1 mg/dl, vs LVAD,1.4 +/- 0.6 mg/dl). In addition, greater proportions of patients in the BiVADgroups required mechanical ventilation before VAD placement (60% vs 35%) and wereimplanted under emergency conditions than in the LVAD group (22% vs 9%). Thesurvival of patients through heart transplantation was significantly better inpatients who had an LVAD (74%) than in those who had BiVADs (58%). However, therewere no significant differences in posttransplantation survival through hospital discharge (LVAD, 89%; BiVAD, 81%).CONCLUSION: Patients who received LVADs were less severely ill before theoperation and consequently were more likely to survive after the operation. Asthe severity of illness increases, patients are more likely to requirebiventricular support.
