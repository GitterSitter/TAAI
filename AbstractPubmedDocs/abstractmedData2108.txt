ASAIO Trans. 1990 Jul-Sep;36(3):M555-8.Nutritional assessment of patients with extended left ventricular assist devicesupport.Vega JD(1), Poindexter SM, Radovancevic B, Burnett CM, Lonquist JL, Birovljev S, Duncan JM, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Texas Heart Institute, Houston77225-0345.The nutritional status of nine patients with end-stage heart disease who weresupported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for more than 30 days while awaiting cardiac transplantation was evaluated. Nutritional status was indicated by the following scale: 0-2, adequate nourishment; 3-5, moderate malnourishment; greater than 5, severe malnourishment. This scale was based on serial assessmentsof albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count, percentage of ideal body weight,midarm circumference, triceps skinfold, and arm muscle circumference. Eachvariable was compared with established standards before implantation and beforetransplantation times and assessed 1 point if less than the normal value and 0points if within the normal range. At the time of LVAD implantation, 5 patientshad a score of 0-2, 3 patients had a score of 3-5, and 1 patient had a scoregreater than 5. At the time of cardiac transplantation, 7 patients had a score of0-2, 2 patients had a score of 3-5, and no patients had a score greater than 5.The patients who were able to meet at least 50% of their daily caloric andprotein requirements by oral intake alone were noted. At LVAD implantation, only 2 patients (22%) met this requirement; however, 6 patients (67%) met thisrequirement at the time of cardiac transplantation. All 9 patients underwentcardiac transplantation, and 8 survived. Thus, it appears that extended LVADsupport and maintenance of hemodynamic stability allow patients to regain thedesire and ability to achieve adequate nutritional status, which may considerablyreduce their perioperative transplant risks.
