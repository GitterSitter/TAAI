Richard.kirk@nuth.nhs.ukBACKGROUND: The course of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failurein children varies; survival with conventional treatment is 64% at 5 years. Hearttransplantation (HTx) enables improved survival; however, outcomes from listingfor transplant are not well described. This study reports survival of patientswith DCM from listing with the availability of mechanical bridge to transplant.METHODS: Patients with a primary diagnosis of DCM (n = 1,098) were identifiedfrom a multi-institutional, prospective, registry of patients aged < 18 yearslisted for HTx from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2006.RESULTS: Characteristics of DCM patients at listing included a mean age of 7.3years; 51% male, 64% white ethnicity, 77% United Network for Organ Sharing statusI, 66% on inotropic support, 28% mechanically ventilated, and 15% on mechanicalsupport. Waitlist mortality was 11%, and 75% underwent HTx at 2 years afterlisting. Overall 10-year survival after listing was 72%, with higher risk ofdeath associated with arrhythmias, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, but not ventricular assist device (VAD)support. Survival at 10 years post-HTx was 72%, with a higher risk of deathassociated with black race, older age, mechanical ventilation, longer ischemictime, and earlier era of transplant.CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation for DCM in the pediatric population offers enhanced survival compared with the natural history. Overall waitlist mortality for DCM islow, with the exception of patients on ECMO, mechanically ventilated, or witharrhythmias. DCM patients fared well after transplant, making HTx a keytherapeutic intervention.PMCID: PMC4296522
