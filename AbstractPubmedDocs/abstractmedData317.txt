The LVADunloads the failing heart and modifies the myocardial structure, with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The regression of hypertrophy has been reported histomorphologically in paired samples of myocardial tissues obtained from thesame patient at the time of LVAD implantation and the heart excised attransplant. The understanding of the mechanisms of recovery may contribute tostrategic development for LVAD weaning and the use of LVAD as a destinationtherapy.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
