Epub 2009 Aug 11.Temporary cardiac support with a mini-circuit system consisting of a centrifugal pump and a membrane ventilator.Meyer AL(1), Strueber M, Tomaszek S, Goerler A, Simon AR, Haverich A, Fischer S.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplantation and Vascular Surgery, HannoverMedical School, Hannover, Germany.Commonly used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) systems for cardiacsupport are limited by bleeding complications, especially after surgery in theadult patient. Recently, we have switched from the use of a conventional ECMOsystem to a miniature-circuit including a centrifugal pump and the Novalungmembrane ventilator (iLA). This system allows us to administer less heparincompared to the conventional system. Between January and August 2007, 1469patients underwent cardiac surgery at our center, of which 18 patients (1.2%)required temporary postoperative ECMO system support. Surgical procedures inthese patients included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery (n=5),valvular replacement (n=2), aortic surgery (n=2), cardiac transplantation (n=5), and other procedures (n=3). The mean age of the 18 patients was 50+/-15 years(n=13 male) with a mean duration of ECMO system support of 4.3 days (range: <1 to14 days). Twelve patients (67%) were successfully weaned from ECMO system. The30-day survival was 44% with a hospital mortality of 61%. Re-thoracotomy forbleeding was necessary in six patients (33%) under ECMO system support. Insummary, the miniature ECMO system circuit seems to be suitable for middle-termcardiac support and is associated with a low rate of bleeding complications.
