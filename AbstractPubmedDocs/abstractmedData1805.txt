Prog Cardiovasc Dis. 2000 Jul-Aug;43(1):1-4.History of mechanical circulatory support.Helman DN(1), Rose EA.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.End-stage heart failure exerts a tremendous impact on individuals and society in terms of personal and economic suffering. The development of mechanicalcirculatory support devices has been driven by the shortage of donor organs forheart transplantation. Collaborative efforts in the fields of surgery, medicine, and biomedical engineering, sponsored by both government and industry, have ledto devices capable of providing reliable circulatory support. Future mechanicalcardiac assist devices will likely play an important role in the treatment of an ever-growing population of patients with end-stage heart failure.
