DeBakey Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas77030-2707, USA.Ventricular support in patients with end-stage heart failure can be achievedusing intracorporeal left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or percutaneousventricular assist device (pVAD) systems. Multiple efforts have been made tominimize procedure-associated complications. We present a case report of anoff-pump insertion of a MicroMed DeBakey VAD after Tandem Heart support using aprevious sternotomy incision. A 47-year-old woman with end-stage heart failureafter coronary artery bypass graft revascularization was admitted forpharmacologic treatment. She developed multi-organ failure and a severecoagulopathy with thromboembolic complications. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was suspected. A percutaneous Tandem Heart was placed, the patient'scondition stabilized, and finally a MicroMed DeBakey Child VAD was implantedoff-pump, re-opening a previous sternotomy incision. To avoid the need forheparinization in the light of HIT and severe coagulopathy, the LVAD implantationwas performed under Tandem Heart support without cardiopulmonary bypass. Thepatient has been anti-coagulated with angiomax ever since. Critically illpatients with end-stage heart disease, multi-organ failure, severe coagulopathyand a previous median sternotomy can be bridged from a Tandem Heart to MicroMedDeBakey VAD without cardiopulmonary bypass using the previous incision, provided there are few adhesions and stable hemodynamic conditions.
