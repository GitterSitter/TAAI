De Gasperis Cardiac Surgery and 2nd Cardiology Division, A. De GasperisDepartment of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Medicine, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy.Chronic heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death in developed countries.Over the last 2 decades, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices havesteadily evolved in the clinical management of end-stage HF and have emerged as astandard of care for the treatment of acute and chronic HF refractory toconventional medical therapy. Possible indications for using MCS are acutecardiogenic shock, as a bridge to transplantation, as a bridge to recovery, andmore recently, as destination therapy in dilated cardiomyopathy, of eitherischemic or idiopathic etiology. We reviewed the different clinical scenarios in which we think there are currently indications to implant different kinds of MCS systems.
