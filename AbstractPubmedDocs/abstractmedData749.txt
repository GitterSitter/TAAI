We used United Network for Organ Sharing data to examine panelreactive antibody titers in patients bridged to transplant with left ventricular assist devices.METHODS: This was a retrospective review of the United Network for Organ Sharing dataset for all patients bridged to orthotopic heart transplantation with aHeartMate II or HeartMate XVE (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif) from January2004 to December 2009. Patients were primarily stratified by device type andsecondarily grouped for comparisons by high (>25%) versus low (0%) panel reactiveantibody activity (class I and II). Outcomes included survival (30-day and1-year), treated rejection in the year after orthotopic heart transplantation,and primary graft dysfunction. Cox proportional hazards regression examined30-day and 1-year survival.RESULTS: A total of 871 patients (56.1%) received the HeartMate II device, and673 patients (43.9%) received the HeartMate XVE device. Patients with high panel reactive antibody had longer duration on the wait list (205 days [interquartilerange, 81-344] vs 124 days [interquartile range, 51-270], P = .01). High panelreactive antibody class II was more common in patients with the HeartMate XVEdevice (51/547 [9.3%] vs 42/777 [5.4%], P < .001). When the entire cohort wasexamined together, there was no 30-day or 1-year survival difference based onpanel reactive antibody activity. Device type did not affect post-orthotopicheart transplantation survival, and panel reactive antibody activity was notassociated with worse mortality in Cox regression. Although panel reactiveantibody activity did not affect rejection in the year after orthotopic hearttransplantation for either device type, high panel reactive antibody class II wasassociated with higher rates of primary graft dysfunction for both devices (P <.05).CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest modern study to examine the impact of detailedpanel reactive antibody information in patients bridged to transplant. High panelreactive antibody levels do not affect drug-treated rejection episodes in thefirst year post-orthotopic heart transplantation; however, there is an associatedhigher rate of primary graft dysfunction, regardless of device type. Highlysensitized patients bridged to transplant experience excellent survival outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation.Copyright Â© 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
