Therefore, we analyzed the predictive value of plasma Gal-3in the context of other potential clinical risk factors for death on device (DOD)in a cohort of 175 VAD patients.METHODS: We analyzed numerous clinical factors and plasma Gal-3 levels of 175 VADpatients before device implantation. Eighty VAD patients were successfullybridged to HTx (BTT, 45.7%), 80 (45.7%) died on VAD, 2 recovered on device (BTR, 1.1%) and 13 (7.4%) were still on device. Uni- and multivariate analyses wereperformed to assess the importance of Gal-3 with respect to other clinicalfactors. Myocardial gene expression of Gal-3 was investigated in apex samples by RT-PCR (n = 30) and Western blotting (n = 45).RESULTS: Plasma Gal-3 levels were higher in VAD patients than in controls (16.6 ±9.3 vs 9.5 ± 3.9 ng/ml, p < 0.0001). Cox regression showed several clinicalfactors and type of VAD as independent outcome predictors, but Gal-3 was notamong them. Using the regression equation we grouped patients according to their factor constellation for prediction of survival on VAD. We propose a calculation method for VAD survival prediction. Gal-3 mRNA and protein were detectable infailing myocardium, but did not correlate with its plasma concentration.CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 levels are associated with severe heart failure but donot provide sufficient discrimination for prediction of outcomes after VADimplantation. Importantly, we were unable to confirm myocardial tissue as aprimary source for the observed plasma elevations of Gal-3.Copyright © 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
