Curr Opin Cardiol. 1999 May;14(3):234-48.Ventricular assistance for recovery of cardiac failure.Loebe M(1), MÃ¼ller J, Hetzer R.Author information: (1)Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Germany. loebe@dhzb.deMechanical assist devices have been used increasingly to support patients whoawait heart transplantation. The initial goal was to provide sufficientcirculatory function to keep these patients alive and to allow them to recoverfrom secondary organ dysfunction. A recent observation showed an improvement innative heart performance in some transplant candidates who receive support withmechanical assist devices. Under these conditions, myocardial recovery has beenmostly restricted to patients with primary dilated cardiomyopathy and withextended periods of ventricular support. Also, the exact mechanisms that lead to substantial myocardial recovery remain unknown. Several investigations havedemonstrated improved myocyte performance, reduced fibrosis, reduced cytokinelevels, and reduced autoantibodies during long-term mechanical support;therefore, the observation of cardiac recovery during mechanical support is inaccordance with currently discussed models of end-stage heart failure.
