The optimal duration of device support before heart transplantation is debated. We report theeffect of left ventricular device support duration on survival after hearttransplantation.METHODS: All patients bridged to heart transplantation with theThermoCardiosystems Heartmate 1,000 IP left ventricular assist device betweenJanuary 1, 1986, and October 15, 1994, were included in our study. Parametersstudied included duration of support, measures of end-organ function, andcomplications while supported with the device. Patients supported < 30 days were compared with patients supported > 30 days before undergoing transplantation.RESULTS: Patients supported for < 30 days had a threefold increased perioperativemortality compared with patients supported > 30 days (p = 0.031). Laboratoryvalues of end-organ function were similar before left ventricular deviceinsertion in both groups, although at the time of transplantation patientssupported < 30 days had a significantly elevated bilirubin level compared withpatients supported > 30 days (p < 0.001). Patients supported > 30 days hadsignificantly more infections than the < 30 days group (p = 0.0345).CONCLUSIONS: Patients supported for > 30 days with left ventricular assistdevices have improved post-transplant perioperative survival because ofnormalization of end-organ function and improved physiologic status secondary to aggressive physical rehabilitation. Patients should be supported for > 30 days incombination with physical rehabilitation, to improve early survival after hearttransplantation.
