Prog Cardiovasc Nurs. 1989 Jan-Mar;4(1):1-9.Nursing care of a patient requiring prolonged mechanical circulatory support.Reedy JE, Ruzevich SA, Swartz MT, Termuhlen DF, Pennington DG.Four cardiac transplant candidates were supported with ventricular assist devicesfor periods ranging from 53 to 90 days (mean, 75 days). The patients were men whoranged in age from 36 to 49 years (mean, 44.5 years). Two patients hadPierce-Donachy biventricular assist devices (BVADs) and two patients had Novacor left ventricular assist systems (LVASs). Complications included infection (3patients), development of antibodies (2 patients), bleeding (2 patients), andpump inflow obstruction (1 patient). All patients were maintained on ananticoagulation regimen which included warfarin and dipyridamole. They wereextubated and ambulatory for most of the period of mechanical support.Thromboembolic complications did not develop in any of these patients, and theydid not acquire infections which involved the mediastinum. They were successfullytransplanted and discharged 11 to 25 days after transplantation. Although majorcomplications were common in this small group of patients, all four patientsachieved hemodynamic stability and became excellent candidates for cardiactransplantation. With proper patient selection and meticulous nursing care,current mechanical circulatory support technology is capable of maintainingpatients consistently for periods of greater than 50 days.
