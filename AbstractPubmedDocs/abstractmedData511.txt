The question addressed was: is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) superior to dedicated ventricular assist device (VAD) in patients withacutely failing allograft following transplantation. Altogether, 162 papers were found using the reported search, of which 8 represented the best evidence toanswer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country ofpublication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Two studies provide data only for ECMO-treatedpatients, in three, the authors describe their experiences with LevitronixCentriMag and three studies directly compare the outcomes of ECMO and VADsupport. The survival ranges from 40 to 74% in patients rescued with ECMOcompared with 33-60% in patients supported with dedicated VAD. We conclude thatthere is insufficient evidence to prefer ECMO over VAD and the optimal modalityof mechanical circulatory support (MCS) following heart transplantation should bedetermined by the surgeon and institutional experience and dependent on theextent and severity of myocardial dysfunction and the presence or absence ofassociated respiratory insufficiency.PMCID: PMC3598045
