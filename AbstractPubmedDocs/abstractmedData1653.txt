ASAIO J. 2003 Jan-Feb;49(1):136-8.First use of the Cancion cardiac recovery system in a human.Wasler A(1), Radovancevic B, Fruhwald F, Tripolt M, Klein W, Tscheliessnigg K.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Graz,Auenbruggerplatz 29, A-8036 Graz, Austria.Animal studies have shown clearly that a peripheral circulatory support systemcan effectively unload the left ventricle. We report here the first implantation of one such system (Cancion, Orqis Medical, Lake Forest, CA) in a human. TheCancion system consists of a centrifugal pump connected to the circulation via a graft cannula anastomosed to the left axillary artery and a percutaneous cannula placed into the left common femoral artery. Flow is initiated from the femoral tothe axillary artery. The system was implanted in a 62-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy suffering from decompensation whose condition had not improvedwith catecholamine therapy. The Cancion system supported the patient for 3 days, after which it was electively explanted. During the support period, pulmonarycapillary wedge pressure dramatically decreased from 28 to 9 mm Hg, leftventricular diastolic dimension decreased from 6.78 to 6.16 cm, creatinine levelsdecreased from 1.9 to 0.9 mg/dl, cardiac index improved from 1.5 to 2.7 L/min,and ejection fraction improved from 25 to 35%. Together, our data indicate thatthe Cancion system quickly and effectively improved the patient's hemodynamics.This suggests that the device may one day become a short-term alternative to highdose inotrope therapy and that its application may delay the need for moreinvasive forms of mechanical circulatory support.
