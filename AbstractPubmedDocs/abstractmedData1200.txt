Epidemiologic studies havedemonstrated an increased risk of heart failure in diabetics. Experimental andclinical studies support the existence of a specific diabetic cardiomyopathyrelated to microangiopathy, metabolic factors or myocardial fibrosis. Theknowledge of the diabetes status may help to define the optimal therapeuticstrategy for heart failure patients. In ischemic cardiomyopathy the choice of thesurgical treatment may differ according to diabetes status, coronaryatherosclerosis and left ventricular function. At present, surgicalrevascularization techniques seem to be superior to interventionalrevascularization procedures. In the last decade a growing part of diabeticspresenting severe heart failure underwent heart transplantation. Thereby, it was found that the survival rates of patients with uncomplicated diabetes mellitusand of nondiabetics did not differ. The survival rates in patients with severeand progressive form of diabetes mellitus are discussed controversially in theliterature. Because of donor organ shortage each diabetic patient presentingsevere heart failure should be evaluated to find the best therapy includingpermanent mechanical circulatory support ("destination therapy").
