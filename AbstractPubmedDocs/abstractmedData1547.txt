Additionally, alimited number of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy have undergonesuccessful device explantation after their myocardial function improved duringventricular assist system support. The authors present their experience with fourpatients who had acute, severe heart failure without coronary artery disease orbiopsy-proven myocarditis. After receiving prolonged ventricular assist systemsupport, all four patients had significantly improved left ventricular function, returning to New York Heart Association functional class I without inotropictherapy. In each case, dobutamine stress echocardiography and invasivehemodynamic tests were performed to confirm improvement of cardiac functionbefore device explantation was undertaken. In all four cases, device explantationwas followed by early successful maintenance of left ventricular function. These cases reveal a unique clinical syndrome that may be successfully treated withearly institution of ventricular assist system support followed by explantationafter myocardial recovery.
