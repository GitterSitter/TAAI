Previous work hasfocused on the Thoratec Heartmate VE device, use of which is associated withpre-formed antibody production. We reviewed our cumulative experience with theWorldheart Novacor VAD as a bridge to transplantation (BTT).METHODS: From January 1989 through October 2002, 39 patients required a VADbridge, with 26 of 39 surviving to transplantation. Antibody levels were assessedby complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay at routine intervals and expressed as panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels. Post-transplant allograft rejection,coronary vasculopathy, and survival were compared between Novacor-supportedpatients and non-VAD transplant recipients.RESULTS: PRA values did not significantly change after VAD implantation (12.4%+/- 11.2% vs 14.8% +/- 12.3%, p = 0.28). Survival for the BTT patients was 80.4%,75.7%, 64.0%, 64.0%, and 64.0%, respectively, for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 yearspost-transplant, with similar results for non-BTT patients. The freedom fromcoronary vasculopathy was 90.2%, 90.2%, 72.2%, and 72.2%, respectively, at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years post-transplant.CONCLUSIONS: First, to our knowledge, this study is the first to examine theincidence of allosensitization after Novacor implant in detail. In contrast with previous results of work with other VAD systems, as assessed by PRA levels,Novacor patients did not become sensitized. Second, compared with 220 non-BTTpatients who received transplants during a similar time frame, Novacor BTTpatients had equivalent rejection profiles and survival. Finally, the incidenceof transplant-associated coronary artery disease was lower than in previousreports.
