J Heart Lung Transplant. 1994 Sep-Oct;13(5):803-10.Eleven years' experience with the Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device.Pennington DG(1), McBride LR, Miller LW, Swartz MT.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, St. Louis University Health Sciences Center, MO 63110.During the last decade, mechanical circulatory support has been used in patients with cardiogenic shock refractory to conventional therapy. Since 1982, wesupported 77 patients (78 implants) with Pierce-Donachy external pneumaticventricular assist devices. Forty-two patients (35 after cardiotomy, four afterheart transplantation, and three with acute infarction) 15 to 71 years of age(mean age 52 years) were supported for cardiac recovery. Left ventricular assist devices were used in 16 patients, right ventricular assist devices plusintraaortic balloon were used in nine, and biventricular assist devices were usedin 17. Patients were supported 0.2 to 17 days (mean 4.4 days), 18 patients (43%) were weaned, and 11 (26%) survived. Complications included acute myocardialinfarction (60%), bleeding (48%), infection (38%), and renal failure (24%).Bridging to transplantation was attempted in 35 patients (one patient underwentthe procedure twice), 12 to 63 years of age (mean age 40 years). Left ventricularassist devices were used 19 times, and biventricular assist devices were used 17 times. Duration of support was 0.2 to 95 days (mean 24 days). All 20 patients whounderwent transplantation were discharged. Of the 15 patients who did not undergotransplantation, two were weaned and survived, whereas the remaining 13 patients (who did not undergo transplantation because of complications) died with thedevice in place. In the patients in the bridge to transplantation group, bleedingoccurred in 26%, infection in 55%, and renal failure in 15%. In the entire group of 77 patients, the incidence of ventricular assist device-relatedthromboembolism was 6%, but only 4% had neurologic deficits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATEDAT 250 WORDS)
