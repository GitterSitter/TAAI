Reduced pulsatilityhas been implicated as a contributing cause. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different degrees of pulsatility on the incidence of nonsurgicalbleeding.METHODS AND RESULTS: The Utah Transplantation Affiliated Hospitals (U.T.A.H.)heart failure and transplant program databases were queried for patients withend-stage heart failure who required support with the continuous-flow LVADHeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) between 2004 and 2012. Pulsatilitywas evaluated by means of the LVAD parameter pulsatility index (PI) and by theechocardiographic assessment of aortic valve opening during the first 3 months ofLVAD support. PI was analyzed as a continuous variable and also stratifiedaccording to tertiles of all the PI measurements during the study period (low PI:<4.6, intermediate PI: 4.6-5.2, and high PI: >5.2). Major nonsurgical bleedingassociated with a decrease in hemoglobin â‰¥2 g/dL (in the absence of hemolysis)was the primary end point. A total of 134 patients (median age of 60[interquartile range: 49-68] years, 78% men) were included. Major bleedingoccurred in 33 (25%) patients (70% gastrointestinal, 21% epistaxis, 3%genitourinary, and 6% intracranial). In multivariable analysis, PI examinedeither as a categorical variable, low versus high PI (hazard ratio, 4.06; 95%confidence interval, 1.35-12.21; P=0.04), or as a continuous variable (hazardratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.92; P=0.02) was associated with anincreased risk of bleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Reduced pulsatility in patients supported with the continuous-flowLVAD HeartMate II is associated with an increased risk of nonsurgical bleeding,as evaluated by PI.
