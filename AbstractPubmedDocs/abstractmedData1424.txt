ASAIO J. 2005 Sep-Oct;51(5):501-3.Thoratec ventricular assist devices in pediatric patients: update on clinicalresults.Reinhartz O(1), Hill JD, Al-Khaldi A, Pelletier MP, Robbins RC, Farrar DJ.Author information: (1)Stanford University, Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, CA 94605, USA.Particularly in pediatric patients, mechanical circulatory support remains aclinical challenge. We analyzed the Stanford experience with use of the Thoratec ventricular assist device (VAD) in children and adolescents and data from thecompany's voluntary database. Through January 2005, 209 patients up to 18 yearsof age have been supported with the Thoratec VAD worldwide. Mean age was 14.5years (range 5-18 years), mean weight was 57 kg (range 17-118 kg), and mean body surface area was 1.6 m2 (range 0.7-2.3 m2). The majority of patients weresupported for cardiomyopathies (55%) and acute myocarditis (25%). A minority (6%)was treated for end-stage congenital heart disease. Average duration of supportwas 44 days (0-434 days). Overall survival to transplantation or weaning off the device was 68%. Survival rates were higher for patients with cardiomyopathies(74%) and acute myocarditis (86%) compared with patients with congenital heartdisease (27%). We performed a subanalysis in small children with a body surfacearea of less 1.3 m2. This subgroup had a higher incidence of congenital heartdisease and a slightly lower survival (52%). Aspects of the particular risks and device management in these small patients are discussed.
