Exercise capacity, age, gender,and HF aetiology were balanced between HFDM- and HFDM+ groups. Subjects underwentmaximal bicycle spiroergometry with blood sampling to measure metabolites andneurohormones before and immediately after the exercise. HFDM+ patients hadincreased free fatty acids, glucose, and β-hydroxybutyrate compared withcontrols. HFDM+ patients had higher baseline copeptin (24 ± 16 vs. 17 ± 13pmol/L, P < 0.05) but otherwise showed similar neurohumoral activation andexercise response to HFDM- patients. Peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)) wasunrelated to post-exercise free fatty acids, glucose, lactate, or glycerol, butstrongly correlated with post-exercise pyruvate (in all: r = 0.62, P < 0.001).During the next 17 ± 10 months, 36% of HF patients experienced an adverse event(death, urgent transplantation, or assist device insertion). From metabolicfactors, only post-exercise glucose [hazard ratio (HR) 1.28, P = 0.04), totalbody fat (HR 0.58, P < 0.001), and the presence of DM (HR 1.98, P = 0.04) werepredictive of the outcome.CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of pyruvate, acute changes of metabolicsubstrates are not related to cardiac performance in HF, regardless of diabeticstatus. Inhibition of body fat depletion, attenuation of stress-relatedhyperglycaemia, or increasing dynamics of plasma pyruvate may representtherapeutic targets in advanced HF.
