However, the rate ofimplantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks and the effect of theseshocks on outcomes in patients with LVADs remain unknown.METHODS: Medical records were reviewed from patients with both an ICD and a LVAD from September 2000 to February 2009. The association between ICD shocks andsurvival while receiving device support was assessed using Cox proportionalhazards modeling.RESULTS: Thirty-three of 61 patients with a LVAD also had an ICD and form thebasis of this report. The mean duration of LVAD support was 238 days. One or moreICD shocks were delivered to 14 patients (42%) with 8 (24%) receiving appropriateshocks for ventricular arrhythmias and 6 (18%) receiving inappropriate shocks. Nopatients received both appropriate and inappropriate shocks. When compared withreceiving no ICD shock, receiving any ICD shock or an appropriate ICD shock were both associated with an increase in the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 4.5, 95%confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 17.3, p = 0.027, and HR 5.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 22.6, p = 0.023, respectively); receipt of an inappropriate shock showed anon-significant trend for an increased risk of death (HR 3.2, 95% CI 0.7 to 16.1,p = 0.151).CONCLUSIONS: ICD shocks are common after implantation of LVADs, with nearly equalnumbers of appropriate and inappropriate shocks. ICD shocks are associated withhigher mortality. Larger studies are needed for assessing the independentrelationship of ICDs to a variety of clinical outcomes in patients with LVADs.
