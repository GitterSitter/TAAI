We studied the prognosis of HTx candidates after failed donor heart allocation in urgent status. We studied all adult and pediatric (<18 years) HTx candidates who underwent primary HTx after Eurotransplant urgencylisting between January 2001 and December 2006 (Group A-uHTx [A-"u"rgent status"HTx"], n = 99; Group P-uHTx [P-"u"rgent status "HTx"], n = 24) and those to whomdonor heart was not urgently allocated before VAD implantation or death in thesame period (Group A-fHA [A-"f"ailed "H"eart "A"llocation], n = 21, Group P-fHA[P-"f"ailed "H"eart "A"llocation], n = 10). Mortality rate after urgency listing or primary VAD implantation was studied in each group. In adult patients, 1-year mortality rate after urgency listing in Group A-fHA was 56.8% and significantlyhigher than in Group A-uHTx (30.6%, P < 0.001, log-rank test). After failedurgent heart allocation, 15 out of 21 patients in Group A-fHA had VADimplantation and two patients (9.5%) underwent HTx after VAD implantation. Inpediatric patients, 1-year mortality rate in Group P-fHA was 40.0% andsignificantly higher than in Group P-uHTx (8.5%, P < 0.05). In Group P-fHA, all10 patients underwent VAD implantation after failed urgent heart allocation andsix patients (60.0%, P < 0.01 vs. Group A-fHA, Fisher's exact test) underwent HTxafter VAD implantation. After failed urgent donor heart allocation, pediatric HTxcandidates seem to profit more from mechanical circulatory support than adults.
