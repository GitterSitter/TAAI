This trial explores the safety and efficacy of this strategy.METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, double-blind, sham-procedure controlledtrial, 30 patients were randomized (2:1) to intramyocardial injection of 25million MPCs or medium during LVAD implantation. The primary safety end point wasincidence of infectious myocarditis, myocardial rupture, neoplasm,hypersensitivity reaction, and immune sensitization (90 days afterrandomization). Key efficacy end points were functional status and ventricularfunction while temporarily weaned from LVAD support (90 days afterrandomization). Patients were followed up until transplant or 12 months afterrandomization, whichever came first. Mean age was 57.4 (±13.6) years, mean leftventricular ejection fraction was 18.1%, and 66.7% were destination therapyLVADs. No safety events were observed. Successful temporary LVAD weaning wasachieved in 50% of MPC and 20% of control patients at 90 days (P=0.24); theposterior probability that MPCs increased the likelihood of successful weaningwas 93%. At 90 days, 3 deaths (30%) occurred in control patients, and noneoccurred in MPC patients. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction aftersuccessful wean was 24.0% (MPC=10) and 22.5% (control=2; P=0.56). At 12 months,30% of MPC patients and 40% of control patients were successfully temporarilyweaned from LVAD support (P=0.69), and 6 deaths (30%) occurred in MPC patients.Donor-specific HLA sensitization developed in 2 MPC and 3 control patients andresolved by 12 months.CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary trial, administration of MPCs appeared to besafe, and there was a potential signal of efficacy. Future studies will evaluate the potential for higher or additional doses to enhance the ability to wean LVAD recipients off support.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
