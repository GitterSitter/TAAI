Long-term follow-up included all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, and implantation of a left ventricular assist device.Longitudinal data analysis of left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVi)was performed to adjust for the confounding effect of patient loss duringfollow-up.RESULTS: Patients with uneventful survival had a lower baseline LVESVi (Delta =8.6 ml/m(2), SE = 4.6 ml/m(2), p < 0.0001) and a decreased LVESVi by -0.11ml/m(2)/day during first 6 months, whereas the LVESVi remained unchanged inpatients with adverse events (p < 0.0001). Beyond 6 months, the LVESVi remainedunchanged in patients with uneventful survival, whereas the LVESVi continued toincrease in those with adverse events at a rate of 0.01 ml/m(2)/day (p < 0.0001).Predictors of reverse remodeling were nonischemic etiology, female sex, and awider QRS duration (p < 0.0001, p = 0.014, and p = 0.001, respectively). In themajority of patients, 6 months indicates a break point after which reverseremodeling becomes significantly less pronounced.CONCLUSIONS: CRT patients with uneventful survival show a significant decrease inthe LVSVi at 6 months and generally maintain this response in the long term.Those with adverse outcomes are characterized by left ventricular dilationdespite CRT.Copyright (c) 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
