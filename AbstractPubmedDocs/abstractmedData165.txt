We present data comparing results afterimplantation of HeartMate II (HM II) versus HVAD (HW) left ventricular assistdevices (LVADs) for the past 7 years at our institution.METHODS: From July 2006 to August 2012, 121 consecutive patients underwent LVADimplantation: 70 (57.9%) received HM II and 51 (42.1%) HW. Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and laboratory parameters as well as postoperativeoutcome were compared retrospectively.RESULTS: Patients in the HM II group were significantly younger (P < .01), withmore deranged liver function (higher bilirubin [P = .02] and alanineaminotransferase [P = .01] levels), and had a significantly higher rate ofpreoperative infections requiring antibiotic treatment (P = .02) and a higherbody core temperature (P < .01). Other demographic and preoperative parametersdid not show statistical differences. Most postoperative characteristics werealso similar between the two groups. HM II patients had a significantly highertransfusion rate, but there were no differences in incidence of resternotomy (P =.156). Recovery and VAD explantation were more likely in the HM II group (P =.02). Although there was no significant difference in survival (log rank test: P = .986; Breslow test: P = .827), HM II patients were more likely to develop apercutaneous site infection (P = .01).CONCLUSIONS: Both HM II and HW provide similar early postoperative outcome andgood long-term survival. The differences observed between the groups may berelated to demographic and preoperative factors rather than the type of thedevice used.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
