D.Mihaylov@med.rug.nlCongestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a major health problem with a high mortalityrate. Its ultimate therapy, heart transplantation, is limited by the shortage of donor hearts. Since decades researchers have been working to solve this problemby developing Mechanical Circulatory Support Systems (MCSS) that can replace orassist the failing heart. Short-term and intermediate-term ventricular assistdevices are used nowadays frequently to bridge patients with severe heart failureto recovery. Long-term ventricular assist devices (VADs) and Total ArtificialHearts (TAHs) are used increasingly as a bridge to heart transplantations or aspermanent circulatory support in patients with end-stage heart failure that arecontraindicated for heart transplantation. The early TAHs and VADs were mainlydriven from an external pneumatic drive unit. The latest generation TAHs andlong-term assist devices are electrically powered, ultracompact, totallyimplantable, and have small wearable drive/control consoles, allowing patients toreturn to their daily activities. The article categorizes and reviews thedevelopment of MCSS, highlights the medical indications and contraindications of pump implantation, advantages and disadvantages of the various systems, andresults of animal and clinical studies.
