J Heart Lung Transplant. 2005 Sep;24(9):1195-201.Biventricular assist device-induced right ventricular reverse structural andfunctional remodeling.Klotz S(1), Naka Y, Oz MC, Burkhoff D.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, ColumbiaUniversity, New York, NY 10032, USA.BACKGROUND: Support with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) induces LVreverse structural and functional remodeling, evidenced by normalization ofpassive end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships (EDPVRs) and cardiomyocytefunction. These changes are not evident in the right ventricle (RV), whichremains dilated during LVAD support. However, studies on whether RV reverseremodeling could be induced by RV or biventricular assist support (BiVAD) havenot been published.METHODS: Whole hearts from 16 patients with end-stage congestive heart failure(CHF) at the time of cardiac transplantation without LVAD support, 16 patientswith LVAD support, and 3 patients with BiVAD support were used to study RVEDPVRs, with estimation of chamber stiffness. Perfused isolated myocardialtrabeculae were used for functional studies. Furthermore, RV free wall sampleswere used for histology and collagen determination by hydroxyproline.RESULTS: The RV size, calculated from the ex vivo RV EDPVRs, RV mass, and myocytediameter were significantly smaller in BiVAD-supported hearts than innon-supported or LVAD-supported hearts (p < 0.05) and reached normal levels.Furthermore, cardiomyocyte function demonstrated a normalized response toincreased stimulation frequency and after perfusion with isoproterenol following BiVAD support. In addition, myocardial collagen content and chamber stiffnessincreased tremendously after BiVAD support (p < 0.05 vs CHF and LVAD).CONCLUSION: BiVAD-induced hemodynamic unloading support resulted in significantreverse structural and functional remodeling of the right chamber. The lack ofthese findings during LVAD support alone provides additional support thatdiastolic pressure and volume unloading is an important mechanism underlying the process of reverse remodeling.
