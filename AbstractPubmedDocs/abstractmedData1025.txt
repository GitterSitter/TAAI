Indications for insertion included bridge to decision(BTD) or "salvage" and bridge to transplant (BTT).RESULTS: Between April 2005 and December 2008, 22 percTH devices weresuccessfully implanted in patients (13 men) with isolated left heart failure.Mean duration of support was 6.8 +/- 9.4 days (median, 4; maximum, 45 days). Ofpatients requiring percTH support for at least 3 days, mean pump flows were 3.77 +/- 1.10, 4.22 +/- 0.69, and 4.04 +/- 0.41 L/min on at days 1, 2, and 3. Meanserum aspartate aminotransferase levels were 455 +/- 994 mg/dL before percTH, 551+/- 1046 mg/dL at day 1, and 231 +/- 225 mg/dL at day 3 after percTH. Nomechanical device failure, device-related infections, or cerebrovascularaccidents occurred. Ten of 11 BTT patients were successfully bridged. Support waswithdrawn in 7 of 11 BTD patients. The percTHs were successfully explanted in 4BTD patients: 1 as recovery, 1 direct to transplant, and 2 to VAD.CONCLUSIONS: The percTH was reliable, with no mechanical device failures andminimal associated adverse events. We support the use of the percTH in the BTDmode, allowing time for a more complete evaluation of neurologic and end-organstatus without the added expense and morbidity of a long-term VAD.
