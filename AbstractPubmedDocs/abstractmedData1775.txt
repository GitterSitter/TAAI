When pharmacologic treatment is insufficient, mechanical circulatory assistancehas been used to support the failing right ventricle. Considering right and left ventricular interdependence, we investigated whether intraaortic ballooncounterpulsation (IABP) might also alleviate predominantly right ventriculardysfunction after heart transplantation.METHODS: Among 278 cardiac recipients, 12 adult patients underwent mechanicalcirculatory support for cardiac allograft dysfunction. Five patients were treatedwith percutaneous IABP for early postoperative low cardiac output syndromecharacterized by predominantly right ventricular failure. Clinical data andhemodynamic variables were recorded before and during IABP treatment.RESULTS: Cardiac index (CI) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased (CI 1.7+/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.2, MAP 53 +/- 12 to 71 +/- 7, p < 0.05) within 1 hour after IABP, whereas central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure(PAWP) decreased (CVP 21.6 +/- 1.7 to 13.8 +/- 3.1, p < .05; PAWP 14.8 +/- 4.9 to12.4 +/- 3.7, nonsignificant). Within the next 12 hours, CI and mixed venousoxygen saturation increased (p < 0.05) and pulmonary artery pressure decreased (p< 0.05). All 5 patients were weaned successfully and 4 are long-term survivorswith adequate cardiac performance at 1 year follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Intraaortic balloon pumping is a minimally invasive circulatoryassist device with proved efficiency in low cardiac output syndromes. This reportshows that low output syndrome caused by predominantly right ventricularallograft failure may be an additional indication for IABP.
