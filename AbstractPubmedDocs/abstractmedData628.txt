Epub 2012 May 10.The ABCs of left ventricular assist device echocardiography: a systematicapproach.Ammar KA(1), Umland MM, Kramer C, Sulemanjee N, Jan MF, Khandheria BK, Seward JB,Paterick TE.Author information: (1)Aurora Cardiovascular Services, Aurora Sinai/Aurora St. Luke's MedicalCenters, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 2801 W.Kinnickinnic River Parkway, #845, Milwaukee, WI 53215, USA.Echocardiography is an important imaging modality used to determine theindication of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation for patientswith advanced heart failure (HF) and for serial follow-up to make managementdecisions in patient care post-implant. Continuous axial-flow LVAD therapyprovides effective haemodynamic support for the failing left ventricle, improvingboth the clinical functional status and quality of life. Echocardiographers must develop a systematic approach to echocardiographic assessment of LVADimplantation and post-LVAD implant cardiac morphology and physiology. Thisapproach must include the evaluation of left and right heart chamber morphologyand physiology and the anatomy and physiology of the inflow and outflow cannulas and the rotor pump, and the determination of the degree of tricuspidregurgitation and the presence of interatrial shunts and aortic regurgitation.Collaboration among the echocardiography and HF/transplant teams is essential to obtain this comprehensive evaluation. We outline a systematic approach toevaluating patients with HF who have failed conventional therapy and require LVADtherapy as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or destination therapy.
