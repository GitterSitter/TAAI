Herein, we describe ourexperience with HTx in the presence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)together with the Thoratec VAD (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, California). From May 1996 to June 2009, mechanical circulatory support with the Thoratec VAD wasprovided in 20 patients. Before implantation of the VAD, circulation in 17patients was maintained using ECMO. Although 350 patients underwent HTx duringthat period, only 13 patients (65%) received suitable donor organs for orthotopicHTx. The 20 patients ranged in age from 10 to 80 years; 3 were female, and 17were male; and 17 (85%) required ECMO before VAD implantation. In 11 of 17patients (65%), the VAD was implanted as a double bridge to HTx. The demand formechanical circulatory support in patients with acute hemodynamic collapse hasled to major improvements in clinically available systems such as ECMO as adouble bridge to VAD implantation. We use ECMO as a rescue procedure in patients with acute hemodynamic deterioration. However, during ECMO support, leftventricular afterload increases. If prolonged support is necessary, a VAD may be required. We observed that 65% of patients who received support from an ECMOhybridized with the Thoratec VAD could wait for a suitable donor for HTx. Werecommend use of ECMO for short-term support (<1 week) and the Thoratec VAD formedium- or long-term support as a bridge to HTx.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
