Two therapeutic strategies have emerged with the potential toimprove the landscape of the clinical management of heart failure. First, leftventricular assist device therapy is able to sustain the circulation of patients in end-stage heart failure and may promote cardiac recovery. Secondly, stem cell therapy can potentially be used to induce myocardial regeneration replacing lost or non-functioning native myocardium. In this review, we present evidence thatthese strategies may overlap significantly in their mechanisms of action at thesystems, organ, tissue and cellular levels. We review the current clinicalevidence of their combined use.
