Stulak, Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic College ofMedicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA,stulak.john@mayo.edu.Advances in mechanical circulatory support have significantly expanded thetreatment options for patients with heart failure, whether acute or chronic.There are numerous devices available that offer patients short-, intermediate-,and long-term duration of support depending on their clinical needs and cardiacrecovery. Each device has its own technical considerations and the decision whichdevice to use depends on several factors, including what is available, the degreeof support required, and expected duration of support. Additional issues thatneed to be considered in choosing level of support include right heart function, respiratory failure, and multi-organ derangements. A widespread availability ofshort-term ventricular assist devices and timely institution for effectivehemodynamic support will translate into improved patient outcomes whether that issuccessful transfer to a tertiary care facility or recovery of inherent cardiacfunction. Implantable ventricular assist devices have and will continue to evolveinto smaller and more durable devices, and the future for patients with advanced heart failure looks ever-more promising.PMCID: PMC4295068
