J Biomech Eng. 2014 Feb;136(2):021014.Thromboresistance comparison of the HeartMate II ventricular assist device withthe device thrombogenicity emulation- optimized HeartAssist 5 VAD.Chiu WC, Girdhar G, Xenos M, Alemu Y, Soares JS, Einav S, Slepian M, Bluestein D.Approximately 7.5 × 106 patients in the US currently suffer from end-stage heart failure. The FDA has recently approved the designations of the Thoratec HeartMateII ventricular assist device (VAD) for both bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy (DT) due to its mechanical durability and improved hemodynamics. However,incidence of pump thrombosis and thromboembolic events remains high, and thelife-long complex pharmacological regimens are mandatory in its VAD recipients.We have previously successfully applied our device thrombogenicity emulation(DTE) methodology for optimizing device thromboresistance to the Micromed DebakeyVAD, and demonstrated that optimizing device features implicated in exposingblood to elevated shear stresses and exposure times significantly reducesshear-induced platelet activation and significantly improves the devicethromboresistance. In the present study, we compared the thrombogenicity of theFDA-approved HeartMate II VAD with the DTE-optimized Debakey VAD (now labeledHeartAssist 5). With quantitative probability density functions of the stressaccumulation along large number of platelet trajectories within each device whichwere extracted from numerical flow simulations in each device, and throughmeasurements of platelet activation rates in recirculation flow loops, wespecifically show that: (a) Platelets flowing through the HeartAssist 5 areexposed to significantly lower stress accumulation that lead to plateletactivation than the HeartMate II, especially at the impeller-shroud gap regions(b) Thrombus formation patterns observed in the HeartMate II are absent in theHeartAssist 5 (c) Platelet activation rates (PAR) measured in vitro with the VADsmounted in recirculation flow-loops show a 2.5-fold significantly higher PARvalue for the HeartMate II. This head to head thrombogenic performancecomparative study of the two VADs, one optimized with the DTE methodology and oneFDA-approved, demonstrates the efficacy of the DTE methodology for drasticallyreducing the device thrombogenic potential, validating the need for a robust insilico/in vitro optimization methodology for improving cardiovascular devicesthromboresistance.PMCID: PMC4023653
