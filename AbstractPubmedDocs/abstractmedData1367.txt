Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol. 2004;88:113-21.[Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD): optional treatment alternative tocardiac transplantation?].[Article in German]Wohlschlaeger J(1), Kawaguchi N, Levkau B, Schmid C, Scheld HH, Baba HA.Author information: (1)Institut für Pathologie, Universität Essen-Duisburg, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122Essen, Deutschland.Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are used to "bridge" patients withend-stage heart failure until transplantation of a donor heart can be performed("bridge to transplantation"). However, LVAD support sporadically results inimproved cardiac function, and heart transplantation is not necessary even after removal of LVAD in a subset of patients ("bridge to recovery"). Additionally,LVAD appears to be an optional treatment alternative to heart transplantation in patients with contraindication for organ replacement ("destination therapy"). Theunderlying process has descriptively been termed "reverse remodeling". Themolecular basis remains incompletely understood at present, however, somemechanisms have been identified in the past. Alterations of several molecularpathways are involved in the development of chronic heart failure. Some of thepathways appear to be reversible and have been shown to be regulated by LVADtreatment. LVAD lead to lowered cardiac pressure and volume overload followed by decreased ventricular wall tension, reduction of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,improved coronary perfusion and a decrease of chronic ischemia in the myocardium.Improved coronary flow and myocardial perfusion as well as decreased ventricular wall tension may serve as a possible explanation for changes of the molecularsystems involved in the development of chronic cardiac insuffiency. This reviewfocuses on the roles of apoptosis, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Metallothionein (MT) and the transcription factor NFkkappaB in chronic heart failure after mechanical circulatory support.
