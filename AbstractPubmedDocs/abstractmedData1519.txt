Wereport on a 2-year-old, 12 kg boy admitted with 2-week history of low-gradefever, ear pain, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure. Trans-thoracicechocardiography confirmed severe myocardial dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.20 and percentage shortening of 13. After 2 days ofventilatory and inotropic support, the patient continued to deteriorate andsubsequently required femoro-femoral extracorporeal life support (ECLS). This waslater complicated by a progressive coagulopathy and massive bleeding. On day 17, a pulsatile pediatric paracorporeal biventricular assist device (VAD) (BerlinHeart) was implanted. The patient's condition improved significantly with allcoagulopathies corrected, and the patient was extubated 21 days later. After 109 days of bi-VAD support, the patient was successfully transplanted and discharged home 45 days post transplant. Our early experience with initial ECLS bridge toVAD and subsequently to transplant was encouraging. It allowed for additionaltime to select the ideal organ donor and optimize the recipient's comorbidcondition and multiorgan failure. VAD provides an additional armamentarium ofcirculatory support in pediatric patients with severe heart failure.
