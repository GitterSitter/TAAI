Epub2012 Apr 10.The obesity paradox in men versus women with systolic heart failure.Clark AL(1), Chyu J, Horwich TB.Author information: (1)David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Obesity is common in heart failure (HF) and is associated with improved outcomes,a finding often termed the "obesity paradox." Although fat distribution varies bygender, the role of obesity in the outcomes of women compared to men with HF has not been well studied. In a cohort of patients with advanced systolic HF followedat a single university center, 2,718 patients had body mass indexes (BMIs)measured at baseline, and 469 patients with HF had waist circumferences (WCs)measured at baseline. Elevated BMI was defined as ≥25 kg/m(2). High WC wasdefined as ≥88 cm in women and ≥102 cm in men. The primary outcome was death,urgent heart transplantation, or ventricular assist device placement. The meanage was 53.0 ± 12.4 years, 25% of subjects were women, and the mean leftventricular ejection fraction was 22.9 ± 7.19%. In men, 2-year event-freesurvival was better for high versus normal BMI (63.2% vs 53.5%, p <0.001) and forhigh versus normal WC (78.8% vs 63.1%, p = 0.01). In women, 2-year event-freesurvival was better for elevated versus normal BMI (67.1% vs 56.6%, p = 0.01) butsimilar in the 2 WC groups. In multivariate analyses, normal BMI and normal WCwere associated with higher relative risk for the primary outcome in men (BMI1.34, WC 2.02) and women (BMI 1.38, WC 2.99). In conclusion, in patients withadvanced HF, high BMI and WC were associated with improved outcomes in bothgenders. Further investigation of the interaction between body composition andgender in HF outcomes is warranted.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.PMCID: PMC3377856
