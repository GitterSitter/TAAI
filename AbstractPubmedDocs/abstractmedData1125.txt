We examined waiting list mortality since the pediatric heart allocation system was revised in 1999 todetermine whether the revised allocation system is prioritizing patientsoptimally and to identify specific high-risk populations that may benefit fromemerging pediatric cardiac assist devices.METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study using the USScientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. All children <18 years of age whowere listed for a heart transplant between 1999 and 2006 were included. Among3098 children, the median age was 2 years (interquartile range 0.3 to 12 years), and median weight was 12.3 kg (interquartile range 5 to 38 kg); 1294 (42%) werenonwhite; and 1874 (60%) were listed as status 1A (of whom 30% were ventilatedand 18% were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Overall, 533 (17%) died,1943 (63%) received transplants, and 252 (8%) recovered; 370 (12%) remainedlisted. Multivariate predictors of waiting list mortality include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]2.4 to 3.9), ventilator support (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.4), listing status 1A(HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.7), congenital heart disease (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8 to2.6), dialysis support (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0), and nonwhite race/ethnicity(HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.0).CONCLUSIONS: US waiting list mortality for pediatric heart transplantationremains unacceptably high in the current era. Specific high-risk subgroups can beidentified that may benefit from emerging pediatric cardiac assist technologies. The current pediatric heart-allocation system captures medical urgency poorly.Further research is needed to define the optimal organ-allocation system forpediatric heart transplantation.PMCID: PMC4278666
