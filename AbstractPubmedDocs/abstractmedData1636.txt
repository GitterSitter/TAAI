Epub 2002 Aug 23.[Myocardial alterations with mechanical left ventricular assist devices].[Article in German]Grabellus F(1), Schmid C, Levkau B, Stypmann J, Scheld HH, Baba HA.Author information: (1)Institut für Pathologie, Universität Essen.Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have been used to "bridge" patients withend-stage heart failure to transplantation. Although several reports havesuggested that the native ventricular function recovers after long-term LVADsupport, a process called "reverse remodeling", the underlying biologicalmechanisms are still unclear. Various molecular pathways of the human myocardium associated with apoptosis, response to stress, or matrix changes are known to be altered under conditions of heart failure, and some have been shown to bereversibly regulated during left ventricular mechanical support, suggesting that the descriptive term "reverse remodeling" is, at least in parts, a reversiblemechanism. The reduction of volume and pressure overload with a decrease ofventricular wall stress leading to an improvement of myocardial blood supplyunder mechanical circulatory assistance, may be one explanation for the molecularmyocardial changes and may reflect one possible cause for the phenomenon of"reverse remodeling".
