The following procedures were performed at baselineand after 3 months of therapy: echocardiography at reduced support (4liters/min); cardiopulmonary exercise testing; body composition analysis; andquadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Myocardial histologic analysiswas measured at device implantation and explantation.RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events or arrhythmias. Creatinephosphokinase (CPK) was elevated in 4 subjects, with no clinical sequelae. Nochange in ejection fraction was seen. End-diastolic dimension increasedsignificantly (4.73 +/- 0.67 vs 5.24 +/- 0.66; p < 0.01), despite a trend toward increased LV mass. Body weight and lean mass increased significantly (75.5 +/-17.9 vs 79.2 +/- 25.1 kg, 21.1 +/- 8.9 vs 23.6 +/- 9.7 kg, respectively; both p <0.05). Exercise capacity did not change, but MVC improved significantly from 37.0+/- 15.7 to 45.8 +/- 20.6 kg (p < 0.05). No significant change in myocyte size orcollagen deposition was seen.CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac function did not improve in this cohort of LVAD patientstreated with high-dose clenbuterol. However, clenbuterol therapy increasedskeletal muscle mass and strength and prevented the expected decrease in myocyte size during LVAD support. Further study will clarify its potential for cardiacand skeletal muscle recovery.
