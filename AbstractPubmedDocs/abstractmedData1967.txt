J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1996 Apr;111(4):773-82; discussion 782-3.Transplant candidate's clinical status rather than right ventricular functiondefines need for univentricular versus biventricular support.Kormos RL(1), Gasior TA, Kawai A, Pham SM, Murali S, Hattler BG, Griffith BP.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA, USA.We have studied our experience since 1988 with 31 patients who required amechanical circulatory bridge to transplantation and also had biventricularfailure (mean right ventricular ejection fraction 11.8%) to better define theneed for biventricular or total artificial heart support versus univentricularsupport. Clinical factors including preoperative inotropic need, fever withoutdetectable infection, diffuse radiographic pulmonary edema, postoperative bloodtransfusion, and right ventricular wall thickness were compared with hemodynamic parameters including cardiac index, right ventricular ejection fraction, central venous pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and total pulmonary resistancefor ability to predict need for mechanical or high-dose inotropic support for theright ventricle. Patients were grouped according to need for right ventricularsupport after left ventricular-assist device implantation: none (group A, 14)inotropic drugs (group B1, 7), and right ventricle mechanical support (group B2, 10). There were no differences in preimplantation hemodynamic variables. GroupsB1 and B2 had significantly lower mixed venous oxygen saturation (39.2% vs 52.5% in group A; p < 0.001), greater level of inotropic need (p < 0.02), greaterimpairment of mental status, and lower ratio of right ventricular ejectionfraction to inotropic need (0.37 vs 0.56 for group A; p < 0.02) before leftventricular-assist device implantation. A significant discriminator betweengroups B1 and B2 was the presence of a fever without infection within 10 days of left ventricular-assist device implantation (43% in group B1 vs 70% in group B2).Group B2 had more patients with preimplantation pulmonary edema seen on chestradiography and a greater requirement for postoperative blood transfusion (5units of cells in group B1 vs 14.8 units in group B2. Right ventricular wallthickness at left ventricular-assist device explantation was 0.83 cm in group B2 vs 0.44 cm in group B1 (p < 0.05). Transplantation rates after bridging were 100%in group A, 71% in group B1, and 40% in group B2. Clinical factors that reflectpreimplantation degree of illness and perioperative factors that result inimpairment of pulmonary blood flow or reduced perfusion of the right ventricleafter left ventricular-assist device implantation are now considered to be morepredictive of the need for additional right ventricular support thanpreimplantation measures of right ventricular function or hemodynamic variables.
