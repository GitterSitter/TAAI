[Epub ahead of print]Serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide Concentration 60 Days after Surgery as aPredictor of Long-term Prognosis in Patients Implanted with a Left VentricularAssist Device.Sato T(1), Seguchi O, Iwashima Y, Yanase M, Nakajima S, Hieda M, Watanabe T,Sunami H, Murata Y, Hata H, Fujita T, Kobayashi J, Nakatani T.Author information: (1)National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Japan *1Department ofTransplantation *2Department of Cardiovascular Surgery *3Division of Hypertensionand Nephrology.Mechanical circulatory support by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is usedto bridge patients with advanced heart failure to transplant or as a definitivetreatment. We retrospectively sought predictors of long-term outcome in a cohort of 83 patients who had undergone LVAD treatment. We subjected patients'perioperative clinical data to statistical analysis to establish parametersassociated with all-cause mortality, and the cut-off values, sensitivity andspecificity of those that had a statistically significant relationship withsurvival. Mean follow up was 717 days (standard deviation 334 days, range 17-1592days). Fourteen patients (16.8%) died, but nine (10.8%) were weaned from support.Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration measured 60 days afterimplantation was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The optimalBNP cut-off value to predict death during LVAD support was 322 pg/ml, with asensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 79.8%. Two-year survival was 92.0% inthose with 60-day serum BNP concentration <322 pg/ml compared with 70.5% in thosein whom it was â‰§322 pg/ml (p = 0.003). The relationship between BNP and survival likely reflects recovery of native myocardial function and improvements in globalhealth, and should assist clinicians in the on-going management of long-term LVADtherapy.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
