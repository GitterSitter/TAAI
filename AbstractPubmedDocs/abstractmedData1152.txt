Little is knownabout the long-term outcomes and costs associated with these devices.OBJECTIVE: To examine the acute and long-term outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries receiving ventricular assist devices alone or after open-heart surgery.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Analysis of inpatient claims from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the period 2000 through 2006. Patients wereMedicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who received a ventricular assist devicebetween February 2000 and June 2006 alone as primary therapy (primary devicegroup; n = 1476) or after cardiotomy in the previous 30 days (postcardiotomygroup; n = 1467).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of device replacement, deviceremoval, heart transplantation, readmission, and death, accounting for censoring and competing risks. Patients were followed up for at least 6 months and factors independently associated with long-term survival were identified. Medicarepayments were used to calculate total inpatient costs and costs per day outsidethe hospital.RESULTS: Overall 1-year survival was 51.6% (n = 669) in the primary device group and 30.8% (n = 424) in the postcardiotomy group. Among primary device patients,815 (55.2%) were discharged alive with a device. Of those, 450 (55.6%) werereadmitted within 6 months and 504 (73.2%) were alive at 1 year. Of the 493(33.6%) postcardiotomy patients discharged alive with a device, 237 (48.3%) were readmitted within 6 months and 355 (76.6%) were alive at 1 year. Mean 1-yearMedicare payments for inpatient care for patients in the 2000-2005 cohorts were$178,714 (SD, $142,549) in the primary device group and $111,769 (SD, $95,413) inthe postcardiotomy group.CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicare beneficiaries receiving a ventricular assist device, early mortality, morbidity, and costs remain high. Improving patient selectionand reducing perioperative mortality are critical for improving overall outcomes.PMCID: PMC2629048
