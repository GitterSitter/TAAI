The battery is connected with a power plug to thepercutaneous skull-mounted footplate, which is monocortically fixated to theretro auricular bone. Patient selection should be highly specific, includingcareful preoperative evaluation. No device failures have been published so far,but complications can occur due to heparinisation. We describe the procedure fromthe perspective of the maxillofacial surgeon and give suggestions to preventsurgical complications.
