Especially in patients with chronic heart failure, theethical and medico-legal issues associated with providing maximal possible careor withholding the same are coming to the forefront. Procedures, such as cardiac transplantation, have strict criteria for adequate candidacy. These criteria for subsequent listing are based on clinical outcome data but also reflect thereality of organ shortage. Lack of compliance and non-adherence to lifestylechanges represent relative contraindications to heart transplant candidacy.Mechanical circulatory support therapy using ventricular assist devices isbecoming a more prominent therapeutic option for patients with end-stage heartfailure who are not candidates for transplantation, which also requires strictcriteria to enable beneficial outcome for the patient. Physicians need tocritically reflect that in many cases, the patient's best interest might notalways mean pursuing maximal technological options available. This articlereflects on the multitude of critical issues that health care providers have toface while caring for patients with end-stage heart failure.PMCID: PMC3230758
