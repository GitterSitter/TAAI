In asubgroup of selected patients, some hearts recovered considerable function. Inthese patients the device was removed and cardiac transplantation was no longernecessary. We report our long-term experience with these weaned patients.METHODS: As of today, 512 cardiac assist devices of various types (Berlin Heart, Berlin, Germany; Novacor, World Heart, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; TCI, ThermoCardioSystems, Inc, Woburn, MA; DeBakey, Micromed Technology Inc, Houston, TX) wereimplanted in patients with end-stage heart failure in our institution. Of these, 95 patients belonged to a subgroup of patients with nonischemic, idiopathic,dilated cardiomyopathy who were implanted with a left ventricular support system (Novacor 84, TCI 10, Berlin Heart 1) between 1994 and 2000. All were routinelyexamined by echocardiography for improvement of cardiac function. The leftventricular diameter in diastole (LVIDd) and left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) served as the main parameters to assess changes in cardiac performance.Under the conditions of a running device, an LVIDd below 60 mm and an LVEF above 40% were the criteria to do further echocardiographic studies when the pump wasturned off for up to 20 minutes.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (26 men, 2 women; ages 18 to 64 yrs; history ofheart failure, 1 to 17 yrs) fulfilled the criteria of improved cardiacperformance and were weaned from the device. Since then, 16 patients havecontinued "normal" heart function with follow-up times ranging from 1 month to5.5 years (group B). Three patients died of noncardiac causes (group C). Eightpatients were transplanted from 1 to 17 months later and one died on the waiting list (group A). Statistically significant differences between groups A and B werecalculated for the duration of heart failure (9 versus 2 years, p = 0.0002).Differences in LVIDd before removal of the device (57 versus 51 mm, p = 0.0420), LVEF after 2 months of unloading (30 versus 49%, p = 0.0300), and LVEFpreexplantation (43 versus 52%, p = 0.0001) were significant. Overall, 17% of thecohort of 95 patients were weaned successfully.CONCLUSIONS: Weaning from cardiac assist devices is feasible for selectedpatients; it saves donor hearts and is preferred to cardiac transplantation.However, as of today no reliable parameter predicts outcome after weaning andnone determines the possibility of device removal before implantation in advance.
