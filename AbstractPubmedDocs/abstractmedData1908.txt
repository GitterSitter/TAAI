A new strategy for the treatment of end stage cardiacdisease.Nishimura M(1), Ohtake S, Sawa Y, Kadoba K, Masai T, Ichikawa H, Chang J,Kagisaki K, Ohata T, Yamaguchi T, Matsuda H.Author information: (1)First Department of Surgery, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.The key to the successful implantation of a left ventricular assist system (LVAS)for patients with end stage cardiac disease is whether the functions of othervital organs are irreversibly damaged or not. The portable cardiopulmonarysupport system (PCPS) is not only as convenient as, but is more powerful than,the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in resuscitating impaired end organfunction. To investigate the efficacy of PCPS in end stage cardiac disease, endorgan function before and after the application of PCPS was retrospectivelyanalyzed for end stage cardiac disease. From 1992 to 1996, five cardiomyopathypatients with deterioration in end organ function, despite application of IABP,underwent PCPS support before implantation of LVAS. Urine volume and levels ofliver enzymes (sAST and sALT) and serum creatinine were determined before andafter institution of PCPS. After the start of PCPS, the urine output increasedsignificantly (1,840 +/- 450-4,340 +/- 470 ml/day, p < 0.01), and levels of sAST,sALT, and serum creatinine decreased significantly (630 +/- 220-150 +/- 50 IU/L, 630 +/- 260-260 +/- 130 IU/L, and 2.9 +/- 0.5-1.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, respectively; p < 0.05). All five patients were successfully bridged to LVAS implantation, andnone died of multiple organ failure caused by pre-existing cardiac failure. Theseresults indicate that PCPS before LVAS implantation is useful in resuscitatingimpaired end organ function and improving the survival rate with LVASimplantation for end stage cardiac disease.
