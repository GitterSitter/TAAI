The aim of this study was toidentify in an unselected cohort of LVAS recipients those aspects of patientselection that have an impact on postimplant survival.METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained from the Novacor European Registry.Between 1993 and 1999, 464 patients were implanted with the Novacor LVAS. Themajority had idiopathic (60%) or ischemic (27%) cardiomyopathy; the median age atimplant was 49 (16 to 75) years. The median support time was 100 days (4.1 years maximum). Forty-nine percent of the recipients were discharged from the hospital on LVAS; they spent 75% of their time out of the hospital. For a subset of 366recipients, for whom a complete set of data was available, multivariate analysis revealed that the following preimplant conditions were independent risk factorsfor survival after LVAS implantation: respiratory failure associated withsepticemia (odds ratio 11.2), right heart failure (odds ratio 3.2), age >65 years(odds ratio 3.01), acute postcardiotomy (odds ratio 1.8), and acute infarction(odds ratio 1.7). For patients without any of these factors, the 1-year survival after LVAS implantation including the posttransplantation period was 60%; for thecombined group with at least 1 risk factor, it was 24%.CONCLUSIONS: Careful selection, specifically implantation before patients become moribund, and improvement of management may result in improved outcomes of LVAStreatment for advanced heart failure.
