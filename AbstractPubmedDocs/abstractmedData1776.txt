Nitric oxidemodulates the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain to regulate myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2).METHODS: Myocardial oxygen consumption was measured polarographically using aClark-type oxygen electrode in isolated left ventricular myocardium from 26explanted failing human hearts obtained at the time of heart transplantation.RESULTS: The rate of decrease in oxygen concentration was expressed as apercentage of baseline. Results of the highest dose of drug are shown. Decreasein MVO2 was greater in LVAD hearts (n = 8) compared with heart failure controls(n = 18) in response to the following drugs: bradykinin (-34+/-3% vs. -24+/-5%), enalaprilat (-37+/-5% vs. -23+/-5%) and amlodipine (-43+/-13% vs. -16+/-5%;p<0.05 from controls). The decrease in MVO2 in LVAD hearts was not significantly different from controls in response to diltiazem (-22+/-5% in both groups) andexogenous NO donor, nitroglycerin (-33+/-7% vs. -30+/-3%). N(w)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of NO synthase, attenuated the response to bradykinin,enalaprilat and amlodipine. Reductions in MVO2 in response to diltiazem andnitroglycerin were not altered by inhibiting NO.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic LVAD support potentiates endogenous NO-mediated regulationof mitochondrial respiration. Use of medical or surgical interventions thataugment NO bioavailability may promote myocardial recovery in end-stage heartfailure.
