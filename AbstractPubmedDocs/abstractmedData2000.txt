Experience with the HeartMate1000 IP LVAD at the Cleveland Clinic as a bridge to heart transplantation in 21patients has shown (1) excellent hemodynamic function [improving cardiac indexfrom a mean +/- standard deviation of 1.6 +/- 0.26 L.min-1.m-2 to 3.0 +/- 0.42L.min-1.m-2]; (2) 81% survival before transplantation with a mean duration of 64 +/- 34 days of LVAD support; (3) 100% survival after transplantation; (4) NewYork Heart Association class IV and moribund patients were returned to class I orII status while on the LVAD; and (5) a remarkably low risk of thromboemboliduring 1,583 patient-days of support. The multicenter experience (173 patients)confirms the low risk of embolic events (2%, including septic emboli). A "target population" for initial use of the permanent device was outlined from aretrospective review of 570 patients. A subgroup of 74 patients (13%) werebetween 18 and 75 years of age, had isolated cardiac failure (without multiplecomorbidities), and required inotropic medications, intraaortic balloon pumpsupport, or both. Survival for this patient group (mean age, 57 +/- 13 years; 68%male) was poor: median survival was 7 months, 21.6% died during thehospitalization, and 47.3% died after discharge. Of the survivors, only 4patients (5% of the initial 74 patients) were in New York Heart Association classI. From the bridge-to-transplantation experience we extrapolate that survival andquality of life should improve for patients in the target population treated withthe portable LVAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
