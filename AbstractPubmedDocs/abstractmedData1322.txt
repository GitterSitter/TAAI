During a four-month follow-up, patientswere repeatedly evaluated with right heart catheterization and echocardiographyand, if functional improvement was observed, studied with the device turned off. Cardiac recovery was defined as off-pump LVEF>or=40% together with a significant improvement in invasive haemodynamic measurements (CI>or=2.5 and PCWP<or=10-12 mmHg). Patients fulfilling these criteria were considered for weaning.RESULTS: Three patients fulfilled the predefined criteria for cardiac recoveryand were subjected to device explantation. In one patient, a young female withacute myocarditis, the following course was uneventful. In the second patient, a male with dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure reoccurred only a few days later.The third patient had a relapse of giant cell myocarditis and was transplanted.One patient underwent transplantation before follow-up evaluation could beperformed.CONCLUSION: In our experience, patients with severe advanced heart failure areunlikely to show significant cardiac recovery following treatment with LVAD, incontrast to previous suggestions.
