In Japan, CFVAD is limited for BTT use. Thewaiting period for heart transplantation (HT) is long owing to donor shortage. Weexamined the results of CFVAD for BTT indication.METHODS: Eighty-nine VAD treatments were performed among subjects whosepreimplantation condition was profile 1 (n = 49) or profile 2 or 3 (n = 40). The device was the paracorporeal pulsatile Nipro VAD (n = 67) or CFVAD (n = 22). All CFVAD patients were profile 2 or 3.RESULTS: The median assist period was 529 days (Nipro VAD, 530; CFVAD, 528).Twenty-six patients were on the device for >2 years. Actuarial survival was81.6%, 69.5%, and 61.1% at 1, 3, and 5 years. Survival in profile 1 wassignificantly worse than in profile 2 or 3. Survival of CFVAD patients wassuperior to that of paracorporeal VAD. Six-month mortality rate of 20% in casesbefore 2009 (n = 60) was dramatically improved to 3% among those after 2010 (n = 29). All patients with CFVAD were alive and discharged home. 26 patients weretransplanted, 7 had been weaned from VAD and 27 were on a device. The rate ofevents requiring hospital admission was 0.98 per patient-year in CFVAD patients.CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary CFVADs have enabled advanced heart failure patients to await HT safely with an improved quality of life. The advent of CFVAD has alsoshifted their preimplantation condition to a less sick status. CFVADs were thesafest, most reliable circulatory support devices for long-term waiting periodsfor the BTT indications.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
