Outcomes of patients who underwent short-term ventricular assist device (STVAD)implantation in a community hospital (CH) as a bridge to a long-term VAD (LTVAD) were compared with those who received both implants at the same tertiary hospital(TH).METHODS: Data were retrospectively reviewed for patients with a STVAD who werebridged to a LTVAD in a TH from 1997 to 2010. We studied outcomes and survivalcensored for cardiac transplantation.RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (73% male) were identified. Mean age was 52 ± 16years, 30% were diabetic, and 65% had intra-aortic balloon pump support. Reasons for STVAD implantation were an acute myocardial infarction, 38%; post-cardiotomy,38%, decompensated chronic heart failure, 19%; and others, 5%. A STVAD wasimplanted in a CH in 20 patients (54%), and they had fewer cardiovascular riskfactors than those whose STVAD was implanted at the TH. All patients at the CHwere at Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 1compared with 71% at the TH (p = 0.014). Patients from the CH tended to diesooner after LTVAD implant, although long-term survival was similar. At the1-year follow-up, 65% from the CH were alive or had received a transplant vs 60% from the TH.CONCLUSION: Patients with cardiogenic shock in whom a STVAD was implanted in a CHand then were bridged to a LTVAD in a TH had similar long-term survival as those bridged to LTVAD at the TH.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
