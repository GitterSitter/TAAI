Treatment of the underlying disease, patient education andimprovement of compliance and consequent upgrading of medical heart failuretherapy often delays further progression to an advanced stage of heart failure.Nevertheless heart failure remains a chronic progressive disease and it is up to the treating clinician to identify the signs of advanced heart failure in atimely manner in order to evaluate patients for further treatment strategies suchas heart transplantation. This article should help define advanced heart failure and illustrate how patients are evaluated for further therapy. Outcome of hearttransplantation or mechanically assisted circulatory support is stronglyassociated to proper patient selection and timing.
