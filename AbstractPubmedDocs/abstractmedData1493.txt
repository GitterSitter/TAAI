DeBakey Department of Surgery, Division of Transplant Surgery andAssist Devices, Center for Artificial Organ Development, Baylor College ofMedicine, Houston, Texas, USA.Implantable ventricular assist devices (VADs) are indicated for long waitingperiods before transplantation and also as a destination therapy. Meanwhile,right ventricular failure (RVF) is one of the four major complications observedin patients after left VAD (LVAD) implantation, with an incidence ofapproximately 20%. Preoperative prediction of the complication remains difficult,and the mortality is very high. To date, no implantable right VAD (RVAD) isavailable for the clinical situation. The possibility of realizing an implantableRVAD with Gyro centrifugal pump (PI-710 pump) was investigated. Eleven chronicanimal experiments with LVAD and RVAD implantation were performed. Right heartbypass was established between right outflow and pulmonary trunk, and the pumpwas implanted in the preperitoneal space. The anatomic fit was good. The meanterm of the experiments was 59 days, with excellent pump performance. Stablepulmonary hemodynamics and respiratory function were maintained during all of theexperimental terms. No specific abnormal histologic findings of the lung wereconfirmed; however, tunica media hypertrophy was recognized in some cases. ThePI-710 pump is feasible as a clinically implantable RVAD, but further study ofhistologic and pulmonary vascular changes after RVAD implantation is needed.
