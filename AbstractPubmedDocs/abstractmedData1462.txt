There is a need for long-term ventricular assistdevices to bridge the failing myocardium of young children until recovery ortransplantation. Miniaturized devices and innovative modalities need to beoptimized. We report on our experience.METHODS: From 1/1992 to 6/2004, 18 infants (6 male/12 female) under 1 year of agewere treated with the Berlin Heart Excor VAD. The infants were divided into twogroups, depending on the year of treatment. Group A consists of eight infantsresuscitated and supported with a pulsatile pneumatic ventricular assist devicebetween 1992 and 1998 and group B consists of 10 infants treated between 1999 and6/2004. With the pediatric-sized Berlin Heart we used miniaturized extracorporealpneumatically driven blood pumps, the lowest stroke volume being 10 ml.RESULTS: In 18 children, age 3-345 (median 147) days, artificial replacement ofheart function was applied for long-term support (1-64, median 10 days) as alife-saving measure in our hospital. Nine had LVAD and nine BVAD support. Allwere in cardiogenic shock with multiorgan failure; three had fulminantmyocarditis, four cardiomyopathy, and one chronic stage of congenital heartdisease. Five children were weaned from the system, three reached hearttransplantation, and 10 died on the VAD. There were no differences between groupsA and B regarding age, body weight or diagnosis, but the duration of mechanicalsupport differed: Group A, median 2, range 1-16 days; group B, median 12, range1-100 days. Since 1999 (group B), the survival rate of our small infants hasincreased to 70% whereas none of the infants in group A survived to bedischarged.CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of VAD support in small infants is no longer inferior tothat of adult support, now optimized cannulas, modified anticoagulation andoptimized surgical and intensive care management have been established.
