First Norwegianexperiences].[Article in Norwegian]Fiane AE(1), Geiran OR, Lindberg HL, Seem E, Pedersen TH, Svennevig JL.Author information: (1)Kirurgisk avdeling A, Rikshospitalet, Oslo.By February 1997, the number of heart transplantations at the National Hospitalhad reached 265. In our department, the first bridge to transplantation in using Thoratec artificial heart was performed in 1995. A 44 year-old patient withlife-threatening heart failure was placed for one week on cardiopulmonary assist with an intra-aortic balloon pump and a veno-arterial cardiopulmonary bypass. Dueto unceasing heart failure a Thoratec left ventricular assist device wasimplanted as a bridge to transplant. The patient was successfully transplantedtwo days after implantation of Thoratec. After eight months follow-up he is inNew York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I. Another patient, 17 yearsof age, and with dilated cardiomyopathy, went into cardiogenic shock whileawaiting heart transplantation. For three days he had cardiopulmonary assist withintra-aortic balloon pump and venoarterial bypass with an oxygenator. After sevenweeks on the left ventricular assist device he was transplanted. Although oneepisode of severe rejection occurred, be is in NYHA functional class I after fourmonths follow-up. Our early experience is encouraging. Ventricular assist devicesshould be considered as a life support for patients scheduled for hearttransplantation and expected to die within a very short time.
