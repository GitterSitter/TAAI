After resuscitation, a miniaturized pulsatileventricular assist device for the mechanical replacement of heart function wasimplanted. The biventricular assist device ("Berlin Heart") consists of twoextracorporeal pneumatically driven polyurethane blood pumps, with a multi-layer flexible membrane that separates a blood and an air chamber. Four siliconcannulae connect the blood pumps to the patient. A three-leaflet valve preventsblood reflux. The pumps are driven by a pulsatile electropneumatic system. In 12 of the 15 children the bridging to transplantation was successful with a support time of 1 to 98 days (mean 24 days). Nine of them were extubated and mobilizedwhile assisted. Three children died during the support time due to hemorrhage,sepsis, and pulmonary failure. In addition, there was one infarction of thearteria cerebri media. To date seven of the transplanted children are in goodcondition on follow-up. The beneficial effects of ventricular assist device useare well known in adult patients and with special devices it can be transferredto infants and children in whom longer need for support is anticipated. Even insmall infants it is an effective method for bridging to cardiac transplantation.
