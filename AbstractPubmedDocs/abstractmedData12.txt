We describe the use of this device to support the systemic right ventricle (RV) of a pediatric patient with New York HeartAssociation class IIIC congestive heart failure who had undergone Mustardprocedure for D-transposition of the great vessels as an infant.CASE REPORT: A HeartWare ventricular assist device was implanted in the leftchest of a 16-year-old female patient (body surface area 1.43 m(2)) who presentedwith edema and later deteriorated, developing acute kidney injury, dysrhythmia,and pulmonary edema.RESULTS: The patient's edema and acute kidney injury resolved after deviceplacement. She was discharged home and successfully underwent device removal withheart transplant five months later.CONCLUSION: The HeartWare device may be used for extended support as a systemicRV in a pediatric patient. It is feasible to consider using the device in thispatient population.Â© The Author(s) 2014.
