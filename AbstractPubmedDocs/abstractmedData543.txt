Increasing the availability ofcyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5)is a relatively new, but promising therapeutic strategy. Preclinical studiessuggest a favorable myocardial effect of PDE5 inhibitors by blocking adrenergic, hypertrophic and pro-apoptotic signaling, thereby supporting their use in HF. Theclinical benefits of acute and chronic PDE5 inhibition on lung diffusioncapacity, exercise performance and ejection fraction in humans are emerging andappear promising. Larger, controlled trials are now on-going to assess thesafety, efficacy and tolerability of PDE5 inhibitors on morbidity and mortalityin patients with both systolic and diastolic heart failure. If the results ofthese trials are positive, a new avenue for the treatment of HF will open, which will help curtail the societal effects of this costly and morbid disease.
