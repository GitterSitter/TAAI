The device consists of an abdominally placed,battery-powered titanium blood pump that, in contrast to earlier pneumaticallypowered systems, allows patients untethered freedom of movement. The batterieslast 5 to 8 hours and can be changed on a rotating basis indefinitely. Thepatient, a 33-year-old man (90 kg, blood type O) with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, experienced end-organ heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class IV) while he was awaiting heart transplantation. When his hemodynamic criteria metthose outlined in the protocol, we implanted the VE-LVAD as a bridge totransplantation. The patient was supported by the device for more than 16 months.His cardiac status returned to NYHA class I, and he was eventually allowed totake day trips outside the hospital as he awaited transplantation. The VE-LVADenabled the patient to participate in activities such as eating in restaurants,going to movies, and practicing basketball shots. Unfortunately, the patient diedsuddenly due to a neurological thromboembolic event that occurred on day 503 ofVE-LVAD support. The VE-LVAD improved native left ventricular function by chronicunloading, and ventricular remodeling resulted in a more normal configurationanatomically, physiologically, and ultimately, histologically and pathologically.
