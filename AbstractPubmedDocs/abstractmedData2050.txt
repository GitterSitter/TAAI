Ann Thorac Surg. 1993 Jan;55(1):250-6.Clinical experience with ventricular assist systems in Japan.Takano H(1), Nakatani T, Taenaka Y.Author information: (1)National Cardiovascular Center, Research Institute, Osaka, Japan.In Japan, five types of ventricular assist system, including thegovernment-approved National Cardiovascular Center type and the Tokyo University type, were applied to 202 patients as of September 30, 1991. Adult-sizedventricular assist systems were used in 194 patients and a pediatric one in 8.The major primary diagnosis was ischemic heart disease (52.5%). Sixty-threepatients in cardiogenic shock with acute myocardial infarction were treated usinga ventricular assist system, and the results were fairly good. The predominantindication was failure to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass (72.8%), andthere was no case of bridging to heart transplantation. Left ventricular assistwas performed in most patients (85.1%). The duration of ventricular assist systemapplication ranged from 1 hour to 70 days, and the mean duration was 6.8 +/- 9.6 days. Duration of circulatory support had no relation to the results, and thelongest support in survivors was 25 days. The weaning rate was 50.0%, and thesurvival rate was 26.2%. Main causes of death were heart failure, includingunrecoverable heart failure, and multiple organ failure. It should be kept inmind that the decision to use a ventricular assist system should be made quickly,before major organs, including the heart itself, are irreversibly damaged.
