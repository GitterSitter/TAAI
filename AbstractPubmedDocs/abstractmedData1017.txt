The purpose was to identifypredictors associated with ARD after VAD implantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: ARD was defined using the risk of renal dysfunction, injury to the kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, end-stagekidney disease (RIFLE) criteria. Patients who developed ARD during VAD support(ARD, n=24) were compared with patients who did not (NoARD, n=29). Patients with ARD before implant were excluded. Patient characteristics pre-VAD implant,incidence of complications during support and survival were analyzed. Baselinecharacteristics were similar. The ARD group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) time, greater need for reoperation and higher risk of bleeding (>1 L)intraoperatively (P < .05). The ARD group had a higher incidence of infections(17% vs. 50%, OR 5, 95%CI 1.3-17), liver injury (58% vs. 17%, OR 7, 95%CI 2-24), ventricular arrhythmias (42% vs. 14%, OR 4, 95%CI 1.1-16), and right ventricular failure (73% vs. 30%, OR 7, 95%CI 2-24). Need for dialysis was associated withhigher pre-VAD creatinine and worse outcomes. Survival was significantly lower inthe ARD group (HR 8.5, 95%CI 2-29).CONCLUSIONS: Acute renal dysfunction is a common and serious complicationpost-VAD implantation and is associated with reduced survival. Longer CPB time,higher intraoperative blood loss, and reoperation are associated factors with thedevelopment of this disease.
