However, patients receiving ACE-Iduring VAD-support had lower Col1A1 mRNA content at transplantation. The totalcollagen content was not influenced by mechanical unloading or by ACE-Imedication.CONCLUSION: Mechanical unloading by VAD does not reduce the collagen content ofthe terminal failing ventricle possibly due to increased TGF beta1 levels.However, Col1A1 production may be reduced by ACE-I medication during VAD support.
