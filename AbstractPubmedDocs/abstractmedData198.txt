Our group developed two transplant programs at Instituto Nacional delTórax and Clínica Dávila. We report our clinical experience based on distinctive clinical policies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients were transplanted between November 2008 and April 2013, representing 51% of all Chilean cases. Distinctive clinical policies include intensive donor management, generic immunosuppressionand VAD (ventricular assist devices) insertion.RESULTS: Ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy were the main indications (23 (43%)each), age 48 ± 13 years and 48 (91%) were male. Transplant listing Status: IA 14(26%) (VAD or 2 inotropes), IB 14 (26%) (1 inotrope) and II25 (47%) (noinotrope). Mean waiting time 70 ± 83 days. Twelve (24%) were transplanted during VAD support (median support: 36 days).OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: orthotopic bicaval transplant with ischemia time: 175 ± 54min. Operative mortality: 3 (6%), all due to right ventricular failure.Re-exploration for bleeding 2 (4%), stroke 3 (6%), mediastinitis 0 (0%),pneumonia 4 (8%), and transient dialysis 6 (11%). Mean follow-up was 21 ± 14months. Three-year survival was 86 ± 6%. One patient died of Pneumocystisjirovecii pneumonia and the other died suddenly (non-compliance). Freedom fromrejection requiring specific therapy was 80 ± 7% at 3 years of follow-up. Fourhundred eighty four endomyocardial biopsies were done: 11 (2.3%) had 2Rrejection. All survivors are in NYHA (New York Heart Association) functionalclass I and all but one have normal biventricular function.CONCLUSION: Mid-term results are similar to those reported by the registry of theInternational Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. This experience has ahigher proportion of VAD support than previous national series. Rejection ratesare low in spite of generic immunosuppression.
