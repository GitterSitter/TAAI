Devicethrombosis is a serious complication of CF-LVADs, but its precise prevalence and etiology remains uncertain.METHODS: Root-cause analysis was performed in all cases with device thrombosisconfirmed upon explant among patients implanted with a HeartMate II (HM II) from January 1, 2009 to November 15, 2012. Cannula position and bend relief integrity were assessed and charts were reviewed with particular attention toanti-coagulation and infection profiles.RESULTS: Nineteen of 177 patients (11%) were found to have device thrombosis ofvarious etiologies after a mean of 351 ± 311 days, representing 0.12event/patient-year. Of the 5 mechanically induced thromboses, proximate etiology was severely abnormal inflow cannula position in 3 patients and bend reliefdisconnect with deformed outflow graft in 2 patients. One patient had ahypercoagulable disorder with prior arterial embolism. In the remaining 13patients (age 61 ± 14 years, 77% male, 69% Caucasian), "non-mechanical" devicethrombosis occurred after 357 ± 383 days; INR at the time of diagnosis was 1.81(1.62 to 2.07); and mean device speed was 8,855 ± 359 rpm. Five of 13 patients(38%) had an infection during the month leading up to device thrombosis. Of note,lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was already elevated at the time of discharge inpatients who would later develop non-mechanical device thrombosis (423 [354 to766] vs 352 [272 to 373] U/liter, p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Device thrombosis is a multifactorial phenomenon, anddifferentiation of mechanical and non-mechanical causes is an essential step for individual diagnosis and treatment plans. Larger studies excluding patients with obvious mechanical etiology are needed to investigate biologic and/ormanagement-related risk factors for device thrombosis. Our findings suggest that LDH may be an early risk marker. Due to the difficulty in treating late-stagedevice thrombosis, we suggest early use of simple tests to rule out both causesof thrombosis, such as X-rays and closer LDH monitoring (bi-weekly).© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published byInternational Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.
