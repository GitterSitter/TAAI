J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1988 Dec;96(6):901-11.Seven years' experience with the Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device.Pennington DG(1), Kanter KR, McBride LR, Kaiser GC, Barner HB, Miller LW,Naunheim KS, Fiore AC, Willman V.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, St. Louis University Hospital, Mo.Of currently available methods for mechanical circulatory support, thePierce-Donachy external pneumatic ventricular assist device has proved to be one of the most versatile and effective. Since 1981, 48 patients, aged 15 to 71 years(mean 43.0), with profound cardiogenic shock refractory to conventional therapywith drugs and intra-aortic balloon support, were supported with thePierce-Donachy ventricular assist device. There were four patient groups. Thelargest group consisted of 30 patients with cardiogenic shock after cardiacoperations. Nine required left ventricular support, six needed right ventricular support plus an intraaortic balloon pump, and 15 had biventricular support.Duration of support ranged from 3 hours to 22 days (mean 3.6 days). Eight of the first 11 patients died in the operating room of bleeding and/or biventricularfailure. However, 16 patients, (53%) had improved cardiac function, 15 (50%) wereweaned, and 11 (36%) were discharged. Of the last 19 patients, 47% survived.Frequent factors in nonsurvivors were myocardial infarction (75%) and renalfailure (90%). Common complications in all patients were bleeding (52%) andinfection (27%). The second group consisted of 11 patients with end-stagecardiomyopathy or acute myocardial infarction in whom the Pierce-Donachyventricular assist device was used as a bridge to transplantation (leftventricular support, four patients; biventricular support, seven patients). Renalfailure, infection, or coagulopathy that precluded transplantation developed infive patients. Five patients were supported for 8 hours to 75 days (mean 20.7days) before undergoing successful transplantation, with one late death (sixmonths) from rejection owing to noncompliance. One has subsequently undergonesuccessful transplantation after 84 days of support. The third group consisted offour patients, aged 40 to 56 years (means 47.2), who had refractory cardiogenicshock after cardiac transplantation caused by pulmonary hypertension (twopatients), hyperacute rejection (one patient), or graft failure (one patient).Despite biventricular support in all four (biventricular assist devices, twopatients; right ventricular assist device plus intraaortic balloon pump, twopatients), all died of infection and/or renal failure after 12 hours to 6 days(mean 3.4 days) of support. The final group consisted of three patients, aged 36 to 51 years (mean 45), with cardiogenic shock caused by acute myocardialinfarction. One patient was supported with biventricular assist devices (3.5days) and two patients were supported with a left ventricular assist device (8.5 and 15 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
