Circulation. 1996 Nov 1;94(9 Suppl):II222-6.Assessment of submaximal exercise capacity in patients with left ventricularassist devices.Foray A(1), Williams D, Reemtsma K, Oz M, Mancini D.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY10024, USA.BACKGROUND: Long-term implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) areincreasingly used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation and may be used aslong-term therapy for end-stage heart failure. After insertion of an LVAD,patients frequently become ambulatory. Sensors contained within these devices canmeasure the hemodynamic demands of submaximal exercise. In this study, weperformed serial assessment of submaximal exercise capacity in patients withLVADs early (< 3 months), mid (3 to 6 months), and late (> 6 months) after deviceimplantation to determine whether submaximal exercise capacity increased overtime and whether this was related to improvements in the cardiac output response.Moreover, we compared the sub-maximal exercise capacities of these patients with those of normal subjects and patients with mild to severe heart failure.METHODS AND RESULTS: An encouraged 6-minute walk test with metabolic measurementswas used to assess submaximal exercise capacity in 14 patients with LVADs, 20patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF), 14 patients withsevere heart failure dependent on dobutamine (DB), and 6 normal subjects. Cardiacoutput measurements at rest and during exercise were obtained in the patientswith devices. Distance walked was significantly greater for LVAD patients than DBpatients and was similar to that for patients with mild CHF (LVAD, 1562 +/- 404; DB, 948 +/- 241; and CHF, 1358 +/- 278 ft; P < .01). Vo2 was also greater in the LVAD than DB or CHF patients (LVAD, 16.3 +/- 6.5; DB, 9.8 +/- 4.8; and CHF, 11.2 +/- 2.0 mL.kg-1.min-1; P < .05). Vo2 (23.4 +/- 7.4 mL.kg-1.min-1) and distancewalked (2142 +/- 408 ft) in normal subjects was significantly greater than forall patient groups (all P < .01). Serial assessment of submaximal exercisecapacity in LVAD patients demonstrated continued sustained improvement over time (early, 1261 +/- 341; mid, 1538 +/- 345; and late, 1867 +/- 265 ft; P < .05).However, peak cardiac output response was unchanged (early, 8 +/- 1.3; mid, 8.6+/- 1.4; and late, 8.6 +/- 1.4 L/min; P = NS).CONCLUSIONS: The submaximal exercise capacity of LVAD patients is comparable tothat of patients with mild CHF but significantly better than that ofdobutamine-dependent patients. Hemodynamic and metabolic assessment during6-minute walk tests demonstrates that in patients with heart failure and LVAD,cardiovascular demands are generally > 85% of maximum. A significant sustainedimprovement in submaximal exercise capacity occurs with chronic LVAD therapy.Lack of alteration of the cardiac output response to exercise suggests that this functional improvement results from peripheral mechanisms.
