Curr Opin Cardiol. 1997 Mar;12(2):166-71.Radical alternatives to transplantation.Starling RC(1).Author information: (1)Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac TransplantMedicine, OH 44195, USA.Because of the lack of donor hearts, thousands of patients annually die withend-stage heart failure. Surgical alternatives to transplantation include partialleft ventricular resection, dynamic cardiomyoplasty, and left ventricular assist devices. Partial left ventricular resection is an innovative procedure in whichthe heart is surgically reduced in size and cardiac function is dramaticallyimproved immediately after surgery. Long-term follow-up is required to determine the success of this procedure. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty has been in use for 12years. In properly selected patients, it results in significant amelioration ofsymptoms and improvement in quality of life. Improved survival and objectivephysiologic improvement have not been documented. A randomized trial is now inprogress to evaluate survival with surgical therapy versus survival with medical therapy. Left ventricular assist devices have been shown to be extremelyeffective as a short- and long-term "bridge" to heart transplantation in mortallyill patients. They are not approved for long-term support as an alternative totransplantation in the United States, but a randomized trial is now underway tocompare the efficacy of these devices with the efficacy of medical therapy in NewYork Heart Association functional class IV patients.
