However, studies of a large series ofapplications are still lacking. We evaluate the safety and efficacy of theHeartWare pump in 141 patients with end-stage heart failure at a single centre.METHODS: A total of 141 patients (116 men and 25 women with a mean age of 52years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV received implantation of theHeartWare Ventricular Assist System between August 2009 and April 2011 at theDeutsches Herzzentrum Berlin. The outcomes were measured in terms of laboratorydata, adverse events, NYHA functional class and survival during device support.RESULTS: The HeartWare system provided an adequate haemodynamic support forpatients both inside and outside the hospital. NYHA class improved to I-II. Organfunction and pulmonary vascular resistance improved significantly. In this cohortof patients, 14 patients underwent heart transplantation, one had had the device explanted following myocardial recovery, one had changed to another assistdevice, 81 were on ongoing support and 44 died. The overall actuarial survivalrates at 6 and 12 months were 70 and 67%, respectively, and the 3-, 6- and12-month survival rates on a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support forbridge to transplantation patients were 82, 81 and 79%, respectively. Infectionand bleeding were the main adverse events. Four patients underwent an LVADexchange for pump thrombosis.CONCLUSIONS: The HeartWare system provides a safe and effective circulatorysupport in a population with a wide range of body surface areas, with asatisfactory actuarial survival time and an improved quality of life. It can beused for univentricular or biventricular support, being implanted into thepericardial space with simplified surgical techniques.
