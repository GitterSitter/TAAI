Transplantation is limited by donoravailability but has a median survival of 10 years. Post-transplantimmunosuppression is often transplant center dependent, but a tacrolimus andmycophenolate mofetil-based regimen may be preferred. Sirolimus may reduce theprogression rate of transplant vasculopathy. There has been a trend towardcontinuous-flow left ventricular assist devices because of their increaseddurability and reduced size. A variety of surgical and percutaneous ventricularassist devices may be used as a bridge to decision on a patient's candidacy fortransplantation. Mechanical circulatory support as destination therapy has notbeen widely implemented because of poor device durability, but this is expectedto change with newer devices. Mechanical circulatory support as a bridge tomyocardial recovery has been successful only in a few patients.
