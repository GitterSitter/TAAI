There were 133 men (91.7%) and 12 women (8.3%) with a mean age of 52.95±12.01 years. Patients were divided into two groups depending on preoperative PH reversibility. Fixed PH was defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >25 mmHg, a pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) >2.5 Wood Unit (WU) and a transpulmonary gradient (TPG) >12 mmHg, despitepharmacological treatment.RESULTS: Fifty-six patients had fixed PH (group A) and 89 reversible PH (groupB). Only 27 patients of group A underwent right heart catheterization evaluation during LVAD support; the remaining 29 patients had other contraindications toheart transplantation (HTx). The 27 patients were divided into three subgroups onthe basis of examination time during LVAD support: <6 months (11 patients),between 6 and 12 months (six patients) and >12 months (10 patients). The mPAP,PVR, and TPG decreased significantly during LVAD support (mPAP, 37.26±6.35 mmHgvs 21.00±7.51 mmHg, p=0.007; PVR, 3.49±1.47 WU vs 1.53±0.66 WU, p=0.000; and TPG,15.04±5.22 mmHg vs 7.78±3.21 mmHg, p=0.019). A significant reduction of allparameters was observed during the first 6 months and later on there was nofurther decrease. There were no significant differences between the threesubgroups (mPAP, p=0.680; PVR, p=0.723; and TPG, p=0.679) in terms of time ofreversibility. LVAD support allowed 19 patients to be transplanted.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with fixed PH can be treated with LVAD support. Our datasuggest that 6 months after LVAD implantation it is possible to observe animportant reduction of PH and evaluate the potential transplantability ofpatients. Longer support does not add any effect of LVAD on PH.Copyright © 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published byElsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
