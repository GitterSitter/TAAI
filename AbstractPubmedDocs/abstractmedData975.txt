Epub 2010 Mar 19.Usefulness of cardiac index and peak exercise oxygen consumption for determining priority for cardiac transplantation.Methvin A(1), Georgiopoulou VV, Kalogeropoulos AP, Malik A, Anarado P, Chowdhury M, Hussain I, Book WM, Laskar SR, Vega JD, Smith AL, Butler J.Author information: (1)Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.Decisions regarding cardiac transplantation listing are difficult in patientswith heart failure who have relatively discordant peak exercise oxygenconsumption (Vo(2)) and cardiac index (CI) values. One hundred five patients withheart failure who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing and right-sidedcardiac catheterization for transplantation evaluation were studied. Patientswere divided into 4 groups on the basis of peak Vo(2) and CI: group 1, Vo(2) > or= 12 ml/min/kg, CI > or = 1.8 L/min/m(2) (n = 30); group 2, Vo(2) > or = 12ml/min/kg, CI <1.8, L/min/m(2) (n = 27); group 3, Vo(2) <12 ml/min/kg, CI > or = 1.8 L/min/m(2) (n = 25); and group 4, Vo(2) <12 ml/min/kg, CI <1.8 L/min/m(2) (n = 23). Groups were compared for event-free (death or ventricular assist device)survival. The overall CI was 1.9 + or - 0.4 L/min/m(2) and peak Vo(2) was 12.4 + or - 2.8 ml/min/kg; values in the 4 groups were as follows: group 1, peak Vo(2)14.7 + or - 2.1 ml/min/kg, CI 2.2 + or - 0.3 L/min/m(2); group 2, peak VO(2) 14.2+ or - 1.3 ml/min/kg, CI 1.5 + or - 0.2 L/min/m(2); group 3, peak Vo(2) 10.2 + or- 1.3 ml/min/kg, CI 2.1 + or - 0.3 L/min/m(2); and group 4, peak Vo(2) 9.7 + or -2.0 ml/min/kg, CI 1.6 + or - 0.2 L/min/m(2). After a median follow-up period of3.7 years, 28 patients (26.0%) had events. Event-free survival was 96%, 95%, 96%,and 79% for 6 months (p = 0.04); 88%, 81%, 90%, and 73% for 12 months (p = 0.09);88%, 73%, 85%, and 65% for 18 months (p = 0.11); and 83%, 73%, 79%, and 53% for24 months (p = 0.06) for groups 1 to 4, respectively. Median survival was 5.1,3.0, 3.9, and 2.6 years, respectively, in groups 1 to 4 (p = 0.052). Inconclusion, almost half the patients had relatively discordant peak Vo(2) and CI measurements. Patients with lower peak Vo(2) values but relatively preserved CIvalues had survival comparable to post-transplantation survival, whereas thosewith low CI but preserved Vo(2) had a lower survival rate. These results suggest that the former group may be safely monitored on medical therapy, whereas thelatter may benefit from early listing.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
