A systematic search was conducted in fivedatabases for the period 2003 to 2012. Fifty-three publications with data for 999patients, supported with CentriMag, were included. In 72% studies, CentriMag was used as a VAD and in 25% as part of ECMO circuit. Mean duration of VAD supportwas 25.0 days in precardiotomy group, 10.9 days in postcardiac surgerycardiogenic shock group, 8.8 days in post-transplant graft failure and rejection group, and 16.0 days in post-LVAD placement right ventricular failure group.Survival on support was 82% (95% CI 70-92) for VAD support in precardiotomycardiogenic shock indication, 63% (95% CI 46-78) in VAD support in postcardiacsurgery cardiogenic shock indication, 62% (95% CI 46-76) in VAD support inpost-transplant graft rejection or failure indication, and 83% (95% CI 73-92) in VAD support in post-LVAD placement right ventricular failure indication.CentriMag is an effective technology for temporary support of patients withcardiac and cardiorespiratory failure.PMCID: PMC4154791
