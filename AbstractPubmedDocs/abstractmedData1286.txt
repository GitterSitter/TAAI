Medical therapy or the use of anintra-aortic balloon pump may be insufficient to help the patient overcome acute cardiogenic shock. The set-up of mechanical assist devices such as extracorporealmembrane oxygenation or patient relocation into the operating room requiresvaluable time that is often not available. The aim of our study was to testwhether a novel left ventricular assist device can be percutaneously implantedwithout fluoroscopy under echocardiographic navigation in a preclinical model.METHODS: Pigs were subjected to percutaneous implantation of a novel leftventricular assist device under navigation of transesophageal echocardiography(TEE) without fluoroscopic support. Percutaneous puncture of the interatrialseptum using a Brockenbrough needle and insertion of the afferent cannula intothe femoral vein and its advance to the right atrium and through the interatrial septum into the left atrium was performed under echocardiographic control. Theefferent cannula was inserted into the contralateral femoral artery using theSeldinger technique.RESULTS: In all animals, the percutaneous implantation of a left ventricularassist device was successful under only TEE navigation.CONCLUSIONS: The ability to abstain from fluoroscopy and the feasibility ofinserting the afferent cannula across the interatrial septum guided by TEE allowsfor application of this system in intensive care units, saving precious time aswell as financial and human resources.
