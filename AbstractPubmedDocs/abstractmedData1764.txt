The most definitive surgical option for severeend-stage heart failure is cardiac transplantation. In general, patientsconsidered for heart transplant should have severe heart disease despite allother therapies with a high risk of death within 1 year. Noncardiac conditionsthat would by themselves shorten life expectancy or increase the risks ofrejection, infection, or other fatal complication, should not be present.However, in light of the limited donor pool, complications associated withlong-term immunosuppressive therapy, and the ever-increasing number of CHFpatients, the role of cardiac transplantation for CHF will continue to belimited. The conduct of and evaluation for cardiac transplantation has been well described previously and therefore will not be evaluated in this review (1);however, there has been recent progress in the genetic modification of animalorgans for potential use in transplantation (xenografts) (2). If thesedevelopments come to fruition, then cardiac transplantation/organ replacement maybecome a surgical option for a much greater number of CHF patients. Onealternative approach to complete cardiac transplantation is the surgicalplacement of transformed cells into the diseased myocardium, briefly discussedunder "Future Directions." This article will examine surgical options that arecurrently being used for CHF patients, surgical modalities that are currentlyunder clinical evaluation, and finally, potential future therapies with respectto surgical options for heart failure.
