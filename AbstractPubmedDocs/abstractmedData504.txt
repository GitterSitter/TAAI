Despite significantprogress, even the latest generation left ventricular assist devices are burdenedby a significant long-term adverse events profile that will increasinglychallenge physicians as patients survive longer on implantable mechanicalcirculatory support. In this review, we analyze the impact of long-term adverseevents on clinical outcomes in the major trials of continuous flow leftventricular assist devices. We discuss several of the more pertinent andinteresting adverse events, examine their potential causes, and explore theirfuture implications.
