Electronic address: Carolina.alba@uhn.ca.BACKGROUND: Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) are involved in the process ofendothelial repair and are a prognostic factor in cardiovascular diseases. Weevaluated the association between serial measurements of CPCs and functionalcapacity and outcomes in heart failure (HF).METHODS: We included 156 consecutive consenting ambulatory HF patients (leftventricular ejection fraction < 40%). We evaluated CPCs and functional capacity(peak VO2) every 6 months for up to 2 years. CPCs were measured asearly-outgrowth colony-forming units (EO-CFUs) and circulating CD34+, VEGFR2+and/or CD133+ cells. We recorded mortality, HF hospital admissions, transplant,and ventricular assist device.RESULTS: The mean age was 55 ± 15 years. A decrease in CD34+VEGFR2+ cells wasindependently associated with increased functional capacity; a 10-cell decreasein CD34+VEGFR2+ cells was associated with an increase of 0.2 mL/kg/min in peakVO2 (P < 0.05). We found an interaction effect (P = 0.02) between EO-CFUs anddiabetes: in patients without diabetes, a 10-EO-CFU increase was independentlyassociated with increased peak VO2 of 0.28 mL/kg/min (P = 0.01), and in patients with diabetes, a decrease in EO-CFUs was associated with an increased peak VO2 (P< 0.05). Higher EO-CFUs were associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio,0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.69).CONCLUSIONS: We noted differential relations between CPCs and outcomes inpatients with vs without diabetes. Higher EO-CFUs and lower CD34+VEGFR2+ cellswere associated with improved functional capacity and reduced mortality innondiabetic patients. In patients with diabetes, lower EO-CFUs were associatedwith improved functional capacity. The basis for these differences requiresfurther examination.Copyright © 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
