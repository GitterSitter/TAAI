Renal impairment can range from reversible ischemic damage to renal failure requiringshort- or long-term renal replacement therapy (2). Patients who requiremechanical circulatory support, such as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), as definitive treatment for congestive heart failure or as a bridge to cardiactransplantation pose a unique challenge with respect to receiving dialysis,because they experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality from infection inthe post-LVAD period (3-7). Acute dialysis access can pose an increased infectionrisk. In this article, we present a patient who required renal replacementtherapy and a LVAD for management of acute-on-chronic cardiorenal syndrome while awaiting heart transplantation. A literature review to determine whetherperitoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is superior for patients with profoundhemodynamic dysfunction and the need to minimize risk of infection did not offer clear guidance about which modality is superior in patients with advancedcongestive heart failure. However, there is clear evidence of the superiority of peritoneal dialysis in reducing the risk of systemic infection secondary to acutedialysis access. Given the high risk of LVAD infection, we therefore concludethat, to decrease mortality secondary to systemic infection, peritoneal dialysis should strongly be considered in patients who require renal replacement therapybefore or after LVAD placement.PMCID: PMC3524848
