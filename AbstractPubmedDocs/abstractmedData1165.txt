The use of a bridge-to-bridge strategy leads to excellent survival rates in pediatricpatients. We present an adolescent, who acquired acute respiratory failure, dueto possible transfusion related lung injury, and who was successfully treatedwith venovenous extracorporal membrane oxygenation while on ventricularassist-device support.
