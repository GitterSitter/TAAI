We determined the pressures in mmHg of right atrium (RA), pulmonary arterypressure (PAP), pulmonary wedge pressure (WEDGE), arterial blood pressure (AP),and the cardiac output (CO) in l/min. In addition, the blood levels ofnorepinephrine (Ne), renin (Re), epinephrine (Ep), lactate and the mixed venousoxygen pressure (pVO2) were determined. The CO increased from 2.14 to 3.9-4.2l/min, the AD decreased from 26mmHg to 8mmHg, the MPAP reduced from 38mmHg to14-24mmHg, the WEDGE reduced from 25 to 4mmHg and the AP become normal. The Nereduced from 1927pg/ml to 983pg/ml, the lactate reduced from 99mg/dl to 22mg/dland the pVO2 increased from 28mmHg to 43mmHg. The EP remained between 81pg/ml and129pg/ml, the renin activity remained between 113ng/ml/hr and 136ng/ml/hr. Thus, during the ventricular assistance device system support there was a improvementin hemodynamic and neurohormonal conditions. The patient underwent successfulheart transplantation.
