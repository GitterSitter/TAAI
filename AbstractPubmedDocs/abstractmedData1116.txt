The most exciting goal inusing VADs and CSDs is to achieve reverse remodeling, suppression of remodelinggene programs, and activation of myocardial recovery programs, which will improveleft ventricular shape, size, and function. Long-term left VADs are effective,but recovery upon removal is uncommon. Passive CSDs (eg, Acorn devices) are very promising as long-term devices for therapy of end-stage heart failure andreversal of structural and biochemical remodeling. Expanding CSD use to includepreventing progressive adverse left ventricular remodeling after ST-segmentelevation myocardial infarction requires further study. The combination of cell- and/or matrix-based therapies with CSDs is under investigation.
