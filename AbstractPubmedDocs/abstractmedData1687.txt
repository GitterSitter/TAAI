Despite technical improvements,however, various complications are still reported for patients during mechanical support. We report our experience with intraventricular thrombolysis as atreatment for possible thrombosis of a continuous flow device that had beenimplanted as a bridge to heart transplantation. This approach has beendemonstrated to be both effective and safe.
