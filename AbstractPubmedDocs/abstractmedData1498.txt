A 68-year-old male had a Thoratec-Heartmate LVAD implanted asdestination therapy. After an uneventful (apart from early fever) recovery in theintensive care unit, the patient developed an intractable high temperature, andgeneralized sepsis and died 21 days following implant. The white cell blood countnever exceeded the guard limits, and the patient succumbed with severe LVAD valvemalfunction. At post-mortem examination friable material consisting of fungalhyphae was found on the inflow and outflow valves. According to publishedclinical trials, infection accounts for more than 40% of mortality in LVADsupported patients. Fungal LVAD endocarditis is a particularly deadly disease.Successful management requires a high level of suspicion and timely institutionof antifungal therapy to control the infection. This has led some authors torecommend empiric antifungal therapy in LVAD recipients with culture-negativesepsis unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics.
