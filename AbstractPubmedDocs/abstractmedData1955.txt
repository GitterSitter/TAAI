ASAIO J. 1996 Sep-Oct;42(5):M568-70.Exercise capacity recovers slowly but fully in patients with a left ventricularassist device.Nishimura M(1), Radovancevic B, Odegaard P, Myers T, Springer W, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Texas Heart Institute, Houston 77030, USA.Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are used increasingly as bridges tocardiac transplantation. The typical LVAD candidate is a bedridden, criticallyill, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV patient with congestive heartfailure (CHF) who is dependent upon intravenous, inotropic, and, in many cases,intra-aortic balloon support. The LVAD provides the potential for pre transplant rehabilitation by allowing the patient to become ambulatory, and by improvingmuscle tone, muscle mass, and nutritional status before transplantation. However,whether the abnormal exercise capacity of these patients improves afterimplantation has not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was toevaluate the exercise capacity of patients with CHF after LVAD implantation (n = 10) using peak oxygen consumption during maximal exercise (MVO2), and comparingthe results with those of a group of NYHA Class III patients with CHF (n = 14).After 2 months of implantation, MVO2 of the patients with LVAD was 12.8 +/- 0.3ml/kg/min, which was comparable to that of the NYHA Class III patients with CHF(12.5 +/- 0.5 ml/kg/min). Four of 10 patients with LVAD were monitored for morethan 5 months when MVO2 rose to 15.4 +/- 1.0 ml/kg/min (p < 0.05 vs NYHA ClassIII). In conclusion, the exercise capacity of patients with LVAD recovers slowly but significantly after 5 months of implantation, promising the potential forcomplete recovery from heart failure in patients supported with an LVAD.
