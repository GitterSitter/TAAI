J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1986 Dec;92(6):994-1004.Mechanical support of the circulation followed by cardiac transplantation.Pennock JL, Pierce WS, Campbell DB, Pae WE Jr, Davis D, Hensley FA, Richenbacher WE, Waldhausen JA.Improvements in both mechanical circulatory support devices and immune therapypromise a wider use of sequential mechanical support as a bridge to orthotopiccardiac transplantation. The intra-aortic balloon pump, the left and rightventricular assist pumps, and the pneumatic artificial heart represent the range of devices capable of keeping a patient alive who is awaiting a donor organ. The major difficulty in using circulatory support devices is infection, which iscaused by their required percutaneous tubes. We report here our experiences with mechanical circulatory support devices as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Ina series of 31 consecutive transplant procedures, six patients have requiredpreoperative mechanical circulatory support. The intra-aortic balloon pump wasused in two patients for 2 and 14 days, respectively, before transplantation.Both patients are well 10 and 11 months after the transplant procedure. Twopatients required the left ventricular assist device for 11 and 21 days and arealive 3 weeks and 8 months, respectively, after transplantation. One patient was supported by the pneumatic artificial heart for 10 days before a donor heartbecame available but died of septic shock 17 days after transplantation. A secondpatient received a pneumatic artificial heart 7 days after transplantation whenthe heart transplant failed. He has been in stable condition for 45 days but isrecovering from renal failure. Our early experiences indicate that either partialor total mechanical support as a bridge to transplantation is successful ifoverwhelming sepsis or renal failure can be avoided.
