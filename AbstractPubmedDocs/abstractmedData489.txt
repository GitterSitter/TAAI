Epub 2013 Feb 9.Impact of continuous-flow left ventricular assist device support on rightventricular function.Morgan JA(1), Paone G, Nemeh HW, Murthy R, Williams CT, Lanfear DE, Tita C,Brewer RJ.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart and Vascular Institute, Henry FordHospital, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA. jmorgan2@hfhs.orgBACKGROUND: Continuous-flow (CF) pumps have yielded improvements in short- andlong-term survival and quality of life, and have reduced the number of leftventricular assist device (LVAD)-related complications. However, their ability tounload the right ventricle (RV) and improve RV function has not been as clearlydefined. We evaluated the short- and mid-term effects of CF-LVADs on centralvenous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), pulmonary capillarywedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac index (CI), RV ejection fraction (RVEF), RVend-diastolic dimension (RVEDD), RV stroke work index (RVSWI), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR).METHODS: From March 2006 through June 2012, 130 patients with chronic heartfailure underwent implantation of a CF-LVAD (122 HeartMate II and 8 HeartWaredevices) as a bridge to transplant (n = 76) or as destination therapy (n = 54).Patients with pre-operative long-term LVADs (n = 4) and patients who underwentconcomitant tricuspid valve repairs during their LVAD implant (n = 21) wereexcluded from the analysis. Echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations ofthe remaining 105 patients were reviewed pre-operatively and at 1 and 6 monthspost-LVAD implantation.RESULTS: At 1 month post-LVAD implantation, CVP decreased from 12.4 ± 5.9 mm Hgto 8.7 ± 4.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001), systolic PAP decreased from 52.3 ± 14.1 mm Hg to 36.8 ± 11.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001), PCWP decreased from 23.0 ± 9.4 mm Hg to 12.9 ± 8.0mm Hg (p < 0.001), CI index increased from 1.8 ± 0.5 liters/min m2 to 2.4 ± 0.5liters/min m2 (p < 0.001), RVEF increased from 33.1 ± 4.9% to 40.4 ± 6.2% (p <0.001), RVEDD decreased from 36 mm to 31 mm (p = 0.020), RVSWI improved from408.6 ± 144.6 mm Hg ml m2 to 614.4 ± 196.2 mm Hg ml m2 (p < 0.001), and meanTAPSE increased from 1.1 ± 0.4 cm to 1.9 ± 0.4 cm (p = 0.004). Similarly,qualitative RV function on echocardiography improved from 57.1% moderately orseverely reduced pre-operatively to 38.1% at 1 month (p = 0.008). Severity of TR decreased from 11.4% moderate or severe pre-operatively to 4.8% at 1 month (p <0.001). These improvements were maintained at 6 months post-LVAD.CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support significantly decreased CVP and RVEDD, withconcomitant improvement in RV function, as measured by increases in RVEF, RVSWIand TAPSE, as well as improvements in the qualitative echocardiographicappearance of RV contractility and a reduction in TR.Copyright © 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
