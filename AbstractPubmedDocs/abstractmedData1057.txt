Hsugiki@aol.comPost-cardiotomy right ventricular failure is a serious complication thatfrequently results in adverse outcomes. We reviewed our experience with theImpella Recover RD (Impella Cardiosystems GMbH, Aachen, Germany). From January2007 to December 2007, 7 patients (5 males, 54 +7 years old) had this deviceimplanted for temporary support after heart transplantation in 4, after repeatmitral valve replacement in 2, and with a left ventricular assist device in 1.Devices were implanted during initial operation (n =5) or shortly thereafter (n=2). Six patients underwent implantation without cardiopulmonary bypass.Effective support with pump flows of 4.0-4.5 L x min(-1) and adequate unloading(central venous pressure decreased from 15.3 +/- 1.4 to 9.4 +/- 1.2 mm Hg) wasachieved in all patients. Patients were assisted for a mean duration of 4.9 +/-4.5 days. Three patients could be weaned after 7.0 +/- 5.6 days of support andunderwent device explantation without cardiopulmonary bypass. One of thesepatients died of recurrent right ventricular failure, 2 remained stable but died later of sepsis. The patient with a left ventricular assist device was switchedto an alternative device for prolonged support. Two patients experienced pumpdysfunction. Our preliminary experience shows that the Impella Recover RD is aneffective device that can be easily implanted and explanted. However, itsmechanical reliability needs to be improved.
