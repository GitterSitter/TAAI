In the UK, there was a significant reduction inheart transplantation rates over the last decade, so that transplantation fromVADs is much less frequent. The objective of this study was to determine outcomesand their predictors in this situation of low BTT rates, and as patients wereexposed to long-term support, the incidence and outcomes of VAD thrombosis.METHODS: We analysed outcomes for 102 consecutive patients between 2009 and 2013 (mean age 47 ± 13; VentrAssist n = 6 and HeartWare n = 96). The median durationof support was 462 ± 426 days.RESULTS: Survival rates on the device were 75 and 66% at 1 and 2 years,respectively. Older age and more acute INTERMACS groups were significantlyrelated to reduced survival within the first 90 days (P = 0.030 and 0.010,respectively). Poor preoperative right ventricular (RV) function had a negativeeffect on survival after 1 year (P = 0.009), though not earlier. VAD thrombosis(n = 24 HeartWare and n = 1 VentrAssist) occurred at 0.18 events per patient-yearfor HeartWare and 0.07 for VentrAssist devices at a median time of onset at 404 ±281 days. There was no significant effect of VAD thrombosis on survival. Only 14 of 102 patients were transplanted at a median of 334 ± 347 days, and only 3 were transplanted within the first 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation left ventricular assist device implants with a low rate of transplantation have similar survival to destination therapy, and aresusceptible to long-term complications of VAD thrombosis and right heart failure.© The Author 2014.
