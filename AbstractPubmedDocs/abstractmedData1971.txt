Z Kardiol. 1996;85 Suppl 4:61-8.[Acute and chronic mechanical circulatory support].[Article in German]Waldenberger FR(1), Laube HR, Konertz W.Author information: (1)Universitáatsklinikum Charité, Klinik für Herzchirurgie, Berlin.Mechanical circulatory support and mechanical unloading of the left ventriclebecome more and more routine in clinical treatment regimens of both acute andchronic heart failure. Along with increasing availability of different cardiacassist systems one can adjust the degree of support according to the clinicalsituation. We report about our experience in the period between January 1994 and May 1995 with following assist systems: Hemopump, centrifugal pumps, Medos,HIAVAD and Novacor. We implanted those devices in 21 patients out of followingindications: postinfarct--cardiac failure (CF), postcardiotomy CF, electivepostcardiotomy support, myocarditis CF and "bridge" to transplant. Ten patientssurvived the period of mechanical support and could be weaned successfully.Circulatory support was sufficient in all cases, indication, time ofimplantation, anticoagulation and prevention of infections are discussed.
