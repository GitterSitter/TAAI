We have previously found argininevasopressin to be a remarkably effective pressor in a variety of vasodilatoryshock states. We investigated the incidence and clinical predictors ofvasodilatory shock in a general population of cardiac surgical patients and theeffects of low-dose arginine vasopressin as treatment of this syndrome inpatients with heart failure.METHODS: Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (n = 145) were studiedprospectively. Preoperative ejection fraction, medications, and perioperativehemodynamics were recorded, and postbypass serum arginine vasopressin levels weremeasured. Vasodilatory shock was defined as a mean arterial pressure lower than70 mm Hg, a cardiac index greater than 2.5 L/min/m2, and norepinephrinedependence. Predictors of vasodilatory shock were investigated by logisticregression analysis. The hemodynamic responses of patients who received arginine vasopressin infusions for vasodilatory shock after cardiopulmonary bypass forleft ventricular assist device placement or heart transplantation were analyzedretrospectively.RESULTS: Eleven of 145 general cardiac surgery patients (8%) met criteria forpostbypass vasodilatory shock. By multivariate analysis, an ejection fractionlower than 0.35 and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use were independent predictors of postbypass vasodilatory shock (relative risks of 9.1 and 11.9,respectively). Vasodilatory shock was associated with inappropriately low serumarginine vasopressin concentrations (12.0 +/- 6.6 pg/mL). Retrospective analysis found 40 patients with postbypass vasodilatory shock who received low-dosearginine vasopressin infusions, resulting in increased mean arterial pressure anddecreased norepinephrine requirements.CONCLUSIONS: Low ejection fraction and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitoruse are risk factors for postbypass vasodilatory shock, and this syndrome isassociated with vasopressin deficiency. In patients exhibiting this syndromeafter high-risk cardiac operations, replacement of arginine vasopressin increasesblood pressure and reduces catecholamine pressor requirements.
