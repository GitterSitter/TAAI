ThisEuropean multicenter study analyzes the effect of partial mechanical support asbridge-to-transplant in a less sick heart failure patient group.METHODS: The CircuLite Synergy device is implanted via a small right-sidedthoracotomy with an inflow cannula in the left atrium and an outflow graftconnected to the right subclavian artery without the use of extracorporealcirculation. The pump itself sits in a "pacemaker" pocket subcutaneously in theright clavicular groove. It is able to pump up to 3.0 l/min and partially unload the left ventricle.RESULTS: The device was implanted in 25 patients on the cardiac transplantwaiting list (20 males), aged 55.5 +/- 9.6 yrs with an ejection fraction of 21.6 +/- 6.0 %, a mean arterial pressure of 73.5 +/- 8.5 mmHg, a pulmonary capillarywedge pressure of 27.2 +/- 7.8 mmHg and cardiac index of 1.9 +/- 0.4 l/min/m (2).Duration of support ranged from 6 to 238 days. Right heart catheterization showedsignificant hemodynamic improvement in the short- and intermediate-term afterimplantation with increases in arterial pressure from 72.6 +/- 11.0 to 79.4 +/-8.6 mmHg ( P = 0.04) and in cardiac index from 2.0 +/- 0.4 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 l/min/m(2) ( P = 0.003) with a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 28.5+/- 6.0 to 19.7 +/- 6.9 mmHg ( P = 0.012).CONCLUSIONS: The CircuLite Synergy device is a partial support pump, which iseasy to implant and which provides hemodynamic benefits in bridging heart failurepatients to cardiac transplant.(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York.
