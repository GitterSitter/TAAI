ASAIO Trans. 1989 Jul-Sep;35(3):730-3.The incidence of isolated left ventricular failure in bridge-to-transplantcandidates.Swartz MT(1), Pennington DG, Ruzevich SA, McBride LR, Miller LW, Reedy JE,Termuhlen DF.Author information: (1)University Hospital, St. Louis, MO 63110-0250.Twenty-one patients (pts) were supported with mechanical devices as a bridge tocardiac transplantation (Tx). Ventricular function was assessed by a combination of angiography, echocardiography, nuclear scans, hemodynamics, and visualinspection at the time of device insertion. Twelve pts had biventricular failure (BVF) and 11 received biventricular support with extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (two pts), biventricular assist devices (VAD) (eight pts), or anartificial heart (one pt). One BVF pt received a left VAD (LVAD) and drug supportfor severe right ventricular failure (RVF), which resolved after 48 hr. Theremaining nine pts had left ventricular failure (LVF), with only mild to moderateRVF, and received LVADs with minimal drugs. Eleven pts were tx, with ninesurvivors. A comparison of pts with LVF vs BVF revealed no differences in age,gender, device flows, duration of support, diagnosis, number tx, or numbersurvived. The incidence of LVF was 43% vs 57% BVF in bridge-to-transplant pts.LVAD support alone is often successful in pts with mild or moderate BVF, but israrely successful in pts with severe BVF.
