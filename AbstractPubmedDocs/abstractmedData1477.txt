In the present study weevaluated our first one-year experiences with this method for bridging patientsto cardiac transplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 2003 and May 2004, the Thoratec VAD (Thoratec,Pleasanton, CA, USA) was implanted in 6 patients ( males; age 28-61 years) as abridge-to-transplant procedure after having received maximum inotropic supportand who were at imminent risk of death. In all patients was performed VAD asbiventricular device (BiVAD). During a week after placement was observed recoveryof organs function in all patients. Five patients survived to hearttransplantation. One patient died 21 days after BiVAD placement due to massivebleeding to the respiratory tract. In post-transplantation period 1 patient died second day from acute graft failure and other patient died 34 days after fromintracranial bleeding. Three patients has been discharged from the hospital andthey are surviving more than I year.CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of our first experiences with the Thoratec BiVADimplantation as bridging to heart transplantation suggests that it is well suitedmethod with respect to long- term prognosis of this group of patients.
