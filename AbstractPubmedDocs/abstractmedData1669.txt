Organfailure induced by the addition of or an increase in immunosuppressive medicationis known to be a cause of the poor outcomes. Thus we tried a new therapeutictechnique that allows complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive medication, as thedonor heart is removed and circulatory support is maintained with a biventricularassist device.
