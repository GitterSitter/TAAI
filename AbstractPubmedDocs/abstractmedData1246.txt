ASAIO J. 2007 Nov-Dec;53(6):696-700.The pediatric mechanical circulatory support program in Innsbruck, Austria, andthe impact of such programs on lack of donor hearts in Europe.Schweigmann U(1), Antretter H, Mair P, Velik-Salchner C, Margreiter J, BrunnemannJ, Schermer E, Engl G, Hoermann C, Hoefer D, Kilo J, Laufer G, Stein JI, GeigerR, Rahmel A, Slot M, Cottogni M.Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics III-Pediatric Cardiology, Innsbruck MedicalUniversity, Innsbruck, Austria.Strategy and results of the Innsbruck Mechanical Circulatory Support Program are presented, and the impact of such programs on pediatric heart transplantation(HTX) in Europe is discussed. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(vaECMO) and ventricular assist devices (VADs) were used in 21 pediatric patients(median age 3.3 years, 2 days to 17 years) for acute heart failure (AHF)following a bridge or bridge-to-bridge strategy. Twelve patients were treatedwith vaECMO: eight were weaned after 2-10 days, two died, and two were switchedto a VAD. Of the last, one was weaned 47 days later and the other underwent HTX168 days later. In nine patients, VAD was implanted without preceding vaECMO. Onesuch patient died (cerebral hemorrhage) after 236 days; of the remaining eightpatients three were weaned and five underwent HTX. Waiting time for HTX(high-urgency status) varied from 4 to 372 days. Fifteen patients were discharged(follow up: 2-74 months); 14 are doing very well (New York Heart Association(NYHA) Functional Classification Class I, neurologically normal), whereas onesuffers from severe neurologic damage, presumably from resuscitation beforevaECMO. Data from Eurotransplant on pediatric HTX in 2004, 2005, and 2006 (33,49, and 34 transplanted hearts, respectively; recipients <16 years of age) arediscussed. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) substantially improves survivalwith AHF in pediatric patients. Medium-term support (up to 400 days in ourpatients) is possible and outcome of survivors is excellent. Wide spread use ofMCS might slightly aggravate the lack of donor organs, which could result inlonger support times.
