Expert Rev Med Devices. 2006 Nov;3(6):749-53.US FDA perspective on regulatory issues affecting circulatory assist devices.Sapirstein W(1), Chen E, Swain J, Zuckerman B.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Devices, Office of Device Evaluation, Center forDevices and Radiological Health, US FDA, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.wys@cdrh.fda.govThere has been a rapid development in mechanical circulatory support systems inthe decade since the US FDA first approved a mechanical device to provide thecirculatory support lacking from a failing heart. Devices are presently approved for marketing by the FDA to replace a failing ventricle, the Ventricular AssistDevice or the entire heart, Total Artificial Heart. Contemporaneous with, andpermitted by, improvement in technology and design, devices have evolved fromunits located extracorporeally to paracorporeal systems and totally implanteddevices. Clinical studies have demonstrated a parallel improvement in thehomeostatic adequacy of the circulatory support provided. Thus, while thecirculatory support was initially tolerated for short periods to permit recovery of cardiac function, this technology eventually provided effective circulatorysupport for increasing periods that permitted the FDA to approve devices forbridging patients in end-stage cardiac failure awaiting transplant and eventuallya device for destination therapy where patients in end-stage heart failure arenot cardiac transplant candidates. The approved devices have relied ondisplacement pumps that mimic the pulsatility of the physiological system.Accelerated development of more compact devices that rely on alternative pumpmechanisms have challenged both the FDA and device manufacturers to assure thatthe regulatory requirements for safety and effectiveness are met for use ofmechanical circulatory support systems in expanded target populations. An FDAregulatory perspective is reviewed of what can be a potentially criticalhealthcare issue.
