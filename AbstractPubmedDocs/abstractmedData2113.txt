The first 2 patients died of multisystem organfailure while on support. All the remaining patients survived the support period,and actuarial survival after transplantation was 100% at 6 months and 89% at 1year. In no patient did bacterial infection develop during support or aftertransplantation. Right ventricular ejection fraction before implantation of theleft ventricular assist system was lower than 15% in 6 of 8 patients, yet itincreased twofold during left ventricular support. The need for excessiveinotropic support (2 patients) or temporary (four days) mechanical rightventricular support (2 patients) while on the left ventricular support systemappeared to be related to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance during supportin association with large preimplantation ventricular volumes. It appears thateven patients with compromised right ventricular performance can be supportedlong term with a left ventricular assist device. Patients with elevated pulmonaryvascular resistance may require temporary right ventricular support.
