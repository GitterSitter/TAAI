Epub 2008Dec 3.Incremental value of renal function in risk prediction with the Seattle HeartFailure Model.Giamouzis G(1), Kalogeropoulos AP, Georgiopoulou VV, Agha SA, Rashad MA, LaskarSR, Smith AL, Butler J.Author information: (1)Center for Heart Failure Therapy, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.BACKGROUND: Impaired renal function portends poor heart failure (HF) outcomes.The Seattle Heart Failure Score (SHFS), a multimarker risk assessment tool,however does not incorporate renal function. In this study, we assessed theincremental value of renal function over the SHFS in patients with advanced HF oncontemporary optimal treatment.METHODS: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (sCr), BUN/sCr ratio, andestimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed in survival models with SHFSas the base model among 443 patients with HF (52 +/- 12 years, male 68.5%, white 52.4%, ejection fraction 0.18 +/- 0.08). Incremental value of renal function was assessed by changes in the likelihood ratio chi(2) and the area under thereceiver operating characteristic curves for 1-, 2-, and 3-year event prediction.RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 21 months, 108 (24.5%) of 443 patients had an event (death [n = 92], urgent transplantation [n = 13], or ventricular assist device implantation [n = 3]). All renal parameters individually were associatedwith outcome (BUN, P < .001; sCr, P < .001; BUN/sCr ratio, P = .006; andestimated glomerular filtration rate, P = .006); however, only BUN was anindependent predictor of events in multivariable analyses. Addition of BUNimproved the predictive ability of SHFS (Deltalikelihood ratio chi(2) 5.03, P =.025); however, the increase in the area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve was marginal (year 1, 0.786 to 0.791; year 2, 0.732 to0.741; year 3, 0.745 to 0.754; all P > .2).CONCLUSION: Among the various renal function parameters, BUN had the strongestassociation with outcomes in patients with advanced HF. However, the incremental value of renal function over the SHFS for risk determination was marginal.
