Omega (Westport). 2013;67(1-2):161-6.Improving end-of-life care for ventricular assist devices (VAD) patients: paradoxor protocol?*.McGonigal P(1).Author information: (1)Aurora Health Care, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53207, USA. peg.mcgonigal@aurora.orgWhen a person consents to have a ventricular assist device (VAD) implanted inone's heart, the intention is to extend life toward a new heart or toward moretime. Complications may develop followed by frequent hospital admissions-mostoften in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting-rendering a transplant a distantreality and to discontinue the device means certain death. Emotional support for patient and family is critical. Regardless of the original goal for the device,palliative care provides assistance in communication, goal setting, and symptommanagement and yet its consultation is often more for brink-of-death care thanend-of-life care provided at the time of diagnosis of a life-threatening disease such as heart failure. This study examined the recent deaths of hospitalizedpatients with VADs and the use of the palliative care service. Understanding the benefit and timing of palliative care for VAD patients-particularly in the ICUsetting--may improve the end-of-life experience for patients, families, andhealthcare providers.
