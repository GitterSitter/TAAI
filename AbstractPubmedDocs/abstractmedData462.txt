Epub 2013 Apr 5.Neurological complications during pulsatile ventricular assistance with theBerlin Heart EXCOR in children: incidence and risk factors.Polito A(1), Netto R, Soldati M, Brancaccio G, Grutter G, Amodeo A, Ricci Z,Morelli S, Cogo P.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery and , Bambino Gesú PediatricHospital, Rome, Italy.The aim of this study is to describe the incidence of brain injury (BI) inchildren with end-stage cardiac failure who were supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation.Between January 2002 and January 2012, all patients <18 years of age whounderwent the implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR at Bambino Gesú Children'sHospital were included. A total of 25 patients were included in this study.Median age and weight at implantation were 22.4 months (range 3.6-154.2) and10 kg (range 4.5-36), respectively. Diagnosis included cardiomyopathy (n = 20)and congenital heart disease (n = 5). Eleven patients received atrialcannulation. Nine patients underwent biventricular assist device support. Sevenpatients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before the implantation ofthe EXCOR VAD. Median duration of VAD support was 51 days (range 2-167). Ninepatients had evidence of acute BI including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 5) andcerebral ischemia (n = 4). Freedom from BI at 30, 60, and 90 days from VADimplantation was 80.7, 69.9, and 43.3%, respectively. Weight <10 kg atimplantation was significantly associated with BI. BI is a frequent complication among children supported with EXCOR VAD and is associated with lower weight atimplantation. However, our data do not support the association between size andBI. Future prospective multicenter studies are warranted to further helpunderstand the etiology and the impact of BI and to improve functional outcomesfor children undergoing EXCOR VAD mechanical support.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs.
