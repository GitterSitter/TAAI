Initially designed to be a bridge totransplantation, MCS also has proven itself as a durable therapy for patients whoare not transplant candidates. As outcomes for patients with MCS have improved,research interest in device development has flourished, with many new devicetypes under investigation. In addition to improvement of MCS devices,investigational work continues to achieve appropriate patient selection andcomplication management.PMCID: PMC2970816
