It has beenincreasingly recognized that there is a rapidly expanding population of children diagnosed and living with heart failure. This expanding population has resultedin increasing numbers of children with medically resistant end-stage heartfailure. The traditional therapy for these children has been hearttransplantation. However, children with heart failure unlike adults do not havesymptoms until they present with end-stage heart failure and therefore, cannotsafely wait for transplantation. Many of these children were bridged to hearttransplantation utilizing extracorporeal membranous oxygenation as a bridge totransplant which has yielded poor results. As such, industry, clinicians, and thegovernment have refocused interest in developing increasing numbers of MCSoptions for children living with heart failure as a bridge to transplantation andas a chronic therapy. In this review, we discuss MCS options for short andlong-term support that are currently available for infants and children withend-stage heart failure.PMCID: PMC3868686
