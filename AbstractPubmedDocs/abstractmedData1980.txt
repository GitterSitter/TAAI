Left ventricular assist systems was performed in most cases (82.6%). Thepredominant indication was failure to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass(65.8%). The duration of ventricular assist system application ranged from 1 hourto 70 days, and the mean was 7.3 days, excluding the patients withcardiomyopathy. The weaning rate was 48.8% and the survival rate was 25.6%. Main causes of death were heart failure including unrecoverable heart failure andmultiple organ failure. In 12 cardiomyopathy patients, Toyobo pumps were applied as left ventricular assist systems. Support duration was from 13 days to 192 days(ongoing). One patient was bridged to transplantation successfully and 1 wasweaned after 3 months of support.CONCLUSIONS: From these data, the Toyobo pump and the Zeon pump are useful forshort-term support for acute, profound heart failure. The Toyobo pump also mayprovide sufficient support as a bridge to transplantation for the medium term.
