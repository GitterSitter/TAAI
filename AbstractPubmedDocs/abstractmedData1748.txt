A panel of cardiacsurgeons addressed the use of these devices in 4 patients. Cardiogenic shockafter mitral valve replacement was considered best served by a left ventricularassist device (VAD) with apical rather than atrial cannulation. A left VAD shouldbe placed first and a right VAD only if needed. Acute myocardial infarction shockwas considered best treated with a left VAD with left ventricular cannulation to avoid thrombosis. If cardiac transplantation is an option, a long-term devicemust be considered. Young patients with acute fulminant myocarditis should beimplanted with VADs in anticipation of recovery, and transplantation should bedelayed. Patients with severe heart failure after coronary bypass grafting wereconsidered best served by an extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system or a VAD. Current postcardiotomy survival rates of postcardiotomy patients of 20% to40% are worthwhile, but can be improved. Temporary devices such as ECMO can bechanged to more long-term devices when necessary.
