The purpose of this study was to compare waitlist mortality andsurvival for ECMO versus ventricular assist device (VAD) support. A review wasconducted of all patients listed for heart transplantation (HTx) since 2002 andrequiring mechanical support. VAD support has been available from 2004 (BerlinHeart Excor Pediatrics). Competing risks analysis was used to model survival toone of four outcomes (HTx, death on waitlist, delisting, improvement). Thirty-sixpatients were on mechanical support while awaiting HTx (21 ECMO, 12 VAD, threeboth). Median age at listing was 1.2 years (birth-16.6 years) for ECMO and 11.3years (0.3-14.6 years) for VAD. Diagnosis was cardiomyopathy in 33% for ECMO and 93% for VAD. Median time to HTx was 37 days (1-930) overall, 20 days (1-85) forECMO, and 39 days (5-108) for VAD. Mechanical support was associated withincreased odds of HTx (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [1.7-3.3], P < 0.0001) but alsodelisting or death waiting (HR 3.0 [1.1-7.8], P = 0.03). Waitlist mortality of38% on ECMO was reduced to 13% with VAD use. Survival post-HTx to hospitaldischarge was better in the group on VAD support (92 vs. 80%). Pediatric patientsrequiring mechanical support as a bridge to HTx have short wait times but highwaitlist mortality. Those patients who survived to be put on the Berlin HeartExcor Pediatric device based on individualized clinical decision making then had a lower waitlist mortality, a longer duration of support, and a higher survivalto transplantation and hospital discharge.© 2010, Copyright the Authors.
