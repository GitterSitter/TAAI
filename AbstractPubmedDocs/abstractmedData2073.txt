Technically, this procedure consists of placing the left LDM flap around the heart via a window created bypartial resection of the 2nd or 3rd rib, and subsequent muscle electrostimulationin synchrony with ventricular systole. The aim of cardiomyoplasty is to supportventricular function in ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathies, or to partiallyreplace the ventricular myocardium after large aneurysm or tumor resections. Our clinical experience at Broussais Hospital involves 44 patients. The functionalclass and quality of life improved after cardiomyoplasty. Improvement of theventricular performance and limitation of cardiac dilatation were demonstratedover the long-term. The actuarial survival at 6 years was 71%. Risk factorsinfluencing perioperative mortality were: age > 65 years, associated surgicalprocedures, pulmonary vascular hypertension, and patients hemodynamicallyunstable or on inotropic drug support. Preoperative risk factors influencing the long-term mortality were: permanent NYHA functional class 4, cardiothoracic ratio> 0.60, LV ejection fraction < 15%, bi-ventricular heart failure, and atrialfibrillation. Cardiomyoplasty does not preclude the use of future orthotopicheart transplantation.
