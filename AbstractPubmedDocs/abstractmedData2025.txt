J Heart Lung Transplant. 1994 Mar-Apr;13(2):268-70.Temporary left-sided mechanical cardiac support during acute myocarditis.Kesler KA(1), Pruitt AL, Turrentine MW, Heimansohn DA, Brown JW.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis.Acute myocarditis is usually a self-limiting viral illness. Rarely, however,myocardial depression can be profound leading to circulatory collapse. Mechanicalcardiac support in the form of intraaortic balloon pumps or ventricular assistdevices have been used in these unusual cases to maintain systemic perfusionuntil transplantation or left ventricular recovery occurs. We report a youngpatient with acute myocarditis who required left heart mechanical support andwho, however, was successfully weaned despite only minimal myocardial recovery.
