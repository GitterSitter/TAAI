SamuelsLE@aol.comBACKGROUND: The Thoratec Implantable Ventricular Assist Device (IVAD) is the onlyFDA-approved intracorporeal biventricular cardiac assist device. It is atitanium-coated version of its predecessor, the Paracorporeal Ventricular Assist Device (PVAD). The blood pump is compatible with the portable TLC-II driver,making home discharge feasible.METHODS: Nine consecutive patients were implanted with the IVAD from June 2005through March 2006. The indications for support were acute heart failure in 6cases and chronic heart failure in 3 cases. All patients were managed withmaximal medical therapies including intravenous inotropic drugs prior to implant.RESULTS: All patients survived the surgical implant. Six patients were consideredsuccessful: 3 patients discharged to home and subsequently receivedtransplantation, 2 are awaiting transplantation (1 at home and 1 in-house), and 1patient was successfully explanted. Three patients expired postoperativelybecause of multiple organ system failure (2 patients) and pulmonary hemorrhage (1patient). There were no device malfunctions. There was 1 localized driveline siteinfection and 1 thromboembolic event with partial visual loss.CONCLUSIONS: The IVAD is a unique device capable of providing uni- orbi-ventricular support for either acute or chronic heart failure conditions. Its versatility permits bridge to transplant or recovery options. Home discharge isfeasible.
