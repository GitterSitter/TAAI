It was shown thatearly intervention with this device can provide substantial benefits to patients with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-support LVAD. However,as it can be inserted via small incisions with no need for sternotomy orcardiopulmonary bypass, it might be beneficial for selected high-risk patients.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Synergy Micro-pump inpatients in INTERMACS class 1-2. From February 2012 to August 2013, 13 patientswith severe heart failure were supported with the Synergy Pocket Micro-pump.Patients were divided into two groups according to INTERMACS class: the high-riskgroup (INTERMACS class 1-2) and the low-risk group (INTERMACS class 3-4). Therewere seven patients in INTERMACS class 1-2 and six in INTERMACS class 3-4.Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and postoperative outcomeswere compared. There were no statistically significant differences in patientdemographics, and mean support time was 108 ± 114 days in the high-risk group and238 ± 198 days in the low-risk group. Also, there were no significant differencesin perioperative characteristics or in the rate of postoperative adverse events. The overall survival was comparable between the two groups (one late death ineach group, log-rank P = 0.608). Two patients from the high-risk group wereupgraded to a full-support LVAD (P = 0.462) after 65 ± 84.9 days of mean support.One patient from the high-risk group and two patients from the low-risk groupwere successfully transplanted (P = 0.559). The use of the Synergy Micro-pump in INTERMACS 1-2 patients is feasible and is associated with similar postoperativeoutcome as in patients in INTERMACS 3-4. Carefully selected patients with severe heart failure could benefit due to the small size of the pump; however, furtherstudies and medium-term follow-up are required.Copyright © 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantationand Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
