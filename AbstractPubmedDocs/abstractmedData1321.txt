We undertook successful mononuclear cell transplantation in a patient who sustained an acute myocardial infarction that had resulted in the LVAD therapy.The heart regained good function after cell transplantation, and the LVAD wasexplanted 6 weeks later. These results suggest that this novel therapy could bean alternative to cardiac transplantation for severe ischemic heart failure.
