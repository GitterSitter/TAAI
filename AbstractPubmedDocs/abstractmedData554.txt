Myocardial recovery ismore evident in recent onset nonischemic cardiomyopathy (ROCM); however, theprevalence of BTR in this subset has not been addressed.METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the use of LVAD support for subjects with ROCMin the Intervention in Myocarditis and Acute Cardiomyopathy 2 (IMAC2) study. The overall cohort (n = 373) was 38% female, 21% black, with a mean age of 45 ± 14years. LVAD support was used in 3.8% (n = 14, 43% female, age 32 ± 10). Of LVADsubjects, 57% (8/14) were BTR, including 73% (8/11) of subjects with symptoms ≤4 months at the time of support. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD)was smaller in BTR than nonrecovered (NR) subjects (P = .04). Myocardialinflammation was more common in BTR (75% versus 0%, P = .005), whereas fibrosiswas less evident (25% versus 100%, P = .005). Of BTR subjects, 7/8 (87.5%) werealive and free of transplant with median follow-up of 19 months.CONCLUSION: In a multicenter registry of ROCM, BTR was common and occurred in themajority of subjects requiring LVAD support. Histology and LVEDD may assist inpredicting potential for BTR in ROCM.Copyright © 2012. Published by Elsevier Inc.
