The CUPID 2 (Calcium Up-Regulation by PercutaneousAdministration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease Phase 2b) trial is designed to evaluate whether increasing SERCA2a activity via gene therapy improves clinicaloutcome in these patients.BACKGROUND: Intracoronary delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype1 (AAV1)/SERCA2a improves intracellular Ca(2+) handling by increasing SERCA2aprotein levels and, as a consequence, restores systolic and diastolic function.In a previous phase 2a trial, this therapy improved symptoms, functional status, biomarkers, and left ventricular function, and reduced cardiovascular events inadvanced heart failure patients.METHODS: CUPID 2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter, randomized event-driven study in up to 250 patients withmoderate-to-severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New YorkHeart Association functional class II to IV symptoms despite optimal therapy.Enrolled patients will be at high risk for recurrent heart-failurehospitalizations by virtue of having elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriureticpeptide/BNP (>1,200 pg/ml, or >1,600 pg/ml if atrial fibrillation is present)and/or recent heart failure hospitalization. The primary endpoint oftime-to-recurrent event (heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presenceof terminal events [all-cause death, heart transplant, left ventricular assistdevice implantation or ambulatory worsening heart failure]) will be assessedusing the joint frailty model. This ongoing trial is expected to completerecruitment in 2014, with the required number of 186 recurrent events estimatedto occur by mid 2015.RESULTS: Available data indicate that calcium up-regulation by AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy is safe and of potential benefit in advanced heart failure patients.CONCLUSIONS: The CUPID 2 trial is designed to study the effects of this therapyon clinical outcome in these patients.
