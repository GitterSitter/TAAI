Inacute situation, ECMO allows stabilization of unstable hemodynamic situationrelated to cardiogenic shock. In patients who require longer term support, theuse of continuous flow pumps is associated with better survival and betterquality of life. Those pumps can be used either as a bridge to transplantation oras a bridge to recovery but also as destination therapy. Early implantationbefore occurrence of severe right heart failure allows preferential use of LVAD. Approximately 350 cardiac transplantations are performed every year in France.Indication in based on several criteria appreciating the severity of functionalimpairment. Contra-indications have to be discussed case by case, and chronologicage should not be a too rigid limit. High urgency list allows transplanting thesickest patients in priority. Conditional half-life in patients surviving thefirst year post transplantation is 12 years. Mechanical circulatory support andcardiac transplantation should be used as complementary treatment of severe heartfailure in order to avoid progressive but sometime irreversible deterioration of patients with chronic heart failure.
