Prior to LVAD implantation, all patients received inotropes, and 25 patients (24%) received PCPS because of cardiogenic shock.Postoperatively, there were no early mortalities within 30 days after surgery,and patients survived on LVAD for 560±391 days, of whom 9 patients recovered and 32 underwent heart transplantation after 711±360 days of LVAD support. Morepatients with preoperative PCPS required nitric oxide inhalation and prolongedinotropic support to maintain adequate LVAD flow. In addition, bilirubin level at1 month after LVAD implantation was significantly higher in patients withpreoperative PCPS. Cox regression analysis identified preoperative PCPS supportas the only significant predictor for death after LVAD implantation and overallsurvival was significantly better in patients without preoperative PCPS.CONCLUSIONS: Despite adequate hemodynamic support after LVAD implantation,patients with preoperative PCPS had significantly worse survival. LVAD should be used for patients with end-stage heart failure, before PCPS is required forhemodynamic support.
