Discussion includes the etiology, diagnosis, andmanagement of fungal infection complications related with long-term mechanicalcirculatory support. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasinglyused as bridge to transplant and permanent long-term therapy in the populationwith end-stage heart failure. Even though better clinical outcomes have beenachieved with the newer-generation continuous-flow devices, infectioncomplications are still a major risk for patients with continuous-flow LVADimplantation in long-term follow-up [Ann Thorac Surg 90:1270-1277, 2010].Device-related infections can be categorized as driveline infections, pump-pocketinfections, and LVAD-associated endocarditis [Expert Rev Med Devices 8: 627-634, 2011]. The microbiological profile is very heterogeneous; the most commonpathogens are Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus species, and Candida.Severe fungal infection may lead to dysfunction of the LVAD due to obstructivemass formation within the device. Due to the only anecdotal reports in thecurrent literature, we present a very rare case of outflow fungal infectiousthrombus formation leading to outflow cannula obstruction in patient with LVAD.PMCID: PMC3996051
