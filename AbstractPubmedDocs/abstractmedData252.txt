The location and severity of driveline failures and their association with adverse clinicaloutcomes were examined. Also, the effect of design modifications was evaluated.RESULTS: Between 2004 and October 2012, 12,969 HeartMate II pumps were implanted worldwide. The incidence of percutaneous lead dysfunction was 1,418 eventsoccurring in 1,198 pumps (9.2% of pumps) over a cumulative support period of13,932 patient-years (maximum, 8 years). Lead failure was mostly in theexternalized part of the cable (87.2%). Lead dysfunction was managed by clamshellreinforcement of the external connector strain relief or by tape or siliconecable reinforcement in 76% of cases. Mortality or significant morbidity,including pump exchange or urgent transplant, or more complex cable repairoccurred in 2.3% of all implanted pumps. The cumulative incidence of leadfailures leading to major adverse clinical events has decreased with two leaddesign revisions: at 18 months postimplantation, the incidence was 6.2%±1.2% for the original design versus 2.2%±0.5% for the latest design change introduced in2010 (log-rank p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Lead failures remain an important factor in the durability of leftventricular assist devices during long-term support. Most lead failures in theHeartMate II occurred in the externalized portion of the driveline, suggestinglead fatigue. The incidence of both internal and external lead failures hasdiminished since 2004 with improvements in lead design.Copyright © 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
