The indication for heart transplantation wascardiomyopathy/myocarditis in 66 (69.5%) of children and congenital heart diseasein 29 (30.5%) patients.RESULTS: Congenital heart disease was diagnosed more often in group 2 than ingroup 1 (p = 0.047). The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, weight and parameters of preoperative liver and kidney function (except for aspartate aminotransferase activity, p = 0.020). The mean waiting time fortransplantation was 64.2 + or - 87.4 days (range 1-443 days) and did not differbetween the groups. The mean follow-up was 6.8 + or - 5.4 years (range 1 day-17.6years). Mortality during long-term follow-up was 9.1% (n = 1) in group 1 and20.2% (n=17) in group 2 (p = 0.632). We found no significant differences inpostoperative ventilatory support time (p = 0.773), duration of hospital stay (p = 0.853), and incidence of acute rejection episodes (p = 0.575).CONCLUSIONS: The use of VAD as a bridge to heart transplantation in children withsevere heart failure had no negative effect on treatment outcomes.
