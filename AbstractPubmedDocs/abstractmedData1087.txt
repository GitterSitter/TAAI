The purpose of thisstudy was to document changes in the cognitive performance of patients with thecontinuous-flow HeartMate II LVAD as a bridge to transplant (BTT).METHODS: A NC protocol was used to evaluate patient performance at 1, 3 and 6months after LVAD implantation at 11 centers. A total of 239 test sessions werecompleted in 93 patients including paired evaluations in 51 to 57 patients from 1to 3 months, and in 20 to 28 patients with results from 1, 3 and 6 months. FiveNC domains were assessed, including visual spatial perception, auditory andvisual memory, executive functions, language and processing speed.RESULTS: There were statistically significant (p < 0.05), but limitedimprovements between 1, 3 and 6 months in NC domain performances as seen invisual memory, executive functions, visual spatial perception and processingspeed. There were no significant declines in any neurocognitive test in anydomain over these time periods.CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive performance of advanced heart failure patientsremained stable or showed slight improvements from Month 1 to Month 6 ofcontinuous-blood-flow support with the HeartMate II LVAD.
