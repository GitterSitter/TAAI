The scarcity of the goldstandard therapy, heart transplantation, demands novel therapeutic approaches.For patients awaiting transplantation, ventricular-assist devices have been ofgreat benefit on survival. To allow explantation of the assist device and obviateheart transplantation, sufficient and durable myocardial recovery is necessary.However, explant rates so far are low. Combining mechanical circulatory supportwith regenerative therapies such as cell (-based) therapy and biomaterials might give rise to improved long-term results. Although synergistic effects aresuggested with mechanical support and stem cell therapy, evidence in bothpreclinical and clinical setting is lacking. This review focuses on advanced and innovative strategies for the treatment of end-stage HF and furthermore appraisesclinical experience with combined strategies.PMCID: PMC4387859
