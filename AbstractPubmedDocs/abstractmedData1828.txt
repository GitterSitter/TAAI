RVADuse was significantly higher in younger patients, female patients, smallerpatients, and myocarditis patients. There was no significant difference in thecardiac index, RV ejection fraction, or right atrial pressure between the twogroups preoperatively. The preoperative mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP)and RV stroke work index (RV SWI) were significantly lower in the RVAD group (p =0.015 and p = 0.011, respectively). Survival to transplant was poor in the RVADgroup (27%) and was 83% in the no-RVAD group.CONCLUSIONS: The need for perioperative RVAD support was low, only 11%.Preoperative low PAP and low RV SWI were significant risk factors for RVAD use.
