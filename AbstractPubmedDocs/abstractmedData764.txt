Part I: Exercise therapy.Corr√† U(1), Pistono M, Mezzani A, Gnemmi M, Tarro Genta F, Caruso R, Giannuzzi P.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Salvatore Maugeri Foundation, IRCCS, Veruno (NO),Italy. ugo.corra@fsmIn the present context of an aging population, limited donor heart availability, improved reliability of mechanical cardiac support and improved patient outcomes,ventricular assist device (VAD) options to support end-stage heart failurepatients are rapidly expanding. In addition, both the smaller size and lighterweight of the pumps now produced and early evidence that these third generationdevices may be associated with lower risk of infection and right ventricularfailure will probably lead to greater physician and patient acceptability. Thisis the first of a two-part review on the role of cardiovascular prevention andrehabilitation in patients with VAD. In this first part, we will discuss the roleof exercise therapy in VAD patients, while the second will focus on long-termmanagement. One of the prerequisites for use of a VAD--whether permanent (asdestination therapy) or semi-permanent (as an alternative to hearttransplantation)--is that exercise capacity, although not normal, must beadequate for daily life activities. An intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitationprogram has the potential to increase exercise performance and improve thequality of life of VAD patients. Both early progressive mobilization and exercisetraining may improve the overall condition of VAD patients, and favorably impact their clinical course.
