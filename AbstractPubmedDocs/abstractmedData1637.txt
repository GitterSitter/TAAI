Changes in techniques and concepts.Implication of anesthesia/resuscitation on patient management. Retrospectivestudy on 159 cases].[Article in French]Estanove S(1), Bastien O, Flamens C.Author information: (1)Service d'Anesthésie-Réanimation, Hôpital Cardio-vasculaire et PneumologiqueLouis Pradel, BP Lyon-Montchat, 69394 Lyon, France.Since the first case in 1987, 159 patients underwent heart mechanical assistdevice as a bridge to transplantation or as potential post transplanted recovery (right ventricular failure or graft failure) or in case of unsuccessful weaningof cardiopulmonary bypass. Survival rate of patients under assist device waiting either for heart transplantation or for functional recovery was 75.4%. 67.7% ofthem were transplanted (1 year survival rate 63%). Improvement of cardiac assist device technology and new method of intensive care allowed the observation of 6myocardial recovery without transplantation 4 after more than 3 weeks of cardiac support. The increase in cardiac assist duration (mean duration = 103 days in2001) because of organ shortage, led to a change in patients medical care.Unexpected interactions between cardiac treatments and anaesthetic drugs shouldlead anaesthetists to a better understanding of the failing heartpathophysiology. Consequently, anaesthetists well conduct appropriatelyanaesthesia and perioperative monitoring. Technical and conceptual evolutionshould allow some patient, to come back home and to fully recover without theneed of transplantation.
