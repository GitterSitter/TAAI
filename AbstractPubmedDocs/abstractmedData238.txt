In addition, females have been underrepresented in mostmulticenter randomized controlled trials for mechanical circulatory support(MCS). The objective of our study was to analyze our experience implanting 130continuous-flow LVADs and to determine the impact of sex on survival. Weidentified 130 patients who underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD atour institution. Patients were stratified into two groups based on sex. Variableswere compared using two-sided t-tests, Ï‡(2) tests, Cox proportional hazardsmodels, and log-rank tests to determine whether there was a difference betweenthe two groups and if sex was a significant independent predictor of outcome. Of the 130 patients, 35 were females and 95 were males. Female patients had worsepre-LVAD cardiac output and cardiac index and were more likely to be on MCS atthe time of implantation. Male patients had worse renal function. Survival wasanalogous for both cohorts with 30 day, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year survivals of 97%, 90.8%, 90.8%, and 84.3%, respectively, for female patients versus 94.7%,87.9%, 78.4%, and 72.8%, respectively, for male patients. The incidence of other LVAD-related complications was also similar in both groups. Gender did notpredict postoperative mortality on univariate analysis. Contrary to mostpublished reports, female and male LVAD patients have similar postoperative andmidterm survival, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and postoperativecomplications. It appears that females have gained more benefit from newergeneration devices compared to males.PMCID: PMC3942347
