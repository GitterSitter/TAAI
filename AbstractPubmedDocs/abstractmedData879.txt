Survival freefrom heart transplant or ventricular assist device and overall survival werecompared using the Social Security Death Index. A patient cohort who underwentunsuccessful CRT implantation and received a standard defibrillator (SD; n = 94) comprised a comparison group. Propensity score analysis was used to control forintergroup baseline differences.RESULTS: Compared with the other cohorts, II patients had more comorbidities.Both survival endpoints differed significantly (P < .001) among the 4 cohorts; IIpatients demonstrated shorter survival than NI patients, with the PI and SDgroups having intermediate survival. After adjusting for propensity scores,overall differences and patterns in survival endpoints persisted (P < .01), butthe only statistically significant pairwise difference was overall survivalbetween the NI and II groups at 12 months (hazard ratio 2.95, 95% confidenceinterval 1.05-8.35). CRT recipients ever on inotropes (PI and II) and SD patientsever requiring inotropes (n = 17) experienced similar survival endpoints. AmongII patients, predictors of hospital discharge free from inotropes after CRTincluded male gender, older age, and ability to tolerate β-blockade.CONCLUSIONS: Inotrope-dependent HF patients show significantly worse survivaldespite CRT than inotrope-naïve patients, in part because of more comorbidconditions at baseline. CRT may not provide a survival advantage over a standard defibrillator among patients who have received inotropes before CRT. Weaning frominotropes and initiating neurohormonal antagonists before CRT should be animportant goal among inotrope-dependent HF patients.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
