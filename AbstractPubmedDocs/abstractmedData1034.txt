Epub 2009 Oct 10.Low-cost pulsatile cardiac assist device with compliant input chamber.del Cañizo J(1), Rodríguez-Martínez D, Perez-Caballero R, Quintana B,Ruiz-Fernandez M.Author information: (1)Unidad de Medicina y Cirugia Experimental, Hospital General UniversitarioGregorio Marañon, Madrid, Spain. canizo@mce.hggm.esWe propose a new, low-cost pulsatile ventricular assist device (VAD) forshort-term applications. The new device could prove very useful in emergencyventricular failure in which patient survival is not assured. In these cases, thedevice allows ventricular function to be maintained as the patient's situation isevaluated and a decision is made on whether to perform a heart transplant or toreplace the device with a long-term VAD. The device has a pneumatic tubular bloodchamber, clip valves over the cannulae, and a compliant input chamber thatimproves filling of the pump. Clip valves and all other functions of the deviceare controlled by means of a computerized console. The use of clip valves reducesthe cost of the disposable part of the device.
