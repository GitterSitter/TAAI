The LVAD dysfunction is a recognized complication. To date, no studies have defined the role oftransthoracic echocardiography in evaluating long-term mechanical complicationsof chronic LVAD support.METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiography was used in a protocol designed to detectthe common types of mechanical malfunction. Patients were followed up with serialechocardiograms, and clinical validations were made with findings from acatheter-based protocol and inspection at the time of cardiac transplant orcorrective surgery.RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with 44 LVADs were followed up during a four-yearperiod using this protocol that correctly identified 11 patients with inflowvalve regurgitation, 2 with intermittent inflow conduit obstruction, 1 withsevere kinking of the outflow graft, and 9 with new insufficiency of the nativeaortic valve.CONCLUSIONS: As LVAD use for end-stage heart failure becomes widespread, anddurations of support are extended, dysfunction will be increasingly prevalent.Transthoracic echocardiography provides a practical method to accurately identifythe causes of mechanical dysfunction with patients on chronic LVAD support.
