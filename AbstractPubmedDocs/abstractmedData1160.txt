Epub 2008 Aug 27.Patient with hypofibrinolysis-mediated thromboembolism converted to ahypercoagulable/hyperfibrinolytic state via ventricular assist device placement.Nielsen VG(1), Kirklin JK, Holman WL, George JF, Ellis TC, Steenwyk BL.Author information: (1)Department of Anesthesiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,Alabama 35249-6810, USA. vnielsen@uab.eduMechanical circulatory support with ventricular assist devices (VADs) forend-stage heart failure has been a focus of intense interest for nearly fourdecades. Despite improvements in VAD design and biomaterial composition, it iscommon to administer anti-coagulation (e.g., warfarin, anti-platelet agents) toprevent both device thrombosis and thromboembolism. We present a patient withpre-operative thrombophilia (pulmonary embolism, intracardiac thrombus) andhypofibrinolysis, who subsequently developed hypercoagulability withhyperfibrinolysis with normalization of clot lifespan after left VAD placement.Such complex patient-VAD-hemostatic-state interactions serve as the rationale forcontinuing investigation of the effects of mechanical circulation on thefibrinolytic system and thrombophilia.
