All were receiving inotropic agents before leftventricular assist device implantation, 21 (84%) were supported with a balloonpump, and 7 (28%) were supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Sixpatients died, primarily of right ventricular dysfunction and multiple organfailure. Nineteen (76%) were rehabilitated, received a donor heart, and weredischarged (100% survival after transplantation). Pretransplantation duration of support averaged 76 days (22 to 153 days). No thromboembolic events occurred inmore than 1500 patient-days of support with only antiplatelet medications.Significant hemodynamic improvement was measured (before implantation to beforeexplantation) in cardiac index (1.7 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.8 L/min per squaremeter; p < 0.001), left atrial pressure (23.7 +/- 7 to 9 +/- 7.5 mm Hg; p <0.001), pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and rightventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Both creatinine and blood ureanitrogen levels were significantly higher before implantation in patients whodied while receiving support. Renal and liver function returned to normal before transplantation. We conclude that support with the HeartMate device improvedhemodynamic and subsystem function before transplantation. Long-term support withthe HeartMate device has a low risk of thromboemboli and makes a clinical trialof a portable HeartMate device a realistic alternative to medical therapy.
