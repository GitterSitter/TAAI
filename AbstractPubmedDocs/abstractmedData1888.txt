Circulation. 1998 Jun 16;97(23):2297-8.BACKGROUND: The failing myocardium is characterized by decreased forceproduction, slowed relaxation, and depressed responses to beta-adrenergicstimulation. In some heart failure patients, heart function is so poor that aleft ventricular assist device (LVAD) is inserted as a bridge to transplantation.In the present research, we investigated whether circulatory support with an LVADinfluenced the functional properties of myocytes from the failing heart.METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocytes were isolated from human explanted failing hearts(HF-myocytes) and failing hearts with antecedent LVAD support (HF-LVAD-myocytes).Studies of myocyte function indicated that the magnitude of contraction wasgreater (9.6+/-0.7% versus 6.9+/-0.5% shortening), the time to peak contractionwas significantly abbreviated (0.37+/-0.01 versus 0.75+/-0.04 seconds), and thetime to 50% relaxation was reduced (0.55+/-0.02 versus 1.45+/-0.11 seconds) inthe HF-LVAD-myocytes compared with the HF-myocytes (P<0.05). The HF-LVAD-myocyteshad larger contractions than the HF-myocytes at all frequencies of stimulationtested. The negative force-frequency relationship of the HF-myocytes was improvedin HF-LVAD-myocytes but was not reversed. Responses to beta-adrenergicstimulation (by isoproterenol) were greater in HF-LVAD-myocytes versusHF-myocytes.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study strongly support the idea that circulatory support with an LVAD improves myocyte contractile properties and increasesbeta-adrenergic responsiveness.
