Accordingly, we hypothesized that heart failure elicits adaptations in the diaphragm similar to those elicited by endurance exercise in the limb musclesof normal subjects.METHODS AND RESULTS: Costal diaphragmatic biopsy samples were obtained from 7normal subjects (age, 36 +/- 20 years) and 10 patients (age, 50 +/- 6 years; leftventricular ejection fraction, 18 +/- 8%) at the time of transplant or leftventricular assist-device placement. We measured the distribution of myosin heavychain isoforms I, IIa, and IIb by SDS gel electrophoresis. We also measured theactivities of the following enzymes: citrate synthase, a marker of oxidativemetabolism; beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a marker of lipolytic metabolism;and lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of glycolytic metabolism. In normal subjects,the distribution of myosin heavy chain isoforms I, IIa, and IIb was 43 +/- 2%, 40+/- 2%, and 17 +/- 1%, respectively. In contrast, in heart failure subjects, the fiber distribution was 55 +/- 2%, 38 +/- 2%, and 7 +/- 2% for types I, IIa, andIIb, respectively. Therefore, in heart failure, myosin heavy chain I is increased(P < .0001) and myosin heavy chain IIb decreased from normal levels (P < .001).Additionally, citrate synthase activity (normal, 0.33 +/- 0.14; heart failure,0.54 +/- 0.21 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1; P < .05) and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoAdehydrogenase activity (normal, 0.27 +/- 0.04; heart failure, 0.38 +/- 0.02mumol.min-1.mg protein-1; P < .05) were greater in heart failure patients than innormal subjects, whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity was significantly less inheart failure patients than in normal subjects (normal, 11.6 +/- 4.6; heartfailure,: 4.3 +/- 2.2 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1; P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: In the diaphragm in heart failure, there is a shift from fast toslow myosin heavy chain isoforms with an increase in oxidative capacity and adecrease in glycolytic capacity. These diaphragmatic muscle changes areconsistent with those elicited by endurance training of the limb muscles innormal subjects.
