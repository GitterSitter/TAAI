In some childrenin whom aggressive medical treatment fails, artificial replacement of heartfunction may offer lifesaving support until the myocardium has recovered. Fourpreviously healthy children (three boys aged 4, 6, and 1 years; one girl aged 5) developed acute myocarditis with ventricular failure and multiorgan dysfunctioncaused by low cardiac output. Biventricular assist devices (BVAD) were implanted for prolonged support. In three children cardiac function improved and after upto 21 days mechanical support could be withdrawn. They had full recovery of heartfunction. In the fourth patient there was no myocardial recovery after a periodof 20 days. He underwent orthotopic heart transplantation with an uneventfulpostoperative course. Prolonged circulatory support with BVAD is an effectivemethod for bridging until cardiac recovery or transplantation in children.PMCID: PMC1729136
