The cardiac expression of Casp-1, ofits inhibitors caspase recruitment domain (CARD) only protein (COP) and CARDfamily, member 18 (ICEBERG), was evaluated by real-time PCR in the three groupsof patients.RESULTS: Casp-1 was increased in the pre-LVAD group compared to HTx (p=0.006),while on the contrary the ICEBERG level was significantly decreased in pre-LVADwith respect to HTx patients (p<0.001); no difference in COP expression level wasfound.CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a specific pattern of the Casp-1 systemassociated with inflammation and apoptosis markers in patients who require LVADinsertion. The inflammation could be the key process regulating, in a negativeloop, Casp-1 signaling and its down-stream effects, apoptosis included.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
