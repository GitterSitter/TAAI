We report our clinical experience of VADimplantation in patients with prosthetic heart valves, including both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves. The clinical records of 133 consecutive patients whounderwent VAD implantation at a single institution from January 2002 through June2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Six of these patients had a prosthetic valve in place at the time of device implantation. Patient demographics,operativecharacteristics, and postoperative complications were reviewed.Of the sixpatients,four were male.The mean age was 57.8 years (range 35–66 years). Thevarious prosthetic cardiac valves included a mechanical aortic valve (n = 2), abioprosthetic aortic valve (n = 3), and a mechanical mitral valve (n = 1).Theindications for VAD support included bridge to transplantation (n = 2), bridge torecovery (n = 1), and postcardiotomy ventricular failure(n = 3). Three patientsunderwent left ventricular assist device placement and three received a rightventricular assist device. Postoperatively, standard anticoagulation managementbegan with a heparin infusion (if possible)followed by oral anticoagulation.The30-day mortality was50% (3/6). The mean duration of support among survivors was194.3 days (range 7–369 days) compared with 16.0 days(range 4–29 days) fornonsurvivors. Of the three survivors,two were successfully bridged to hearttransplantation and one recovered native ventricular function.Among the threenonsurvivors,acute renal failure developed in each case, and two developedheparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This study suggests that VAD placement inpatients with a prosthethic heart valve, either mechanical orbioprosthetic,appears to be a reasonable option.
