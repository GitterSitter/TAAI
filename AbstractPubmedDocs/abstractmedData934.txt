Many of these patients ultimately develop end-stage heart failure requiring left ventricular assist device implantation (LVAD). However,morphologic differences in the systemic ventricle of these patients requirecareful attention to cannula placement. We report on the evolution of oursurgical technique for implanting LVADs in 3 patients with transposition of thegreat arteries and congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.Applying standard LV cannulation techniques to the systemic ventricle led us too anteriorly in our first patient, creating obstruction by the moderator band.Subsequent use of epicardial and transesophageal echocardiography allowed forintraoperative localization of the intracardiac muscular structures to identifythe optimal cannulation site. The acute angle of the inflow cannula on theDeBakey LVAD (MicroMed Technology, Houston, TX) required flipping the device180°. The HeartMate II device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) could be shifted towardsthe midline. One patient underwent successful transplant and 2 are home waitingfor a donor organ. We conclude from our experience that LVAD surgery can besafely performed in patients with congenital heart disease when implanted underechocardiographic guidance.Copyright © 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
