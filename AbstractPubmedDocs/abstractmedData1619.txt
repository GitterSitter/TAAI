Here wereport our 3 cases of patients implanted with the MicroMed DeBakey VAD(ventricular assist device). Three male patients, aged 37, 41, and 40, hadend-stage left heart failure due to idiopathic cardiomyopathy and were listed forcardiac transplantation. They had progressive hemodynamic deterioration. AlthoughPatient 1 underwent surgery, after device implantation, for bowel necrosis causedby thromboemboli of unknown origin, heart transplantation was performed 70 daysafter implantation. Pump thrombosis occurred in Patient 2 on the 120th day.Outflow graft ligation was performed because the patient refused a pump exchange.This patient died on the 25th day after ligation and the 145th day afterventricular assist device implantation. A heparin-coated version of the devicewas implanted in Patient 3, whose preoperative profound biventricular failure hadbeen improved by inotropic medication and intra-aortic balloon pump support.Successful heart transplantation was performed 161 days after implantation. Theseare the 1st implantations of a left ventricular assist device in Turkey. Fromthese cases, we have learned that the DeBakey VAD supplies adequate blood flowduring the bridging period and, due to its simplicity, portability, and lowinfection rate, enables discharge of the patient from the hospital. However,preoperative psychological evaluation and postoperative psychological support areimportant for a successful bridging procedure, as is close observation ofcoagulation and of pump operation.PMCID: PMC161896
