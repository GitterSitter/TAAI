Transplantation. 2000 Aug 27;70(4):606-12.The results of cardiac retransplantation: an analysis of the Joint International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation/United Network for Organ SharingThoracic Registry.Srivastava R(1), Keck BM, Bennett LE, Hosenpud JD.Author information: (1)Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53215, USA.BACKGROUND: It is well established that repeat heart transplantation has asignificantly worse outcome when compared with primary (first time)transplantation. Defining the risk factors for mortality within this group hasbeen difficult due to small numbers of patients at individual centers.METHODS: All cardiac retransplants performed in the United States and registered in the Joint International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation(ISHLT)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Thoracic Registry were analyzedfor demographics, morbidity posttransplantation, immunosuppression, and riskfactors for mortality.RESULTS: The study cohort included 514 patients of which 81% were male with amean age of 47+/-12 years. Time from primary transplant to retransplantationranged from 1 day to 15.5 years and more than 50% of the patients underwentretransplantation for chronic rejection. More than 60% of patients were in theintensive care unit at the time of retransplantation and more than 40% of thepatients were reported to be on some form of life support (ventricular assistdevice, ventilator, and/or inotropic therapy). Survival for the entireretransplant cohort was 65, 59, and 55% for 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, but was substantially lower when the intertransplant interval was short. Conversely, when the interval between primary and retransplantation was more than 2 years, 1 year survival postretransplantation approached that of primary transplantation.Additional independent risk factors for mortality for the retransplant cohortincluded overall cardiac transplant center volume, the use of a ventricularassist device or ventilator, the patient being in the intensive care unit, andrecipient age. The four most common causes of death were infection,primary/nonspecific graft failure, chronic rejection (allograft vasculopathy),and acute rejection.CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm that repeat heart transplantation is a higher risk procedure than primary transplantation, especially early after the primary heart transplant.
