ASAIO Trans. 1988 Jul-Sep;34(3):241-6.Skeletal muscle ventricles as a potential right heart assist or substitute.Anderson WA(1), Andersen JS, Bridges CR, Hammond RL, DiMeo F, Frisch EE, Salmons S, Stephenson LW.Author information: (1)Harrison Department of Surgical Research, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Skeletal muscle ventricles (SMV) were constructed from canine latissimus dorsimuscle and chronically stimulated to pump fluid within a totally implantable mockcirculation device. They were stimulated to contract at either 95/min (N = 7) or 54/min (N = 4). The preload was chronically maintained at 20 mmHg. After 1 month of continuous pumping the SMV were capable of generating a stroke work of 0.134 X10(6) ergs and power output of 0.021 watts, representing 61% and 42% of thestroke work and power output of the native canine right ventricle, respectively.
