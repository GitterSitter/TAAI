Between Mayand September 2007, eight consecutive patients undergoing LVAD implantation foradvanced heart failure received the LMWH nadroparin. Nadroparin was given twicedaily to achieve anti-Factor Xa activity target peak levels of 0.4 +/- 0.1 U/mL. The antiplatelet therapy consisted of aspirin (100 mg/day) and dipyridamole (3 x 75 mg/day). One patient underwent heart transplantation, three patients died, andfour patients continued to receive device support. The median duration of supportwas 78 days (range, 46 to 174). No major bleeding was observed; minor bleedingoccurred in three patients. In two patients, pump thrombosis was suspected. Therewere two ischemic and no hemorrhagic strokes. The use of LMWH may provide a newanticoagulation treatment option in the immediate postoperative period after LVADimplantation.
