We report our single-center experience withmechanical circulatory support therapy.METHODS: From March 2002 to December 2012, 107 adult patients (mean age, 56.8 ±9.9 y; range, 31-76 y) were primarly supported on temporary or long-term VAD orTAH support as treatment for refractory heart failure at our institution.Temporary extracorporeal radial VAD support (group A) was established in 49patients (45.7%), and long-term paracorporeal and intracorporeal VAD or TAH(group B) in 58 patients (54.2%). Left ventricular (LVAD) support was establishedin 55 patients (51.4%; n = 33, Heartmate II; n = 6, Heartmate I XVE; n = 4,Heartware HVAD; and n = 12, Centrimag) and biventricular (BVAD/TAH) support(group B) in 28 patients (26.1%; n = 10, Thoratec paracorporeal; n = 2, HeartwareHVAD, n = 1, Thoratec implantable; n = 1, Syncardia TAH; and n = 14, Centrimag). The temporary Centrimag was the only device adopted as isolated right ventricular(RVAD) support, and it was inserted in 24 patients (22.4%).RESULTS: In group A, overall mean support time was 10.2 ± 6.6 days (range, 3-43d). In group B, LVAD mean support time was 357 ± 352.3 days (range, 1-902 d) and BVAD/TAH support time was 98 ± 82.6 days (range, 8-832 d). In group A, theoverall success rate was 55.1% (27 patients). In group B, LVAD overall successrate was 74.4% (32 patients) and BVAD/TAH success rate was 50% (7 patients).Overall heart transplantation rate for both groups was 27.1% (n = 2, group A; n =27, group B). Overall 1-year and 5-year survivals after heart transplantationwere 72.4% (n = 21) and 58.6% (n = 17), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical circulatory support is an effective strategy even incases of end-stage heart failure according to our experience. Further improvementof VAD and TAH technologies may support their adoption as an encouragingalternative to heart transplantation in the near future.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
