In the current study, we retrospectivelyinvestigated echocardiographic and histologic changes in patients supported byLVADs (n = 18). The goal of our study was to determine if the degree of cardiacfibrosis and myocyte size in pre-implant biopsies could predict myocardialimprovement as assessed by improvements in ejection fraction (EF) during LVADsupport.METHODS: We determined total collagen content in myocardial biopsy specimens by asemi-quantitative analysis of positive Picro-Sirius Red-stained areas and myocytesize measurements by computerized edge detection software.RESULTS: During LVAD support, 9 of the 18 patients (Group A) were distinguishedby significant improvement in ejection fraction (pre <20% vs unloaded 34 +/- 5%).In addition, Group A patients had significantly less fibrosis and smallermyocytes than their Group B counterparts, whose EF did not improve. There was an inverse correlation between pre-implant biopsy collagen levels and myocyte sizewith increases in EF during LVAD unloading.CONCLUSIONS: We found that the patients who demonstrated the greatestimprovements in EF during support had less fibrosis and smaller myocytes at thetime of device implantation. We propose that tissue profiling a patient'spre-implant biopsy for fibrosis and myocyte size may allow stratification inStage IV heart failure and may predict myocardial improvement during LVADsupport.
