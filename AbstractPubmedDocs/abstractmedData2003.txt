J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1995 Jan;109(1):74-80.Experience with the Novacor left ventricular assist system as a bridge to cardiactransplantation, including the new wearable system.Vetter HO(1), Kaulbach HG, Schmitz C, Forst A, Uberfuhr P, Kreuzer E, Pfeiffer M,Brenner P, Dewald O, Reichart B.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Grosshadern Hospital, Munich, Germany.The three components of the Novacor left ventricular assist system, compactcontroller, battery, and back-up battery, have been miniaturized in thedevelopment of the wearable system. Therefore patients can be fully mobilizedreceiving mechanical circulatory support while awaiting heart transplantation.Between February 1992 and April 1994 a total of eight patients with decompensatedheart failure (6 dilated cardiomyopathy, 1 acute myocarditis, 1 ischemiccardiomyopathy) were treated with the Novacor left ventricular assist systems. Inthe most recent four cases the wearable system (N100P) was used. Patients' agesranged from 17 to 49 years. In five patients severe failure of the right side of the heart was present at the time of implantation. Hemodynamic stabilization was achieved in all patients during the 2 to 122 days (mean 30.8 +/- 42.5 days) ofsupport. The following parameters were measured on average before and 24 hoursafter implantation of the left ventricular assist system: mean arterial pressure 70 +/- 11 versus 87 +/- 13 mm Hg (p < 0.05), cardiac index 1.71 +/- 0.42 versus3.23 +/- 0.74 L/min/m2 (p < 0.05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 27.1 +/-4.4 versus 9.9 +/- 5.2 mm Hg (p < 0.01), mean pulmonary pressure 41 +/- 9 versus 27 +/- 6 mm Hg (p < 0.05), and right ventricular ejection fraction 16.7% +/-10.3% versus 22.0% +/- 11.6% (not significant). Patients who received thewearable system were capable of managing their own power supply during thebridging period and were able to walk to the hospital park and shopping area. Onepatient had a serious pulmonary infection, which was treated successfully, andtwo patients had a cerebrovascular accident, which resolved in one and resultedin a minor residual deficit in the other. All eight patients received a hearttransplant. One patient died early after transplantation and seven patients arealive and well. In summary, the wearable Novacor left ventricular assist systemprovides major advantages regarding quality of life of patients during mechanicalcirculatory support. However, there is a remaining risk of thromboembolismdespite anticoagulation therapy.
