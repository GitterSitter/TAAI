Limitedavailability of organs for transplantation, coupled with wider selection criteriafor destination therapy, has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of patients with permanently assisted circulation. Given the high rate ofcomplications related to circulatory assist devices, it is expected that thesepatients will be undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures more commonly.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a laparoscopic splenectomy in a patientsupported with a Heartmate II left ventricular assist device. Using this case as a model, we discuss hemodynamic changes associated with pneumoperitoneum andanesthesia induction. Additionally, an extensive literature search was performed to asses the frequency of laparoscopic procedures performed on patients withcirculatory support.RESULTS: Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed without significant hemodynamicchanges. To our knowledge, this is the first laparoscopic splenectomy performedin a patient with this mode of circulatory support.CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic procedures can safely be performed in patients withcompensated heart failure, who are supported with ventricular assist devices.
