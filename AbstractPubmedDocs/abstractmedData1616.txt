The axial flow pumps provide continuous flow from the left ventricle (LV) to the aorta; the TAH provides pulsatile flowto the pulmonary and systemic circulation. Understanding the differences between these systems is necessary for appropriate patient selection and management. Wecompared the Jarvik 2000 axial-flow pump and the AbioCor TAH. The Jarvik 2000pump is placed in the LV with its outflow graft anastomosed to the aorta. Thissystem is used for bridge-to-transplantation and destination therapy. The AbioCorTAH provides complete circulatory support. The AbioCor is used for destinationtherapy in patients expected to die in less than 30 days. Worldwide, 45 patients have received the Jarvik 2000 as a bridge to transplantation (n = 34) ordestination therapy (n = 11) for an average duration of support of 132.8 days (5 to 853 days). In 30 bridge-to-transplantation cases, 14 patients (47%) haveundergone heart transplantation, 5 (17%) continue to be supported with the Jarvik2000 device, and 11 (37%) have died. Five of 7 patients supported by the AbioCor TAH survived beyond the perioperative period; 4 were ambulatory, 2 weredischarged from the hospital, and 1 is at home 13 months after implantation.Anticoagulation therapy and infection management are necessary for both systems. Therapy with inotropic agents, vasoactive drugs, a pacemaker, and electrolytenormalization is necessary for Jarvik patients. AbioCor-supported patients do notrequire medications to support heart function. Vasoactive agents may be usefulfor controlling blood pressure.
