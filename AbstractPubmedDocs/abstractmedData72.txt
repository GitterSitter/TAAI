Epub 2014 Dec 2.Does CircuLite Synergy assist device as partial ventricular support have a place in modern management of advanced heart failure?Mohite PN(1), Sabashnikov A, Simon AR, Weymann A, Patil NP, Unsoeld B, Bireta C, Popov AF.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation and Mechanical support, RoyalBrompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.The discrepancy between the number of patients on the waiting list and available donor hearts has led to the successful development of left ventricular assistdevices (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation. The conventional LVADs aredesigned to provide full hemodynamic support for the end-stage failing heart.However, full-support LVAD implantation requires major surgery, sternotomy andcardiopulmonary bypass in majority of cases. The Synergy Micro-pump is thesmallest implantable LVAD and provides partial flow support up to 3 l/min. It wasshown that early intervention with this device can provide substantial benefitsto patients with severe heart failure not yet sick enough for a full-supportLVAD. Due the small dimensions it can be implanted without cardiopulmonary bypassor a sternotomy. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical use of theSynergy Micro-pump as partial hemodynamic support.
