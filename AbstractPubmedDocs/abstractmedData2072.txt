Muscle fatigue is almost alwaysdependent upon muscle capillary blood flow. This study examined the relationship between SMV intrapouch pressure and blood flow to the circumferential muscle in aworking SMV with a mock circulation. The unconditioned rectus abdominis musclewas used to create an in situ SMV in five dogs. Muscle blood flow was measured byboth the radioactive microsphere and the electromagnetic flow probe method as thepouch pressure was varied between 10 and 70 mmHg and as the SMV was stimulated tocontract at a rate of 20 min-1. The correlation coefficient for the two methodswas 0.908. At pouch pressures of 10, 40, and 70 mmHg, the respective blood flowvalues were 22.60 +/- 2.50 (1 SEM), 12.20 +/- 2.10, and 4.40 +/- 0.74 ml min-1 (pless than 0.05). When they were corrected for muscle weight, the mean blood flow values at these same pouch pressures were 0.28 +/- 0.03, 0.15 +/- 0.03, and 0.05 +/- 0.01 ml min-1 g-1, respectively (p less than 0.05). SMV output was measuredfor each pouch pressure that was tested. Pouch output, expressed as ml min-1, was458 +/- 20 (1 SEM) at an SMV diastolic pouch pressure of 10 mmHg, 309 +/- 22 at apouch pressure of 40 mmHg, and 103 +/- 6 at a pouch pressure of 70 mmHg.(ABSTRACTTRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
