We sought to determine thepretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital mortality in transplanted infants in the current era.METHODS: All infants under 12 months of age who underwent primary hearttransplantation during a recent 10-year period (1999-2009) in the United Stateswere identified using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database.Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independentpretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital mortality.RESULTS: Of 730 infants in the study (median age 3.8 months), 462 (63%) hadcongenital heart disease, 282 (39%) were supported by a ventilator, 94 (13%) withextracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 22 (3%) with a ventricular assist deviceat the time of transplantation. Overall, 82 (11.2%) infants died before theirinitial hospital discharge. In adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality wasassociated with repaired congenital heart disease (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95%confidence interval [CI], 1.8, 7.2), unrepaired congenital heart disease not onprostaglandin E (OR, 2.8; CI, 1.3, 6.1), extracorporeal membrane oxygenatorsupport (OR, 6.1; CI, 2.8, 13.4), ventilator support (OR, 4.4; CI, 2.3, 8.3),creatinine clearance less than 40 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) (OR, 3.1; CI, 1.7, 5.3), and dialysis (OR, 6.2; CI, 2.1, 18.3) at transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: One in 9 infants undergoing heart transplantation dies beforehospital discharge. Pretranplantation factors associated with early mortalityinclude congenital heart disease, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support,mechanical ventilation, and renal failure. Risk stratification for earlyposttransplant mortality among infants listed for heart transplantation mayimprove decision-making for transplant eligibility, organ allocation, andposttransplant interventions to reduce mortality.Copyright Â© 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
