Since the need for hearttransplantation is on the rise, there is a requirement for implantable LVADs,which can be safely used for long-term purposes. One of the most promising kinds of these devices is the sac-type LVAD (ST-LVAD) that has the ability to generate pulsatile flow. In this study and for the first time, three different models ofST-LVAD are analyzed numerically. In the first model, the motion of the elasticmembrane wall is simplified, while in the second model, the motion is assumed to be wavy. The pressure boundary conditions are added to the second model toallocate for the effect of pressure on the flow pattern, and hence, form thethird model. The simulation results of the analyzed models show that in thisparticular type of LVAD, the viscous term of the applied stress from the fluid onthe moving wall is negligible, compared with the pressure term. Additionally, it can be concluded that the motion pattern of the moving wall does not affect theblood flow pattern in a great deal. Furthermore, the inclusion of the fluidpressure in the boundary conditions does not have a major influence on the blood flow pattern.
