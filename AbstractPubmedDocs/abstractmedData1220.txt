Surgical treatment of heart failure has been the subjectof renewed focus, with a particular emphasis on applying the principles ofevidence-based medicine to the evaluation of surgical therapies. The purpose ofthis review is to discuss emerging surgical therapies in heart failure, inparticular, mechanical cardiac support and mitral valve repair.RECENT FINDINGS: The most widely established surgical therapy for heart failureis cardiac transplantation, but its impact is limited due to the limited numberof donors. The Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure study, a landmarkevaluation of the role of coronary artery bypass grafting and surgicalventricular restoration in patients with ischemic heart disease and heartfailure, has recently completed enrollment. Improvements in device design andpatient selection appear likely to continue to improve outcomes with mechanicalcardiac support in patients who are not deemed transplant candidates (destinationtherapy). Surgical repair of secondary mitral regurgitation is undergoingevaluation in the soon to be launched Surgery vs. Medical Treatment Alone forPatients with Mitral Regurgitation and Nonischemic study.SUMMARY: A variety of surgical therapies for heart failure are currentlyundergoing evaluation in randomized controlled trials. Data from these landmarkstudies will guide the application of surgical therapy in heart failure for theforeseeable future.PMCID: PMC3960402
