The sarcoplasmic reticulumCa(2+)-adenosine triphosphatase (Ca2+-ATPase) activity is down-regulated infailing myocardium and contributes to heart failure-associatedcontraction/relaxation abnormalities. Regulation of Ca(2+)-ATPase aftermechanical support was shown to be heterogeneous. Thus, we analyzed Ca(2+)-ATPaseactivity and protein expression in the paired myocardial samples of 21 patientssupported by ventricular assist devices to identify factors that influencerestoration of the Ca(2+)-transient after ventricular assist device support.METHODS: We measured Ca(2+)-ATPase activity using a reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-coupled reaction, determined sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-dependentATPase protein using Western blotting, and determined 4-hydroxyproline usingamino-acid analysis.RESULTS: The mean Ca(2+)-ATPase activity decreased at assist-device implantation and slightly increased at transplantation, but remained significantly lower than in non-failing donor hearts. However, individual responses were heterogeneous.Patients with older age, increased left ventricular diameter, and increased4-hydroxyproline content showed down-regulation of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity,whereas we found up-regulation in patients with low values for these parametersafter assist-device support.CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, which influences the myocardial Ca(2+)-transient, generally is not restored to normal values inassist-device-supported hearts, but depends on a combined score of the leftventricular end-diastolic diameter, degree of ventricular fibrosis, and age ofthe patient at the time of assist-device implantation.
