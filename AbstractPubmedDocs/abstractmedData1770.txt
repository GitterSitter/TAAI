When conventional therapy including NO-inhalation fails the only choice to reach sufficient haemodynamic conditions may be theimplantation of a right ventricular support system.METHODS: In all cases the Biomedicus centrifugal pump was implanted bycannulation of the right atrium and pulmonary artery.RESULTS: Since March 1989 950 heart transplant procedures were performed at ourcenter. In nine cases (7 male, 2 female, mean age 52 years) implantation of aright ventricular support system was necessary because of deterioration of right ventricular function. The implantation was carried out in 7 cases immediatelyafter transplantation, in 2 cases after 2 days. The support time ranged from4-348 hours. Six patients could be weaned, 2 patients underwent retransplantationand died and 1 patient died on the support system. Three of the six weanedpatients died in the further course because of multiorgan failure.CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical right ventricular support is often the only therapeuticaltool to reach adequate haemodynamic conditions in post-transplant right heartfailure. The Biomedicus centrifugal pump provides good conditions in these cases.Weaning is often possible after short-term support. The mortality rate isdetermined by multiorgan failure in immuno-suppressed patients. Retransplantationseems not to be successful despite maximal treatment.
