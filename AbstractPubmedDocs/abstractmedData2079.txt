Very little can be done for individuals with thiscondition, which is increasing in prevalence. The only hope is the promise ofintervention with permanent circulatory support systems. Can we as a societyafford the $3.1 billion that would be required to support every patient needingsuch a system? This cost represents an increase of 1/2 of 1% of the $662 billion per year expended for medical care. Fortunately, circulatory support systems donot necessarily represent an expense, but rather an investment that has areasonable payback period. An investment in an individual of $100,000 for thedevice and implantation cost, coupled with an ongoing maintenance cost of $4,000 per year, can return to society an income greater in value than the investment.The payback period is strongly dependent on the earning power of the individual, as well as the amount of medical attention or complications experienced. Anindividual with an annual salary of $40,000 per year becomes a positive financialforce in our society and increases the gross national product (GNP) within 5years. The same individual with extensive medical complications and intermittent loss of salary can extend the payback period by an additional 2 years.Circulatory support systems have the potential of increasing our GNP, leading to a higher standard of living for the populace.
