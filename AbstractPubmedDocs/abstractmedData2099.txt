Intensive Care Nurs. 1990 Sep;6(3):138-49.Use of an implantable left ventricular assist device for irreversible ventricularfibrillation secondary to massive myocardial infarction--a case study.McGinley AM, Matthews AS, Graham TR.Mechanical circulatory support devices are currently being developed. Theindications for their use are presently following acute myocardial infarction; inpost cardiac-surgical cardiogenic shock; and as a mechanical 'bridge' to cardiac transplantation. Devices are being developed for permanent implantation inpatients with end-stage left ventricular failure who are unacceptable for ordenied transplantation. Intensive care nurses are required to care for patientswho receive such mechanical support. These patients need intensive physical care with extensive nursing intervention and psychological support. The following casestudy describes the care of a patient who received an implantable leftventricular assist device (LVAD). The study illustrates the nursing care requiredin the management of such patients.
