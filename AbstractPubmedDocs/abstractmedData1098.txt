Indication,results, risks].[Article in German]Meyer AL(1), Strüber M.Author information: (1)Klinik für Herz-, Thorax-, Transplantations- und Gefässchirurgie, MedizinischeHochschule, Hannover.Three generations of left ventricular assist devices are available for thetherapy of heart failure. In the current development, pulsatile devices are beingdisplaced by axial flow pumps. Intentions for left ventricular assist deviceimplantations are bridge to transplantation or to recovery and destinationtherapy. Already the mechanical support has the drop on the conservative medical therapy; furthermore, improvements in the devices are registered. In addition, byimplanting a left ventricular assist device the quality of life was improved.Consequently, the importance of left ventricular assist devices in the therapy ofheart failure is increasing.
