After ventricular assist deviceplacement, the patient recovered myocardial function. The ventricular assistdevices were removed on post-implant Day 7, and the patient made a full long-termrecovery. Ventricular assist devices should be strongly considered, as bridges torecovery, to support patients with acute myocardial dysfunction associated withsepsis while the underlying infection is treated.
