The aim of the study was to address the weaning procedure,analyzing the hemodynamic and echocardiographic picture of patients weaned and toidentify predictors of poor outcome among this population.DESIGN: Observational study.SETTING: University hospital.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-nine VA ECMO cases.INTERVENTIONS: None.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (38%) were weaned, 7 (5.4%)were bridged to a ventricular assist device, and 6 (5.2%) were listed for hearttransplantation. Weaned patients showed a significant increase of pulse pressure (35 [0-50] mmHg before ECMO, 59 [53-67] mmHg at weaning, 61 [51-76] mmHg afterECMO (p<0.001]) and reduction of dose of inotropes (inotropic score [as definedin the text] 20 [14-40] before ECMO, 10 [3-15] at weaning, and 10 [5-15] afterECMO, p<0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased from 19(0-22.5)% before ECMO to 35 (22-55)% after ECMO (p<0.001). A significantimprovement of right ventricular (RV) function was observed in weaned patients(RV dysfunction from 52% to 21%, p<0.001). Among weaned patients, 15 (31%) died. Patients who died after weaning had longer ECMO duration compared to dischargedpatients (8 [5-11] v 4 [2-6] days, p = 0.01) and more transfusions (22 [10-37] v 7 [0.5-15] units, p = 0.02); survival was lower in patients with central ECMO(postcardiotomy) compared to peripheral ECMO (p = 0.045). Mortality was higher inthose with persistence of RV failure, continuous venovenous hemofiltration,higher inotropic score, lower systolic pressure, or higher leucocyte count atweaning.CONCLUSIONS: Successful weaning from ECMO is a multifaceted process, whichencompasses consistent recovery of myocardial and end-organ function; LVEF,though improved, is still low at weaning. Hospital survival is correlatedsignificantly to the duration of ECMO support and to bleeding complications.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
