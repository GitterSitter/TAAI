The mean length of hospital stay was 8 days before LVADinsertion. Before insertion 6 patients (18%) had positive pulmonary cultures and 5 patients (15%) had bacteremia.RESULTS: During LVAD support 18 patients (55%) had bloodstream infection. Of 24patients (73%) successfully bridged to transplantation, 12 (50%) had positiveblood cultures including Staphylococcus species (n = 9), Candida (n = 3),Pseudomonas (n = 2), and Enterococcus (n = 2). Infectious complicationsencountered in this series included driveline infection requiring surgicalrevision, septic embolus, "cleared" device infection, "suppressed" deviceinfection, and LVAD infection treated by device removal in 1 patient and deviceexchange in another.CONCLUSIONS: Infection in implantable LVAD patients is common, especially inpatients in whom multiple organ failure develops, requiring prolonged stay in theintensive care unit. Strategies are needed to prevent these infections inrecipients of the permanent LVADs because treatment of an established infectionis difficult and expensive.
