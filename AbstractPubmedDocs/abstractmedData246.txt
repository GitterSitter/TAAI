We soughtto analyze outcomes in such patients in the United States (U.S.) in the currentera.METHODS: All patients aged ≥ 18 years old listed for a primary HT in the U.S.between July 2004 and September 2010 were identified. Outcomes in those removedfrom the list by March 2011 (survival, relisting, HT) were examined usingtime-to-event analyses.RESULTS: Of 15,061 patients listed for primary HT, 10,168 (68%) received a HT,1,393 (9%) died on the waiting list, and 1,871(12%) were removed before receivingHT. Of patients removed from the list, 560 (30%) were removed due to clinicalimprovement, 692 (37%) due to deterioration, and 619 (33%) due to other reasons. After removal, 30-day and 1-year survival were 99.6% and 94%, respectively, inpatients removed due to improvement and 44% and 26%, respectively, in patientsremoved due to deterioration. Multivariable predictors of death after removalwere removal due to clinical deterioration, hypertrophic or restrictivecardiomyopathy, United Network of Organ Sharing status 1A/1B at listing, andrenal dysfunction. Only 27 patients (4.8%) among those removed due toimprovement, 21 (3.0%) removed due to deterioration, and 46 (7.4%) removed due toother reasons were relisted.CONCLUSIONS: One in 8 patients listed for HT in the U.S. are removed from thewaiting list before receiving HT. The indication for removal (clinicaldeterioration vs improvement) is the strongest independent predictor of survival after removal from the list.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
