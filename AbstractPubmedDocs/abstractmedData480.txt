Epub 2013Feb 27.A heart transplant candidate with severe pulmonary hypertension and extremelyhigh pulmonary vascular resistance.Sato T(1), Seguchi O, Morikawa N, Hieda M, Watanabe T, Sunami H, Murata Y, YanaseM, Hata H, Fujita T, Nakatani T.Author information: (1)Division of Transplantation, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center,Osaka, Japan.Fixed pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a contraindication for heart transplantation(HTx). Several studies showed that use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)in patients with fixed PH who were initially deemed ineligible for HTxeffectively decreased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), thus permitting HTx. We recently encountered a candidate for HTx who had severe PH with extremely highpulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). A 27-year-old female who had been diagnosed with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and who was approved for HTx atage 25 was referred to our institute because of severe fatigability with moderatedyspnea even at rest due to severe bilateral heart failure. Despite continuousinotrope infusion, the patient's symptoms were not relieved. Right heartcatheterization (RHC) disclosed a PAP of 62/40 mmHg with severely reduced cardiacoutput (1.8 l/min). A PVR of 15.9 Wood units suggested progressive worsening ofleft ventricular function with almost irreversible remodeling of the pulmonaryvasculature, and the patient was thought to be contraindicated for HTx. Following3 weeks of aggressive medical treatment, repeat RHC demonstrated PVR lowering to 8.16 Wood units. This suggested it was likely that PVR could be reversed, and thepatient underwent LVAD implantation. RHC performed after LVAD implantation showeda fall in PVR from the initial, extremely high measurement of 15.9 Wood units to 3.4 Wood units at 2 months postoperatively, and to 2.2 Wood units at 1 year. The patient is currently awaiting HTx with favorable LVAD support.
