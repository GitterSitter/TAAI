Six patientswere submitted to paracorporeal left VAD implantation, while right ventriculardysfunction was managed clinically. The mean time of circulatory support was 27days. Two patients were bridged to heart transplantation successfully, while the other four patients died under assistance with complications that correlated withthe final situation of multiple organ failure. Nevertheless, persistent rightventricular dysfunction was observed only in one patient who survived more than15 days, despite the general significant preoperative compromise of the rightventricle. This paradoxical observation indicates that left VAD implantation may be regarded as a valuable treatment option for patients with Chagas' diseasecardiomyopathy who evolve with decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
