We reporttwo useful surgical modifications for the implantation of the BHE in thepediatric population, improving ease of implantation as well as subsequentsurgical procedures at the time of explantation or transplantation. The firstmodification entails the use of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft for cannulationvia the innominate artery for arterial perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass.This graft is preserved and reused for institution of bypass at the time oftransplantation or explantation of the device after recovery. The secondmodification consists of an extension of the BHE arterial cannula using a length of knitted polyester graft. This allows for improved positioning of the arterial cannula in the ascending aorta or main pulmonary artery, facilitates vascularanastomosis, and improves hemostasis.
