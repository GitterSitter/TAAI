We describe the case of a patient in cardiogenic shock after amyocardial infarction. A percutaneous ventricular assist device was used toprovide immediate active hemodynamic support, and, because the patient'scondition necessitated surgical revascularization, percutaneous left ventricular assist device support was continued during off-pump coronary artery bypass.
