Epub 2013Dec 2.Evaluating the hemodynamical response of a cardiovascular system under support ofa continuous flow left ventricular assist device via numerical modeling andsimulations.Bozkurt S(1), Safak KK(1).Author information: (1)Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yeditepe University, 34755 Kadikoy,Istanbul, Turkey.Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type of the heart failure which can be characterized by impaired ventricular contractility. Mechanical circulatorysupport devices were introduced into practice for the heart failure patients tobridge the time between the decision to transplant and the actual transplantationwhich is not sufficient due to the state of donor organ supply. In this study,the hemodynamic response of a cardiovascular system that includes a dilatedcardiomyopathic heart under support of a newly developed continuous flow leftventricular assist device--Heart Turcica Axial--was evaluated employing computer simulations. For the evaluation, a numerical model which describes thepressure-flow rate relations of Heart Turcica Axial, a cardiovascular systemmodel describing the healthy and pathological hemodynamics, and a baroreflexmodel regulating the heart rate were used. Heart Turcica Axial was operatedbetween 8000 rpm and 11,000 rpm speeds with 1000 rpm increments for assessing thepump performance and response of the cardiovascular system. The results also givean insight about the range of the possible operating speeds of Heart TurcicaAxial in a clinical application. Based on the findings, operating speed of Heart Turcica Axial should be between 10,000 rpm and 11,000 rpm.PMCID: PMC3864087
