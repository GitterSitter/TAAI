Prior femorofemoralbypass is the preferred approach in these patients, but poor venous drainage may restrict arterial flow rate.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared bypass parameters, transfusion requirements andpostoperative outcome in 33 consecutive patients (40.4+/-12.2 years old, 28 men) assisted with the Thoratec paracorporeal VAD (mean duration, 3.0+/-2.96 months)undergoing transplantation using either gravity siphon drainage (GSD, n=16) orkinetic assisted venous drainage (KAVD, n=17).RESULTS: Cannulation technique, perfusion pressure, temperature and duration weresimilar between groups. There were no significant differences in arterialre-infusion flow rates (GSD, 3.6+/-0.7 vs KAVD, 3.8+/-0.6l/min, p=0.5). KAVDpatients had a lower mean S(v)O(2) and a higher desaturation index than GSDpatients (69.5+/-4.6 vs 76.1+/-5.4mmHg, p=0.004; and 0.63+/-0.23 vs 0.25+/-0.63, p=0.0001, respectively). Perioperative requirements in fresh frozen plasma andplatelet transfusions were significantly higher in KAVD patients. However, there were no differences in postoperative patient outcome.CONCLUSION: Perceived benefits on venous return associated with KAVD do notnecessarily translate into improved arterial re-infusion flow rates and should beweighed against the hazards of increased venous air aspiration and blood product requirements.
