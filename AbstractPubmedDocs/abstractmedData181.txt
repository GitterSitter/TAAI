We aimed to evaluate whether pump sizein relation to body surface area (BSA) has an impact on clinical outcome.METHODS: Children requiring implantation of a BH between 2000 and 2013 wereincluded in this retrospective study. Primary end-points were events leading toBH explantation (transplantation, recovery or death) and the secondary end-point was occurrence of thromboembolic events. Patients were categorized into threegroups according to BH stroke volume per BSA: optimal (30 to 50 ml/m(2)); small(<30 ml/m(2)); and large (>50 ml/m(2)).RESULTS: Eighty children (median age 2.2 years, median BSA 0.50 m(2)) underwentBH implantation. Fifty-five (69%) children had an optimally sized pump implanted,whereas 8 children (10%) had small pump and 17 (21%) large pump implantation.Overall survival rate was 69%. Weaning was possible in 15 children (19%), and 39 children (49%) were transplanted. Mortality, myocardial recovery andtransplantation were not related to age, BSA or pump size. Thromboembolic events occurred significantly more frequently in children treated with large pumps.CONCLUSIONS: The broad range of body sizes in children from newborns toadolescents requires a wide choice of appropriately sized devices. Large pumpsize in relation to BSA is an independent risk factor for occurrence ofthromboembolic events.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
