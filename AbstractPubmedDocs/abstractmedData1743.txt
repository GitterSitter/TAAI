The patients were 10 males and 4 females aged between 12 and 70years. Four underwent coronary revascularization, 2 required valve replacement,and 8 received heart transplants. Two left, 2 right and 6 bilateral ventricularassist devices were implanted.RESULTS: The incidence of refractory heart failure after extracorporealmechanical circulation requiring ventricular assist devices among our patientswas 0.48%, with left ventricular failure occurring in 21.42%, right ventricularfailure in 42.85% and biventricular failure in 35.71%. The main complicationswere infection, renal insufficiency, coagulation disorder, hemorrhage withrepeated surgery. One patient received a second transplant. The device wassuccessfully withdrawn from 35.7% of the patients. Survival upon discharge was7.1%.CONCLUSION: Refractory heart failure after extracorporeal circulation is alife-threatening event requiring rapid response and resolution. The decision toimplant a ventricular assist device is a difficult one, requiring immediateassessment of the causes of heart failure, its reversibility and the possibility of performing a heart transplant. The study of large series of patientsexperiencing this event and implanted with ventricular assist devices wouldfacilitate decision making.
