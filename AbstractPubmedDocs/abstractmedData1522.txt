Wesought to assess current disposition and outcomes of patients recently referredfor transplant evaluation to a single high-throughput tertiary referral center.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective observational review ofconsecutive patients with advanced heart failure who were assessed initially inan outpatient setting by a heart failure cardiologist, with a view to transplant or nontransplant surgical alternatives between 1995 and 2000. Of 1174 consecutivereferrals (mean age 55.1 [+/-12.7], 74% male), 588 (50%) were recommended formedical treatment (mean age 55.3 [+/-12.4], 72% male) and 200 (17%) fornontransplant surgery, principally coronary artery bypass grafting, mitral valve repair, infarct exclusion, partial left ventriculectomy, or combinations thereof (mean age 57.8 [+/-10.6], 76% male). A minority, 418 (36%), were initially listedfor cardiac transplantation (mean age 53.5 [+/-13.9], 80% male). Of these, 74(18% of listed) died waiting (34 on left ventricular assist device support), 45were delisted (27 for improved clinical status), and 217 (18% of referred group) have been transplanted. The 3-year survival (Kaplan-Meier) was equivalent (82%)in the transplanted and nontransplant surgery groups (excluding partial leftventriculectomy patients).CONCLUSION: In current clinical practice less than one fifth of transplantreferrals are ultimately transplanted, reflecting both a limited donor supply andthe application of alternative, nontransplant strategies. Medium-term survival inpatients suitable for alternative surgical strategies equals that of cardiactransplantation.
