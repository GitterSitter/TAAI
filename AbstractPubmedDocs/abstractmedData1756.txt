The Jarvik 2000 Heart is an electrically powered,axial-flow left ventricular assist device that has been developed during the past13 years. Unlike first-generation left ventricular assist devices, which weredeveloped in the 1970s and were designed to totally capture the cardiac output,the Jarvik 2000 is designed to normalize the cardiac output by augmenting thefunction of the chronically failed heart for extended periods. Design iterations have been tested in 67 animals, and clinical trials have recently begun. Threepatients have received the Jarvik 2000 as a bridge to transplantation, and 1patient is being supported permanently outside the hospital. All 4 patients have improved from New York Heart Association functional class IV to class I, and 2 ofthem have been discharged from the hospital after heart transplantation. Theexperimental and clinical results indicate that the Jarvik 2000 can providephysiologic support with minimal complications and is reliable, biocompatible,and easy to implant.
