It is unclear whetherpre-operative characteristics influence the likelihood of the development ofpost-operative hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Knowing which patientsare at greater risk might assist in tailoring anticoagulation therapy for certainpatients.METHODS: Advanced heart failure patients (n = 956) discharged from the hospitalafter LVAD implantation in the HMII bridge to transplantation (n = 405) anddestination therapy (n = 551) clinical trials were retrospectively evaluated.Bleeding requiring surgery or transfusion of >2 U of packed red blood cells,stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), and pump thrombosis were tracked from hospitaldischarge until patient outcome.RESULTS: Adverse event rates for post-discharge bleeding (0.67events/patient-year) were higher than those for hemorrhagic stroke (0.05),ischemic stroke (0.04), and pump thrombosis (0.03). The main sites of bleedingincluded gastrointestinal (45% of events), wound (12%), and epistaxis (4%). Olderage (>65 years) (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.31), lower pre-operative hematocrit (≤31%) (HR: 1.31), ischemic etiology (HR: 1.35), and female (HR: 1.45) werestatistically significant multivariable risk factors for bleeding. Female (HR:1.92) and 65 years of age and younger (HR: 1.94) were multivariable risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke, whereas female (HR: 1.84) and history of diabetes (HR:1.99) were risk factors for ischemic stroke. Female (HR: 1.90) and higher bodymass index (HR: 1.71/10 kg/m(2) increase) were also multivariable risk factorsfor pump thrombosis.CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bleeding and thrombotic events during LVAD supportdiffers by patient demographics, including sex, age, body mass index, andetiology of heart failure. Further studies should focus on the potential oftailored anticoagulation strategies in these subgroups.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by ElsevierInc.
