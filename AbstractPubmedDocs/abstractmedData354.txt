As more centers adopt this technology, theremay be a need to transport these patients over long distances to facilitatepatient care and organ transplantation. Food and Drug Administration indications for use state only that the patient must be a candidate for transplantation anddoes not place restrictions on the transplant capabilities of the implantingmedical center. Nontransplanting institutions are able to use this technologywith a predetermined agreement to transfer the patient to a partnering transplantcenter. We report the first two cases of interhospital air and ground transportof nonambulatory or intubated pediatric (<13 kg) patients supported by BerlinHeart EXCOR pediatric VADs and Ikus stationary drivers. We present our protocolfor transporting this delicate patient population. In addition, we discussimportant challenges encountered on these operations regarding vehicle transfers and the management of vehicle power supply. These two cases demonstrate that the transportation of pediatric patients on Berlin Heart VADs is feasible and safeand should be considered a treatment option in certain situations.
