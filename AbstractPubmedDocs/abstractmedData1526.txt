Panel reactive antibody was measured before implantation of the assist device, approximately 2 weeks after device implantation, irregularly thereafterdepending on clinical events and length of support, and at transplantation.Longitudinal mixed modeling was used to characterize the temporal pattern ofsensitization and its predictors during ventricular assist device support. Toaccount for nonrandom factors in device selection when comparing HeartMate(Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, Mass) and Novacor (Baxter Healthcare Corp,Novacor Div, Oakland, Calif) devices, we propensity-matched patients according tobaseline characteristics.RESULTS: T-cell panel reactive antibody increased rapidly after implantation ofthe ventricular assist device and then immediately began to decrease. Predictors of higher T-cell panel reactive antibody during support with the assist devicewere a shorter interval from device implantation to T-cell panel reactiveantibody measurement (P <.0001), female sex (P =.0004), younger age (P =.01),higher T-cell panel reactive antibody before device implantation (P =.03), moreperioperative red blood cell transfusions (P =.006), and an earlier date ofdevice implantation (P =.001). In matched patients, device type was not apredictor of higher T-cell panel reactive antibody during ventricular assistdevice support (P =.8).CONCLUSIONS: HLA sensitization during ventricular assist device support is notconstant but increases rapidly at implantation and then decreases. This temporal pattern of sensitization is influenced by patient factors and not by the type of device.
