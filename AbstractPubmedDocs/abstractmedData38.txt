As microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators inremodeling processes, a comparative miRNA profiling in transplanted hearts of HF patients with/without LVAD assistance could aid to comprehend underlyingmolecular mechanisms. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze miRNA differential expression in left ventricles of HF patients who underwent hearttransplantation directly (n = 9) or following a period of LVAD support (n = 8).After data validation by quantitative real-time PCR, association with functional clinical parameters was investigated. Bioinformatics' tools were then used forprediction of putative targets of modulated miRNAs and relative pathwayenrichment. The analysis revealed 13 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs infailing hearts subjected to LVAD assistance. In particular, the expression level of some of them (miR-338-3p, miR-142-5p and -3p, miR-216a-5p, miR-223-3p,miR-27a-5p, and miR-378g) showed correlation with off-pump cardiac index values. Predicted targets of these miRNAs were involved in focal adhesion/integrinpathway and in actin cytoskeleton regulation. The identified miRNAs mightcontribute to molecular regulation of reverse remodeling and heart recoverymechanisms.PMCID: PMC4330954
