Comparing patientssuccessfully transplanted (n = 20) or weaned (n = 9) who survived initialhospitalization, and those who died on mechanical support, there were nodifferences in preoperative renal, hepatic or pulmonary functions. Postoperative urinary output and bilirubin levels were the earliest variables affectingsurvival, and urinary output 24 hours after implant was discriminative inpatients who survived (p less than 0.01). Age (above or below 40 years) andmodality of terminal heart failure (acute versus chronic) were the most importantfactors affecting survival in the bridge to transplant group: 82% of youngpatients with acute decompensation were transplanted and 63% are long-termsurvivors while all patients over 40 years with chronic heart failure died onmechanical support (MS). In postcardiotomy patients, duration of cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was significantly different comparing survivors with those who diedin either bridge or recovery groups and all patients who had a CPB greater than 4hours died on MS or after transplantation or weaning. In conclusion, preoperativeindices indicating reversibility of multiple organ dysfunction remain to beidentified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
