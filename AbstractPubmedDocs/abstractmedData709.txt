The associationbetween ECM turnover and right ventricular failure (RVF) development after leftventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in patients with advanced heartfailure (HF) was investigated.METHODS: Circulating levels of osteopontin, metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MPP-9,and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-4 were measured in 61 patients atLVAD implantation and explantation and in 10 control subjects. RVF was defined asthe need for RVAD, nitric oxide inhalation > 48 hours and/or inotropic support > 14 days.RESULTS: All ECM markers were elevated in patients with HF compared with controls(all p < 0.05). RVF developed in 23 patients (37.7%) on LVAD support. All ECMmarkers decreased on LVAD support in patients without RVF (all p < 0.05), butserum MMP-2, TIMP-1, TIMP-4, and osteopontin remained elevated in RVF patients.Multivariate analysis identified that right ventricular stroke work index(RVSWI), circulating B-type natriuretic peptide, and osteopontin were associated with RVF (all p < 0.05). Osteopontin correlated inversely with RVSWI (r = -0.44, p < 0.001). Osteopontin levels > 260 ng/ml discriminate patients who develop RVF from those without RVF (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 82%).CONCLUSIONS: Marked elevation of osteopontin levels before LVAD placement isassociated with RVF development. Persistent elevation of circulating ECM markers after LVAD implantation characterizes patients who develop RVF. These novelbiomarkers would have a potential role in the prediction of RVF development inpatients undergoing LVAD implantation.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
