This study investigated the effect ofbloodstream infection on survival of patients with LVAD support and assessed riskfactors for survival in LVAD patients with bloodstream infection.METHODS: Between 1999 and 2010, 109 consecutive patients with end-stage heartfailure were supported by an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation. Overallsurvival was compared between those with and without a bloodstream infection.Risk factors for survival of patients with bloodstream infection were analyzed.RESULTS: A bloodstream infection developed in 65 patients (60%) during 584 ± 389 days of LVAD support. Compared with patients without a bloodstream infection,overall survival was significantly worse in those with bloodstream infection (68%vs 84% at 2 years after LVAD implantation, p = 0.0117). However, of 22 patientsbridged to transplantation, none had bloodstream infection recurrence aftertransplantation, and their 3-year survival rate after transplantation was 100%.Cox multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) identifiedpostoperative right ventricular failure (2.890 [1.238 to 6.757]; p = 0.0141) and bloodstream infection caused by a pathogen other than gram-positive cocci (3.336 [1.390 to 8.006] p = 0.0070) as significant risk factors for death in LVADpatients with a bloodstream infection.CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infection had a significant effect on survival afterLVAD implantation. Our results suggest that urgent cardiac transplantation shouldbe considered for LVAD patients with a bloodstream infection based on thecausative organism and right ventricular function.Copyright © 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
