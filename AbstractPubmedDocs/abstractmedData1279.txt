Potential adverse effects of CPB in very ill end-stage heartfailure patients include right ventricular dysfunction, end-organ injury, andbleeding. We sought to evaluate the feasibility and outcome of LVAD insertionwithout CPB.METHODS: The Jarvik 2000 is an axial-flow pump newly involved in a phase Iclinical trial in status I patients as a bridge to transplantation. Sevenpatients received this pump through thoracotomy or sternotomy with or without theuse of CPB.RESULTS: All patients had NYHA class IV heart failure with end-organ dysfunction requiring inotropic therapy. Two were in cardiogenic shock, necessitating fullCPB support. Five patients had the Jarvik implanted off-CPB. The off-CPB patientswere associated with decreased length of surgery, mechanical ventilation, bloodtransfusions, inotropic support, and hospital stay including rehabilitation.Nearly all of the patients had complete resolution of liver and kidneydysfunction.CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that off-CPB insertion of axial flow LVADs isfeasible, safe, and potentially advantageous. Although we are encouraged by theperioperative simplicity of this strategy, we acknowledge that additionalimplants and comparisons of outcomes with traditional pulsatile and continuousflow device techniques will be necessary to advocate its widespread adoption.
