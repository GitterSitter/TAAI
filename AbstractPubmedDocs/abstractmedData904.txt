The etiology of end-stage myocardial failureincluded non-congenital (75%) and congenital heart disease (25%); the median age at implant was 1 year (12 days to 14 years), and the median support time was 55days (1-432 days).RESULTS: Of the 56 pediatric patients, 24 were bridged to heart transplantation, 12 were explanted following myocardial recovery, two continued to receivesupport, and the other 18 died on support. The accurate rate of survival on VADsupport was 81.1% ± 5.8% and 51.4% ± 9.3% at 30 days and 1 year after EXCORimplantation. Patients receiving biventricular support had a trend towards higherpost-implantation mortality as compared with children implanted with leftventricular assist device (LVAD) (P = 0.09). Lower post-implantation survival wasalso observed in patients with congenital cardiac disease compared with children with a non-congenital etiology (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric VAD could provide satisfactory and safecirculatory support for small children with end-stage heart disease.Copyright © 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
