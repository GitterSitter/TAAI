Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda, Milano.maria.frigerio@ospedaleniguarda.itHeart transplantation was performed firstly in 1967, but it became a valuableoption in the 1980s, due to the availability of cyclosporine and of the techniquefor rejection monitoring by means of serial endomyocardial biopsies.Post-transplant survival improved over the years, mainly due to a reduction inearly mortality for infection or acute rejection. Expected 1-year and 5-yearsurvivals are around 85% and 70%, respectively. During the past 20-30 years,better therapies for heart failure have been developed, leading to restriction ofheart transplant candidacy to truly refractory heart failure. On the contrary,the criteria for donor acceptance have been liberalized, due to the discrepancybetween heart transplant candidates and available organs. It must be kept in mindthat renal and/or hepatic insufficiency that may be a consequence of heartfailure, pulmonary hypertension, and donor age, all remain risk factors formortality after transplantation. In order to maintain and possibly improve theresults of heart transplantation, effective strategies to increase safely thedonor pool are of utmost importance. Moreover, long-term post-transplantrecipients present new challenges to research and clinical practice. Mechanicalcirculatory support devices represent a surgical bridge or an alternative totransplantation; their expansion is limited by costs, organizational burden, and by patient difficulties in accepting this therapy.
