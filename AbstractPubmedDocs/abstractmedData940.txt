The devices have shown efficacy both as a bridge to transplantation and as a bridge to recovery. The potentialcomplications that may occur with long-term support have not been fullydescribed. This article reports the occurrence of a large pseudoaneurysmassociated with the ascending aorta following explantation of the EXCOR Pediatricventricular assist device. A management strategy for this potentially lethalcomplication is described.
