Although this is an important clinical entity, there areonly a handful of relevant studies on this topic in the literature.METHODS: From 2004 to 2012, 30 device exchanges (HeartMate II to HeartMate II)were performed. Since June 2011, we have employed the subcostal approach fordevice exchange if indicated. Sixteen patients underwent device exchange through a subcostal approach (S group), whereas 14 patients had devices exchanged througha full sternotomy (F group). Pre- and post-operative data were retrospectivelyreviewed.RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline patient characteristics between the two groups. Overall, mean duration between primary surgery and device exchangewas 425 ± 407 days. Surgical indications included device thrombus/hemolysis (N = 19), device malfunction (N = 9) and infection (N = 2). Cardiopulmonary bypasstime was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 40 ± 23 minutes, F: 105 ± 84minutes; p < 0.05), and post-operative bleeding within 24 hours after surgery wasless in the S group (S: 362 ± 367 ml, F: 1,286 ± 971 ml; p < 0.05). Length of ICUstay was significantly shorter in the S group (S: 4.6 ± 1.8 days, F: 8.2 ± 4.9days; p < 0.05). There was no difference in post-operative complications, except for prolonged intubation (F: N = 6 [43%], S: N = 1 [6.3%]; p < 0.05). There were 3 deaths in the F group and 0 in the S group, with no statistical difference (p =0.09). Also, there was no significant difference in other outcomes, includingtransplantation, device explantation and ongoing LVAD support.CONCLUSIONS: A subcostal approach may be preferred for HeartMate II deviceexchange if indicated.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
