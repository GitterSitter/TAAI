Weanalyzed whether lower body surface area (BSA) of adult patients affects theirprognosis after listing for heart transplantation (HTx).METHODS: Adult candidates (≥ 18 and <65 years) for de novo HTx in our center, whowere newly listed as T (transplantable) by Eurotransplant without ventricularassist device (VAD) support between 2000 and 2009 (n = 545), were studied. Thepatients were divided into two groups: group S (n = 272): BSA<1.9563 m(2) (medianvalue of total patients) and group L (n = 273): BSA ≥ 1.9563 m(2). Most femalepatients (82/84, 97.6%) belong to group S. Among all these patients, 286progressed to critically ill status, that is, they were listed in urgent statusor received a VAD. Actuarial survival rates were studied in each group.RESULTS: Overall survival rates after listing for HTx in group S were comparable to those in group L (43.0% vs 43.7% for 7-year survival, p=0.95). However, 1-yearsurvival rate on waiting list after progression to critically ill status in groupS (58.0%, n = 135) and that of female patients in group S (55.8%, n = 33) weresignificantly lower than those in group L (67.3%, n = 151, all were men; p =0.042 and p = 0.044, respectively). After multivariate Cox analysis, BSA<1.9563m(2) (hazard ratio 2.120, p = 0.0019), serum creatinine (hazard ratio 1.202, p = 0.033), obesity defined as body mass index ≥ 30 kg m(-2) (hazard ratio 2.043, p =0.0096) and primary use of VAD (hazard ratio 3.243, p < 0.0001) were identifiedas independent risk factors for mortality on waiting list after progression tocritically ill status. One-year survival rate on waiting list after VADimplantation in group S (44.4%, n = 65) and that of female patients in group S(38.1%, n = 14) were significantly lower than those in group L (63.0%, n = 78,all were men; p = 0.020 and p = 0.012, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Adult HTx candidates with lower BSA, including most women, had worseprognosis on waiting list after progression to critically ill status, especially after VAD implantation. As almost all HTx are nowadays performed in criticalstatus, this problem has emerged as important.Copyright © 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published byElsevier B.V.
