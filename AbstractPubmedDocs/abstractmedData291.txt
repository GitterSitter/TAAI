Epub 2013 Dec 23.Starling-like flow control of a left ventricular assist device: in vitrovalidation.Gaddum NR(1), Stevens M, Lim E, Fraser J, Lovell N, Mason D, Timms D, Salamonsen R.Author information: (1)Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, St. Thomas' Hospital,King's College London, London, UK.The application of rotary left ventricular (LV) assist devices (LVADs) isexpanding from bridge to transplant, to destination and bridge to recoverytherapy. Conventional constant speed LVAD controllers do not regulate flowaccording to preload, and can cause over/underpumping, leading to harmfulventricular suction or pulmonary edema, respectively. We implemented a noveladaptive controller which maintains a linear relationship between mean flow andflow pulsatility to imitate native Starling-like flow regulation which requiresonly the measurement of VAD flow. In vitro controller evaluation was conductedand the flow sensitivity was compared during simulations of postural change,pulmonary hypertension, and the transition from sleep to wake. The Starling-like controller's flow sensitivity to preload was measured as 0.39 L/min/mm Hg, 10times greater than constant speed control (0.04 L/min/mm Hg). Constant speedcontrol induced LV suction after sudden simulated pulmonary hypertension, whereasStarling-like control reduced mean flow from 4.14 to 3.58 L/min, maintaining safesupport. From simulated sleep to wake, Starling-like control increased flow 2.93 to 4.11 L/min as a response to the increased residual LV pulsatility. Theproposed controller has the potential to better match device outflow to patientdemand in comparison with conventional constant speed control.Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs andTransplantation.
