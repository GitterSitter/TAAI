Before implantation, 100% were on > or =1 inotropicagent, and 77% had an intra-aortic balloon pump. Overall survival was 69%; 42patients (84%) received cardiac transplantation, 5 patients (10%) were weaned,and 3 (6%) remained supported on BiVAD. If the 14 patients with postcardiotomyfailure and acute myocardial infarction with shock are excluded, the overallsurvival improves to 75%. Five-year actuarial survival after hearttransplantation was 58%. Of the 29 patients implanted before 2000, the 4-monthactuarial freedom from driveline infections, bloodstream infections, andneurological events was 10%, 54%, and 48%, respectively, whereas the rates ofthese events for the 44 patients implanted after 2000 improved to 70%, 79%, and80%, respectively. Since 2000, 21 (48%) patients were discharged from thehospital, of whom 38% went to an outpatient residence, 33% to a skilled nursingfacility, and 29% to home. Once discharged, > or =1 readmission occurred in 45%and > or =2 readmissions in 48%.CONCLUSIONS: BiVAD support for MCHF has an acceptable overall mortality andsurvival to transplantation. Morbidity has been significantly reduced in the past4 years, and management as an outpatient is achievable.
