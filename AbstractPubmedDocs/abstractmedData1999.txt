Ann Thorac Surg. 1995 Feb;59(2 Suppl):S56-62; discussion S63.Mechanical circulatory support: the Bad Oeynhausen experience.Körfer R(1), el-Banayosy A, Posival H, Minami K, Körner MM, Arusoglu L, Breymann T, Kizner L, Seifert D, Körtke H, et al.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart Center NorthRhine-Westphalia, Ruhr University of Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany.From September 1987 to February 1994, we treated 147 patients ranging between 11 and 82 years old with different mechanical circulatory support systems. Theapplied devices were the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump in 61 patients, the AbiomedBVS System 5000 in 49 patients, the Thoratec ventricular assist device in 42patients, and the Novacor left ventricular assist device in 7 patients. On thebasis of indication for mechanical circulatory support, the patients were dividedinto three groups: group 1 consisted of 72 patients with postcardiotomycardiogenic shock; group 2, 50 patients in whom mechanical support was used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation; and group 3 (miscellaneous), 25 patients incardiogenic shock resulting from acute myocardial infarction (n = 14), acutefulminant myocarditis (n = 3), primary graft failure (n = 2), right heart failureafter heart transplantation (n = 3), and acute rejection (n = 3). Time of supportranged from 1 hour to 97 days (mean duration, 10.8 days). Seventy-five patients(51%) were discharged from the hospital. The best survival rate was achieved ingroup 2 with 72%, followed by group 1 with 44% and then group 3 with 28%. Themost frequent complications in group 1 were bleeding (44%), multiple-organfailure (24%), neurologic disorders (18%), and acute renal failure (15%). Ingroup 2, the major complications were bleeding (34%) and cerebrovasculardisorders (22%) and in group 3, multiple-organ failure and sepsis (60%) andbleeding (32%).
