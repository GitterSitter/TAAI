Epub 2006 Feb 9.Same bridge, new destinations rethinking paradigms for mechanical cardiac supportin heart failure.Felker GM(1), Rogers JG.Author information: (1)Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA.michael.felker@duke.eduMechanical cardiac support with ventricular assist devices is an establishedtherapy for a variety of clinical scenarios, including postcardiotomy shock,"bridge to transplant," and "destination therapy." At present, devicedevelopment, clinical trial design, regulatory approval, and reimbursementdecisions for the clinical application of mechanical cardiac support devicescontinue to be considered in the context of these clinical indications. Although understandable from a historical perspective, these arbitrary divisions areinconsistent with the clinical realities of advanced heart failure therapy. Bynarrowly focusing on transplant eligibility at a static point in the clinicalcourse, current guidelines impede the broader application of ventricular assistdevice technology to the growing population of patients who may benefit from thistherapy.
