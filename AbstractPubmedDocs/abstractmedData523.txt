As a non-stoppingpumping machine, it operates continuously to pump blood through our bodies tosupply all cells with oxygen and necessary nutrients. When the heart fails, thesupplement of blood to the body's organs to meet metabolic demands willdeteriorate. The treatment of the participating causes is the ideal approach totreat heart failure (HF). As this often cannot be done effectively, the medicalmanagement of HF is a difficult challenge. Implantable rotary blood pumps (IRBPs)have the potential to become a viable long-term treatment option for bridging to heart transplantation or destination therapy. This increases the potential forthe patients to leave the hospital and resume normal lives. Control of IRBPs isone of the most important design goals in providing long-term alternativetreatment for HF patients. Over the years, many control algorithms includinginvasive and non-invasive techniques have been developed in the hope ofphysiologically and adaptively controlling left ventricular assist devices andthus avoiding such undesired pumping states as left ventricular collapse causedby suction. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of thedevelopments of control systems and techniques that have been applied to control IRBPs.
