Wehypothesized that creation of a controlled right-to-left shunt would result indecompression of the right ventricle and improved systemic cardiac output attolerable oxygen saturations. We also hypothesized that a peripheralveno-arterial shunt is physiologically superior to a central shunt.METHODS: Right atrial-femoral artery and right atrial-left atrial shunts werecreated in a large animal model (calf). Right-sided circulatory failure wasinduced by banding the pulmonary artery. Hemodynamic measures and blood gasdeterminations were obtained during nonshunted and shunted states.RESULTS: Peripheral and central shunts resulted in decreased right-sidedpressures and increased cardiac output. Arterial oxygen saturation remainedgreater than 90% during shunting. The peripheral shunt had the added advantage ofdecreasing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular strokework.CONCLUSIONS: A controlled right-to-left shunt improved hemodynamics and cardiacoutput in a large animal model with right-sided circulatory failure. Thisstrategy may be useful in the management of transplant and left ventricularassist device recipients with perioperative right-sided circulatory failure. Our studies also indicate that creation of a peripheral shunt has both physiologicand technical advantages over a central shunt.
