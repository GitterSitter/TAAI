The HeartWare HVAD system is unique compared with other VAD systems in that it has a thin,flexible drive-line and is implanted directly into the pericardial space without the need for a pump pocket. We reviewed 332 patients receiving the HVAD in thepivotal ADVANCE Bridge to Transplant (BTT) trial and Continued Access Protocol(CAP) to determine the incidence of drive-line infections and sepsis.METHODS: Summary statistics of outcomes and Kaplan-Meier freedom-from-eventanalyses were performed. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for homogeneity wasused to determine whether there was any site effect on rates of either drive-lineexit-site or sepsis infections.RESULTS: Drive-line exit-site infections occurred in 16.9% (56 of 332) ofpatients (0.25 event per patient-year [EPPY]). These infections were primarilytreated with antibiotics and most occurred >30 days post-implant (88%, or 66 of75 drive-line infections). Sepsis occurred in 17.2% (57 of 332) of patients (0.23EPPY), and sepsis events occurred more frequently >30 days post-implant (86%, or 60 of 70 sepsis events). Of patients with sepsis, 17.5% (10 of 57) died due tosepsis-related neurologic events (7 of 10) and multisystem organ failure (2 of10) and cardiopulmonary failure (1 of 10), whereas there were no deaths relatedto drive-line infections. In addition, 17.5% (10 of 57) of patients had a stroke event while under treatment for sepsis (7 hemorrhagic and 3 ischemic strokes),and 3.5% (2 of 57 patients with sepsis) had a device exchange for VAD thrombus (4days before and 1 day after sepsis diagnosis). Patients with drive-lineinfections or sepsis had a larger body mass index compared to those withoutinfection (29.4 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), p = 0.015), and were more frequently diabetic(43.7% vs 31.2%, p = 0.034). Although there was no negative impact on survival inpatients with drive-line exit-site infections, there was a trend for reducedsurvival in patients with sepsis events when compared to those patients withoutsepsis.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of drive-line infection and sepsis was low in patientsreceiving the HVAD pump. Despite a trend toward reduced survival in patients withsepsis events, the overall survival of patients with either drive-line infectionsor sepsis was excellent.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
