Each patient was supported by a left ventricular assist system(LVAS) because of severe congestive heart failure. The duration of LVAS supportaveraged 229 days (range, 46 to 447 days). In 3 patients, the LVAS was removedelectively after the patient showed recovery of myocardial function. In the other2, it was removed because of a malfunction.RESULTS: In response to LVAS support, hemodynamic variables were significantlyimproved. The mean cardiac index increased from 1.45 to 2.69 L x min(-1) x m(-2) (p < 0.001) and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 0.144 to 0.288 (p < 0.025). All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class IV at LVAS implantation and class I at its explantation. One patient diedof noncardiac-related causes 10 days after LVAS removal. The remaining 4 patientsare alive and well 35, 33, 14, and 2 months after LVAS removal.CONCLUSIONS: In select patients with severe congestive heart failure, mechanical unloading with an LVAS can result in recovery of myocardial function. Thesepatients can return to a normal physical status, thereby avoiding hearttransplantation. More research is required to determine optimal modes of LVASsupport, to predict which patients are likely to recover, and to assess long-termoutcomes.
