SMVs are able to perform cardiac-type work with an output equal tothat of the left ventricle at physiologic preloads, when tested with a mockcirculation device in our laboratory. SMVs have been used for right-sided cardiacassist. In acute experiments these ventricles have functioned effectively,bypassing the right side of the heart for up to 8 h. Most recently we have testedSMVs using them chronically to pump blood in the right-sided circulation, and at the time of writing they have been shown to function effectively in thisconfiguration for up to 18 days. SMVs may be used in the future as a method oftreating patients with left- or right-sided heart failure.
