The development of a chronic system of circulatory support has been underway at thePennsylvania State University for nearly 30 years. These efforts have beenrecently merged with the industrial partnership with Arrow International towardthe development of the LionHeart LVD-2000 (Arrow International, Reading, PA)completely implanted left ventricular support system. We present an overview ofthe system, details of implantation, a review of preclinical studies, and asynopsis of the first European implants. Early results have demonstrated thesystem to be safe, effective, and reliable. Transcutaneous energy transmissionand the compliance chamber have been validated.
