This article reportson the European experience with this device.METHODS: The HM II was implanted in 571 patients at 64 European institutions. In 72% of cases (411 patients), implantation has taken place at least 6 monthsbefore the closing date of the study (1 August 2008). Patients (19% female, 70%ischaemic aetiology) were on maximum medical therapy, including inotropicsupport. Body surface area ranged from 1.30 to 2.50 m(2) and age from 14 to 75years (mean: 51+/-14 years; n=115, 28% over age 60 years). The intention ofsupport was to provide a bridge to transplantation (73%), destination therapy(21%) and a bridge to recovery (6%). Adverse events were documented in the first 53 patients - for obtaining the Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark (group A) - from a European multicentric study (Strüber et al. [Strüber M, Sander K, Lahpor J, AhnH, Litzler P-Y, Drakos SG, Musumeci F, Schlensak C, Friedrich I, Gustafsson R,Oertel F, Leprince P. HeartMate II left ventricular assist device; early Europeanexperience. Eur J Cardiovasc Surg 2008;34(2):289-94.]: 101 patients) and from asingle-centre study (UMCU, The Netherlands: 30 patients).RESULTS: The mean support duration ranged from 0 to 1019 days with a mean of236+/-214 days (249 patients: >6 months, 119: 1 year, 12: >2 years; total supporttime: 293 years). The overall survival to transplantation, recovery or ongoingdevice support at the end of the study was 69% (284) with an early mortality of17.5% and late mortality of 13.5%. Of the surviving patients, 23% have beentransplanted, 4% had their device removed after recovery of the left ventricleand 42% are still ongoing. Adverse events included bleeding (ranging from 42% in group C to 59% in group A), percutaneous lead infections (A: 0.19, B: 0.61 and C:0.18 events per patient year), pocket infections (A: 0.08, B: 0.07 and C: 0.09events per patient year), ischaemic stroke (A: 0.06, B: 0.09 and C: 0.04 eventsper patient year), haemorrhagic stroke (B: 0.07, C: 0.04 events per patient year)and transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs; A: 0.08, B: 0.02 and C: 0.13 events perpatient year).CONCLUSIONS: These results support the use of the HM II continuous-flow LVAD for long-term support as a bridge to transplantation and possibly for destinationtherapy. Future emphasis should focus on minimising adverse events such asinfections, bleeding and neurological events.Copyright 2009 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
