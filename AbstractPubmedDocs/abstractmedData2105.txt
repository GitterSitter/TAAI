ASAIO Trans. 1990 Jul-Sep;36(3):M632-6.Clinical experience with the Nimbus pump.Deeb GM(1), Bolling SF, Nicklas J, Walsh RS, Steimle CN, Shea MJ, Meagher JS.Author information: (1)University of Michigan Medical Center, Section of Thoracic Surgery, AnnArbor48109.The Nimbus pump is an indwelling, electromagnetic powered left ventricular (LV)assist device inserted transfemorally. The inflow cannula (7 mm) is positionedacross the aortic valve and the pump in the descending aorta. Indications forinsertion include cardiogenic shock despite maximal medical support and PCWPgreater than 18 mmHg, MAP less than 90 mmHg, and Cl less than 2 L/min/m2. Twelve patients underwent the attempt at surgical insertion of the Nimbus pump.Diagnoses included eight acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), two ischemiccardiomyopathy, one postpartum cardiomyopathy, and one transplanted heartrejection. Eight (67%) of twelve patients had successful insertion. One patienthad peripheral vascular disease preventing passage, and three had femoral vesselstoo small for insertion (less than 7.5 Hagar dilator). Five patients with thediagnosis of AMI had successful insertion and three (60%) underwent sufficient LVrecovery for removal of the device; the other two patients died of stroke andventricular arrhythmias, respectively. Three patients with the diagnosis ofcardiomyopathy had progression of the disease process, and their needs exceededthe capabilities of the pump and they died of multiorgan failure. The Nimbus pumpis an attractive LV assist device because of its pumping capacity (3.5 L/min) andminor surgical procedure for insertion. However, its application is limitedbecause of access route and size. The device appears to work well for patients incardiogenic shock after AMI (60% recovery) but does not appear indicated forpatients with cadiomyopathy.
