The low output state associated with end-stagecardiac failure predisposes patients to renal dysfunction and the need forshort-term renal support. The use of cardiopulmonary bypass for VAD insertion,VAD, and hemofiltration expose the blood to mechanical trauma and activatedinflammatory cascades that can result in hemolysis. This produces freehemoglobin, a known nephrotoxin; this is a further renal insult. This studyassesses the effect of VAD alone and in combination with continuous veno-venoushemofiltration (CVVHF) on hemolysis.METHODS AND RESULTS: From July 1999 to December 2000, Thoratec VAD was used in 11patients. Nine (all males) were included in this study as all had laboratoryprofiles. Hemolysis was quantified by plasma free hemoglobin (PFHb) andhydroxybuterate dehydrogenase (HBD) levels measured daily, defined as PFHb level greater than 40 mg/L and HBD greater than 250 IU/L. Data relate to the following time intervals while the VAD was still in situ: T1 = 24 hours post-VAD insertion,T2 = 24 hours post-CVVHF start, T3 = 48 to 72 hours with the same CVVHF circuit, T4 = 24 hours post-stopping of CVVHF, and T5 = CVVHF off for over 48 hours. Themean (SD) PFHb levels were 19.6 (10.9) at T1, 31.7 (0.6) at T2, 93.7 (16.4) at T3(p < 0.05), 32.5 (20.9) at T4, and 14.2 (3.8) at T5 (p < 0.05). These changeswere paralleled by the mean (SD) HBD levels: T1 = 1,337 (616), T2 = 2,025 (509), T3 = 2,676 (1,170) (p < 0.05), T4 1,780 (618), and T5 = 1,310 (436).CONCLUSIONS: Thoratec VAD was associated with a mild degree of hemolysis. Thiswas worsened by concomitant use of CVVHF. The effect was accentuated if the same CVVHF circuit was used for over 48 hours but was reversible within 24 hours ofstopping the hemofilter.
