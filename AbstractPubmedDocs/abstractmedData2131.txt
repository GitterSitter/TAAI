The polyurethane VAD has two #21 Bjork-Shiley valves andthe internal diameter of the cannula is either 6 or 8 mm. Hemodynamic effects of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) on a HF after Fontan's procedure model,and those of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) on right HF with pulmonary hypertension model, were investigated in acute experiments with four and fivedogs, respectively. In the former, the pressure gradient across the lung andcardiac output (CO) increased with an LVAD; right atrial pressure decreased andCO increased with an RVAD in the latter. The pump was implanted as an LVAD in 8young goats, 9-22 kg in weight, for 4-10 weeks and favorable in vivo performance was demonstrated. The VAD system was applied as an LVAD to two postcardiotomypatients, a 12 kg boy with a ventricular septal defect, and a 13 kg boy with anendocardial cushion defect. In these cases, CO was well maintained at the levelof 2.5-4.1 L/min/m2 for three and seven days, respectively, and the pump wasremoved. In conclusion, this VAD will become a promising circulatory supportsystem for pediatric uses.
