The aim of this article is to present mechanical circulatoryassist devices used in infants and children with special emphasis onextracorporeal membrane oxygenation, Berlin Heart assist device, centrifugal pumpand Medos assist device. The success of long-term support with implantableventricular assist devices in adults and children has led to their increasing useas a bridge to transplantation in patients with otherwise non-treatable leftventricular failure, by transforming a terminal phase heart condition into atreatable cardiopathy. Such therapy allows rehabilitation of patients beforeelective cardiac transplantation (by removing contraindications totransplantation mainly represented by organ impairment) or acting as a bridge to recovery of the native left ventricular function (depending on underlying cardiacdisease). Treatment may also involve permanent device implantation when cardiactransplantation is contraindicated. Indications for the implantation of assisted circulation include all states of cardiac failure that are reversible within avariable period of time or that require heart transplantation. This article will address the current status of ventricular assist devices by examining historical aspects of its development, current technical issues and clinical features ofpediatric ventricular assist devices, including indications and contraindicationsfor support.PMCID: PMC3232507
