The purposes of this study are todescribe change in QOL from before to after hospital discharge in LVAD patientsand to determine whether being discharged with an LVAD predicts better QOL thanbeing hospitalized with an LVAD.METHODS: A non-random sample of 62 LVAD patients (approximately 50 years old,male, white, married, fairly well-educated) completed self-report questionnaires at >or=2 timepoints post-implant. The questionnaires (Quality of Life Index,Rating Question Form, Heart Failure Symptom Checklist, Sickness Impact Profile,LVAD Stressor Scale, Jalowiec Coping Scale), which were collated into booklets,had acceptable reliability and validity. Longitudinal analyses were performed in 2 steps using 1-sample t-tests and linear mixed effects modeling.RESULTS: Perception of QOL and health status were fairly good both before andafter discharge of LVAD patients. Discharge predicted increased satisfaction withsocioeconomic areas of life; decreased overall and psychologic stress and stress related to family and friends, self-care and work/school/finances; and decreased physical and self-care disability.CONCLUSIONS: QOL outcomes improved from before to after hospital discharge inLVAD patients awaiting heart transplantation. As LVADs potentially becomeavailable as destination therapy, in addition to being successful bridges toheart transplantation, QOL outcomes will become more important to study.
