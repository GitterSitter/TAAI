Cox regression models were used to determine theassociations between strain and strain rate and risk of all-cause mortality,cardiac transplantation, and ventricular-assist device placement. The area under the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) was also calculated at 1 year and 5 years.Over a maximum follow-up of 8.9 years, there were 138 events (33.2%). Inunadjusted models, all strain and strain rate parameters were associated withadverse outcomes (P<0.001). In multivariable models, all parameters with theexception of radial strain rate (P=0.11) remained independently associated, with patients in the lowest tertile of strain or strain rate parameter having a â‰ˆ2-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes compared with the reference group(P<0.05). Addition of strain to ejection fraction (EF) led to a significantlyimproved AUC at 1 year (0.697 versus 0.633, P=0.032) and 5 years (0.700 versus0.638, P=0.001). In contrast, strain rate did not provide incremental prognostic value to EF alone.CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal and circumferential strain and strain rate, and radial strain are associated with chronic heart failure prognosis. Strain providesincremental value to EF in the prediction of adverse outcomes, and withadditional study may be a clinically relevant prognostic tool.PMCID: PMC3959676
