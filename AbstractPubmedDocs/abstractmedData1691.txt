Can J Cardiol. 2002 Apr;18(4):380-7.Biventricular pacing improves quality of life and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure and intraventricular conduction delay.Krahn AD(1), Snell L, Yee R, Finan J, Skanes AC, Klein GJ.Author information: (1)London Health Sciences Centre, University Campus, London, Canada.akrahn@uwo.caBACKGROUND: Biventricular pacing improves left ventricular dysynchrony, leadingto improvement in congestive heart failure symptoms. The extent of placeboeffect, the predictors of response and the long term benefits are unknown.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with symptomatic congestive heartfailure underwent implantation of a biventricular pacing system over a 30-monthperiod (age 65 10 years, 37 men). Patients underwent implantation of abiventricular pacemaker or implantable defibrillator one month or longer afterstabilization of congestive heart failure on maximal medical therapy, includingangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 84% of patients and beta-blockers in 56% of patients. Three patients had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIheart failure, 34 had NYHA class III and eight had NYHA class IV. Cardiomyopathy was ischemic in 31 patients, dilated in 12 and the result of other causes in two.The left ventricular ejection fraction was 19 5%.RESULTS: Implantation of the biventricular pacing system was successful in 38 of 45 patients (84%). Two patients had successful implantation with a secondattempt, and one patient had an epicardial lead implant. Lead dislodgementoccurred in four patients, with successful repositioning in all. During a meanfollow-up of 10 7 months, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnairequality of life index score improved from 62 16 to 42 22 at one month (P<0.001), but subsequently returned to intermediate levels (55 26 at three months, 48 26 atsix months and 56 34 at one year, P=0.50). In seven patients with deferred deviceactivation, quality of life scores also improved by 10 15 points from baseline toone month with VDI 35 pacing, and improved a further 15 20 points with leftventricular lead activation. The mean NYHA class fell from 3.1 0.5 at baseline to2.7 0.7 at one month (P=0.006) and remained stable thereafter (2.8 0.9 at threemonths, 2.8 0.9 at six months). Six patients died during follow-up, one patienthad a cardiac transplantation and subsequently died, one patient had a successfulcardiac transplantation and one patient underwent insertion of a left ventricularassist device. Death occurred due to progressive heart failure in five patients, sudden death occurred in one patient and a noncardiovascular cause resulted inthe death of one patient. An analysis of NYHA responders (NYHA class improvement of 1 or more at last follow-up, 44% of patients) and quality of life responders(score improvement of 10 or more at last follow-up, 57% patients) did not showany difference in age, sex, heart failure etiology, QRS width, ejection fraction or baseline NYHA class.CONCLUSIONS: Biventricular pacing improves quality of life and NYHA class inpatients with advanced heart failure and intraventricular conduction delay. Theattenuated benefit seen over time may be related to initial placebo effect orsimple dual- chamber pacing, or the natural history of the underlying disease.Identification of patients most likely to respond to biventricular pacing was notpossible.
