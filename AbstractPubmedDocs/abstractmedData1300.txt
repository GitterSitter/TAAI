We reportour experience in treating severe pulmonary hypertension with mechanical leftventricular unloading using implantable nonpulsatile left ventricular assistdevices (LVAD) with continuous flow properties.METHODS: In ten patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, refractory tomedical treatment, an implantable nonpulsatile LVAD was placed for continuousmechanical left ventricular support. Pulmonary hemodynamics were assessed byright heart catheterization prior to and during LVAD implantation, and afterorthotopic heart transplantation.RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) interval of nonpulsatile support was 182 (+/-118) days.Pulmonary artery pressure (mean +/- SD) significantly decreased from 42 +/- 13 to24 +/- 5 mm Hg (p < 0.005), the transpulmonary gradient (mean +/- SD) decreasedfrom 20 +/- 6 to 11 +/-5 mm Hg (p < 0.005), and the pulmonary vascular resistance(mean +/- SD) from 4.8 +/- 1.8 to 2.2 +/- 0.8 Wood units (p < 0.005) during aninterval of one to six months of LVAD support. No significant increases inpulmonary artery pressure, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmonary vascularresistance were observed during an interval of three to six months afterorthotopic heart transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: This study supports that LVAD support and continuous nonpulsatilemechanical unloading of the left ventricle can reverse medically unresponsivepulmonary hypertension and render patients eligible for orthotopic hearttransplantation.
