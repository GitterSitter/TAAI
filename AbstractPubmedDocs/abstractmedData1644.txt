Heart Fail Monit. 2002;2(4):120-8.Mechanical circulatory support devices--state of the art.Deng MC(1), Naka Y.Author information: (1)Heart Failure Center and Division of Circulatory Physiology, Department ofMedicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New YorkPresbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA.Mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs) have been developed with the aimof bridging patients with advanced heart failure to cardiac transplantation, torecovery, and to serve as permanent support devices. The current generation ofdevices provides a differentiated spectrum of support, ranging from short-term tointermediate- and long-term duration, partial left ventricular (LV), complete LV,right ventricular, and biventricular options which can be tailored individually. The device positions range from paracorporeal to intracorporeal pumps withtranscutaneous drivelines, to completely implantable systems. Major limitationsare infection, coagulopathies, and device dysfunction. In this review, we discussthe history and experience with currently available MCSD options capable ofsupporting the circulation for 30 days.
