Msiegenth@aol.comOBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the surgical results and effects of continuous support with the permanent Jarvik-2000 left ventricular assist device (LVAD). We report the early outcomes.BACKGROUND: A shortage of transplant donors necessitates the testing ofalternative treatments. The Jarvik-2000 is an axial flow pump with a percutaneousretro-auricular power connector, designed for permanent use.METHODS: Patients with severe heart failure (HF), unsuitable for hearttransplantation or conventional LVAD support, were offered implantation. Thesurgical approach included a left lateral thoracotomy. The device was implantedinto the left ventricular apex on femoro-femoral bypass. It is set to allowpulsatile flow with an aortic valve opening. Anticoagulation is adjusted the sameas for patients with a heart valve.RESULTS: Between May 2001 and August 2001, we implanted the Jarvik-2000 in twopatients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in one with cardiac amyloidosis, allwith severe HF (cardiac index 1.8 +/- 0.3 l/m(2) per min). One patient requiredpreoperative inotropic support. All patients did well, with no repeat operations or infections. Patients received 4.3 +/- 3.2 packed red blood cells and wereintubated at 14 +/- 3 h, and the intensive care unit stay was 7.0 +/- 0.5 days.The cardiac index increased from 3.7 +/- 1.5 l/min per m(2) at 8,000 rpm to 5.9+/- 2.9 l/min per m(2) at 12,000 rpm. All patients currently have mild hemolysis not requiring transfusion. The following postoperative events were recorded: atransient ischemic attack with complete recovery, a short re-intubation due toventricular arrhythmia, loss of consciousness with a battery change whilestanding, knee-joint effusion after ergometry training, a minor wound problem anda short hospital re-admission due to dehydration. Patients were discharged homeafter 49 +/- 7 days; one has returned to work. All quality-of-life scores haveimproved.CONCLUSIONS: The permanent Jarvik-2000 appears safe. It can be used for dilative or restrictive disease. The Jarvik-2000 might prove a valid option for thelong-term treatment of patients with severe HF.
