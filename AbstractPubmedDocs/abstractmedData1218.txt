Patients who underwent primary VAD implantationbetween January 2001 and December 2006 and who were listed as transplantable (T) (group VAD-prim, n=159), and patients listed primarily in urgent status beforeVAD implantation and/or HTx during the same period (group U-prim, n=168) wereenrolled in the study. Group U-prim consists of subgroups: group U-HTx (n=123),who underwent primarily HTx in urgent status; group U-VAD (n=25), who underwentprimarily VAD implantation in urgent status; patients who died in urgent statusbefore HTx or VAD implantation (n=6); and patients in urgent status without HTxor VAD implantation (n=14). The survival rate in each group was studied.RESULTS: Survival rates after VAD implantation in group VAD-prim were comparable to those after urgent status listing in group U-prim (67.0% vs 68.5% for 1-yearsurvival, 56.6% vs 65.8% for 2-year survival, respectively). Actuarial survivalafter listing for urgent status in group U-HTx was significantly better than thatin group U-VAD (73.7% vs 46.0% for 1-year survival, p<0.05, log-rank test).Actuarial survival during mechanical circulatory support after the VADimplantation (censored at HTx or weaning from the device) in group VAD-prim wassignificantly better than that in group U-VAD (80.7% vs 56.2% for 3-monthsurvival, p<0.001, log-rank test).CONCLUSIONS: In order to receive urgent HTx, HTx candidates may choose urgencylisting without primary VAD implantation at the risk of failed donor heartallocation in urgent status. However, the prognosis of the patients in the lattersituation is poor.
