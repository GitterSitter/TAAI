The combination of LVADs and cell transplantation (CTx) is expected tobe effective to improve the success rate of LVAD removal. We investigated thefeasibility of combined CTx therapy and LVAD support with a new heterotopic ratheart-lung transplantation model that could simulate LVAD support and LVADremoval. The heart and both lungs of a rat were heterotopically transplanted, andthe heart was kept unloaded for two weeks. The heart was then reloaded for twoweeks (LVAD group). Syngenic smooth muscle cells were transplanted into thehearts that had been unloaded for a week, and the hearts were kept unloaded foranother week and then reloaded (CT-LVAD group). In the unloaded state, CTx could reduce the left ventricle (LV) volume more effectively than LVAD therapy alone(P<0.01) and maintain the LV volume even after the hearts were reloaded (P<0.01).The results suggest that CTx with LVAD support can prevent recurrent LV dilation after LVAD removal and improve the success rate of LVAD removal.
