Epub 2013 Jan 22.Effect of percutaneous ventricular assist devices on renal function.Mao H(1), Giuliani A, Blanca-Martos L, Kim JC, Nayak A, Virzi G, Brocca A,Scalzotto E, Neri M, Katz N, Ronco C.Author information: (1)Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are used to improve the systemic circulationand to decrease ventricular loading in patients with hemodynamic instability thatis refractory to pharmacologic therapies. During an acute critical event,percutaneous devices are preferred because of their rapid deployment, sinceimplantable devices require more extensive procedures. Implantable devices areused for patients with established end-stage heart failure as a bridge to hearttransplantation, recovery or destination therapy. This report reviews mechanical principles and clinical studies regarding percutaneous VAD to address theirpotential renal effects. Since the focus of this study is set on devices that arededicated to cardiac support only, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systemsare not included.Copyright Â© 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.
