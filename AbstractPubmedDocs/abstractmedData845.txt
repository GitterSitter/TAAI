This process may be reversible in somepacemaker-dependent patients upgraded to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).We examined the clinical characteristics of pacemaker-dependent patients whoexhibit hyperresponse (i.e., normalization of LV function) with CRT upgrade.METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 51 chronically RV-paced patients with nocoronary artery disease, LV ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35%, and severe HF symptoms who were upgraded to CRT-defibrillators (CRT-D). Echocardiograms were performedbefore and ≥6 months after CRT. Patients with follow-up LVEF ≥ 50% were deemedhyperresponders. Clinical outcomes of death, cardiac transplant, mechanicalcirculatory support, and HF hospitalizations were assessed. Fifteen patients wereCRT hyperresponders; all demonstrated ≥15% relative LV end-systolic volumedecrease. Hyperresponders had smaller baseline LV dimensions and shorter knowncardiomyopathy duration than nonhyperresponders (P < 0.01). The best predictorsof hyperresponse using receiver operating characteristic analysis were LVend-systolic dimension <48 mm (area under the curve [AUC] 0.92, P < 0.001), LVend-diastolic dimension <58 mm (AUC 0.86, P < 0.001), and cardiomyopathy duration<24 months (AUC 0.82, P < 0.001). No hyperresponders died, received a cardiactransplant, or required mechanical circulatory support during 42 ± 22 monthsfollow-up, whereas 5 nonhyperresponders died, 2 underwent transplant, and 1required an assist device (log rank P = 0.049).CONCLUSION: Among chronically RV paced patients who are upgraded to CRT-D,smaller baseline LV dimensions and shorter known cardiomyopathy duration predict hyperresponse. Hyperresponders have excellent long-term survival.© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
