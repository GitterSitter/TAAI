Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2001 Oct;49(5):296-9.Outpatients on biventricular assist devices.Drews T(1), Loebe M, Jurmann M, zu Dohna R, Erben M, Hetzer R.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches HerzzentrumBerlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany. dr.drews@berlin.deAs waiting times for transplants have lengthened, long-term mechanicalcirculatory support (MCS) has become more common in patients who present withsevere cardiogenic shock leading to multiorgan failure. With these patients, weused the biventricular assist device (BVAD, Berlin Heart). In this report, wewill describe our 4 years of experience with 11 patients on a BVAD who weredischarged home while awaiting transplantation. The 11 patients underwent BVADimplantation from 1997 to 2000. These were 2 women and 9 men. The mean supporttime was 382 days (range: 156 - 567). The indication for BVAD wascardiomyopathy--six dilated, one restrictive and four ischemic. These patientswere monitored for infections, thromboembolic events, bleeding complications, andpsychological effects during the time they spent at home. Our experience showsthat all of the patients could leave hospital following sufficient training fordressings and anticoagulation after recovering completely from secondary organdysfunction. The mean time period the patients spent at home was 48 days (range: 3 - 182) days. Seven patients (63 %) had to be readmitted to the hospital--due totransitory ischemic attacks in two cases, hemorrhoidal bleeding in one and wound infections in four cases. One patient died of a traumatic accident during sexual activity. The use of a BVAD is feasible for outpatient use as a bridge totransplantation. It ensures the survival of the patient, enables recovery frommultiorgan failure and offers an acceptable quality of life.
