Long-term hemodynamic support was accomplished with an early "bridge" to ventricular assist device (VAD) before definitive treatment with cardiactransplantation.METHODS: A respective review of ECMO and VAD data registries was instituted.RESULTS: From May 1996 to July 2000, 23 patients were placed on ECMO support for profound cardiogenic circulatory failure. Eleven patients (47%) were withdrawnfrom support due to severe neurologic injury or multisystem organ failure. Three patients (13%) were weaned off ECMO with good outcome. Nine patients (39%) weretransferred to a VAD. Two patients expired while on VAD support, and 7 of theVAD-supported patients (78%) survived to transplantation. Overall survival was43%.CONCLUSIONS: Emergent ECMO support is a salvage approach for cardiacresuscitation once conventional measures have failed. In neurologically intactpatients, the early transfer to a VAD quickly stabilizes hemodynamics, avoidscomplications, and is essential for long-term circulatory support beforedefinitive treatment with cardiac transplantation.
