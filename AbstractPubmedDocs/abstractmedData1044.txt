The HeartMate LVAS, the only deviceapproved for bridge to transplant and destination therapy, has limiteddurability, making replacement increasingly necessary. Since 1996, we haveexchanged 19 left ventricular assist devices in 15 patients (11 men: mean age,57.1 years; range, 33-77 years). Most of the devices (14) were replaced with the HeartMate vented electric/extended-lead vented electric pump; five devices wereexchanged for a HeartMate II LVAS. Bearing failure was the most frequent reasonfor exchange (15 of 19 pumps); four of the 19 pumps also had activedevice-related infections at the time of exchange. There were no early deaths (30days). Overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) was 85% at 1 year, 67% at 2 years, and 56%at 3 years. Three patients had transplants (mean, 518 days); six patients diedduring support (mean, 934 days), and six patients remain on LVAS support (mean,1,219 days). One patient has been on device for over 6 years. Left ventricularassist devices exchange is becoming increasingly likely and can be associatedwith acceptably low-operative mortality rates and good intermediate-termsurvival.
