METHODS AND RESULTS: Dataincluding P-AVP were obtained from 162 in-hospital patients with stage D HF andfrom 80 patients receiving ventricular assist device (VAD, n=46) or hearttransplantation (HTx, n=34) at 3 months after surgery. In the HF group,considerably high P-AVP (5.9±6.1 pg/ml) negatively correlated with serum sodiumconcentration (S-Na, 135.3±5.8 mEq/L, r=-0.548 [P<0.01]) and cardiac index (CI,2.2±0.5 L·min(-1)·m(-2), r=-0.458 [P<0.01]). After VAD/HTx treatment, improvementin the CI (2.7±0.5 L·min(-1)·m(-2)[P<0.01] vs. HF) was accompanied bynormalization of serum sodium concentration (S-Na; 138.2±2.0 mEq/L [P<0.01] vs.HF) and suppressed release of AVP (1.7±3.4 pg/ml [P<0.01] vs. HF). P-AVPpositively correlated with only S-Na (r=0.454 [P<0.01]), whereas no correlationwas observed with CI after VAD/HTx treatment. P-AVP ≥5.3 pg/ml well predictedpoor 2-year survival in HF group (60% [P<0.01] vs. 90%).CONCLUSIONS: Low cardiac output stimulates AVP release via a non-osmotic process that results in hyponatremia and poor prognosis in patients with stage D HF.After sufficient recovery of cardiac output by cardiac replacement therapy, AVPrelease is suppressed and is mainly regulated by serum osmolality.
