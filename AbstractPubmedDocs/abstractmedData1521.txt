We hypothesized that recovery of the cytoskeleton, a major site ofmechanotransduction in cardiac myocytes, is crucial for sustained improvement of myocardial function. We therefore measured the effects of LVAD support on 4cytoskeletal proteins in single human heart cells.METHODS: Myocytes were isolated from non-failing (NF), hypertrophied (H), failing(F) and LVAD-supported failing (L) human hearts. Protein quantitation wasperformed using Western blot analysis and cellular distribution was determined byimmunolabeling and confocal microscopy.RESULTS: alpha-actinin did not differ in cells from H or F as compared with NF,and L had no effect. Vinculin was not quantitatively different in H or F vs NF,but localization at the intercalated disks was significantly decreased in H andabsent in F, and this pattern was consistently reversed in L. Desmin protein was significantly increased in F vs NF, both in quantity and distribution, and these increases were reversed in L. beta-tubulin was increasingly polymerized in H and F, and the hyperpolymerization was reversed in L.CONCLUSIONS: On the level of the single cardiomyocyte, major proteins of thecytoskeleton are significantly altered in hypertrophied and failing human hearts.These alterations are reversed by mechanical unloading with an LVAD, suggestingthat the cytoskeleton is not the limiting factor in determining full cardiacrecovery.
