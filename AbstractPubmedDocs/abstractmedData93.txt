[Epub ahead of print]Double organ transplantation in cardiac amyloidosis.Gkouziouta A(1), Farmakis D, Manginas A, Sfyrakis P, Saroglou G, Adamopoulos S,Iliodromitis EK.Author information: (1)aOnassis Cardiac Surgery Center bSecond Department of Cardiology, AttikonUniversity Hospital cFirst Department of Internal Medicine, Laiko HospitaldDepartment of Cardiology, Mediterraneo Hospital, Athens, Greece.BACKGROUND: Cardiac amyloidosis, particularly primary or AL amyloidosis, is themost common infiltrative cardiomyopathy and is associated with a poor prognosis. The outcome of cardiac transplantation is generally poor, and almost half ofpatients die while waiting for the procedure to be done.PATIENT: We report here the remarkable case of a 63-year-old man with heartfailure caused by AL amyloidosis. After a long course, which included rapiddeterioration of preexisting heart failure, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock,biventricular assist device support, heart transplantation, renal failure, kidneytransplantation and finally a life-threatening H1N1 virus pneumonia, the patient managed not only to survive but also to return fully to his previous demandingduties and lifestyle.DISCUSSION: Early use of left ventricular or biventricular mechanical circulatorysupport may be beneficial as a bridge to transplantation in patients with cardiacAL amyloidosis.
