Conversion fromECMO to ventricular assist device (VAD) is reasonable, and we have developed asimple algorithm for selecting proper VADs for these ECMO-supported patients.METHODS: We converted 12 patients who were receiving ECMO support to VAD forbridge to transplantation. Group I (n = 6) was converted directly from ECMO toVAD. Group II (n = 6) underwent stage conversion. We added left atrial drainageto ECMO because of lung edema or marked left heart distension. We discontinueddrainage after recovery of right heart function. Group II had more unfavorablerisk factors for VAD before ECMO.RESULTS: Three patients (50%) in Group I received biventricular VADs. The other 3patients were converted to left ventricular assist device (LVAD), but only 1(16.7%) experienced successful conversion. We successfully converted 5 patients(83.3%) in Group II to LVAD without right VAD, and 4 of them could be weaned fromthe ventilator. The multiple-organ dysfunction score gradually improved in Group II despite additional surgery. Two patients in each group received hearttransplantation and survived long term.CONCLUSION: Using a conversion protocol provides a good guideline for makingdecisions. According to the protocol, right heart and pulmonary function can beclearly assured before shifting to LVAD in these critical ECMO-supportedpatients.
