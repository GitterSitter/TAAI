So long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been proposed as an alternative treatment option to assist patients scheduled on HTx waiting listbridging them for a variable time period to cardiac transplantation-the so-calledbridge-to-transplantation (BTT) strategy. Nowadays approximately 90% of patients being considered for MCS receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Infact, LVAD experienced several improvements in the last decade and thepredominance of continuous-flow over pulsatile-flow technology has been evidentsince 2008. The aim of the present report is to give an overview ofcontinuous-flow LVAD utilization in the specific setting of the BTT strategytaking into consideration the most representative articles of the scientificliterature and focusing the attention on the evolution, clinical outcomes,relevant implications on the HTx strategy and future perspectives of thecontinuous-flow LVAD technology.PMCID: PMC4387421
