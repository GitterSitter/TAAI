Epub 2009 Feb 20.Successful bridge to transplant with the Berlin Heart after cavopulmonary shunt.Irving CA(1), Cassidy JV, Kirk RC, Griselli M, Hasan A, Crossland DS.Author information: (1)Department of Paediatric Cardiac Transplantation, Freeman Hospital,Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.Mechanical cardiac assistance for infants and children may be accomplished using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ventricular assist device support, and arenow well established as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or recovery inbiventricular hearts, usually in the setting of low cardiac output states due to cardiomyopathy or acute myocarditis. Ventricular assist device support remainsless well described in the setting of single ventricle physiology. We report the case of a 3-year-old girl who developed severe right ventricular failure 2 years after cavopulmonary shunt after an initial Stage I Norwood operation forhypoplastic left heart syndrome. She was successfully supported to cardiactransplantation using a single chamber Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assistdevice using right ventricular apex and aortic cannulation and is now well athome 10 months after transplant.
