This approach assumes a priori that animal(patho)physiology will closely match that of humans. Systemic aortic inputimpedance (Z(ART)) is an important physiologic determinant of left ventricular(LV) performance. We tested the hypothesis that Z(ART) is lower in bovine andporcine than in humans with normal or failing hearts.METHODS: High-fidelity aortic pressure and flow waveforms were recordedintra-operatively at native and paced heart rates of 100 beats per minute (bpm)in adult human patients with normal LV function (n = 13) or end-stage HF (n =15), and normal calves (n = 10) and pigs (n = 18). Fast Fourier transformationwas used to calculate Z(ART), and arterial resistance and compliance wereestimated using a 4-element Windkessel model.RESULTS: Humans with HF had greater Z(ART) than those with normal LV function,characterized by higher resistance (1.16 +/- 0.12 vs 1.00 +/- 0.10 mm Hg x s/ml, p < 0.05) and lower compliance (1.53 +/- 0.21 vs 1.88 +/- 0.33 ml x mm Hg, p <0.05). Healthy calves and pigs had significantly lower resistance (calf: 0.63 +/-0.07 mm Hg x s/ml; pig: 0.90 +/- 0.07 mm Hg x s/ml) and higher compliance (calf: 2.79 +/- 0.37 ml x mm Hg; pig: 2.80 +/- 0.64 ml x mm Hg) when compared to humans (p < 0.05) with normal or failing hearts.CONCLUSIONS: Z(ART) is significantly lower in calves and pigs than in humans withor without HF. This finding has important implications for the pre-clinicaltesting of MCS devices and xenotransplants, which are usually examined in bovine and porcine models, respectively. Specifically, these therapies may responddifferently in humans than animals due to non-equivalence of systemic after-load.
