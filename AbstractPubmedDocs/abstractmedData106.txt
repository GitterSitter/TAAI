However, the specific effects of combined Cl+β1 blockadeduring MU are unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the chronic effects (4 weeks) of β2-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation via Cl (2 mg/kg/day) alone, and in combination with β1-ARblockade using metoprolol ((Met), 250 mg/kg/day), on whole heart/cell structure, function and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in failing (induced by leftcoronary artery (LCA) ligation), and unloaded (induced by heterotopic abdominalheart transplantation (HATx)) failing rat hearts. Combined Cl+Met therapydisplayed favourable effects in HF: Met enhanced Cl's improvement in ejectionfraction (EF) whilst preventing Cl-induced hypertrophy and tachycardia. During MUcombined therapy was less beneficial than either mono-therapy. Met, not Cl,prevented MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with increased atrophy occurring during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+ transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content was enhanced equally by Cl or Metmono-therapy, but these benefits, together with Cl's enhancement of sarcomericcontraction speed, and MU-induced recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency, disappearedduring combined therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Combined Cl+Met therapy shows superior functional effects tomono-therapy in rodent HF, but appears inferior to either mono-therapy inenhancing MU-induced recovery of EC coupling. These results suggest that combinedβ2-AR simulation +β1-AR blockade therapy is likely to be a safe and beneficialtherapeutic HF strategy, but is not as effective as mono-therapy in enhancingmyocardial recovery during LVAD support.PMCID: PMC4181979
