Nihon Rinsho. 1993 May;51(5):1305-9.[Mechanical circulatory support for profound heart failure].[Article in Japanese]Kitamura M(1), Nishida H, Koyanagi H.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tokyo Women's Medical College.Profound heart failure, such as acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenicshock and postcardiotomy ventricular failure, requires mechanical circulatorysupport when recent medical treatment is ineffective. Intra-aortic balloonpumping, venoarterial bypass, cardiopulmonary bypass, left ventricular bypass,biventricular bypass and left ventricular assist device are commonly usedcirculatory support methods. Type selection and application timing of circulatorysupports, based on the understanding of type of cardiac failure, respiratoryfunction and other organ conditions, appears to be most important for successful treatment of profound heart failure.
