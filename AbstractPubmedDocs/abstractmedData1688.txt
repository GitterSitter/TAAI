This articlereviews our experience with VAD therapy from the start of our outpatient program until the present.METHODS: Medical records of patients who received a Thoratec para-corporeal VAD, HeartMate vented electrical VAD, or HeartMate pneumatic VAD between 12/1/97 and9/1/01 were reviewed. Variables included age, type of devices, total duration of VAD support, discharge status, duration of outpatient support, outcome(transplanted, died on support, ongoing), in-hospital length of stay aftertransplantation, and complications during VAD support.RESULTS: There were 53 device implants in 46 patients. The cumulativepatient-days of VAD support was 7,468 (mean duration of support, 138 +/- 195days; median, 95 days; range, 2 to 948 days). Twenty of the 46 patients weredischarged with a VAD. The cumulative outpatient days was 3,600 (mean outpatient duration, 157 +/- 164 days; median, 83 days; maximum, 560 days). Of the 20outpatients, 11 received cardiac transplantation, 5 died, and 4 are ongoing as of9/1/01. Major complications that occurred in the outpatient setting included 5deaths after hospital readmission (1 sepsis, 1 conduit tear, 3 neurologicevents); 4 device infections (3 sepsis, 1 pouch infection); and 3 devicemalfunctions that required reoperation for pump replacement (1 HeartMatepneumatic and 2 HeartMate vented electrical). No deaths occurred in an outpatientsetting.CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular assist devices effectively support outpatients formonths to years. The anticipated time for postoperative recovery and VAD trainingbefore discharge is approximately 14 to 21 days, although shorter times may bepossible in the future. Establishing a successful outpatient VAD program is acrucial step toward VAD as definitive therapy for end-stage heart disease.
