An additional argument for the preservation of the recipient's own heart.Losman JG, Levine H, Campbell CD, Replogle RL, Hassoulas J, Novitsky D, CooperDK, Barnard CN.The 1 year survival rate after heart transplantation since 1967 from +/-30% to+/-70%, and the 5 year survival rate is now +/-50%. This improvement has brought renewed interest in this procedure, now done in about twenty centers in eightcountries, and increased confidence has widened the indication to patients whoare less than terminally ill, to restore quality of life. This trend isillustrated by the Cape Town series, which can be divided into two parts: 10patients treated by orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), from 1967 to 1973,and 40 patients treated by heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT), from 1974 to 1981. The HHT group was younger (mean 37 +/- 10 years versus 51 +/- 9 years, pless than 0.001), had been ill for a shorter length of time (mean 3.6 +/- 0.7years versus 6.6 +/- 1.4 years, p less than 0.091), and were in a lower New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (mean 3.45 +/- 0.11 versus 3.9 +/- 1.0, p lessthan 0.006). The improved survival is linked to patient selection, progress inmanagement, and switch to HHT, but not to progress in matching between donor and recipient. Since there is no means to predict tolerance of the donor heart, HHTlimits the risks from unforseeable mismatch. The recipient's heart is a built-in assist device, maintaining life when the donor heart fails acutely at operationor during acute [three cases] or chronic [two cases] rejection. Had thesepatients undergone OHT they would have died. Comparing the 10 oldest HHT patientswith the OHT series, no difference in pretransplant parameters was found.However, survival of HHT recipients was longer during the critical post-HHTperiod: at 3 months, p less than 0.011; at 6 months, p less than 0.05. Largerseries will separate the effects of progress in management from the intrinsicadvantages of HHT. Retaining the recipient's heart is logical and has brought fewcomplications. Survival rate of 40 HHT patients was 73% at 6, 65% at 12, and 51% at 36 months; 85% of survivors are in NYHA Class I. In patients in less thandesperate condition, but who refuse to remain cripples, HHT eliminates thegrowing ethical problem of removing a recipient's heart that may still supportthe patient.
