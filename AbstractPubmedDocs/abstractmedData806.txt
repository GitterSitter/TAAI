As HIV has become achronic illness with the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART),cardiac transplantation has been used for selected HIV patients with end-stageheart failure. We present a case series describing the clinical outcomes withleft ventricular assist device (LVAD) use in 4 patients with HIV. Three of thepatients are alive: 1 after a successful bridge to transplant and the other 2 on continued device support at 18 and 13 months after implantation. No infectiouscomplications occurred in 3 patients, and no opportunistic infections occurred inthe fourth patient. De novo allosensitization did not occur in our patients afterLVAD implantation. With the ongoing donor shortage, implantation of an LVAD inadvanced heart failure patients with HIV with controlled viremia on HAARTrepresents a viable option.Copyright © 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
