ASAIO Trans. 1988 Jul-Sep;34(3):476-9.Nonpulsatile ventricular assist bridging to transplantation.Golding LA(1), Stewart RW, Sinkewich M, Smith W, Cosgrove DM.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cleveland ClinicFoundation, Ohio 44106.Six patients accepted into a cardiac transplantation program have been supported with a Biomedicus LVAD. Five of the six patients deteriorated while awaiting adonor organ; the sixth was being supported with a device following mitral valvesurgery and showed no recovery of ventricular function. In all cases the devicewas used only after all other therapeutic modalities had failed. The periods ofsupport ranged from 2.5 to 31 days, mean of 10 days. Three patients underwentcardiac transplantation and all three have been discharged and are well. Thethree survivors were supported for 2.5, 3, and 31 days. Three deaths occurred in the patients supported for 5, 9, and 15 days, the causes being sepsis, massivecerebral embolism, and respiratory failure. Patients were for the most partmaintained with some degree of heparinization, and hemolysis was a significantproblem in only one patient and associated with a very small arterial returncannula. Flows were routinely maintained above 2.4 L/min/m2, and all showedrecovery of other organ functions while being supported. The patient supportedfor 31 days was capable of limited mobilization by use of the removable drivesystem. The Biomedicus LVAD represents a relatively inexpensive support modality for patients awaiting cardiac transplantation.
