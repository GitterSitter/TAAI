Epub 2013 Sep 11.Comparison of continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow blood pumps on reducingpulmonary artery pressure in patients with fixed pulmonary hypertension.Ozturk P(1), Engin AY, Nalbantgil S, Oguz E, Ayik F, Engin C, Yagdi T, Erkul S,Balcioglu O, Ozbaran M.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Ege University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered as a risk factor for morbidity andmortality in patients undergoing heart transplantation. Recently, leftventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation has been increasingly used inreducing pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with PH unresponsive tomedical therapy. Herein, we aimed to compare the efficacy of continuous-flow and pulsatile-flow blood pumps on the improvement of PH in mechanical circulatorysupport patients. Twenty-seven patients with end-stage heart failure whounderwent LVAD implantation surgery were enrolled. Fifteen of them (55.6%) hadcontinuous-flow pump (HeartWare Ventricular Assist System, HeartWare, Inc.,Miramar, FL, USA), and 12 of them (44.4%) had pulsatile pump (Berlin Heart EXCOR ventricular assist device, Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany). The efficacy ofLVADs on the improvement of PH was compared between continuous-flow and pulsatilepumps by the evaluation of systolic PAP, tricuspid annular plane systolicexcursion (TAPSE), right ventricular systolic motion (RVSM), right ventricularejection fraction (RVEF), and grade of tricuspid insufficiency (TI) for each ofthe study participants. All of the 15 patients who underwent continuous-flowblood pump implantation surgery (Group 1) were male with a mean age of 46.9 ±11.7 years, and in pulsatile-flow blood pump implanted participants (Group 2),the mean age was 40.6 ± 16.8 years, all of whom were also male (P=0.259). Meanfollow-up was 313.7 ± 241.3 days in Group 1 and 448.7 ± 120.7 days in Group 2(P=0.139). In Group 1, mean preoperative and postoperative systolic PAP weremeasured as 51.7 ± 12.2 mm Hg and 22.2 ± 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, while those in Group 2 were 54.5 ± 7.5 mm Hg and 33.9 ± 6.4 mm Hg, respectively. A significantlygreater decrease in systolic PAP was noticed in patients with continuous-flowblood pumps (P=0.023); however, no statistically significant difference was foundwhen we considered the change in TAPSE between study groups (P=0.112). Astatistical significance in the alteration of RVEF, RVSM, and the grade of TIduring study visits was not found between the study groups (P=0.472, P=0.887, andP=0.237, respectively). Although the two studied types of LVADs were found to be effective in reducing PAP in heart transplantation candidates with PH, lesserpostoperative systolic PAP values were achieved in patients who underwentcontinuous-flow pump implantation surgery.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs andTransplantation.
