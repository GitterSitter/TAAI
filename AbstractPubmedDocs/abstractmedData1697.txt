A promising experimental technique is the use of pumping chambers formed from the latissimus dorsi muscle. We formedsuch skeletal muscle ventricles (SMVs) and connected them to the descendingthoracic aorta in a single surgical procedure in pigs. Activation of conditioned SMVs from the end of systole for 80% of diastole increased mean aortic diastolic blood pressure by 11.2 +/- 1.6% in 1 animal and by 15.8 +/- 0.3% in another. The left-ventricular stroke work in the postassisted beat was decreased by 8.7 +/-5.8% and 10.1 +/- 2.2% and the overall stroke work by 7.4 +/- 1.2% and 9.4 +/-0.8%. The key to forming and connecting the SMV in a single procedure was the useof a composite homograft lining. In future clinical practice, this componentcould be replaced by a synthetic composite or by a tissue lining produced invitro.
