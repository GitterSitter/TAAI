The current reviewsummarizes recent findings from in vitro and in vivo studies, focusing on thebiological features and the possible role of progenitor cells in the transientmyocardial recovery, occasionally seen after VAD implantation, and speculates on their clinical utilities for the treatment of the failing human heart.
