We report the case of a 44-year-old manwith severe acute ischemic heart failure who was supported with the Thoratecparacorporeal biventricular assist system. After an initial uneventfulpostoperative course the patient experienced a splenic rupture which required asplenectomy. The pathological mechanism of this outcome remains unclear. Twomonths after discharge, the patient underwent heart transplantation and had nopostsplenectomy sepsis or thrombotic complications at the last follow-up.
