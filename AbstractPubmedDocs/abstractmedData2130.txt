ASAIO Trans. 1989 Jul-Sep;35(3):611-3.Characteristics of blood rheology in patients during Novacor left ventricularassist system support.Hung TC(1), Butter DB, Kormos RL, Sun Z, Borovetz HS, Griffith BP, Yie CL.Author information: (1)Department of Neurosurgery, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, PA15213.Blood rheologic properties were studied in 11 patients on Novacor LVAS support(1-126 days) as a bridge to transplantation. Overall, these patients showedslight increases in mean blood viscosity and red cell rigidity. Their mean plasmafibrinogen was in the upper normal range. However, the degree of rheologic changeobserved, and the individual factors affected most, were unique to each patientand hemorheologic results correlated well with the patient's clinical status.
