The natural long-term trajectory of survivalfree of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant in patientswith ambulatory class IV symptoms who underwent CRT has not been established. We extracted clinical data on 723 consecutive patients with NYHA class III orambulatory class IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, and aQRS duration ≥120 ms who underwent CRT from September 30, 2003, to August 6,2007. Chart notes immediately before CRT were reviewed to confirm NYHA classstatus before CRT. Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox proportionalhazards model were constructed to determine long-term survival free of hearttransplant and LVAD based on NYHA class status. Of the 723 patients, 52 hadambulatory class IV symptoms. Over a mean follow-up of 5.0 ± 2.5 yearscontrolling for many possible confounders, ambulatory NYHA class IV status wasindependently associated with poor long-term outcomes. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and5-year survival free of LVAD or heart transplant for class III versus ambulatory class IV patients was 92.0%, 84.0%, 75.0%, 68.1%, and 63.2% versus 75.0%, 61.5%, 52.0%, 45%, and 40.4%, respectively. Although patients with ambulatory class IVheart failure receiving CRT have inferior long-term outcomes compared with those with class III symptoms, survival in class IV patients continues to parallelclass III patients over an extended follow-up. At 5 years, survival free of LVAD or heart transplant in ambulatory class IV patients receiving CRT is 40%.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
