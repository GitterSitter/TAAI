Epub 2012 Aug 17.The future of heart transplantation.Kobashigawa JA(1).Author information: (1)Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA. Kobashigawaj@cshs.orgThe field of heart transplantation has seen significant progress in the past 40years. However, the breakthroughs in long-term outcome have seen stagnation inthe past decade. Through advances in genomics and transcriptomics, there is hope that an era of personalized transplant therapy lies in the future. To see whereheart transplantation truly fits into the long term, searching for andunderstanding the alternative approaches for heart failure therapy is bothimportant and inevitable. The application of mechanical circulatory support hascontributed to the largest advancement in treatment of end stage heart failure.It has already been approved for destination therapy of heart failure, andgreater portability and ease of use of the device will be the future trend.Although it is still not prime time for stem cell therapy, clinical experienceshave already suggested its potential therapeutic effects. And finally, wholeorgan engineering is on the horizon as new techniques have opened the way forthis to proceed. In the end, progress on alternative therapies largely depends onour deeper understanding of the mechanisms of heart failure and how to preventit.Â© Copyright 2012 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Societyof Transplant Surgeons.
