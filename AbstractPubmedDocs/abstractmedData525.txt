Epub 2012Dec 11.Devices in the management of advanced, chronic heart failure.Abraham WT(1), Smith SA.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Ohio State University, 473 West 12th Avenue, Room 110P, Columbus, OH 43210-1252, USA. william.abraham@osumc.eduHeart failure (HF) is a global phenomenon, and the overall incidence andprevalence of the condition are steadily increasing. Medical therapies haveproven efficacious, but only a small number of pharmacological options are indevelopment. When patients cease to respond adequately to optimal medicaltherapy, cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to improve symptoms,reduce hospitalizations, promote reverse remodelling, and decrease mortality.However, challenges remain in identifying the ideal recipients for this therapy. The field of mechanical circulatory support has seen immense growth since theearly 2000s, and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have transitioned overthe past decade from large, pulsatile devices to smaller, more-compact,continuous-flow devices. Infections and haematological issues are still importantareas that need to be addressed. Whereas LVADs were once approved only for'bridge to transplantation', these devices are now used as destination therapyfor critically ill patients with HF, allowing these individuals to return to the community. A host of novel strategies, including cardiac contractilitymodulation, implantable haemodynamic-monitoring devices, and phrenic and vagusnerve stimulation, are under investigation and might have an impact on the futurecare of patients with chronic HF.PMCID: PMC3753073
