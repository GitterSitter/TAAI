Zentralbl Chir. 1993;118(11):687-90.[Initial experience with the NOVACOR left heart assist system in transition forheart transplantation at the Grosshadern Clinic].[Article in German]Kaulbach HG(1), Vetter HO, Reichenspurner H, Peiffer M, Schindler G, Röll W,Reichart B.Author information: (1)Herzchirurgische Klinik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Klinikum Grosshadern,München.We recently used an electrically powered left ventricular assist device (NOVACOR Corp., Oakland, Calif.) to support the circulation of a 17-year-old man withprofound circulatory impairment. He had been regularly listed for cardiactransplantation previously because of dilated cardiomyopathy, and decompensatedacutely with severe biventricular failure before a suitable donor heart becameavailable. Isolated left ventricular support with the NOVACOR system providedadequate haemodynamics and recovery of right ventricular, hepatic and renalfunction. After 2 days of support, orthotopic heart transplantation could beperformed successfully. Five days after transplantation he developed a massivecerebral haemorrhage during a hypertensive crisis of which he recoveredcompletely after neurosurgery without any residuals. He ist currently doingextremely well some 14 months after transplantation.
