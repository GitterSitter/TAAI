Ventricular assist devices have become increasinglyutilized for patients waiting for heart transplantation as well as those who willbe maintained on a permanent support. The Heartmate II, which was recently given Food and Drug Administration approval as a bridge-to-transplant device, has aparticular anomaly that complicates patient management. The pulse width modulatorof the Heartmate II produces electromagnetic noise that interferes with theability to interrogate and program certain defibrillators, and explantation ofthe defibrillator has been reported as the only viable solution.METHODS: The authors describe the use of cast-iron pans to reduce theelectromagnetic interference between St. Jude Medical's first-generation Atlasfamily of defibrillators (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) and the Heartmate II pump.RESULTS: The use of a simple shielding protocol avoids the need to remove apre-existing defibrillator from a patient receiving support from the Heartmate IIventricular assist device.CONCLUSIONS: The method described herein is important as future generations ofmedical devices may present different types of device-device interactions. Simplebedside methods to eliminate interference can potentially help patients who wouldotherwise need one or another device removed.
