It is unknown whether the use of short-term VAD support in patients with cardiogenicshock affects HTx outcome. We sought to investigate long-term outcomes of HUtransplanted patients with VAD compared with HU transplanted patients withoutdevice support.METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all HTx patients transplanted between 1999 and 2011 in our institution. Patients were categorized by urgency: elective HTx, HU-HTx with VAD (status 0), and HU-HTx without VAD (status 1). Actuarial survivalrates were compared.RESULTS: Of 237 transplanted patients, 55 (23%) were HU-HTx, including 16 on VAD support and 39 without VAD. Mean time in the HU waiting list was 6.5 ± 6 days andmean VAD support was 8.4 ± 8 days (range, 1 to 31 days). Assist devices used wereLevitronix Centrimag (6), Abiomed (9), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) (1). After a mean follow-up of 4.6 ± 4.1 years (range 0 to 13 years), 22patients had died: 5 VAD and 17 non-VAD. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were73% and 61% for the VAD and 74% and 62% for the non-VAD group, respectively (P = ns). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses did not show survival differences, HR 1.11 (95% CI 0.41-3.02), P = 0.84. The presence of renal failure wasassociated with increased mortality risk, HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2), P = 0.02. The presence of renal failure was associated with increased mortality risk [HR 1.9(95% CI 1.1-3.2), P = .02.).CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the long-term outcome of patients receivingHU-HTx under short-term VAD support is comparable to that of patients undergoing HU-HTx without VAD support. Patients with renal failure had an increased risk foroverall mortality in this set of patients.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
