We describe improved surgical techniquesfor INCOR LVAD explantation.METHODS: The outcome of INCOR LVAD implantation at our center and the operativetechniques of device explantation were studied. The patients weaned from thedevice were followed up.RESULTS: Out of 121 patients supported by the device, five (4.1 %) were weanedfrom the device, whereas 34 patients (28.1 %) underwent heart transplantation. Inexplantation surgery, the inflow cannula was removed (one case) or remained inthe left ventricle after occlusion with an inflow cannula plug, with transection of the inflow cannula at its curve (two cases) or without transection (twocases). When the inflow cannula was occluded without the support ofcardiopulmonary bypass (two cases), operative time (180 min and 210 min) wasshorter than that with other explantation procedures. After mean follow-up of 2.4years (range two months-four years) after device explantation, all five patients are alive, have not required heart transplantation and are in New York HeartAssociation class I (one case) or class II (four cases). After weaning from thedevice, no cerebrovascular complication was observed in any of the five patients.CONCLUSIONS: There is a possibility of weaning after INCOR implantation andsurgical techniques for the removal of the INCOR LVAD should be furtherdeveloped.
