Epub 2007 Jun 20.Initial experiences with the HeartMate vented electric left ventricular assistsystem in Japan.Saito S(1), Nakatani T, Niwaya K, Kobayashi J, Hanatani A, Tagusari O, NakajimaH, Miyatake K, Yagihara T, Kitamura S.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, National Cardiovascular Center, Osaka,Japan.We report three consecutive cases of long-term circulatory support using theHeartMate vented electric (VE) left ventricular assist system (LVAS). TheHeartMate VE LVAS dramatically improved the functional status and quality of lifeof these three patients with end-stage heart failure, and all were successfullybridged to transplantation after 659, 995, and 1055 days of support on thedevice. Only an antiplatelet agent was used for anticoagulation therapy, and nocerebrovascular event occurred. Although the pump stopped in two of these threepatients 665 days and 491 days after implantation, both were supported by thebackup pneumatic driver thereafter. The drive-line exit site became infected inone patient and thinning of the left ventricular wall due to an unknown causeoccurred in one patient.
