In the initial period, the results in infants were poor. Sincethen, several improvements have been introduced with regard to the cannulas,connectors, heparin coating of the blood pump inner surface, anticoagulanttreatment and coagulation monitoring, and earlier decision-making in favor ofpump implantation before irreversible shock has set in.METHODS: Since 1990 and as of January 1, 2005, 62 Berlin Heart Excor systems havebeen implanted in patients below 18 years of age at our institution. The patientswere divided into two groups according to the period of treatment: period 1,devices implanted between 1990 and 1998 (n = 34), and period 2, devices implantedbetween 1999 and 2004 (n = 28). We compared our experience during the earlier andlater periods.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the preoperative patient databetween the two periods except for time of support (17.9 +/- 27.7 days versus53.2 +/- 83.9 days, p = 0.001). In period 1, more patients needed a biventricularVAD whereas in period 2, more patients were effectively treated with a left VAD(p = 0.05). In the later period, the chest could be primarily closed in asignificantly higher percentage of infants (0% versus 89%, p = 0.012), and moreinfants could be extubated on the VAD (0% versus 55%, p = 0.16). Discharge fromthe hospital after either weaning from the system or heart transplantation wasachieved for 35% in period 1 and for 68% in period 2 (p = 0.029). Whereas inperiod 1 there were no survivors in the group of children younger than 1 yearold, during period 2, survival in this age group was similar to that of the twogroups of older children (p = 0.024). There was a significant improvement in the discharge rate in period 2 in patients with cardiomyopathy (43% versus 76%, p =0.045) and postcardiotomy heart failure (0% versus 57%, p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Earlier implantation of VADs, heparin coating of the blood pumps,and substantial modifications in cannula design, anticoagulation, and thecoagulation monitoring regimen have led to a significant increase in the survivaland discharge rate, especially among children under 1 year of age. The pediatric size Berlin Heart Excor VAD is a valuable option as a bridge to hearttransplantation or recovery for children suffering from cardiogenic shock.
