Circulation. 2001 Sep 18;104(12 Suppl 1):I233-40.Quantitative myocardial cytokine expression and activation of the apoptoticpathway in patients who require left ventricular assist devices.Birks EJ(1), Latif N, Owen V, Bowles C, Felkin LE, Mullen AJ, Khaghani A, Barton PJ, Polak JM, Pepper JR, Banner NR, Yacoub MH.Author information: (1)National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College School of Medicine,Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital, Harefield, Middlesex.BACKGROUND: Molecular mechanisms underlying the deterioration of patientsundergoing LV assist device (LVAD) implantation remain poorly understood. Westudied the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin(IL)-1beta and IL-6 and the terminal stage of the apoptotic pathway in patientswith decompensating heart failure who required LVAD support and compared themwith patients with less severe heart failure undergoing elective hearttransplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocardial and serum samples from 23 patients undergoingLVAD implantation were compared with those from 36 patients undergoing electiveheart transplantation. Myocardial TNF-alpha mRNA (1.71-fold; P<0.05) and protein (3.43+/-0.19 versus 2.95+/-0.10 pg/mg protein; P<0.05) were elevated in the LVAD patients. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated TNF expression in the myocytes. Serum TNF-alpha was also elevated (12.5+/-1.9 versus 4.0+/-0.4 pg/mL; P<0.0001) in the LVAD patients. IL-6 mRNA (2.57-fold higher; P<0.005) and protein (27.83+/-9.35versus 4.26+/-1.24 pg/mg protein; P<0.001) were higher in the LVAD candidates, aswas serum IL-6 (79.3+/-23.6 versus 7.1+/-1.6 pg/mL; P<0.0001). Interleukin-1beta mRNA expression was 9.78-fold higher in the LVAD patients (P<0.001). iNOS mRNAexpression was similar to that in advanced heart failure patients and was notfurther elevated in the LVAD patients. Levels of procaspase-9 (8.02+/-0.91 versus6.16+/-0.43 oligodeoxynucleotide [OD] units; P<0.01), cleaved caspase-9(10.02+/-1.0 versus 7.34+/-0.40 OD units; P<0.05), intact and spliced DFF-45(4.58+/-0.75 versus 2.84+/-0.23 OD units; P<0.05) were raised in LVAD patients,but caspase-3 and human nuclease CPAN were not.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 and alterations in theapoptotic pathway were found in the myocardium and elevated TNF-alpha and IL-6 inserum of deteriorating patients who required LVAD support. These occurrences may have therapeutic implications and influence the timing of LVAD insertion.
