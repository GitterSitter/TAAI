Although the treatment of HF via left-ventricular assist device(LVAD) placement has recently become widespread, the effects of LVAD therapy oncentral arterial pulse-wave reflections are unknown.METHODS: Central aortic pulse-wave analysis was performed on patients withend-stage HF awaiting cardiac transplantation and on healthy age-matched controlsusing the SphygmoCor (Akor Medical, Sydney, Australia) system. Arterialpulse-wave data were compared between patients receiving LVAD support versusthose receiving intravenous inotropic drugs and healthy control patients.RESULTS: Five patients on LVAD support were compared with 10 patients oninotropic drugs and 10 healthy control patients. Aortic augmented pressure andthe aortic augmentation index (AI(a)) were higher in LVAD patients compared with inotrope and control patients, despite similar brachial and aortic bloodpressures between groups. The AI(a) was significantly higher in LVAD patientsthan in patients on inotropic drugs (28.2% +/- 10% v 7.9% +/- 9%, P < or = .01). Additionally, there was a significantly higher aortic systolic tension timeindex, an index of left-ventricular myocardial oxygen demand, in the LVAD groupcompared with the inotrope group (2655 +/- 298 mm Hg/sec/min v 1748 +/- 303 mmHg/sec/min, P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Central arterial pressure-wave reflection is increased in end-stage HF patients on LVAD support compared with those on inotropic drugs, leading to anincrease in aortic augmented pressure, AI(a), and systolic tension time index.The AI(a) is also higher in LVAD patients than in healthy controls. Thisincreased central arterial-wave reflection places an additional hemodynamic load on the LVAD device and may have relevance to the medical management of patientsafter LVAD placement and to the longevity of the LVAD device itself.
