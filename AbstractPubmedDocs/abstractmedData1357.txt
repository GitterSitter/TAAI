ASAIO J. 2006 Sep-Oct;52(5):497-500.Management of pediatric patients after implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCORventricular assist device.Stiller B(1), Lemmer J, Schubert S, Ewert P, Schulze-Neick I, HÃ¼bler M, Redlin M,Berger F, Hetzer R.Author information: (1)Department of Congenital Heart Defects/Pediatric Cardiology, DeutschesHerzzentrum Berlin, Germany.Within the last 16 years, the Berlin Heart EXCOR systems have been used forcirculatory support in 73 infants and children up to 17 years of age (mean, 7years) with severe circulatory failure resistant to pharmacological therapy atour institution. These were patients with cardiomyopathy, fulminant myocarditis, end-stage congenital cardiac defects, and acute heart failure after congenitalheart surgery. Mean EXCOR support time was 36 days (range, 1 to 420 days).Forty-four patients (62%) survived up to transplantation or after weaning and 37 (51%) of them, including 9 infants, were discharged home. These results inpatients with very advanced disease have improved significantly during the pastfew years as the result of technical developments and growing experience in thetreatment of patients on the device and in postoperative care. The followingarticle gives answers to five questions frequently asked about intensive careunit treatment while on the device, anticoagulation and additional medicalsupport during left ventricular or biventricular support, the daily treatment of the children, and options for the weaning procedure.
