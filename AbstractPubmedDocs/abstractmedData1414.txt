However,specific data describing LV shape and the time course of changes in LV geometryare still incomplete. Thus, the aim of this study was-using 3-dimensional datasets obtained by computed tomography (CT)-to test the hypothesis that the CSD notonly alters LV size but also LV shape, and that short-term post-operative changesin LV geometry are maintained during long-term follow-up.METHODS: Ten patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy underwentelectron-beam CT examination before and again at 2.6 +/- 0.5 and 32.4 +/- 8.7months after CSD implantation. At end-diastole and end-systole LV volumes, thelength-to-width diameter ratio and a sphericity index were determined andejection fraction and end-systolic meridional and circumferential wall stresswere calculated.RESULTS: Implantation of the CSD led to a significant reduction in LV size, amore ellipsoidal LV shape and a subsequent decrease of LV wall stresspost-operatively (p < 0.05 for each), but no substantial changes were foundbetween short- and long-term follow-up (p > 0.05 each). Mean pre-operative andearly and late post-operative end-diastolic values were 310.4 +/- 87.8, 235.5 +/-102.0 and 229.4 +/- 103.1 ml for volume; 1.27 +/- 0.20, 1.37 +/- 0.20 and 1.38+/- 0.20 for diameter ratio; and 0.78 +/- 0.22, 0.67 +/- 0.26 and 0.65 +/- 0.23for sphericity index. A similar pattern was observed for end-systolic values.Ejection fraction was 23.4 +/- 6.2%, 32.9 +/- 11.6% and 34.4 +/- 14.9%.End-systolic meridional and circumferential wall stress was 182.2 +/- 45.6, 128.2+/- 52.6, 130.6 +/- 56.7 kdyn/cm(2) and 411.5 +/- 94.0, 297.4 +/- 108.4 and 302.8+/- 117.5 kdyn/cm(2), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional data obtained by CT demonstrate that passivecardiac constraint leads not only to a size reduction but also to an ellipsoidal re-shaping. Our data indicate that these effects are primarily a short-termconsequence of the CSD implantation but are maintained during long-termfollow-up.
