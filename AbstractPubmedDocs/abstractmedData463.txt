Epub 2013 Apr 4.Temporary right ventricular mechanical support in high-risk left ventricularassist device recipients versus permanent biventricular or total artificial heartsupport.Loforte A(1), Stepanenko A, Potapov EV, Musumeci F, Dranishnikov N, Schweiger M, Montalto A, Pasic M, Weng Y, Dandel M, Siniawski H, Kukucka M, Krabatsch T,Hetzer R.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation, S. Camillo Hospital, Rome, Italy. antonioloforte@yahoo.itEarly planned institution of temporary right ventricular assist device (RVAD)support with the CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, MA, USA) in left ventricularassist device (LVAD) recipients was compared with permanent biventricular assist device (BVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH) support. Between 2007 and 2011, 77 patients (age range: 25-70 years) with preoperative evidence of biventriculardysfunction (University of Pennsylvania score >50; University of Michigan score>5) were included. Forty-six patients (38 men; median age 54.5 years, range:25-70 years) underwent LVAD placement combined with temporary RVAD support (groupA); in 31 patients (25 men; median age 56.7 years, range: 28-68 years), apermanent BVAD or TAH implantation (group B) was performed. Within 30 days, 12patients from group A (26.08%) and 14 patients from group B (45.1%) died onmechanical support (P = 0.02). Thirty patients (65.2%) in group A were weanedfrom temporary RVAD support and three (6.5%) underwent permanent RVAD (HeartWare,Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) placement. A total of 26 patients (56.5%) weredischarged home in group A versus 17 (54.8%) in group B (P = 0.56). Threepatients (8.5%) received heart transplantation in group A and six (19.3%) ingroup B (P = 0.04). In group A, 90-day and 6-month survival was 54.3% (n = 25)versus 51.6% (n = 16) in group B (P = 0.66). In group A, 1-year survival was45.6% (n = 21) versus 45.1% (n = 14) in group B (P = 0.81). The strategy ofplanned temporary RVAD support in LVAD recipients showed encouraging results ifcompared with those of a similar permanent BVAD/TAH population. Weaning from and removal of the temporary RVAD support may allow patients to be on LVAD supportonly despite preoperative biventricular dysfunction.© 2013, Copyright the Authors.
