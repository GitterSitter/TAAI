The secondgeneration, the axial flow pumps, have been introduced since some years.DESIGN: Eleven consecutive patients, seven male, with severe heart failure due toischemic cardiomyopathy (n=5), dilated cardiomyopathy (n=5) and cytotoxicetiology (n=1) were implanted with the HeartMate-II. They were preoperativelytreated with inotropic support (n=9), ventricular assist device (n=2) andmechanical ventilation (n=4).RESULTS: Eight patients were bridged to transplant after median 155 days (range, 65 to 316 days). One patient is ongoing for 748 days, intended for destinationtherapy. Ten of eleven patients were discharged after median 64 days (range, 40to 105 days). Four patients were reoperated due to bleeding. Two embolic eventswere recorded. One perioperative death.CONCLUSION: Eleven HM-II LVAD's have been implanted in our institution with good early results. Eight patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation.One patient is intended for destination therapy and is ongoing since November2006. In these severely ill patients, this technique offers a good chancesurviving until heart transplantation. In selected cases the technique alsooffers the possibility of a permanent support and longevity.
