There are limited dataspecifically examining the incidence and predictors of driveline infections(DLI), with a changing treatment paradigm toward destination therapy (DT) andlonger duration of support.METHODS: Between January 2007 and 2011, 143 patients underwent HeartMate II(Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) implantation, with 87 (61%) as DT. Drivelinemaintenance strategy included sterile dressing changes with chlorhexidine andsaline application, without prophylactic oral antibiotics.RESULTS: DLI developed in 18 patients (12%) at a median of 182 days (range, 26 to1,138 days) after implantation, among which 12 (66%) were from the DT cohort.Infections were superficial in 15 (82%) and deep in 3 (18%). Trauma wasdocumented in 6 patients (33%). Seven patients (38%) needed readmission for DLI. Surgical debridement was needed in 3 (17%). All patients were managedsuccessfully, without the need for device explantation or urgent cardiactransplantation. No patient required continuous antibiotic prophylaxis after the infection subsided. Risk factor analysis identified duration of support as theonly independent predictor of infection (mean. 600 vs 390 days; p = 0.03). Theodds of having a DLI rose by 4% for every month of support.CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of support significantly increased the risk of DLIand hence increased the risk of DLI in patients with DT. DLI may be successfully managed with antibiotics and local wound care. Most of the infections weresuperficial, and progression to deep pocket or pump infection is rare in ourexperience.Copyright Â© 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
