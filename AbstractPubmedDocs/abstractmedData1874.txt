From August 1, 1996, to February 1, 1998, weprospectively attempted to identify potential explant candidates by the use ofexercise testing. During this time, we recruited 39 consecutive patients afterinsertion of the Thermo Cardiosystems vented electric device to participate inthe following study. Approximately 3 months after device implantation, a maximal exercise test with hemodynamic monitoring and respiratory gas analysis wasperformed with the LVAD in the automated mode. The electric device was interfacedwith a pneumatic console such that the rate could be decreased to 20 cycles/min. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded as the device rate was decreased. A repeatexercise test was then performed if the patient remained hemodynamically stable. A retrospective chart review of 111 LVAD recipients at our institution identifiedonly 5 successful explant patients. Eighteen of the 39 patients were studied.Fifteen patients exercised with maximal device support. At peak exercise, VO2averaged 14.5+/-3.6 mL. kg-1. min-1; LVAD flow, 8.0+/-1.3 L/min; Fick cardiacoutput, 11.4+/-3.3 L/min; and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 13+/-4 mm Hg.Seven patients remained normotensive and could exercise at a fixed rate of 20cycles/min. In these patients, peak VO2 declined from 17.3+/-3.9 to 13.0+/-6.1mL. kg-1. min-1. In one of these patients, the device was explanted.CONCLUSIONS: Significant myocardial recovery after LVAD therapy in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure occurs in a small percentage of patients. Mostof these patients have dilated cardiomyopathy. Exercise testing may be a usefulmodality to identify those patients in whom the device can be explanted.
