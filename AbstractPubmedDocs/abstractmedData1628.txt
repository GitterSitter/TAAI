Despite considerable advances in the diagnosis and medical treatment ofCHF, this condition remains a real "malignant" disease. The cardiactransplantation (CT) remains "gold standard" option for the treatment of patientswith severe CHF in all age group; but only a small number of patients can receiveit due to scarcity of donor organs. The increased successful clinical experience with the ventricular assist device (VAD) confirmed the indisputable importance oflong-term mechanical circulatory support for patients who suffer acutehemodynamic deterioration. Over the past years, several miniaturized continuousflow VAD have been developed for clinical use. The authors report the data ofworldwide and particularly Italian experience about middle and long-term pumpperformance in patients supported with axial-flow pump MicroMed DeBakey VAD inthe bridge to cardiac transplantation setting.
