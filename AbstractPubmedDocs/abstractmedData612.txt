Tex Heart Inst J. 2012;39(2):268-70.Remission of chronic, advanced heart failure after left ventricular unloadingwith an implantable left ventricular assist device.Demirozu ZT(1), Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's EpiscopalHospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.We describe the case of a 35-year-old man with severe, dilated idiopathiccardiomyopathy who was placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation.While awaiting transplantation, his heart failure decompensated to such a degree that left ventricular assist device support was necessary. He did well on device support until a pump-pocket infection (methicillin-resistant coagulase-negativestaphylococci) developed at 10 months. At that time, echocardiograms showednormal heart size and an ejection fraction of 0.45 to 0.49 without pump support. The pump was, therefore, explanted emergently. The patient has remainedclinically stable with preserved ventricular function nearly 13 years after theexplantation procedure.PMCID: PMC3384055
