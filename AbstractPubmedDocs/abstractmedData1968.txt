Although there are reports documenting itscirculatory support, little is known about the effects of chronic leftventricular unloading on the heart itself.METHODS: We performed intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography at theinsertion and explanation of a HeartMate left ventricular assist device in 19patients with end-stage heart failure. They were supported by the assist devicefor 3 to 153 days (mean [+/-SD] 68 +/- 33). Measurements were takenretrospectively to obtain left atrial and ventricular diameters andinterventricular septal and posterior wall thicknesses. Histologic examinationswere made from the left ventricular myocardial specimens of 15 patients at thetimes of insertion and explanation for heart transplantation. Insertion andexplanation specimens were compared qualitatively (0 to 3 scale) for wavy fibers,contraction band necrosis and fibrosis, with quantitative measurement of minimal myocyte diameter across the nucleus.RESULTS: Left atrial and left ventricular diastolic and systolic diametersdecreased immediately after insertion of the left ventricular assist device (from46 to 35, 63 to 41 and 59 to 36 mm, respectively, all p < 0.001). Leftventricular wall thickness increased from 10 to 14 mm (p < 0.001) for theinterventricular septum and from 10 to 13 mm for the posterior wall (p<0.001). Noechocardiographic measurements showed significant subsequent changes at thechronic stage. Myocardial histologic findings demonstrated a reduction in myocytedamage (from 1.9 to 0.5, p<0.001, for wavy fiber and from 1.3 to 0.2, p<0.01, forcontraction band necrosis) and an increase in fibrosis (from 1.3 to 1.9, p<0.05),but without significant change in myocyte diameter (from 15.6 to 16.8 micrometer,p=0.065).CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular unloading with the implantable assist deviceinduces an immediate increase in wall thickness, consistent with the reduction inchamber size, thereby decreasing wall stress. Chronic unloading allows myocardialhealing and fibrosis without evidence for ongoing myocyte damage or atrophy. Leftventricular assist device insertion may have a role in "resting" the ventriclefor selected patients with heart failure.
