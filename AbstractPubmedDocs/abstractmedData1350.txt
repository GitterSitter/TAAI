Epub 2006 Oct 4.Mechanical unloading of the heart activates the calpain system.Razeghi P(1), Volpini KC, Wang ME, Youker KA, Stepkowski S, Taegtmeyer H.Author information: (1)Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of TexasHouston-Medical School, 6431 Fannin, MSB 1.222, Houston, TX 77030, USA.The mechanism for the decrease in cardiomyocyte size with mechanical unloading isunknown. The calpain system regulates cardiomyocyte atrophy. We obtained samples from failing human hearts at the time of implantation and explantation of a left ventricular assist device. For mechanical unloading, we also heterotopicallytransplanted rat or mouse hearts for 1 week. The effect of calpain inhibition on cardiac atrophy was assessed in transplanted hearts overexpressing calpastatin.We measured transcript levels of calpain 1 and 2 in the human and the rodentmodel, as well as calpain activity, a calpain-specific degradation product andcardiomyocyte size in the two rodent models. Mechanical unloading of the failing human heart significantly increased calpain 2 gene expression. Transcript levels of calpain 1 and 2, calpain activity and a calpain-specific degradation productall significantly increased in the unloaded rat heart. Unexpectedly, in hearts ofanimals overexpressing calpastatin, cardiomyocyte size also decreased. Mechanicalunloading of the mammalian heart activates the calpain system, although otherproteolytic systems may compensate for decreased calpain activity whencalpastatin is overexpressed.
