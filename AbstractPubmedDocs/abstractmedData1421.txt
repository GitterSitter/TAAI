VADs are a treatment and not a cure, and mortality on device support remains high.Recognizing the dire nature of the decisions for patients and families and theassociated high mortality rates, we actively included processes for devicewithdrawal as part of our program mandate.METHODS: At Toronto General Hospital, from October 2001 to December 2004, 22patients underwent implantation of a VAD. Seven patients died following devicewithdrawal.RESULTS: The average time spent on support prior to device withdrawal was sevendays. In four of the seven cases, family members initiated discussions regarding device withdrawal. Family-initiated discussions were more likely to occur ifpatients were implanted electively, as a bridge to transplantation. Disagreementsoccurred between the ICU and the transplant teams regarding the timing of device withdrawal and responsibility for stopping the pump.DISCUSSION: Establishing a process for device withdrawal has been a key factor inthe success of our VAD program. This process relies heavily on pre-implantationpreparation, a strategy for resolving disagreements, and a process forwithdrawing device support.
