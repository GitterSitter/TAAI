Diabetes is prevalentin advanced heart failure patients. In this study, we sought to investigate theeffects of mechanical circulatory support on diabetic parameters with LVADimplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, data on 244 LVAD recipientsbetween 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Patients without history of diabetes, death within the first 3 months after LVAD implantation, heart transplantation afterLVAD, or LVAD explantation were excluded from the study. Baseline demographic,laboratory, and echocardiographic information prior to LVAD placement and 6-monthfollow-up were obtained. Laboratory values indicative of diabetic control werefound to improve significantly at 6 months post-LVAD implantation (glycatedhaemoglobin, 7.2 vs. 6.1%, P < 0.0001; serum fasting glucose, 141 vs. 122 mg/dL, P = 0.003; mean daily insulin dose, 30 vs. 24 IU/day, P = 0.02). Additionally,the use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was successfully discontinued in sixpatients at 6 months post-LVAD implantation.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term LVAD therapy is associated with improvement in diabeticcontrol which is probabvly due to improvements in cardiac output andnormalization of biochemical derangements resulting from diabetes.© 2014 The Authors.
