Epub 2015 Mar 3.Current approaches to device implantation in pediatric and congenital heartdisease patients.Miller JR(1), Lancaster TS, Eghtesady P.Author information: (1)Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine,St. Louis Children's Hospital, One Children's Place, Suite 5 South St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.The pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD) has recently shown substantialimprovements in survival as a bridge to heart transplant for patients withend-stage heart failure. Since that time, its use has become much more frequent. With increasing utilization, additional questions have arisen including patientselection, timing of VAD implantation and device selection. These challenges are amplified by the uniqueness of each patient, the recent abundance of literaturesurrounding VAD use as well as the technological advancements in the devicesthemselves. Ideal strategies for device placement must be sought, for not onlyimproved patient care, but also for optimal resource utilization. Here, we reviewthe most relevant literature to highlight some of the challenges facing the heartfailure specialist, and any physician, who will care for a child with a VAD.
