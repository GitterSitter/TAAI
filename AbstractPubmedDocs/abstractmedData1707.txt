Cardiactransplantation is an effective therapy but is severely limited to approximately 2300 patients per year due to the donor shortage. With ever increasing waitingtimes, a significant number of patients become severely debilitated or expireprior to transplantation. A mechanical circulatory support device was first used as a "bridge to transplantation" in 1969. Since then, mechanical devices haveincreased tremendously in reliability and efficaciousness. The HeartMate leftventricular assist device (LVAD) has been utilized extensively in a bridge totransplant application with excellent results. Patients refractory to aggressive medical management can be sustained reliably until transplantation. In addition, bridging allows for the correction of physiologic and metabolic dearrangementsoften seen in these severely ill patients prior to transplantation. Nutritional, economic, and quality-of-life issues also favor earlier LVAD placement inrefractory patients. This reportsummarizes the overall bridging experience withthe HeartMate LVAD and focuses on our experience with this device atRush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center.
