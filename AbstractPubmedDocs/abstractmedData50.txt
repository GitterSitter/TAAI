Little is knownabout post-transplant outcomes in patients complicated by late RHF during LVADsupport.METHODS: Between May 2004 and December 2013, 141 patients underwent cardiactransplantation after isolated LVAD bridging at our center. Late RHF was defined as heart failure requiring medical intervention >4 weeks after LVAD implantation.RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 53 ± 13 years, 82% were men, and 36% had anischemic etiology. The mean duration of LVAD support before transplantation was0.75 years. Late RHF developed in 21 patients (15%) during LVAD support. Of thesepatients, 11 were supported with inotropic agents at the time of transplantation.Patients with RHF had higher creatinine (1.6 ± 0.88 mg/dL vs 1.3 ± 0.67 mg/dL, p = 0.07), higher blood urea nitrogen (32 ± 17 mg/dL vs 24 ± 10 mg/dL, p = 0.0013),higher total bilirubin (0.96 ± 0.46 mg/dL vs 0.78 ± 0.42 mg/dL, p = 0.07), andlower albumin (3.8 ± 0.60 g/dL vs 4.1 ± 0.46 g/dL, p = 0.0019) at the time oftransplantation compared with patients who did not develop RHF. In-hospitalmortality was significantly higher in patients with late RHF during LVAD support (29% vs 6.7%, p = 0.002). Overall post-transplant survival rates were 87% at 1year, 83% at 3 years, and 77% at 5 years. The 5-year post-transplant survival wassignificantly worse in patients who developed late RHF during LVAD supportcompared with survival in patients who did not develop RHF (26% vs 87%, p <0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Late RHF during LVAD support adversely affects post-transplantsurvival.Published by Elsevier Inc.
