Despite athorough search in that study, no mitoses explaining a potential net increase of cardiomyocytes has been observed. The heart harbors several stem cellpopulations, including c-kit (CD117)(+) stem cells and side population cells(SPC), which may proliferate after unloading and thus contribute to thegeneration of diploid cardiomyocytes. In this study we sought to determine,whether there is an increase of ABCG2(+) SPC and CD117(+) stem cells afterunloading.METHODS: In paired myocardial samples (prior to and after LVAD), the number ofcells with immunoexpression of ABCG2, c-kit/CD117 and MEF-2 was assessed byimmunohistochemistry. Their number was morphometrically determined and these datawere correlated with the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content.RESULTS: A significant increase of SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit andMEF-2 after unloading was observed from 0.00013% in CHF to 0.0011%, and 0.013% to0.035%, respectively after unloading (p = 0.001). A significant positivecorrelation between both SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2expression was observed (p = 0.007 and 0.01). No correlation was found betweenthe number of SPC and the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content.CONCLUSIONS: SPC are increased significantly in the myocardium after ventricular unloading, suggesting a role for stem cell proliferation during "reverse cardiac remodeling." These cells might proliferate and commit to different cell lineages,such as cardiomyocytes or endothelium, and thus ameliorate cardiac function.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
