A major problem in these operations is the risk of airembolization, particularly in a nonsternotomy approach that precludes access tothe outflow aortic graft and to the ascending aorta. We report a minimallyinvasive, nonsternotomy HeartMate II implantable left ventricular assist device(LVAD) exchange, using peripheral cardiopulmonary support and a novel approach tocontinuous intravascular ascending aortic air removal.Copyright Â© 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
