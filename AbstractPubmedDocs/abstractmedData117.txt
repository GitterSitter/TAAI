Of 382 consecutive patients who completedfollow-up between August 2008 and June 2013 (mean time on support 389 days,median 271 days), 262 (68.6%) underwent isolated HeartWare Ventricular AssistDevice implantation, 75 (19.6%) a concurrent valve procedure, and 45 (11.8%)concurrent nonvalvular procedures. Of the concurrent valve procedures, 56 weretricuspid, 13 aortic, and 6 mitral. Survival was similar between groups (79% for concurrent valve procedures and 85% for HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device only at 1 year; P=0.33). Concurrent valve procedures were also associated withincreased unadjusted early right heart failure (RHF). A multivariable analysisfor death and RHF (121 total events) identified female sex (odds ratio=2.0 [95%confidence interval, 1.2-3.3; P=0.0053]) and preimplant tricuspid regurgitationseverity (odds ratio=2.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.8, P<0.0001]) asindependent predictors while concurrent tricuspid valve procedures (TVP) were notpredictors. Furthermore, patients with significant preimplant tricuspidregurgitation who did not receive a TVP experienced an increased rate of late RHFcompared with those who received TVP (0.19 versus 0.05 events per patient-year,respectively; P=0.024).CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device alone, survivalwas equivalent for the concurrent valve procedure group. Tricuspid regurgitation severity was the most important predictor of increased postoperative RHF, andconcurrent TVP was not an independent predictor of RHF overall. Concurrent TVPmay reduce the rate of late RHF for patients with significant preimplanttricuspid insufficiency.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
