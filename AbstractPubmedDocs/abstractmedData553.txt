The results ofthe speed designations were plotted, and linear function slopes for leftventricular end-diastolic dimension, pulsatility index, and power werecalculated.RESULTS: Fifty-two ramp tests for 39 patients were prospectively collected andanalyzed. Twenty-eight ramp tests were performed for speed optimization, andspeed was changed in 17 (61%) with a mean absolute value adjustment of 424 ± 211 rpm. Seventeen patients had ramp tests performed for suspected device thrombosis,and 10 tests were suspicious for device thrombosis; these patients were thentreated with intensified anticoagulation and/or device exchange/emergenttransplantation. Device thrombosis was confirmed in 8 of 10 cases at the time of emergent device exchange or transplantation. All patients with device thrombosis,but none of the remaining patients had a left ventricular end-diastolic dimensionslope >-0.16.CONCLUSIONS: Ramp tests facilitate optimal speed changes and device malfunctiondetection and may be used to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions andneed for surgical intervention in CF-LVAD patients.Copyright © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
