Despite advances in medical care, prognosiswith HF remains poor, especially in advanced stages. The large patient populationwith advanced HF and the limited number of donor organs stimulated thedevelopment of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices as a bridge totransplant and for destination therapy. However, MCS devices require a majoroperative intervention, cardiopulmonary bypass, and blood component exposure,which have been associated with significant adverse event rates, and longrecovery periods. Miniaturization of MCS devices and the development of anefficient and reliable transcutaneous energy transfer system may provide thevehicle to overcome these limitations and usher in a new clinical paradigm inheart failure therapy by enabling less invasive beating heart surgical proceduresfor implantation, reduce cost, and improve patient outcomes and quality of life. Further, it is anticipated that future ventricular assist device technology will allow for a much wider application of the therapy in the treatment of heartfailure including its use for myocardial recovery and as a platform for supportfor cell therapy in addition to permanent long-term support.© 2012, Copyright the Authors.
