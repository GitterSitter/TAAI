ASAIO Trans. 1991 Jul-Sep;37(3):M425-6.Extended support with a left ventricular assist device as a bridge to hearttransplantation.McGee MG(1), Myers TJ, Abou-Awdi N, Dasse KA, Radovancevic B, Lonquist JL, DuncanJM, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Cullen Cardiovascular Research Laboratories, Texas Heart Institute, Houston77225-0345.The Heartmate-1000IP, an intracorporeal, pneumatically activated, pulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD) with textured blood-contacting surfaces, isundergoing clinical evaluation as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). Duringa 3 year period (January 1988 to April 1991), the authors evaluated 12 patientswho required extended LVAD support (greater than 30 days) while awaiting HTx.Duration of support ranged from 31 to 233 days (mean, 117 days). LVAD performancewas excellent, with average pump flow indices of 2.5-3.5 L/min/m2. Long-termantithrombotic therapy consisted of dipyridamole and aspirin in all except onepatient who received only low-molecular-weight dextran. After the initialrecovery period, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times returned tobaseline levels. Plasma-free hemoglobin levels averaged less than 10 mg/dl. Onepatient is currently receiving support (91+ days); the 11 other patientsunderwent successful HTx, with follow-up ranging from 7 to 36 months. Theauthors' cumulative experience with this LVAD totals more than 1,506 days ofsupport (greater than 4 years) without evidence of any thromboembolic episodes.These results suggest that this LVAD provides an effective bridge to HTx forextended periods.
