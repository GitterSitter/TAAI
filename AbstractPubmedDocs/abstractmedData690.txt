These devices may be used as abridge to transplant, destination therapy, or to recovery, providing eitherpulsatile or nonpulsatile support. Because of the increasing frequency of leftventricular assist device utilization and the improved short-term and long-termsurvival after placement, there has been a parallel increase in the radiologicimaging of patients with these devices, mandating radiologists' awareness of the manifestations of common complications, including infection, thrombosis andembolism, cannula obstruction, hemorrhage, and complications of adjacent vessels and viscera, all of which will be discussed in this pictorial essay.
