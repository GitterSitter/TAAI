Epub 2007 Jan 29.Pediatric ventricular assist devices.Fynn-Thompson F(1), Almond C.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Childrens Hospital Boston, Harvard MedicalSchool, 300 Longwood Avenue, Bader 273, Boston, MA 02115, USA.Francis.Fynn-Thompson@cardio.chboston.orgVentricular assist device therapy is continuing to evolve in the practice ofpediatric cardiac surgery. Although ECMO is still the most often appliedmechanical support for infants and young children, a broader range of pulsatile, paracorporeal, as well as implantable ventricular assist devices are nowavailable for pediatric application. A number of these innovative devices havebeen developed specifically for pediatric use with miniaturized pumps andoptimized cannulas suitable for the entire age range of pediatric patientsincluding neonates. Unlike ECMO, these devices can offer medium- to long-termsupport and have been successfully utilized as a bridge to transplant as well as a bridge to recovery. This review examines the different types of devicescurrently available, their clinical indications for use, future devices, and the current results of pediatric ventricular assist device therapy in the treatmentof heart failure in the pediatric population.
