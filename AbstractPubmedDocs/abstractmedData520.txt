We report on a recent5-year single-center experience with MCSD for treatment of RCS.METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of adult patients who required an MCSD due to RCS in the past 5 years. We excluded those patients withpost-cardiotomy shock and post-transplant cardiac graft dysfunction. In thesetting of RCS, a short-term ventricular assist device (VAD) was inserted as abridge-to-decision device. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) was chosen in cases of unknown neurologic status, complete hemodynamiccollapse or severe coagulopathy.RESULTS: From January 2007 through January 2012, 90 patients received an MCSD forRCS, 21 (23%) of whom had active cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Theetiology of RCS included acute myocardial infarction in 49% and acutedecompensated heart failure in 27%. Mean age was 53±14 years, 71% were male, and 60% had an intra-aortic balloon pump. The initial approach utilized wasshort-term VAD in 49% and VA ECMO in 51%. Median length of support was 8 days(IQR 4 to 18 days). Exchange to implantable VAD was performed in 26% of patients.Other destinations included myocardial recovery in 18% and heart transplantation in 11%. Survival to hospital discharge was 49%. Multivariate analysis showedongoing CPR to be an independent risk factor for mortality (OR = 5.79, 95% CI1.285 to 26.08, p = 0.022).CONCLUSIONS: In the current era, roughly half of the patients who need an MCSDfor RCS survive, and roughly half of these survivors require an implantable VAD. Ongoing CPR is predictive of in-hospital mortality.Copyright © 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
