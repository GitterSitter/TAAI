We present theoutcomes of patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter clinical study inJapan using the HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD for bridge to transplantation. The study evaluated 6 inotrope-dependent heart failure patients failing onmedical management (3 males and 3 females, age 44.7 ± 15.8 years, BSA 1.58 ± 0.17m(2)) implanted with the HMII LVAD at 5 Japanese centers. Functional status,adverse events and outcomes were determined for the first 6 months with follow-upat 2 years. After implant, functional improvement was evident in 6-min walkdistance which increased from 268 ± 92 m at baseline to 399 ± 105 m at 6 months, and 100% of patients were in NYHA class I or II at 6 months compared to 0% atbaseline. Adverse events included localized non-device-related infection (4/6),arrhythmias (3/6) and percutaneous lead infection (1/6). There were nore-thoracotomies for bleeding and no strokes or pump replacements. All patientswere alive at 6 months and all were transplanted after 1.96-3.58 years of LVADsupport. The results in Japan of the HMII LVAD for BTT are consistent withresults from the US pivotal clinical trial. The expanded use of this technologyto Japanese heart failure patients is appropriate.
