Previous retrospective studiesdemonstrated that bleeding events in patients with the HeartMate II (ThoratecCorp, Pleasanton, CA) were attributed to acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Wesought to analyze the von Willebrand factor (VWF) profile in patients receiving aHeartMate II or a CircuLite (Saddle Brook, NJ,) device (Synergy PocketMicro-pump) prospectively.METHODS: Prospectively analyzed were 34 patients supported with left ventricular assist device (LVAD; 26 with HeartMate II and 8 with CircuLite). The controlgroup comprised 20 patients who underwent heart transplantation (HTx). Bloodsamples were taken pre-operatively and at 14 days and 3, 6, 9, and 12 monthspost-operatively.RESULTS: Patients with LVADs had a high incidence of bleeding complications. Fromthe immediate post-operative phase throughout the entire observation, the VWFristocetin cofactor activity (Rco)/antigen (Ag) ratio of patients with HeartMate II and CircuLite devices was consistently lower compared with HTx patients. Nocorrelation was found between the individual VWF:Rco/Ag ratio and bleeding eventsor transfusion requirements. The VWF:Rco/Ag ratio normalized immediately inpatients who received HTx.CONCLUSIONS: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome was confirmed to occur immediately after the implantation of both types of LVAD and persisted up to 12 months. Alower VWF:Rco/Ag ratio was associated with larger transfusion requirements.Acquired von Willebrand syndrome resolves after LVAD explantation.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
