Eur J Heart Fail. 2014 Apr;16(4):435-43.Weaning from inotropic support and concomitant beta-blocker therapy in severelyill heart failure patients: take the time in order to improve prognosis.Constantinescu AA, Caliskan K, Manintveld OC, van Domburg R, Jewbali L, Balk AH.AIMS: Beta-blockers improve the prognosis in heart failure (HF), but theirintroduction may seem impossible in patients dependent on inotropic support.However, many of these patients can be titrated on beta-blockers, but there islittle evidence of successful clinical strategies.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the records of inotropy-dependent patientsreferred for assessment for heart transplantation. Thirty-six patients (45%)could not be weaned (NW) and underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD)implantation or transplantation, or died. However, 44 (55%) were successfullyweaned (SW). Neither the aetiology (ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic) nor cardiacindexes were different in the SW as compared with the NW group (2.27±0.5 vs.2.15±0.6 L/min/m2). The NW patients had lower LVEF (15±5% vs. 19±5%, P=0.001),higher right atrial pressure (12±6 vs. 8±6 mmHg, P=0.02), and more severe mitral regurgitation (P<0.001) than the SW patients. At discharge, 35 of 44 SW patients were receiving beta-blockers. In 29 of them, a beta-blocker could only beinitiated or continued during concomitant support with i.v. enoximone for aduration of 14.1±7.2 days. Patients discharged on a beta-blocker had anLVAD/transplantation-free cumulative survival of 71% during a follow-up of2074±201 days (confidence interval 1679–2470).CONCLUSION: It takes time to put severely ill HF patients on beta-blockers and itmay require bridging with inotropes which are independent of beta-adrenergicreceptors. Whether such a strategy may result in a better clinical outcomewarrants further research.© 2013 The Authors. European Journal of Heart Failure © 2013 European Society of Cardiology.
