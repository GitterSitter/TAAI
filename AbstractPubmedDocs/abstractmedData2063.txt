ASAIO J. 1992 Jul-Sep;38(3):M676-8.Differential regional function of the right ventricle during the use of a leftventricular assist device.Kawai A(1), Kormos RL, Mandarino WA, Morita S, Deneault LG, Gasior TA, ArmitageJM, Griffith BP.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania 15213.The use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplant isassociated with a 52% incidence of RV failure requiring additional inotropic ormechanical support (RVAD). This study evaluated the differential performance ofthe RV free wall and septum to identify the need for additional RV support.Cross-sectional views of the RV were obtained immediately before, and 1 hr after,Novacor LVAS implantation in 12 consecutive patients using transesophagealechocardiography. Each image was divided into a free wall portion (FW) and aseptal portion (SP) by grids drawn from the center of gravity of theend-diastolic endocardial outline to the junction between the FW and the SP.Percentage change between preimplant and postimplant for RV ejection fraction(RVEF), fractional area change for the FW (FAC-FW) and the SP (FAC-SP), andfractional shortening of the FW to SP distance (F-S) is reported for patientsbased upon the need for RV support: minimal (Group 1), maximal (Group 2). AfterLVAS implantation, patients showed a reduction in SP fractional area change.However, this reduction was most pronounced in Group 2. The degree of SPimpairment may explain the mechanism of RV failure in patients on an LVAD.
