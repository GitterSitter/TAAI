DeBakey Department ofSurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.dlmorale@texaschildrenshospital.orgOver the past two decades clinicians and researchers have sought to bringmechanical circulatory support (MCS) to pediatric patients with heart failure.ECMO, IABPs, and VADs have all been used in infants and children as a bridge tomyocardial recovery or as a bridge to transplant. However, until recently, acommitment by industry, government, and researchers towards the development ofpediatric MCS has not been present, especially in the United States. Advancementsin adult VAD design to smaller, quieter, and fully implantable pumps capable ofcomplete outpatient support have sparked curiosity in the application of thistechnology to children. Also, the increasing success of palliating congenitalheart disease is creating an ever-growing cohort of children and adolescents withheart failure. These changing demographics and technological advances have causeda refocus of attention. This is most clearly demonstrated by the internationaluse of several established MCS pediatric and neonatal systems, by the FDAOsincreasing proclivity to allow the use of international pediatric VADs in theUSA, and by the recent National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute funding ofseveral institutions to develop pediatric VADs. This review describes thedifferent aspects of pediatric MCS including indications, the features of thevarious VADs, and their current application in children worldwide.
