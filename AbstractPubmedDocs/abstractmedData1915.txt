To date, the extent to which sustained mechanical unloading alters the phenotype of pathologic myocardialhypertrophy in dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown.METHODS: We examined left ventricular size, myocyte and myocardialimmunoreactivity for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriureticpeptide (BNP) in eight patients with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy before andafter LVAD support. The mean duration of congestive heart failure was 18 +/- 5months, and LVAD support averaged 42 +/- 4 days before heart transplantation.RESULTS: Echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass decreased from505 +/- 83 to 297 +/- 52 gm (p < 0.05) during LVAD support, whereas minimummyocyte diameter decreased from 28.1 +/- 0.9 to 21.7 +/- 0.6 microns (p < 0.01)in transmural myocardial tissue specimens. Overall left ventricular ANPimmunopositivity decreased from 48% at LVAD placement to 12% at transplantation(p < 0.05), whereas BNP immunopositivity decreased from 28% to 4% after LVADsupport. Moreover, a gradient of ANP and BNP immunostaining from subendocardiumto epicardium observed before mechanical unloading diminished after LVAD support.Analysis of the relationship between left ventricular mass and ANPimmunopositivity revealed a close and highly significant correlation betweenthese variables.CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate remarkable left ventricular plasticityeven in the presence of advanced cardiomyopathy. Parallel reductions inmyocardial mass and myocyte size with reductions in ventricular ANP and BNPimmunostaining indicate a novel regression of the phenotype of pathologichypertrophy within the human myocardium after LVAD support.
