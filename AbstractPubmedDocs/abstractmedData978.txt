If maximalmedical therapy fails, patients may then be treated with mechanical circulatorysupport devices and (or) cardiac transplantation. Our purpose is to demonstratethe long-term efficacy of these surgical interventions.METHODS: A retrospective review of 18 patients diagnosed with peripartumcardiomyopathy from 1994 to 2009 was conducted.RESULTS: Eighteen patients were referred with a median of seven year delaybetween onset of symptoms and presentation. Eight (44%) had medical therapy with only one death at five years, seven are alive, and two patients are awaitingtransplantation. Six patients were implanted with devices. From this group, therewere two hospital deaths, one native heart recovery, and three heart transplants with 100% survival. Four patients (21%) were treated with transplantation aloneand all survived. Combined device and (or) transplant survival was 80% at oneyear.CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of this group varied; 38% of the medicallytreated patients are stable on medical therapy (3 of 8) and 67% of the devicepatients (4 of 6) are alive. One of six device patients (17%) was successfullybridged to native heart recovery. Mechanical assist devices can be used as abridge to recovery or as a bridge to cardiac transplantation for the treatment ofperipartum cardiomyopathy patients who fail medical management. In addition,cardiac transplantation alone is also a viable treatment option for patients who fail medical management and do not require a mechanical assist device.Copyright (c) 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
