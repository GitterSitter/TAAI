Patient-specific risk factors have yet tobe consistently identified in a large, multicenter registry, which may underliethe poorer outcomes for BiVAD patients. The Interagency Registry for MechanicallyAssisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) is a registry of U.S. Food and DrugAdministration-approved durable MCS devices used for bridge-to-transplantation,destination therapy, or recovery. The purposes of this study were to 1) identify the underlying pre-implant characteristics of the population requiring BiVADsupport that contribute to reduced survival, and 2) identify differences inpostoperative outcomes with respect to adverse events compared with patientssupported with LVAD alone.METHODS: From June 2006 to September 2009, 1,646 patients were entered into theINTERMACS database in which adverse events and outcomes were recorded for primaryimplants with LVAD or BiVAD. Competing outcomes methodology was used to estimate the time-related probability of death, transplant, or recovery. Overall survival for all groups was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportionalregression analysis.RESULTS: The distribution of primary device implants included 1,440 LVADs and 206BiVADs. BiVAD patients presented with a lower INTERMACS profile 93% in INTERMACS 1 or 2, compared with 73% for LVAD patients (p < 0.001). Survival at 6 months was86% for LVADs and 56% for BiVADs (p < .0001). Adverse event rates, expressed asepisodes/100 patient-months for the BiVAD group compared with LVAD, weresignificantly higher for infection (33.2 vs 14.3), bleeding (71.6 vs 15.5),neurologic events (7.9 vs 2.6), and for device failure (4.9 vs 2.0).CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring BiVAD support at the time of durable MCS implant are more critically ill at the time of MCS implant. BiVAD patients experienceworse survival than patients supported with LVAD alone and higher rates ofserious adverse events. Characteristics of the population present at the time of BiVAD implant likely influence post-implant MCS outcomes.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
