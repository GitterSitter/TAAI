Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis.McIntyre JA(1), Higgins N, Britton R, Faucett S, Johnson S, Beckman D, Hormuth D,Fehrenbacher J, Halbrook H.Author information: (1)Department of Transplantation, Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana46202, USA.Surgery surrounding the use of mechanical assistance in cardiac transplantcandidates often leads to multiple blood/platelet transfusions and subsequentdevelopment of alloantibodies. This is a case report of a 50-year-old malepatient who had received blood transfusions during coronary bypass grafting 9years earlier. He presented in acute and chronic heart failure and, despitetherapy, became moribund with multisystem organ failure. His ejection fractionwas 10%. A Novacor ventricular assist device was implanted on May 19, 1995 (day0). The patient received 44 U of blood and 20 U of platelets. Although hispercent reactive antibodies (PRA) were negative before surgery byfluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, the PRA 3 days after implantation ofthe ventricular assist device was 80%; it increased to 100% by day 7. In anattempt to decrease the PRA, intravenous immunoglobulin was given at 3-weekintervals. The PRA became negative and the patient received a donor heart thatwas negative by fluorescence-activated cell sorter cross-match on day 64. On days69-72, a dramatic increase in alloantibody activity was promptly reversed withadditional intravenous immunoglobulin. Currently at posttransplant month 12, the patient shows no humoral, cellular, or vascular evidence of rejection.
