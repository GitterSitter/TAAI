Three pumpsystems were used: Biomedicus Centrifugal Pump, Abiomed BVS 500, and ThoratecVAD. The choice of system depended on the indication and quality of each device. Seven patients (47%) could be weaned from the mechanical circulatory support(MCS) system and three patients (20%) are long-term survivors.RESULTS: All 15 patients developed at least one serious complication, such asmultiorgan failure (MOF), liver failure, acute renal failure or sepsis.Twenty-five per cent had severe bleeding and 13% had neurological complication.Mortality was due mostly to MOF, MOF and sepsis or sepsis. The survivors had a CIgreater than 2.2 l.min.m2, total bilirubin less than 1.0 U/1, and did not undergoresuscitation.CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure after cardiac transplantation severe enough to requireMCS is currently associated with several major complications and high mortality(80%).
