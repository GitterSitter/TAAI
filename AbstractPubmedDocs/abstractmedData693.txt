It is thereforeimportant to identify patients at risk a priori. However, prognostic modelsderived from multivariate analyses have had limited predictive power.METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 LVAD recipientsbetween May 1996 and October 2009; of these, 27 later required a RVAD (RVAD(+))and 156 remained on LVAD only (RVAD(-)) until transplant or death. A decisiontree model was constructed to represent combinatorial non-linear relationships ofthe pre-operative data that are predictive of the need for RVAD support.RESULTS: An optimal set of 8 pre-operative variables were identified:transpulmonary gradient, age, right atrial pressure, international normalizedratio, heart rate, white blood cell count, alanine aminotransferase, and thenumber of inotropic agents. The resultant decision tree, which consisted of 28branches and 15 leaves, identified RVAD(+) patients with 85% sensitivity, RVAD(-)patients with 83% specificity, and exhibited an area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve of 0.87.CONCLUSIONS: The decision tree model developed in this study exhibited severaladvantages compared with existing risk scores. Quantitatively, it providedimproved prognosis of RV support by encoding the non-linear, synergicinteractions among pre-operative variables. Because of its intuitive structure,it more closely mimics clinical reasoning and therefore can be more readilyinterpreted. Further development with additional multicenter, longitudinal datamay provide a valuable prognostic tool for triage of LVAD therapy and,potentially, improve outcomes.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
