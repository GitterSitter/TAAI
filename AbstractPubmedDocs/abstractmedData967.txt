Ten patients were girls, and 21 were boys. Preoperative diagnoses included cardiomyopathy (n=20), congenital heart disease (n=7), hypertrophiccardiomyopathy (n=2), restrictive cardiomyopathy (n=1), and ischemiccardiomyopathy (n=1). Mean (SD) ischemia time was 185 (72) minutes. Thirty-daymortality was 6%, and was due to primary graft failure (n=2). Overall follow-upwas 4.36 (3.93) years. Eleven patients underwent bridge techniques before HTx,and 11 patients required perioperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation orventricular assist device support.RESULTS: In the group that received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 8patients (73%) were successfully weaned and discharged with excellent functional class. There were no differences in operative mortality, functional class,survival, rejection, and infection rates between the bridged and nonbridgedgroups. Overall actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates were 93% and 83%,respectively. All survivors had good functional class.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate satisfactory medium-term outcome of HTx inselected pediatric patients with end-stage heart disease. Using bridge methods inchildren at high risk can increase the opportunity to receive a donor heart.These bridge methods achieve similar postoperative outcomes.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
