Inaht, Chelsae [corrected to Ihnat, Chelsea].Most infants and children implanted with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are bridged to cardiac transplantation. Prioritizing recovery may decrease thistrend. Patients were treated with LVAD ventricular decompression, medical heartfailure therapy, and bolus therapy with a beta-agonist before weaning trials.Devices were removed if adequate function was observed. Eleven patients with amean age of 1.7 years presented for LVAD implantation. The mean Z score for left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was +5.5 (+1.6 to +7.3), and the mean fractional shortening was 9% (5%-14%). They were on maximal medical therapy andinotropic support. Duration of device support ranged from 6 to 22 days (mean: 13 days). There were three deaths, one from preimplant anoxic brain damage and twofrom thromboembolism. Eight patients (73%) recovered, were explanted, and arealive 0.6-6 years with hearts that have a mean Z score for LVEDD of 1.0(0.09-3.7) and fractional shortening of 23%-36%. Left ventricular assist devicedecompression of dilated left ventricles in infants and children led to long-termsurvival in 73%. Ventricular size was significantly reduced and contractilitysignificantly increased. None of these patients required transplantation.
