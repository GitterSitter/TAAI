The objective of this studywas to compare the HVAD device to the HeartMate II (HMII) axial flow device. Veryfew studies have compared clinical outcomes between newer generation VADs.METHODS: All perioperative and follow-up data on LVAD recipients were collectedprospectively in our institutional database. Between January 2006 and April 2012,46 consecutive patients underwent implantation of either an HVAD (n=13) or a HMII(n=33) device. Pre-implant demographics, perioperative and postoperative clinicaloutcomes were reviewed between groups.RESULTS: Overall, the baseline characteristics, demographics, co-morbidities and laboratory values were comparable between the two groups. The majority of thepatients were Interagency Registry for Mechanical Assisted Circulatory Support3-4 (92% in both groups) and most of the patients were bridge to transplant (75% in HMII vs. 79% in HVAD). Survival and the incidence of perioperative bleeding,renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and infection were similar between thegroups. However, HVAD devices had a significantly higher incidence ofgastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (31% vs. 0% in HMII patients, p<0.01) and stroke(44% vs. 10% in HMII patients, at one year p=0.04). Hemorrhagic strokes were morefrequent in patients with HVAD (three of the five episodes vs. one of the threeepisodes in HMII patients, p=0.06).CONCLUSION: While device complications were comparable, patients with HVADexperienced a significantly higher incidence of stroke and GI bleeding andtherefore refinement in patients' management may decrease incidence of thesecomplications.Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
