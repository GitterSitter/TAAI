Epub 2010 Jul 31.Aortic valve pathophysiology during left ventricular assist device support.John R(1), Mantz K, Eckman P, Rose A, May-Newman K.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University ofMinnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. johnx008@umn.eduThe increased applicability and excellent results with left ventricular assistdevices (LVADs) have revolutionized the available treatment options for patients with advanced heart failure. Pre-existing valve abnormalities are common in this population, and subsequent development of valve abnormalities after LVADplacement is also often noted. Although native mitral and tricuspid valve diseaseis more common in heart failure patients before LVAD placement, aortic valves aremuch more likely to generate abnormal pathophysiology in the LVAD patient during as well as after LVAD placement. The aim of this comprehensive review is toreview aortic valve function in LVAD patients and highlight the consideration of pre-existing valve disease on patient treatment at the time of LVAD implant. The basis for structural changes leading to valve pathophysiology during and afterLVAD placement will be described, providing a basis for improved clinicalunderstanding and new strategies to prevent these conditions.Copyright Â© 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
