Because all of these devicesrequire anticoagulation treatment of various intensities, management of majorbleeding can be critical for the overall outcome of the therapy. In this regard, the newest generation of magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow pumps affordsseveral potential advantages in terms of thrombogenicity and eventualdiscontinuation of anticoagulation treatment. We report the use of a short-termbiventricular assist device (Levitronix CentriMag) for 94 days in a 55-year-oldman with refractory ventricular arrhythmias after combined heart surgery. Despiteserious complications while the patient was on the assist device, includingsevere intestinal bleeding with the necessity of discontinuing anticoagulationfor 10 days and, ultimately, hemicolectomy, the circulatory support was completedwith successful heart transplantation.
