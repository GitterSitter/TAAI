A potential novel strategy to reverse elevated PVR may be implantation of a chronic left ventricular assist device with subsequent left ventricular unloading. We present a patient withelevated PVR secondary to congenital heart disease who was listed for heart-lung transplant. The patient underwent placement of biventricular assist devices andsubsequently experienced marked reduction of PVR, ultimately enabling successful heart transplantation.
