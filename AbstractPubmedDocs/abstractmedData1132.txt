The patient was initially stabilized using central extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, followed by conversion to a leftventricular assist device. Unexpected evidence of cardiac recovery 9 months afterimplant enabled device weaning during a 3-month period, culminating in successfuldevice explantation 1 year after implant. The patient survives 18 months afterexplant in New York Heart Association class I, on conventional heart failuremedical management and metabolic therapy.
