The purpose of this study was toevaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD inend-stage heart failure patients within the first destination program in theNetherlands.METHODS: A third-generation LVAD was implanted in 16 heart failure patients (age 61 ± 8; 81 % male; left ventricular ejection fraction 20 ± 6 %) as destinationtherapy. All patients were ineligible for heart transplant. At baseline, 3 and6 months, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, quality-of-life andexercise capacity were assessed. Clinical adverse events were registered.RESULTS: Survival at 30 days and 6 months was 88 and 75 %, respectively. In thepostoperative phase, 6 (38 %) patients required continuous veno-venoushaemofiltration for renal failure and 2 (13 %) patients required extracorporealmembrane oxygenation because of severe right ventricular failure. Duringfollow-up, NYHA functional class and quality-of-life improved from 3.7 ± 0.1 to2.3 ± 0.1 and 57 ± 5 to 23 ± 3 at 6 months (P < 0.001), respectively. The 6 minwalking distance improved from 168 ± 42 m to 291 ± 29 m at 6 months (P = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD therapy is a promising treatment for patientswith end-stage heart failure ineligible for heart transplant.PMCID: PMC4315784
