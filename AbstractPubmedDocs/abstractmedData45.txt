The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates peaked at 149.0 per 100 waitlist years in 2007 and has been declining since then;in 2013, the rate was 87.4 heart transplants per 100 active waitlist years.Increased waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increasein waitlist mortality. Since 2008, the proportion of patients on life supportbefore transplant increased from 53.4% to 65.8% in 2013. Medical urgencycategories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgencycategories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list each year; the number of pediatric transplants performed each year increased from293 in 2003 to 411 in 2013. Patient survival among pediatric recipients continuesto improve; 5-year patient survival for transplants performed from 2001 through2008 was 70% to 80%. Medicare paid for some or all of the care for 42.2% of allheart transplant recipients in 2012.Â© Copyright 2015 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Societyof Transplant Surgeons.
