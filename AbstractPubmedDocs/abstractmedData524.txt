We report on our experiences of thesepatients with a follow-up of 132 patient years.METHODS: Seventy-four HeartMate II axial flow pumps and 41 HeartWare centrifugal pumps were implanted in patients with non-ischaemic (n = 70) or ischaemiccardiomyopathy (n = 45). The mean age of the patients was 50 ± 13 years. Allpatients were on inotropic support prior to implantation. Extracorporeal membraneoxygenation was used as a bridging procedure in 21 cases.RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 14%. Hospital discharge occurred onaverage after 46 ± 33 days. Twenty-two patients of this cohort received a hearttransplant 492 ± 342 days after implantation of the device. Two patients diedafter heart transplantation. A 1-year survival of 73% and a 2-year survival of69% were recorded, despite a low incidence of transplant procedures. The longest support time was 1686 days.CONCLUSIONS: Modern left ventricular assist device technology can be usedsuccessfully for heart failure. The scarcity of donor hearts leads to prolongedperiods on the device, and chronic ventricular assist device therapy has become areality, although bridge to transplant was intended; therefore, sufficientsupport services for outpatient care of these patients are required.
