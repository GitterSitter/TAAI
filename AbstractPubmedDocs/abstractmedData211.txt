The incidence of RHF complicates 20-50%(range, 9-44%) of cases and is a major factor of postoperative morbidity andmortality. Unfortunately, despite the fact that many risk factors contributing tothe development of RHF after LVAD implantation have been identified, it seems to be extremely difficult to avoid them. Prevention of RHF consists of themanagement of the preload and the afterload of the right ventricle with optimuminotropic support. The administration of vasodilators designed to reducepulmonary vascular resistance is standard practice in most centers. The surgical attempt of implantation of a right ventricular assist device does not alwaysresolve the problem and is not available in all cardiac surgery centers.PMCID: PMC3966152
