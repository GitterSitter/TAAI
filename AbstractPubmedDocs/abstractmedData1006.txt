Because many patients exhibit marked clinical improvement of their heart failure after LVAD implantation, we studied thephysiological effect of pulsatile and non-pulsatile devices on the neurohormonal axis and exercise capacity.METHODS: We prospectively included 20 patients (17 men, 3 women) undergoing LVAD implantation between November 2001 and January 2004. Ten patients (1 woman and 9 men) were treated with the non-pulsatile INCOR-LVAD (Berlin Heart(c)) and tenpatients received the pulsatile EXCOR LVAD (Berlin Heart(c)). Blood samples forplasma renin activity (PRA) were taken once a week over a period of ten weeks.All blood samples were collected in the morning before mobilization. Bloodpressure, body weight, fluid intake and urine production were measured once aday. All patients received standard hospital diet with no limitation in fluidintake.RESULTS: Body weight remained constant in both groups throughout the ten weeks'examination, and fluid intake and urine production were balanced in all patients.Although there was no significant difference in mean blood pressure (INCOR: 70+/- 10 mmHg; EXCOR: 73 +/- 10 mmHg), plasma renin activity was substantiallyelevated in patients with non-pulsatile left ventricular support (INCOR: 94.68+/- 33.97 microU/ml; EXCOR: 17.06 +/- 15.94 microU/ml; P < 0.05). Furthermoreplasma aldosterone levels were significantly higher in patients supported bynon-pulsatile INCOR LVAD (INCOR: 73.4 +/- 9.6 microg/ml; EXCOR: 20.6 +/- 4.6microg/ml; P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that pulsatile as well as non-pulsatile leftventricular assist devices are equally able to treat chronic heart failure.However pulsatile devices seem to have a greater impact on reversing the changes in plasma renin activity and might thus offer a greater advantage when recoveryof left ventricular function is expected.(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York.
