Recentstudies have shown that adenosine inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducedexpression of TNF-alpha in macrophages and rat cardiomyocytes. The aim of thisstudy was to determine whether adenosine has a similar effect in the failinghuman heart.METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular muscle strips were obtained from sevenpatients with end-stage congestive heart failure undergoing heart transplantationor insertion of a left ventricular assist device. The muscle strips wereincubated at 37 degrees C in 95% O2/5% CO2 and stimulated with LPS (10microg/mL). TNF-alpha release in the supernatant was measured with ELISA, andmuscle sections were stained for TNF-alpha. Muscle strips released TNF-alpha inthe absence of LPS (0.22+/-0.05 pg x mL(-1) x mg wet wt[-1]). TNF-alpha wasimmunolocalized to the cardiac myocyte, suggesting that the myocyte is a sourcefor TNF-alpha production. Adenosine (10 micromol/L) decreased TNF-alpha by 40%(P<.05). The selective adenosine A2 receptor agonist DPMA (10 micromol/L)decreased TNF-alpha release by 87% (P<.001), whereas ITu (10 micromol/L), anadenosine-regulating agent that increases endogenous adenosine concentration,inhibited TNF-alpha release by 93% (P<.001).CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine can significantly diminish TNF levels in the failing humanheart and may represent a new pharmacological intervention in congestive heartfailure.
