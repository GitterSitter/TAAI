We evaluated the incidence and outcomes of pump replacement procedures with theHeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD.METHODS: Data were obtained from 1,128 patients implanted from March 2005 toJanuary 2010 with the HeartMate II during the clinical trials for bridge totransplant and destination therapy. The operative mortality associated with thereplacement procedure was determined.RESULTS: The mean duration of HeartMate II support was 568 ± 535 days (cumulativeduration: 1,755 patient-years, longest: 6.5 years). A total of 72 (6.4%) patientsunderwent 79 LVAD replacements (0.045 events/patient-year) of which 2 were in theinitial operation and 77 in separate procedures. Reasons for replacement werepercutaneous lead damage (36 events, 3.0%), device thrombosis (25 events, 2.1%), infection (7 events, 0.6%), and miscellaneous other (11 events, 0.9%). The mediantime to pump replacement was 428 days (range 0 to 1,474). Of the 77 replacementprocedures, there were 5 (6.5%) operative deaths within 30 days. The causes ofdeath were device thrombosis, right heart failure, multisystem organ failure, andbleeding. One year after exchange (median 2.1 years after initial implant), 30%had died, 5% were transplanted, and 65% were ongoing and alive.CONCLUSIONS: HeartMate II device failure requiring pump replacement isinfrequent, but when required can be done safely. These data continue to provide encouraging evidence supporting HeartMate II use for long-term circulatorysupport.Copyright © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
