Circulation. 2006 Jul 4;114(1 Suppl):I16-20.Myocardial expression of the arginine:glycine amidinotransferase gene is elevatedin heart failure and normalized after recovery: potential implications for local creatine synthesis.Cullen ME(1), Yuen AH, Felkin LE, Smolenski RT, Hall JL, Grindle S, Miller LW,Birks EJ, Yacoub MH, Barton PJ.Author information: (1)National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, Heart ScienceCentre, Harefield, Middlesex, UB9 6JH, UK.BACKGROUND: Combination therapy consisting of mechanical unloading using a leftventricular assist device (LVAD) and pharmacological intervention can promoterecovery from end-stage heart failure, but the mechanism is unknown. Preliminary microarray analysis revealed a significant and unexpected decrease in myocardial arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) gene expression during recovery inthese patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and role of AGAT expression in heart failure and recovery.METHODS AND RESULTS: We used quantitative real time (TaqMan) polymerase chainreaction to examine myocardial AGAT mRNA expression in implant and explantsamples from recovering patients after combination therapy (n=12), end-stageheart failure (ESHF) samples from stable patients undergoing transplantationwithout LVAD support (n=10), and donor hearts with normal hemodynamic function(n=8). AGAT mRNA expression was significantly elevated in all heart failurepatients relative to donors (4.3-fold [P<0.001] and 2.7-fold [P<0.005] in LVADand ESHF relative to donors, respectively) and returned to normal levels afterrecovery. AGAT enzyme activity was detectable in both human and rat myocardia andwas elevated in heart failure.CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight local and potentially regulated expression ofAGAT activity in the myocardium and suggest a specific response to heart failure involving elevated local creatine synthesis. These findings have implicationsboth for the management of recovery patients undergoing combination therapy andfor heart failure in general.
