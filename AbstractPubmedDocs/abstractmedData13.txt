In this study, we evaluated the impact ofetiology on outcomes.METHODS: Between January 2009 and March 2013, we implanted a total of 249patients with ECLS; we focused on 64 patients for whom peripheral ECLS was thetreatment for PCS. Of these, 37 cases (58%) were "acute" (mostly acute myocardialinfarction: 39%); 27 (42%) had an exacerbation of "chronic" heart failure(dilated cardiomyopathy: 30%; post-ischemic cardiomyopathy: 9%; and congenital:3%).RESULTS: In the group with chronic etiology, 23 patients were bridged to a leftventricular assist device (52%) or heart transplantation (33%). In the group withacute etiology, ECLS was used as a bridge-to-transplantation in 3 patients (8%), a bridge-to-bridge in 9 (24%), and a bridge-to-recovery in 18 (49%). One patient in each group was bridged to conventional surgery. Recovery of cardiac functionwas achieved in only the group with acute primary cardiogenic shock (18 vs 0patients, P = .0001). A mean flow during support of ≤60% of the theoretic flow(body surface area × 2.4) was a predictor of successful weaning (P = .02). Medianduration of ECLS support was 7 days (range: 2-11.5 days). Nine patients (14%)died during support; 30-day overall survival was 80% (51 of 64 patients); and 59%of patients were discharged, in whom survival at 48 months was 90%. Thirty-daysurvival was correlated with duration of ECLS support.CONCLUSIONS: In "chronic" heart failure, ECLS represents a bridge to aventricular assist device or heart transplantation, whereas in "acute" settings, it offers a considerable chance of recovery, and is often the only requiredtherapy.Copyright © 2015 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
