Epub 2007 Mar 5.Ventricular arrhythmias during left ventricular assist device support.Bedi M(1), Kormos R, Winowich S, McNamara DM, Mathier MA, Murali S.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Institute and Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University ofPittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been used effectively as a "bridge" to cardiac transplantation and as destination therapy in patients with advancedheart failure. Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) have been reported to occur inLVAD-supported patients, although their incidence, risk factors, and clinicalsignificance have not been characterized. In this study, 111 patients whoreceived LVAD support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation at the University ofPittsburgh Medical Center from January 1987 to June 2001 were evaluated.Clinically significant VA was defined as ventricular fibrillation, sustainedventricular tachycardia, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with symptomsrequiring antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients were grouped on the basis of thepresence or absence of VAs. VAs occurred in 24 patients (22%) during devicesupport. Ischemic heart disease was the cause of heart failure in 71% of patients(17 of 24) in the VA group and 45% of patients (39 of 87) in the group withoutVAs (p <0.05). The mortality rate was significantly higher (p <0.001) during LVADsupport in the group with VAs (33%) compared with the group without VAs (18%). Inthe group with VAs, the early (<or=1 week) occurrence of VAs was associated with a significantly higher (p <0.001) mortality rate (54%) compared with late (>1week) occurrence (9%). In conclusion, although clinically significant VAs occurin patients with heart failure receiving LVAD support, the overall incidence islow. VAs are more frequent in patients with ischemic heart failure, and theiroccurrence is associated with greater mortality. The occurrence of VAs earlyafter LVAD implantation, in particular, predicts a higher mortality rate.
