Prior to HTx 23% (98)required inotropic support, 8.5% (34) an intra-aortic balloon pump and 11% (43) aventricular assist device.RESULTS: Actuarial patient survival was 86% at 30 days, 79% at 1 year and 62% at 10 years. Survival was similar regardless of the heart failure severity, P=0.22. The cumulative incidence of allograft vasculopathy, Costanzo grade≥2, was 7% at 5years and 23% by 10 years with an 11% cumulative probability of requiring apercutaneous coronary intervention by 10 years. Allograft function was preserved with a mean±SD left ventricular ejection fraction of 73±7% at 1 year and 74±8% at10 years. The cumulative incidence of malignancy by 10 years was 27% (skinmalignancy 13% and post transplant lymphoproliferative diseases 10%). Thecumulative incidence of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimatedglomerular filtration rate≤45 ml/min/1.73 m2 was 42% at 1 year, 62% at 5 yearsand 72% at 10 years and of requiring long-term renal replacement therapy was10.6% at 10 years.CONCLUSION: HTx provided good medium-term survival for patients with advancedheart failure, independent of its severity. The incidence of allograftvasculopathy was lower than reported previously but malignancy and CKD remaincause for concern.
