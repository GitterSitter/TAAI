The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Iva during MU, in a rodent model of HF.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the chronic effects (4 weeks) of Iva (10mg/kg/day) alone and in combination with MU [induced by heterotopic abdominalheart transplantation (HATx)] on whole-heart and cellular structure, function,and excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in a rodent (rat) model of HF, 12 weekspost-left coronary artery (LCA) ligation. Effects of Iva were compared with thoseof Î²-blockade using metoprolol [(Met), 250 mg/kg/day]. Iva, but not Met, reversedmyocardial fibrosis, alone and in combination with MU. MU-induced restoration of deranged E-C coupling was enhanced by Iva to a greater extent than Met: both Iva and Met enhanced the recovery of the Ca(2+) transient amplitude and thesarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content, but Iva alone maintained MU-inducednormalization of L-type Ca(2+) current and t-tubule abnormalities. Met prevented MU-induced reduction in the myocardial size (myocardial atrophy); Iva had noeffect on this parameter.CONCLUSION: Iva shows beneficial structural and E-C coupling effects during MU:Iva reverses myocardial fibrosis and enhances the restoration of deranged E-Ccoupling, displaying more beneficial effects than that of Met. These resultssuggest that Iva may prove effective in enhancing functional recovery in heartfailure patients receiving LVAD therapy.
