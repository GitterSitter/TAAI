INTERMACS data were analyzedthrough the most recent quarter ending March 31, 2008.STUDY DESIGN: INTERMACS variables include demographics, patient outcomes(survival and adverse events), hemodynamic data, and laboratory values. Data wereanalyzed with competing outcomes methods. Risk factors were identified for death and transplantation.RESULTS: Ninety-four sites have prospectively enrolled 483 patients in INTERMACS (BTT, 80%; destination therapy, 15%; bridge to recovery, 5%). Forty-two percentof patients had critical cardiogenic shock before implantation, 38% hadprogressive circulatory decline despite inotropic agents, and 8% were stable but inotropic agent-dependent. The remaining 12% had recurrent advanced heartfailure, severe exercise intolerance, or advanced class III heart failure. At 6months postimplantation, the competing outcomes for the 483 patients includedongoing support (42%), cardiac transplantation (33%), cardiac recovery with pump removal (3%), or death (22%). The most common causes of death were centralnervous system events (11%), cardiovascular failure (8%), or respiratory failure (8%). Less common causes were infection (4%), device malfunction (4%), and liver failure (3%). Survival for BTT and destination therapy were similar (p = 0.53).Patient profile at the time of implantation (critical cardiogenic shock versusothers) influenced survival (p = 0.007), as did device configuration (leftventricular assist device versus biventricular ventricular assist device; p <0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: INTERMACS has increasing participation among domestic MCSD centers. The influence of preimplantation patient condition on survival underscores theimportance of timely referral before critical cardiogenic shock occurs. As moredevices achieve US FDA approval, INTERMACS will become useful for comparingMCSDs.
