The availability of relatively low-cost short-termmechanical support devices has altered the management of primary graft failurebut there are few data on clinical outcome. Here, we describe the UK experiencewith Levitronix CentriMag support following heart transplantation across multiplecentres.METHODS: Data for all adult heart transplants and all CentriMag devices usedwithin 30 days of heart transplantation in the UK between November 2003 and July 2008 were collected. Transplant characteristics were compared for those who didand did not receive CentriMag support, and device outcomes and survival rateswere summarised.RESULTS: A total of 572 heart transplants were performed in this period. As many as 38 patients (6.6%) were implanted with CentriMag devices for primary graftfailure. Four patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation concurrently and were excluded from further analysis. There were no significant differences intransplant characteristics between the patients who received CentriMag supportand those who did not. Twelve patients were explanted; nine survived but threedied shortly afterwards. Five underwent acute retransplantation; two survived andthree died. Seventeen patients died on support. The 30-day and 1-year survivalrates were 50% (95% confidence interval (CI) 32-65%) and 32% (95% CI 18-48%),respectively. Patients who previously had a bridge-to-transplant ventricularassist device (VAD) had significantly better survival than those who did not(1-year survival 71% vs 22%, p = 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: Primary graft failure remains an important early complication ofheart transplantation. Levitronix CentriMag support led to the salvage of 32% of patients with severe allograft failure.Copyright Â© 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published byElsevier B.V.
