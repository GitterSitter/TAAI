We hypothesized that LVAD explant-OHT is a more challengingsurgical procedure compared to OHT without LVAD explantation and thatinstitutional LVAD explant-OHT procedural volume would be associated withpost-transplant graft survival. We sought to assess the impact of institutionalvolume of LVAD explant-OHT on post-transplant graft survival.METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the Scientific Registry ofTransplant Recipients for adult OHTs with long-term LVAD explantation. LVADexplant-OHT volume was characterized on the basis of the center's year-specifictotal OHT volume (OHTvol) and year-specific LVAD explant-OHT volume quartile(LVADvolQ). The effect of LVADvolQ on graft survival (death orre-transplantation) was analyzed.RESULTS: From 2004 to 2011, 2,681 patients underwent OHT with LVAD explantation(740 with HeartMate XVE, 1,877 with HeartMate II and 64 with HeartWare devices). LVAD explant-OHT at centers falling in the lowest LVADvolQ was associated withreduced post-transplant graft survival (p = 0.022). After adjusting forannualized OHTvol (HR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.993 to 1.003, p = 0.515 and pulsatile XVE(HR = 0.842, 95% CI 0.688 to 1.032, p = 0.098), multivariate analysis confirmed asignificantly (approximately 37%) increased risk of post-transplant graft failureamong explant-OHT procedures occurring at centers in the lowest volume quartile(HR = 1.371, 95% CI 1.030 to 1.825, p = 0.030).CONCLUSION: Graft survival is decreased when performed at centers falling in the lowest quartile of LVAD explant-OHT for a given year. This volume-survivalrelationship should be considered in the context of limited donor organavailability and the rapidly growing number of LVAD centers.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
