Wiener Cardiovascular Institute, Mount Sinai MedicalCenter, New York, New York, USA.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted CirculatorySupport (INTERMACS) I classification encompasses patients with varying clinicalpresentations and prognoses. The purpose of this review is to discuss foursub-classifications of cardiogenic shock patients (acute myocardial infarction,acute decompensated heart failure, biventricular failure, and myocarditis), andexplore management considerations for these groups, with particular emphasis onstrategies for device placement.RECENT FINDINGS: In single-center studies, the use of intra-aortic ballooncounterpulsation, percutaneous ventricular assist devices, and extra-corporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) has allowed approximately half of cardiogenic shockpatients to receive an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or hearttransplant, or experience myocardial recovery. Primary implantation of a durable LVAD in well-selected myocardial infarction shock patients was associated with a 1-year survival of 86% in one small case series. Analysis of amulti-institutional database suggests patients older than 65 years have a lowerpost-implantation survival compared with younger recipients.SUMMARY: Device selection strategies for INTERMACS I patients are predicated on apatient's prognosis, hemodynamic stability, end organ, and neurologic status.Percutaneous assist devices may be preferred for patients with favorableprognoses, ECMO for patients with hemodynamic compromise, and durable mechanical support for patients failing to recover sustainable myocardial function aftershort-term device use.
