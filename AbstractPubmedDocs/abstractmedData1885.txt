To give these patients a chance to survive their waiting time,chronic mechanical circulatory support, especially left ventricular assistdevices have been clinically established. The results with this therapy areencouraging. Because of these results trials using these devices as analternative for cardiac transplantation are initiated. Due to the furtherdevelopment and miniaturization of such devices this indication will become more important. The most interesting patients are the one, in which devices could beexplanted after chronic support, because their myocard has recovered. If we canfind a way to identify such patients a new form of therapy for end-stage heartdisease could be established.
