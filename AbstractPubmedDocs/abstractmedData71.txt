Electronic address:thorwich@mednet.ucla.edu.Although high body mass index (BMI) is associated with improved outcomes inestablished heart failure (HF), the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness on thisobesity paradox is less clear. We studied 1,675 patients with systolic HF whounderwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at a single university center (77.4%men, mean age 52.2 ± 11.6 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 23.2 ±7.1% and New York Heart Association class III or IV in 79.1%). We evaluated2-year survival in patients stratified by both BMI (normal 18.5 to 24.9kg/m(2)[reference], overweight 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2), obese ≥30.0 kg/m(2)) and bypeak oxygen uptake (PKVO2; high >14 ml/kg/minute, low ≤14 ml/kg/minute). At 2years, BMI category was significantly associated with outcomes for the low PKVO2 group (p <0.001) but not the high PKVO2 group (p = 0.1). In the low PKVO2 group, obese patients had decreased risk of death free from urgent status 1A hearttransplant or ventricular assist device placement after multivariate adjustmentcompared with normal BMI (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]0.44 to 0.91, p = 0.01); no significant difference was observed for overweightpatients (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.25, p = 0.5). In the high PKVO2 group, norelation was seen (overweight BMI HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32, p = 0.3; obese HR0.87, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.75, p = 0.7). In conclusion, the obesity paradox was only observed in patients with lower cardiorespiratory fitness in this advancedsystolic HF cohort, indicating that improved functional capacity may attenuatethe obesity paradox.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
