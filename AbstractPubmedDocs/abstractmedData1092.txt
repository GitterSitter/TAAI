Over thepast decade, an increasing number of assist devices have been developed for both temporary and long-term circulatory support. Different types of devices areplaced either percutaneously or surgically in different scenarios. Extracorporealpercutaneous devices are useful for rapid implementation of support aimed atstabilizing the patient's general condition by providing enough systemiccirculation and improvement of native heart function to allow removal of thedevice. Instead of veno-arterial bypass, new percutaneous devices that directlydrain the left atrium or ventricle seem a promising option. If recovery isunlikely, further assessment and additional treatment should be considered forlonger term support aiming at bridging to transplantation or chronic assistance. Short-term support with extracorporeal devices to bridge the patient to long-termtherapies is becoming a more and more important strategy. Paracorporeal pulsatiledevices still have an important role for patients requiring biventricular supportor in the pediatric population. Chronic support aiming at heart transplantationusing a paracorporeal device is an alternative option until the new rotary blood pumps become available in Japan.
