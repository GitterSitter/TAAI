Anticoagulant therapy varied as afunction of patient status: 1) postoperative bleeding was treated by partialreplacement of deficient factors (VII and VIII) and hemoderivatives in order tomaintain factor VIII at 50% of normal levels; 2) once the bleeding had stopped,the effect of the hemophilia itself maintained the degree of anticoagulationrequired by the ventricular assist device; and 3) transplant surgery was followedby complete replacement of factor VIII and intravenous heparinization (a simpleway of preventing clot formation in the device and to ensure proper scarring ofsurgical wounds).CONCLUSIONS: Selection of anticoagulant therapy as a function of patient statusin terms of bleeding and surgical-wound scarring progress is vital for the properfunctioning of support techniques (Berlin-Heart biventricular assist andextracorporeal membrane oxygenation) in hemophiliac patients. Collagen dressings placed on surgical wounds achieved good functional and aesthetic results, as wellas mechanically isolating the scars from the exterior.
