Therefore, we investigated the complexinterplay of duration of mechanical circulatory support and patient and devicefactors affecting survival on support, as well as survival after transplantation.METHODS: From December 21, 1991, to July 1, 2006, mechanical circulatory support was used in 375 patients as a bridge to transplantation, with 262 surviving totransplant. Implantable pulsatile devices were used in 321 patients, continuousflow was used in 11 patients, a total artificial heart was used in 5 patients,external pulsatile devices were used in 34 patients, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in 68 patients. Two time-related models were developed: (1) a competing-risks multivariable model of death on mechanical circulatory support,with modulated renewal for each sequential support mode; and (2) a model of deathafter transplant in which patient factors and duration of mechanical circulatory support were investigated as risk factors.RESULTS: Survival after initiating mechanical circulatory support, irrespectiveof transplantation, was 86% at 30 days, 55% at 5 years, and 41% at 10 years;survival was 94%, 74%, and 58% at the same time intervals, respectively, aftertransplantation in those surviving the procedure. Risk factors for death includedlonger, but not shorter, duration of mechanical circulatory support, use ofmultiple devices, global sensitization, and poor renal function.CONCLUSION: Initiating mechanical circulatory support early with a singledefinitive device may improve survival to and after cardiac transplantation.Early transplant, which avoids infection, sensitization, and neurologiccomplications, may improve bridge and transplant survival.2010.
