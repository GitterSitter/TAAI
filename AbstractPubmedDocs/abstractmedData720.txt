We examined the safe working range for LVAD pump speed and the effect on pump output and cardiac function in 13 stable outpatients with VentrAssist-LVAD (Ventracor Ltd, Australia). Pump speed was decreased from abaseline mean of 2,073 ± 86 revolutions per minute (RPM, with corresponding mean flow of 5.59 ± 1.18 L/min, mean ± standard deviation) to an average low-speed of 1,835 ± 55 RPM (corresponding flow 4.68 ± 0.99 L/min) and up to high-speed of2,315 ± 66 RPM (corresponding flow 6.30 ± 1.29 L/min). There was a strong linear relationship between alteration in speed and flow rates (r(2) = 0.89, p <0.00001) but marked interpatient variation. Downward titration to preset minimum 1,800 RPM was achieved in 9/13 (69%) and upward titration to the preset maximum2,400 RPM was achieved in 4/13 (31%). Upward titration was stopped due toventricular suction or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 4/13 (31%).Ventricular suction or VT (in 4/13) tended to be more common in patients withpoor right ventricular (RV) function (p = 0.07). In summary, pump flow is stable within a relatively small speed range and should not be altered without closemonitoring due to variation in response between patients, particularly withconcomitant RV impairment.
