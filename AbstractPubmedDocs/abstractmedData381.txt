Axial flowcfLVADS have been associated with increased rates of adverse gastrointestinalevents such as bleeding angiodysplasia. The purpose of this study was todetermine the incidence of bleeding gastrointestinal tract angiodysplasia and theprofile of patients supported with the centrifugal cfLVAD, referred forendoscopy.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 66 patients implanted with Ventrassist (n = 33) and Heartware (n = 33) centrifugal continuous flow LVADs was performed. Allpatients were on warfarin, aspirin and/or clopidogrel. Endoscopy was performed inall patients with either active gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 6) or anemia with positive fecal occult blood (n = 6).RESULTS: Bleeding gastrointestinal angiodysplasia was demonstrated in 5 out ofthe 12 (41.6%) patients who underwent endoscopy from the cohort of 66 cfLVADsupported patients (7.6%). The incidence of bleeding angiodysplasia was higherthan the age-standardized rate of andiodysplasia from literature (0.8%). Activegastrointestinal bleeding in one other patient was due to diverticulosis. Thefive patients with bleeding angiodysplasia tended to be older than the remaining 61 patients (58.8 ± 10.3 vs 49.6 ± 15.7 years, p = 0.2).CONCLUSIONS: We found excess bleeding angiodysplasia in patients on centrifugalcfLVAD support. It may be appropriate to screen for angiodysplasia particularlyin older patients prior to support by centrifugal cf LVADs. Reasons for thehigher rate of bleeding angiodysplasia in cfLVAD patients warrant further study.
