We monitored the introduction of 4 Impella Recover 100 devices in 2 patients by means of the transesophageal approach in the operating room, andthereafter we monitored the functioning of the devices by means of themultisection transthoracic approach in the intensive coronary care unit. Thefirst Impella placement was performed in a patient as a "bridge" to hearttransplantation, whereas the other three placements were performed in a patientas "recovery" for acute myocarditis. In all patients transesophagealechocardiography turned out to be a valuable tool to monitor the introduction andthe perioperative hemodynamic management of the Impella device. In the earlypostoperative phase, transthoracic echocardiography allowed us to assess any pumpdisplacement, and optimize biventricular function and adequate inotropic support.In conclusion, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography resulted in avaluable method for monitoring the correct placement and functioning of the left ventricular assist device Impella Recover 100.
