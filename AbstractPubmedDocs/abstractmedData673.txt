New temporary ventricular assist devices (VADs)that are rapidly applied to normalize cardiac output in patients with severeheart failure are being used more frequently. Bridge to decision describes thetemporary use of a VAD to stabilize critically ill patients until completediagnostic tests are performed and decisions about more definitive therapy aremade. The CentriMag, TandemHeart, and Impella VADs offer versatility for use inmany patients and in multiple hospital settings. These VADs provide continuousblood flow, altering the usual assessment of arterial blood pressure. Patientsare usually immobilized during support to prevent dislodgement of cannulas.Anticoagulation therapy is commonly required, and bleeding is a frequentcomplication. Infection prevention measures must be used to avoid septiccomplications. In the past 10 years, clinical experience with these devices hasexpanded, but they remain underused.
