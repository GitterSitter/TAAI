The significance of progressive ventricular dysfunction amongnonresponders remains unclear.OBJECTIVE: We sought to define predictors of and clinical outcomes associatedwith progressive ventricular dysfunction despite CRT.METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 328 patients undergoing CRT withdefibrillator for standard indications. On the basis of 6-month echocardiograms, we classified patients as responders (those with a ≥5% increase in ejectionfraction) and progressors (those with a ≥5% decrease in ejection fraction), andall others were defined as nonprogressors. Coprimary end points were 3-year (1)heart failure, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transplantation, or deathand (2) ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).RESULTS: Multivariable predictors of progressive ventricular dysfunction werealdosterone antagonist use (hazard ratio [HR] 0.23; P = .008), prior valvesurgery (HR 3.3; P = .005), and QRS duration (HR 0.98; P = .02). More favorablechanges in ventricular function were associated with lower incidences of heartfailure, LVAD, transplantation, or death (70% vs 54% vs 33%; P < .0001) and VT orVF (66% vs 38% vs 28%; P = .001) for progressors, nonprogressors, and responders,respectively. After multivariable adjustment, progressors remained at increasedrisk of heart failure, LVAD, transplantation, or death (HR 2.14; P = .0029) andVT or VF (HR 2.03; P = .046) as compared with nonprogressors. Responders were at decreased risk of heart failure, LVAD, transplantation, or death (HR 0.44; P <.0001) and VT or VF (0.51; P = .015) as compared with nonprogressors.CONCLUSION: Patients with progressive deterioration in ventricular functiondespite CRT represent a high-risk group of nonresponders at increased risk ofworsened clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.
