We describe a 36-year-old man with no significantmedical history who presented with flu-like symptoms of 3-week duration. When he sought medical attention, he was already manifesting heart failure secondary tofulminant myocarditis, along with multiorgan failure. Despite aggressivemanagement, including circulatory support with a catheter-based mechanicalcardiac assist device (Impella 2.5 Cardiac Assist Device, Abiomed, Danvers, MA)as a bridge to cardiac transplant, and aggressive antiviral and antibacterialtherapy, the patient died of cardiac arrest. An H1N1 polymerase chain reactionpostmortem assay produced positive results, and a diagnosis of fulminant viralmyocarditis and multiorgan system failure was established.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
