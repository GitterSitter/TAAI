RVDwas defined as the use of a left VAD (LVAD) with an elevated central venouspressure of >16 mm Hg with inotropic therapy and/or inhaled nitric oxide for >96 hours or biventricular assist (BiVAD).RESULTS: A total of 57 children (median age, 2.97 years; range 35 days to 15.8years) were supported. Of the 57, 43 (75%) had an LVAD, and of those, 10developed RVD. The remaining 14 (25%) required BiVAD. Thus, RVD occurred in 24 of57 patients (42%). Preoperative variables such as younger age (P = .01), use ofextracorporeal mechanical support (P = .006), and elevated urea (P = .03),creatinine (P = .02), and bilirubin (P = .001) were associated with RVD. Multiplelogistic regression analysis indicated that elevated urea and extracorporealmechanical support (odds ratio, 26.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-307.3; andodds ratio, 27.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-312.3, respectively) were riskfactors for BiVAD. The patients who developed RVD on LVAD had a complicatedpostoperative course but excellent survival (100%), comparable to those withpreserved right ventricular function (91%). The survival for those requiringBiVAD was reduced (71%).CONCLUSIONS: RVD occurred in approximately 40% of pediatric VAD recipients andaffects their peri-implantation morbidity and bridging outcomes. Preoperativeextracorporeal membrane oxygenation and elevated urea were risk factors forBiVAD. Additional studies of the management of RVD in children after VADimplantation are warranted.Copyright © 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published byMosby, Inc. All rights reserved.
