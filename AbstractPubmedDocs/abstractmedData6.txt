[Epub ahead of print]Manipulation of SR Ca(2+) -release in heart failure through mechanicalintervention.Ibrahim M(1), Nader A, Yacoub MH, Terracciano C.Author information: (1)Integrated Resident in Cardiac Surgery, Division of Cardiovascular Surgery,Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104,USA.Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) were developed as a means of temporarycirculatory support, but the mechanical unloading they offer also results insignificant reverse remodeling. In selected patients, these improvements aresufficient to allow ultimate device explantation without requiringtransplantation; this represents a fundamental shift in our understanding ofheart failure. Like heart failure itself, LVADs influence multiple biologicalsystems. The transverse tubules are a system of membrane invaginations inventricular cardiomyocytes which allow rapid propagation of the action potential throughout the cell. Through their dense concentration of L-type Ca(2+) channels in close proximity with intracellular Ryanodine receptors, the t-tubules enablesynchronous Ca(2+) release throughout the cell. The t-tubules' structure appears to be specifically regulated by mechanical load, such that either the overload ofheart failure (or the spontaneously hypertensive rat model (Song etÂ al., 2006))or the profound unloading in a chronically unloaded heart result in impairedt-tubule structure, with ineffective Ca(2+) release. While there are multiplemolecular pathways which underpin t-tubule regulation, Tcap appears to beimportant in regulating the effect of altered loading on the t-tubule system.This article is protected by copyright.
