Epub2008 Aug 26.Resolution of central sleep apnoea following implantation of a left ventricularassist device.Vazir A, Hastings PC, Morrell MJ, Pepper J, Henein MY, Westaby S, Poole-WilsonPA, Cowie MR, Simonds AK.Central sleep apnoea (CSA) occurs in up to 40% of patients with chronic heartfailure (CHF). It is thought to be a consequence of CHF and is associated with anaccelerated decline in cardiac function, and increased morbidity and mortality.The optimal treatment of CSA remains unclear. Resolution of CSA has been reportedafter cardiac transplantation. We report the first case of resolution of CSA 10months following implantation of a permanent Jarvik 2000 left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The correction of CSA after implantation of the LVAD wasassociated with improvements in symptoms, exercise capacity, renal function, and increased arterial carbon dioxide levels at rest during wakefulness and alsoreduction in brain natriuretic peptide.Copyright 2008.
