Our decision to offer MCS fornontransplant candidates has led to their reevaluation after a period of leftventricular assist device (LVAD) support.METHODS: From 2001 to September 2009, we had 37 patients who received animplantable LVAD, 22 (59%) were not deemed to be transplant eligible at the time of LVAD insertion (bridge to candidacy, BTC group).RESULTS: Fifteen (41%) patients were considered transplant eligible (bridge totransplant, BTT group) at the time of device insertion and received a HeartMateXVE (n = 7), HeartMate 2 (n = 7), or a Novacor LVAS (n = 1). In the BTC group,patients received the HeartMate XVE device (n = 11), HeartMate 2 (n = 5), or the Novacor LVAS (n = 6). The primary criterion for transplant ineligibility wasrefractory pulmonary hypertension (PH) in 18 patients, 3 patients did not meetour body mass index criteria (>35 kg/m(2)), and 2 patients weredialysis-dependent. Six (27%) BTC patients died on support. Overall, 16/22patients (73%) were subsequently listed for transplantation, with one listed for combined heart-lung due to refractory PH. Twelve patients (75%) underwentsuccessful heart transplantation. Three patients died during their transplant.Overall posttransplant survival at one year shows lower survival in the BTC groupcompared to the BTT group (67% vs. 100%, p = 0.05). At two years and three years the survival was lower, but not statistically different (BTC vs. BTT: 67% vs. 90%and 64% vs. 87%, respectively, p = NS).CONCLUSIONS: MCS can successfully convert a large proportion oftransplant-ineligible patients into acceptable candidates. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
