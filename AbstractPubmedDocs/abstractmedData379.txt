Consequently, more patients with advanced heart failure require aventricular assist device (VAD). We report U.K. activity, trends, and outcome forlong-term VAD support as a bridging therapy to HTx.METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were grouped into three eras: E1, February2004-March 2006; E2, April 2006-March 2009; and E3, April 2009-March 2011.Exclusions were patients who received isolated short-term support orextracorporeal membrane oxygenation without prior or subsequent long-term VADsupport. A total of 247 patients received VAD support; 202 left ventricular(LVAD) support alone and 45 both left and right ventricular support. Activityincreased over time, from 36 patients implanted in E1 to 123 in E3. Overall, 46patients received a first-generation device, 80 a second-generation device, and121 a third-generation device. Use of third-generation devices increased from <6%in E1 to 78% in E3. Median duration of LVAD support increased from 141 days in E1to 578 days in E3 (P < 0.001). Overall survival to 1 year after LVAD implant rosefrom 58.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.7-72.4%] in E1 to 72.5% (95% CI63.3-79.8%) in E3 (P = 0.21), and improved significantly with device generation; at 1 year, 50% of patients with first-generation devices were alive compared with68.1% and 76.9% of patients with second- and third-generation devices,respectively (P = 0.002). These differences remained after risk adjustment. HTxfollowing LVAD implant reduced over time (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: VAD activity and duration of support have increased. There has been ashift from first- and second- to third-generation devices, and an associatedimprovement in survival.
