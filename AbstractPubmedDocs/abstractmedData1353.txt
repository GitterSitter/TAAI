We present our experiencewith HTx after an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) hybrid with various ventricular assist devices (VAD). From May 1996 to December 2003, mechanicalcirculatory support with a Biopump VAD was performed in eight patients, HeartMateleft VAD in eight patients, and Thoratec VAD in eight patients. Before VADimplantation, 19 patients maintained their circulation with ECMO. Half of the 24 patients were implanted with VAD to await a suitable donor for HTx. We observedthat half of the patients supported by ECMO hybrid with various VAD awaited asuitable donor for HTx. In our experience, we recommend the application of ECMOfor short-term support within 1 week and the Biopump VAD, Thoractec VAD, orHeartMate VAD for medium-term or long-term support as a bridge to HTx.
