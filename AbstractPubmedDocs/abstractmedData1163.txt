The median patient age was 1.7 years (12days to 17 years). The median patient weight was 9.4 kg (3 to 38 kg). Allchildren were supported with multiple intravenous inotropes+/-mechanicalventilation (6) or ECMO (3) before BiVAD implantation. All had significant right ventricular dysfunction. The median pulmonary vascular resistance index (Rpi) was6.0 WU/m(2). Eight patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantationafter a median duration of BiVAD support of 35 days (1 to 77 days). One deathoccurred after 10 days of support from perioperative renal failure in a 3 kginfant. Five patients required at least 1 blood pump change. One patient had adriveline infection requiring treatment. There were no acute neurologicalcomplications, no thromboembolic events, and no bleeding complications. In 2patients with Rpi >10 WU/m(2) unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilator therapy, Rpi dropped to 1.4 and 4.6 WU/m(2), after 33 and 41 days of support, respectively.All 8 survivors underwent successful heart transplantation. Of 5 patientssupported >30 days, 3 developed an extremely elevated (>90%) panel reactiveantibody by ELISA that was not confirmed by other methods; none had a positivedonor-specific retrospective crossmatch. There was 1 episode of rejection (withhemodynamic compromise) in the 8 transplanted patients. Rpi was normal (<3WU/m(2)) without pulmonary vasodilators in all patients within 3 months aftertransplant. There have been no deaths after transplant with a median follow-up of19 months.CONCLUSIONS: BiVAD support can effectively be used in small children as a bridge to heart transplantation and can be accomplished with low mortality andmorbidity. BiVAD support may offer an additional means to reverse extremelyelevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Surveillance for HLA antibodysensitization during BiVAD support may be complicated by the development ofnon-HLA antibodies which may not reflect true HLA presensitization.
