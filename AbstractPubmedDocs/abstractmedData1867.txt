Am J Cardiol. 1999 Feb 1;83(3):396-9.Myocardial adenine nucleotides, glycogen, and Na, K-ATPase in patients withidiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy requiring mechanical circulatory support.Ishino K(1), BÃ¸tker HE, Clausen T, Hetzer R, Sehested J.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Germany.Acute decompensation leading to progressive pump failure is a main cause of deathin patients with congestive heart failure. To find possible metabolic defectsassociated with the onset of this fatal occurrence, we measured myocardialadenine nucleotides, glycogen, and Na,K-ATPase in patients with end-stageidiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The biopsy specimens were obtained from theright ventricle of beating hearts during implantation of a biventricularassistance device in 23 patients (group I) suffering from irreversiblecardiogenic shock and during heart transplantation in 20 patients (group II) incompensated heart failure. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) wasdetermined preoperatively by echocardiography. Left ventricular function in groupI was more severely impaired than in group II (LVEF 16.8%+/-4.6% vs 22.1%+/-5.1%; p <0.01). Myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in group I was significantlyreduced in comparison with group II (119.4+/-10.2 vs 27.7+/-7.4 nmol/mgnoncollagen protein; p <0.01). There was no difference in glycogen levels.Na,K-ATPase concentration in group I (n = 8) was lower than that of group II (n =20) (425+/-80 vs 498+/-75 pmol/g wet weight; p <0.05). Linear regression analysesshowed a significant correlation between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and LVEF (r= 0.41, p <0.01) and between Na,K-ATPase and LVEF (r = 0.55, p <0.01). Theseresults indicate that loss of myocardial ATP and Na,K-ATPase could partiallycontribute to the development of spontaneous deterioration of the chronicallyoverloaded heart.
