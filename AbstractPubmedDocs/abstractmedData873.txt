Advanced stage of heart failure].[Article in Spanish]Ventura H(1), Bichara VM.Author information: (1)Sección Miocardiopatía y Trasplante Cardiaco. Ochsner Heart and VascularInstitute. New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.Heart failure is considering one of the most prevalent diseases in recent years. Despite advances in the treatment with new drugs and devices such as implantable defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy, the progression in heartfailure leads to deterioration in the quality of life, frequent hospitalizations and high mortality rates. Advanced stage of this disease remains hearttransplantation for treatment choice, although is not the adequate therapy forall the patients. Many of them require support with inotropic drugs, which leadto a progressive deterioration and limited survival, because waiting times areprolonged or transplantation is not performed. Therefore, progress in circulatorysupport devices allow to consider these as the treatment while awaitingtransplantation and an alternative when the transplant is not considered anoption. It is our objective to review the progress and the usefulness ofcirculatory support devices in patients with advanced heart failure, in which thelast option is heart transplantation.
