In patients with end-stage disease, mechanical circulatory supportmay improve survival, quality of life, and serve as bridge to cardiactransplantation. There are many ethical issues surrounding the use of mechanical circulatory support in patients with CHD including the use of prospective andrandomized trials, proper oversight of new therapies, and transparency inreporting. Additionally, there are ethical considerations relevant to the greatersociety as these therapies are highly resource intensive in a resource-limitedsociety. This article will review the burden of disease of heart failure inpatients with CHD, the challenges of mechanical circulatory support and hearttransplantation, and the ethical considerations and problems that arise for this population.
