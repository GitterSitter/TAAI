The impact of ventricular assist devices on arrhythmias andhow arrhythmias affect the clinical course of this population are not welldescribed.METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-centre retrospective analysis of children receivinga ventricular assist device between 1998 and 2011 was performed. In all, 45patients received 56 ventricular assist devices. The median age at initialplacement was 13 years (interquartile range 6-15). The median duration of supportwas 10 days (range 2-260). The aetiology of heart failure includedcardiomyopathy, transplant rejection, myocarditis, and congenital heart disease. In all, 32 patients (71%) had an arrhythmia; 19 patients (42%) had an arrhythmia before ventricular assist device and eight patients (18%) developed newarrhythmias on ventricular assist device. Ventricular tachycardia was most common(25/32, 78%). There was no correlation between arrhythmia and risk of death ortransplantation (p=0.14). Of the 15 patients who weaned from ventricular assistdevice, post-ventricular assist device arrhythmias occurred in nine (60%), withfive (33%) having their first arrhythmia after weaning. Patients with ventriculardysfunction after ventricular assist device were more likely to have arrhythmias (p<0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Arrhythmias, especially ventricular, are common in childrenrequiring ventricular assist device. They frequently persist for those able towean from ventricular assist device.
