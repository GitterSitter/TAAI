Tex Heart Inst J. 2006;33(2):111-5.Clinical experience with the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device.Kar B(1), Adkins LE, Civitello AB, Loyalka P, Palanichamy N, Gemmato CJ, MyersTJ, Gregoric ID, Delgado RM 3rd.Author information: (1)The Heart Failure and Transplant Program, Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.The TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device can be used to supportpatients in cardiogenic shock (until cardiac recovery occurs or as a bridge todefinitive therapy) or as a temporary application during high-risk coronaryinterventions. The TandemHeart is a left atrial-to-femoral artery bypass systemcomprising a transseptal cannula, arterial cannulae, and a centrifugal bloodpump. The pump can deliver flow rates up to 4.0 L/min at a maximum speed of 7500 rpm. From May 2003 through May 2005, the TandemHeart was used to support 18patients (11 in cardiogenic shock and 7 undergoing high-risk percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty). The patients in cardiogenic shock weresupported for a mean of 88.8 +/- 74.3 hours (range, 4-264 hr) at a mean pump flowrate of 2.87 +/- 0.56 L/min (range, 1.8-3.5 L/min). The mean cardiac indeximproved from 1.57 +/- 0.31 L/min/m2 before support to 2.60 +/- 0.34 L/min/m2during support. The mean duration of support for the high-risk percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty patients was 5.5 +/- 8.3 hours (range, 1-24hr). The mean flow rate was 2.42 +/- 0.55 L/min (range, 1.5-3.0 L/ min). Theoverall 30-day survival rate was 61%. In our experience, the TandemHeart devicewas easy to insert and provided a means either to cardiac recovery or tocontinued support with an implantable left ventricular assist device.PMCID: PMC1524679
