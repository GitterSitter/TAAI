We report a case of severe nonspecificallograft dysfunction that was ultimately reversible after 18 days ofbiventricular mechanical circulatory support. Allograft recovery wasechocardiographically recognized by a positive inotropic response toisoproterenol and milrinone. This case illustrates the potential for recovery of even extreme allograft dysfunction.
