The improvement of these devices would benefit many patients,especially those refractory to maximal pharmacological treatment and ineligiblefor heart transplantation. This study examined whether the shape memory alloy(SMA) fibers, which are fibers that contract when electric current flows through them and relax passively when that flow is interrupted, can be wrapped around thefailing heart and assist in its pumping action. A band of SMA fibers was wrapped around a silicon cylindrical chamber which simulated a dilated heart and itspumping action was tested in a circulatory mockup. This rudimentary device wasinnovatively controlled by pulse width modulation. The band was made of only six fibers but yet produced the considerable pressure of 20 mm Hg and a stroke volumeof 11.8 ml with modest energy demands. A SMA device could assist a severelyfailing heart, but there are limiting factors to overcome before designing highlyeffective devices.
