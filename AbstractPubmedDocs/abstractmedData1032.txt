The objective of this study is to review the 5-year experience ofbridging patients to heart transplantation with this device in a single center.Surgical aspects, including hybrid pump pocket, double tunneling of driveline,and optimal cannulae placement, are discussed.METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 24 patients treated between January2002 and December 2007. Nineteen patients (79.1%) received a single implantableventricular assist device as left ventricular assist devices, and 5 patients(21.9%) received 2 implantable ventricular assist devices as biventricular assistdevices. The devices were implanted in pre-peritoneal/posterior rectus hybridpump pockets. The driveline was passed through a 2-stage double-tunnel to exitonto the lateral chest wall. Patients were anticoagulated with Warfarin aimingfor an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0.RESULTS: Twenty male and 4 female patients with a mean age of 39.8 years (17-57years) and a body surface area of 1.87 m(2) (1.63-2.2 m(2)) were supported for a total of 2308 patient-days. Mean duration of support was 96 days (10-301 days).The cause of heart failure was dilated cardiomyopathy in 18 patients and ischemiccardiomyopathy in 6 patients. Preoperatively, 23 patients were receivinginotropes, 12 patients required intra-aortic balloon pump support, 5 patientswere intubated and mechanically ventilated, and 3 patients required continuousvenovenous hemofiltration for renal support. Eleven patients (45.8%) weredischarged with ventricular assist device support (1015 home patient-days).Complications observed were a) neurologic: stroke in 3 patients, transientischemic attacks in 4 patients; and b) infection: driveline infection in 3patients and pump pocket infection in 1 patient. There was no mechanical devicefailure. Support to transplantation was achieved in 17 patients (70.8%): 3 of 5biventricular assist devices (60%) and 14 of 19 left ventricular assist devices(73.7%).CONCLUSION: The Thoratec IVAD is a versatile and reliable ventricular assistdevice. It can provide univentricular or biventricular support for bridgingpatients to heart transplantation with acceptable complication rates. Theportable Thoratec TLC-II console facilitated discharge while patients waited for a suitable donor heart.Crown Copyright 2010. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.
