Heart Fail Clin. 2007 Jul;3(3):369-75.Lifetime circulatory support must not be restricted to transplant centers.Westaby S(1).Author information: (1)Oxford Heart Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. swestaby@AHF.org.uk <swestaby@AHF.org.uk>Heart failure that does not respond to maximum medical management is afrightening and debilitating condition. The patients have poor quality of lifeand become progressively more dependent on hospital admissions for escalatingmedical therapy. Long-term circulatory support can provide symptomatic relief andimproved survival for those who do not have access to cardiac transplantation.User-friendly blood pumps with proven durability already exist. Rotary bloodpumps must be made available in centers other than those involved intransplantation. The mystique must be removed from this relatively simpleintervention.
