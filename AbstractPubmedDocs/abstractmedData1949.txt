The Thermo Cardiosystems HeartMate 1000 IP left ventricularassist device (LVAD) employs a design that may reduce thromboembolic risk andobviate the need for systemic anticoagulation.METHODS: Two hundred twenty-three patients with nonreversible heart failure were supported with the HeartMate LVAD as a bridge to heart transplantation. Allpatients were monitored prospectively for thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation regimens and occurrence of subclinical thromboembolic events, including thoseseen by transcranial Doppler examinations in selected patients, were alsorecorded.RESULTS: Total time of LVAD support use was 531.2 patient-months. Twenty-threepatients (10%) received warfarin postoperatively for 42.4 patient-months (8.2% oftotal support time). Six patients (2.7%) had thromboembolic events, representing 0.011 events per patient-month of device use.CONCLUSIONS: The thromboembolic complication rate associated with this LVAD isacceptably low despite the minimal anticoagulation employed in this series,allowing consideration of long-term device use for the treatment of heartfailure.
