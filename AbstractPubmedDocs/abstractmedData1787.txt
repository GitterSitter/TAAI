Clin Transpl. 1999:239-48.Cardiac transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.Hoercher K(1), McCarthy P, Young JB.Author information: (1)Kaufman Center for Heart Failure, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio, USA.The past 15 years has seen a significant evolution of heart transplant patientselection criteria, definition of suitable donors, immunosuppressive strategies, infection prophylaxis and treatment, and post-transplant patient surveillance.Primarily important has been broadening of the donor suitability definition andan evolution toward transplanting more ill and hemodynamically unstable patients.Despite "pushing the envelope" with both patient and donor selection and withtransplanted patients generally being more ill, we believe our outcomes at theCleveland Clinic Foundation are exemplary. The one- and 3-year survival rates for265 heart transplants performed during 1996-1998 were 88% and 81%, respectively. Key to the success of our program has been close interdisciplinary workingrelationships and respect, broad and expert consultative support services, adesire to investigate clinical challenges, and dedication to excellence. Ofadditional importance is the realization that no matter how difficult we believe our difficulties are, we realize that those of our patients are vastly greater.
