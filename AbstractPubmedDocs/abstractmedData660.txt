Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted CirculatorySupport (INTERMACS) profiles describe patient condition at pre-implant andoutcome. This study assessed the relationship among inflammation patterns andINTERMACS profiles in LVAD recipients.METHOD: Thirty ESHF patients undergoing LVAD implantation as bridge to transplantwere enrolled. Blood and urine samples were collected pre-operatively andserially up to 2 weeks post-operatively for assessment of inflammatory markers(plasma levels of interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-10, and osteopontin, a cardiacinflammatory-remodeling marker; and the urine neopterin/creatinine ratio, amonocyte activation marker). Multiorgan function was evaluated by the totalsequential organ failure assessment (tSOFA) score. Outcomes of interest wereearly survival, post-LVAD tSOFA score, and intensive care unit (ICU) length ofstay.RESULTS: Fifteen patients had INTERMACS profiles 1 or 2 (Group A), and 15 hadprofiles 3 or 4 (Group B). At pre-implant, only IL-6 levels and the IL-6/IL-10ratio were higher in Group A vs B. After LVAD implantation, neopterin/creatinine ratio and IL-8 levels increased more in Group A vs B. Osteopontin levelsincreased significantly only in Group B. The tSOFA score at 2 weeks post-LVAD andICU duration were related with pre-implant IL-6 levels.CONCLUSIONS: The INTERMACS profiles reflect the severity of the pre-operativeinflammatory activation and the post-implant inflammatory response, affectingpost-operative tSOFA score and ICU stay. Therefore, inflammation may contributeto poor outcome in patients with severe INTERMACS profile.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
