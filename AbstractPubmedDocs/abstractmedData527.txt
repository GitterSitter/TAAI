Electronic address: jbkim1975@amc.seoul.kr.OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a widely accepted modality forthe treatment of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) after majorcardiac surgery by providing temporary circulatory support for the stunnedmyocardium. We sought to identify the factors that affect outcomes of ECLS forpostoperative LCOS.METHODS: From 2005 to 2011, of a total of 9267 adult patients underwent majorcardiac surgery, 93 patients (aged, 60.6 ± 13.8 years; 47 women) underwent ECLSto treat postoperative LCOS.RESULTS: Thirty-nine (41.9%) patients were weaned off ECLS successfully, and 1patient underwent heart transplantation. A final total of 23 patients (24.3%),including 1 heart transplantation recipient, survived until the end of thefollow-up period (median, 611 days; range, 125-2247 days). On logistic regressionanalysis, old age (P = .001), a high blood lactate level before ECLS initiation(P < .001), cardiopulmonary bypass weaning failure after surgery (P < .001), and postoperative bleeding (P = .012) were independent factors associated withmortality. In contrast, administration of anticoagulant nafamostat mesilate(P = .040) was found to be associated with improved outcomes of ECLS. When thepredictive value of pre-ECLS blood lactate level for mortality was assessed usingthe receiver operating characteristic curve, the greatest accuracy was obtainedat the cutoff value of 7.9 mmol/L, with 63% sensitivity and 68% specificity.CONCLUSIONS: High lactate level before ECLS is an independent predictor ofmortality after ECLS, necessitating earlier ECLS implementations before profound lactic acidosis develops. Moreover, nafamostat mesilate should be considered asalternative to heparin to reduce the risk of bleeding in these high-riskpatients.Crown Copyright © 2014. Published by Mosby, Inc.
