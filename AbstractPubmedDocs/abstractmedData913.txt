E3221, P.O. Box 843015,Richmond, VA 23284, USA. althrock@vcu.eduCurrently available mechanical circulatory support systems are limited foradolescent and adult patients with a Fontan physiology. To address this growingneed, we are developing a collapsible, percutaneously-inserted, axial flow blood pump to support the cavopulmonary circulation in Fontan patients. During thefirst phase of development, the design and experimental evaluation of an axialflow blood pump was performed. We completed numerical modeling of the pump using computational fluid dynamics analysis, hydraulic testing of a plastic pumpprototype, and blood bag experiments (n=7) to measure the levels of hemolysisproduced by the pump. Statistical analyses using regression were performed. Theprototype with a 4-bladed impeller generated a pressure rise of 2-30 mmHg with a flow rate of 0.5-4 L/min for 3000-6000 RPM. A comparison of the experimentalperformance data to the numerical predictions demonstrated an excellent agreementwith a maximum deviation being less than 6%. A linear increase in the plasma-freehemoglobin (pfHb) levels during the 6-h experiments was found, as desired. Themaximum pfHb level was measured to be 21 mg/dL, and the average normalized index of hemolysis was determined to be 0.0097 g/100 L for all experiments. Thehydraulic performance of the prototype and level of hemolysis are indicative ofsignificant progress in the design of this blood pump. These results support the continued development of this intravascular pump as a bridge-to-transplant,bridge-to-recovery, bridge-to-hemodynamic stability, or bridge-to-surgicalreconstruction for Fontan patients.
