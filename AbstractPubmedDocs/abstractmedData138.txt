Baselinecharacteristics associated with increased infection risk included chronic lungdisease (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 2.26),heart failure (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.95), and longer surgery (HR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.21 to 1.41). Practices associated with reduced infection risk includedprophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52 to0.94), whereas post-operative antibiotic duration >48 h (HR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.28to 2.88), stress hyperglycemia (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.73); intubation time of 24 to 48 h (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.14); and ventilation >48 h (HR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.66 to 3.63) were associated with increased risk. HRs for infection weresimilar with either <24 h or <48 h of antibiotic prophylaxis. There was asignificant but differential effect of transfusion by surgery type (excludingleft ventricular assist device procedures/transplant) (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.20). Major infections substantially increased mortality (HR: 10.02; 95% CI:6.12 to 16.39).CONCLUSIONS: Major infections dramatically affect survival and readmissions.Second-generation cephalosporins were strongly associated with reduced majorinfection risk, but optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis requires furtherstudy. Given practice variations, considerable opportunities exist for improving outcomes and preventing readmissions.
