Little is known about the psychological adjustment and quality oflife of these patients and how patients with a VAD in situ compare with those whounderwent transplantation or had the device explanted.DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using grounded theory methodology wascarried out. Patients with heart failure living with a VAD and those whounderwent transplantation or explantation were interviewed to elicit perceptions of their adjustment and quality of life.RESULTS: All patients identified perceived control as their core category, with 3related conceptual categories: normality, uncertainty, and emotional state.Identity of illness/VAD and the impact of the device were specifically identifiedby VAD patients, and independence was identified by transplant patients.CONCLUSION: This study has identified previously unrecognized concepts in theadjustment of patients with either a VAD in situ or who have had the deviceexplanted or have undergone transplantation. It provides a basis for thedevelopment of specific nursing and psychological care designed to support thisdeveloping surgical practice.
