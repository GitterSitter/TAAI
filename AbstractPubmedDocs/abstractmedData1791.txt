In this study of 135 LVAD patients (64 pneumaticHeartMate; 39 vented-electric HeartMate; 32 Novacor devices), 72 (53%) hadprevious heart surgery. For patients with previous coronary artery bypass, thegrafts were managed by replacement or preservation. For patients with ventricularaneursym (or aneursmysectomy), or partical left ventriculectomy, apicalcannulation had to be modified to maintain precise unobstructed orientation ofthe inflow cannula towards the mitral valve. Mechanical mitral and aorticprostheses were rereplaced with tissue valves. Implantable cardioverterdefibrillators were removed, or the LVAD pump was placed intraperitoneal and the generator was left in the abdominal wall pocket. There were no significantdifferences in reoperations for bleeding (22% primary vs 23% reoperations),perioperative RVAD support (12% primary vs 7% reoperation) or survival totransplant (82% primary vs 72% reoperations). In conclusion adjustment ofstandard LVAD implant technique can successfully manage most problems posed bypatients with previous heart surgery.
