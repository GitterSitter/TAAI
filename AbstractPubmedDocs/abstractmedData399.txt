This support serves as a bridge to recovery,decision-making, heart transplantation or ventricular-assist device implantation.It can be implanted either through a percutaneous approach using Seldinger'stechnique or via an open approach via the common femoral artery or the axillaryartery. Early and late arterial vascular complications remain an important issue,with rates of up to 28% with femoral and axillary cannulation sites. Among them, limb ischemia requires prompt diagnosis and management to avoid limb amputation. In the case of peripheral artery cannulation, ipsilateral distal limb perfusionto prevent acute limb ischemia can be performed via a single lumen catheterthrough the artery or via the 'chimney graft' technique during extracorporealmembrane oxygenation implantation.
