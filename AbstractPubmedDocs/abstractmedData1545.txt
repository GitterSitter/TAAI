Cardiaccontractility modulation (CCM) by means of nonexcitatory electrical currentsdelivered during the action potential plateau has been shown to acutely enhancesystolic function in humans with HF. The aim of this multicenter study was toassess the chronic safety and preliminary efficacy of an implantable devicedelivering this novel form of electrical therapy.METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen patients with drug-resistant HF (New York HeartAssociation [NYHA] class III) were consecutively implanted with a device(OPTIMIZER II) delivering CCM biphasic square-wave pulses (20 ms, 5.8-7.7 V, 30ms after detection of local activation) through two right ventricular leadsscrewed into the right aspect of the interventricular septum. CCM signals weredelivered 3 hours daily over 8 weeks (3-hour phase) and 7 hours daily over thenext 24 weeks (7-hour phase). Safety and feasibility of this novel therapy wereregarded as primary endpoints. Preliminary clinical efficacy, -as expressed bychanges in ejection fraction (EF), NYHA class, 6-minute walking test (6-MWT),peak O(2) uptake (peak VO(2)), and Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire(MLWHFQ), was assessed at baseline and at the end of each phase. At the end offollow-up (8.8 +/- 0.2 months), all patients were alive, without hearttransplantation or need for left ventricular assist device. Serial 24-hour Holteranalysis revealed no proarrhythmic effect. No devices malfunctioned or failed forany reason other than end-of-battery life. Throughout the two study phases, EFimproved from 22.7 +/- 7% to 28.7 +/- 7% and 37 +/- 13% (P = 0.004), 6-MWT from418 +/- 99 m to 477 +/- 96 m and 510 +/- 107 m (P = 0.002), MLWHFQ from 36 +/- 21to 18 +/- 12 and 7 +/- 6 (P = 0.002), peak VO(2) from 13.7 +/- 1.1 to 14.9 +/-1.9 to 16.2 +/- 2.4 (P = 0.037), and NYHA class from 3 to 1.8 +/- 0.4 to 1.5 +/- 0.7 (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: CCM therapy appears to be safe and feasible. Proarrhythmic effects ofthis novel therapy seem unlikely. Preliminary data indicate that CCM graduallyand significantly improves systolic performance, symptoms, and functional status.CCM therapy for 7 hours per day is associated with greater dispersion near themean, emphasizing the need to individually tailor CCM delivery duration. Thetechnique appears to be attractive as an additive treatment for severe HF.Controlled randomized studies are needed to validate this novel concept.
