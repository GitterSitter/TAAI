This study evaluates our clinicalexperience using the CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, Mass) system fortemporary mechanical RV support.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 29 patients (mean age, 57 +/- 14years) in whom the CentriMag system was used for RV support from September 2005to March 2008.RESULTS: The indication for RV support was PCCS in 7 (24%), CTx in 10 (35%), and LVAD placement in 12 (41%). The mean support time was 8 +/- 8 days. The devicewas successfully weaned in 3 PCCS patients (43%), 7 CTx patients (70%), and 7LVAD patients (58%). Complications included major infection (pneumonia, sepsis,or LVAD pocket infection) in 13 (45%), arrhythmia in 13 (45%), reoperation forbleeding in 10 (35%), stroke/encephalopathy in 3 (10%), and air embolism in 1(3%). Early mortality (< 30 days or before discharge) occurred in 14 patients(48%) of which 9 (31%) died with the device in place. Late death occurred in 2 of15 patients (13%) who survived to discharge. There were no device failures.CONCLUSIONS: The CentriMag system provides effective temporary mechanicalcirculatory support for RV failure. Ease of implantation and a high rate ofsuccessful device weaning justify the use of the CentriMag system for temporaryRV support.
