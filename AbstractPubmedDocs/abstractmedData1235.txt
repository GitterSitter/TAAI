Levels ofNT-proBNP were analyzed before and 7 and 30 days after device implantation. Inaddition, we determined levels of mid-region proANP (MR-proANP) and BNP in 13 of the 19 children.RESULTS: The actuarial survival rate to discharge home was 84%. Two childrencould be weaned from the system, 14 reached heart transplantation, and 3 diedduring mechanical circulatory support. Serial measurements of NT-proBNP, BNP and MR-proANP showed a significant down-regulation of all three natriuretic peptides within the first week of support and a further decrease between Days 7 and 30.The lowest NT-proBNP level while on the device (250 pg/ml) was found in the childlater weaned, who reached normal levels (71 pg/ml) within 12 weeks after weaning.CONCLUSIONS: Extremely high levels of natriuretic peptides reflect the severityof myocardial failure before device implantation. During mechanical support, the decline of natriuretic peptides appears to be a helpful additional tool in thepre-selection of potential weaning candidates.
