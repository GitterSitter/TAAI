With improvements in medical therapy, the emergence of primarypercutaneous coronary intervention, and an increasingly ageing population,patients with right, left or biventricular failure, who are not suitable forcardiac transplantation or long-term ventricular assist device therapy, presentfor cardiac surgery. The modern cardiac surgeon needs to have a safe strategy fordealing with these complex cases. We report two cases that illustrate simple and safe cannulation techniques for temporary left and right ventricular failure.
