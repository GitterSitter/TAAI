The success of thepulsatile 70 cc stroke volume left ventricular assist device (LVAD) developed by Penn State has led to the development of a 50 cc stroke volume pump for use inpatients with smaller chest cavities to benefit a larger patient population. The initial 50 cc pump shows regions of in vivo thrombus formation, which correlateto low wall shear rates within the device. In an in vitro evaluation of three newdesigns (V-2, V-3, and V-4) of the 50 cc LVAD, identical except for the location and orientation of their outlet ports, particle image velocimetry (PIV) is usedto capture planar flow field data within the pumps. V-2 has an outlet port thatis located parallel to the inlet. In V-3, the outlet port is rotated away fromthe inlet port, with the intention of minimizing the amount of fluid turningneeded to exit the device. With V-4 the outlet port is moved to the center of thepump to prolong the desirable rotational flow. PIV data were taken at six planar locations within the pump. Although the modifications to the outlet portlocations serve their intended purpose, they also introduce unwanted changes inthe flow. Poorer wall washing and weaker rotational flow are observed with V-3and V-4. Although the differences between the devices are subtle, the device thathas the most desirable flow characteristics is V-2.PMCID: PMC3163059
