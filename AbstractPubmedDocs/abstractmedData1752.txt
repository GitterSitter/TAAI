It has been successfully used for the past 16 years as a bridge tocardiac transplantation in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure. The Stanford experience represents 53 patients (48 male, 5 female) with a mean age of44 +/- 13 years (16 to 62) and a mean support time of 56 +/- 76 days (1 to 374). Complications with LVAS use consisted predominantly of bleeding (43%), infection,(30%), and embolic cerebrovascular events (24.5%). Sixty-six percent of thesupported patients were successfully bridged to cardiac transplantation. Inanimal studies, 4 sheep had the totally implantable configuration in place for a cumulative duration of 1 year with 1 animal supported for 260 days. The nextgeneration Novacor LVAS will be small, quiet, and fully implantable without theneed for volume compensation. It will also provide physiologic pulsatile flow andwill be fail-safe.
