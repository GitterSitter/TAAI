Our objective was to compare the clinicalsignificance of changes in RV echocardiographic indices in response to intensive medical treatment in patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensatedheart failure (ADHF).METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial comprehensive echocardiography was performed in 62consecutive patients with ADHF, and adverse events (death, cardiactransplantation, assist device, heart failure rehospitalization) wereprospectively documented. RV peak systolic strain was assessed usingspeckle-tracking longitudinal strain analysis as the average of the basal, mid-, and apical segment of the RV free wall. Other conventional parameters of RVfunction (RV fractional area change, RV myocardial performance index, tricuspidannular peak systolic excursion, and tissue Doppler peak tricuspid annularsystolic velocity) were measured for comparison. In our study cohort [leftventricular ejection fraction, 26+/-10%; cardiac index, 2.0+/-0.6 L/(min .m(2))], overall mean RV peak systolic strain was -14+/-4% at baseline and-15+/-4% at 48 to 72 hours (P=0.27). Among all the RV functional indicesmeasured, only RV peak systolic strain at 48 to 72 hours was associated withadverse events (P=0.02). In particular, improvement in RV peak systolic strainafter intensive medical treatment was associated with lower adverse events inthis patient population (26% versus 78%; hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02 to0.84; P=0.02).CONCLUSION: Dynamic improvement in RV mechanics in response to intensive medical therapy was associated with lower long-term adverse events in patients with ADHF than in patients not showing improvement.PMCID: PMC3060051
