Prior studies haveexamined hospital costs for LVAD implants performed during investigationalstudies (e.g., REMATCH), but none has been published since that trial wascompleted.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 23 consecutive patients who hada HeartMate XVE pump implanted as destination therapy at 2 high-volumeventricular assist device implant centers after US Food and Drug Administrationapproval in October 2003. We evaluated survival to discharge during theimplantation hospitalization, hospital length of stay, and hospital costs, andcompared them with outcomes reported from the REMATCH (RM) trial.RESULTS: All patients in this cohort implanted post-REMATCH (PRM) had class IVheart failure and were similar in age, gender, and nearly all otherpre-implantation clinical measures to the RM subjects. Mean hospital costs forPRM patients were 40% lower than for RM patients when measured from implantation to discharge (dollar 128,084 vs dollar 210,187, p < 0.01). PRM patients whosurvived implantation hospitalization had 48% lower costs than those who did not survive (dollar 114,979 vs dollar 215,456, p < 0.01), a finding similar to the RMexperience. PRM patients in this cohort were more likely to survive to discharge compared with RM patients (87.0% vs 67.3%, p = 0.09). Mean hospital length ofstay was 25% lower in the PRM group (44 vs 33 days) but did not reach statisticalsignificance (p = 0.50).CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes with use of LVADs as destination therapy have improved inthe post-REMATCH era, including significantly lower hospital costs as well asstrong trends toward better survival to hospital discharge and shorter averagelength of stay.
