Here, we present a case of a patient with hemolytic anemia after continuous-flow left ventricular assistdevice (CF-LVAD) implantation that was successfully treated with pentoxifylline. Our case is a 64-year-old African American woman who was implanted with aHeartMate II device on August 6, 2010, as a bridge to transplant for end-stageheart failure. Her postoperative course was complicated by recurrentgastrointestinal bleeding and antiplatelet therapy was discontinued. On October25, 2011, she was readmitted with anemia and hemoglobin of 6.6 mg/dl and noidentifiable source of bleeding. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 936 IU/L,indicating severe hemolysis. Due to her evidence of hemolytic anemia and herinability to tolerate antiplatelet therapy due to recurrent bleeding, she wasdischarged on pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily on October 27, 2011, withhemoglobin of 11.2 mg/dl after transfusion. After 60 days of pentoxifylline, her hemoglobin and LDH in clinic were 10.1 mg/dl and 223 IU/L, respectively. Thepatient was successfully bridged to transplant in June 2012. Additional analysis of pentoxifylline as a therapeutic modality to manage hemolytic anemia afterCF-LVAD implantation may be warranted.
