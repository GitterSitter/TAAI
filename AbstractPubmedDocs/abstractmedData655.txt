We reviewedour experience with the management of patients on continuous flow (CF) LVADsupport undergoing NCS.METHODS: From March 2006 through March 2011, 86 patients with chronic heartfailure underwent implantation of a HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD. Clinical records of these patients were reviewed to identify patients whounderwent NCS while on LVAD support, with a focus on peri-operative death,bleeding, thrombosis, and device malfunction, as well as management ofpre-operative anti-coagulation.RESULTS: While on CF-LVAD support, 20 patients underwent 25 NCSs, comprising 13major and 12 minor procedures. Operations were performed electively in 22 and as emergencies in 3. No peri-operative deaths, thromboembolic complications, ordevice malfunctions occurred. The incidence of bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells was 36.0%, including 25% of patients undergoing minor NCSsand 46.2% undergoing major NCSs (p = 0.004). All bleeding complications occurred in patients on both warfarin and aspirin pre-operatively. The only significantdifferences between patients who did and did not require transfusion werepre-operative warfarin use and significantly higher pre-operative internationalnormalized ratio in the transfused group (1.9 ± 0.4 vs 1.4 ± 0.3; p = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Non-cardiac operations can be performed safely in patients withCF-LVADs. It may possible to reduce peri-operative bleeding by loweringpre-operative anti-coagulation goals, especially before major surgery. However,additional analysis is required to determine if this can be performed safely.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
