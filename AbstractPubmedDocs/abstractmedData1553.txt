One only has to look at the role of cardiac transplantation to realize the benefit of a naturaltherapy to end-stage heart disease. Although the technology today is not thatdifferent from the technology that existed a decade ago (ie, BioMedicus, BVS5000, Thoratec, CardioWest), the application of it and the experience gained byit have allowed surgeons to improve the chances of a positive outcome. In termsof new technologies for biventricular mechanical support, the totally implantableversions of a VAD (eg, Thoratec IVAD) or the totally implantable TAH (eg,AbioCor) are promising technologies that add to the spectrum of devices asdestination therapy or alternatives to transplantation. And lastly, the role ofthe Berlin Heart as a tool for the management of biventricular failure inpediatric patients may be realized in the United States in the near future. Inconclusion, the treatment of biventricular failure (acute or chronic) with assistor replacement technologies has gained widespread acceptance in the medical andsurgical communities. It is now time to use these technologies wisely in aneffort to treat the worldwide epidemic of congestive heart failure.
