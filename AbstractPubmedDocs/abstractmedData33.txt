Data were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Weinterviewed 17 caregivers: 10 caregivers of patients living with DT LVAD, 6caregivers of patients who had died with DT LVAD, and 1 caregiver of a patientwho had declined DT LVAD. The themes identified, which could also be considereddialectical tensions, are broadly interpreted under 3 domains mapping to decisioncontext, process, and outcome: (1) the stark decision context, with tensionbetween hope and reality; (2) the challenging decision process, with tensionbetween wanting loved ones to live and wanting to respect loved ones' wishes; and(3) the downstream decision outcome, with tension between gratitude and burden.CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making surrounding DT LVAD should incorporate decisionsupport for patients and caregivers. This should include a focus on caregiverburden and the predictable tensions that caregivers experience.Â© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.PMCID: PMC4365422 [Available on 2016-03-10]
