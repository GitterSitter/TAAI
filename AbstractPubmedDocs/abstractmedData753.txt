Heart Fail Rev. 2012 May;17(3):511-27. doi: 10.1007/s10741-011-9272-0.Right side of heart failure.Guglin M(1), Verma S.Author information: (1)University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA. mguglin@gmail.comThe function of the right ventricle (RV) in heart failure (HF) has been mostlyignored until recently. A 2006 report of the National Heart, Lung, and BloodInstitute identified a gap between RV research efforts and its clinicalimportance compared with that of the left ventricle. This recent shift inparadigm is fueled by the prognostic value ascribed to RV failure in HF andmorbidity/mortality after myocardial infarction and surgery. In this review, weexamine the significance of RV failure in the HF setting, its clinicalpresentation and pathophysiology, and ways to evaluate RV function usingechocardiographic measurements. Furthermore, we discuss the medical management ofRV failure including traditional therapies like beta-blockers and newer optionslike nitric oxide, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and calcium sensitizers.Mechanical support is also examined. Finally, this review places an emphasis onRV failure in the setting of left ventricular assist devices and hearttransplantation.
