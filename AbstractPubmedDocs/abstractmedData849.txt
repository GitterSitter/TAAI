We evaluated a new miniaturized leftventricular assist device that requires minimal surgery for implantation,potentially allowing implantation in earlier stage heart failure.METHODS: HeartWare (Miami Lakes, Fla) developed transapical miniaturizedventricular assist device. Acute (n = 4), 1-week (n = 2), and 30-day (n = 4)bovine model experiments evaluated hemodynamic efficacy and biocompatibility ofthe device, which was implanted through small left thoracotomy with singleinsertion at apex of left ventricle without cardiopulmonary bypass. The deviceoutflow cannula was positioned across the aortic valve. The internationalnormalized ratio was maintained between 2.0 and 2.5 with warfarin. Hemodynamic,echocardiographic, fluoroscopic, hematologic, and blood chemistry measurementswere evaluated.RESULTS: The device was successfully implanted through the left ventricular apex in all 10 animals. The device was operated at 15,000 ± 1000 rpm (powerconsumption, 3.5-6.0 W). The device maintained normal end-organ perfusion with nosignificant hemolysis (0-30 mg/dL). There were no pump failures or device-relatedcomplications. At autopsy, no abnormalities were seen in endocardium, aorticvalve leaflets, or aortic root. There was no evidence of thromboembolism orabnormalities in any peripheral end organs.CONCLUSIONS: We successfully demonstrated feasibility of a novel intraventricularassist device that can be completely implanted through left ventricular apex.This transapical surgical approach eliminates needs for sternotomy, devicepocket, cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular coring, and construction of anoutflow graft anastomosis.Copyright © 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
