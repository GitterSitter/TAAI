Adult, outpatient LVAD recipients(n = 11) participated twice in individual or paired interviews.RESULTS: A conceptual definition of QoL while living with an LVAD was establishedas: "Being well enough to do and enjoy day-to-day activities that are importantto me." Participants described 5 important life domains consistent with QoLliterature: physical, emotional, social, cognitive, and spiritual/meaning.However, participants identified unique concerns not addressed by generic orheart failure disease specific measures typically used in the LVAD population.CONCLUSION: Existing generic and heart-failure specific QoL measures are notadequate for understanding QoL among LVAD patients. Cognition andspiritual/meaning domains were significant; these need inclusion forcomprehensive QoL assessment in the LVAD population.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
