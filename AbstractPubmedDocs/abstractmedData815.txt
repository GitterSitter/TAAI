The aim of this study was to report our experience of theuse of VADs in patients with prosthetic mitral valves.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 747 VAD patients from January 1995 to May2010 was performed.RESULTS: Thirteen patients with a prosthetic mitral valve (average age 56 ± 10years of age, nine mechanical valve, four biological valve) were identified.Indications for VAD implantation were as a bridge to transplant in 11 patientsand destination therapy in two patients. At the time of VAD implant, nointervention to the prosthetic mitral valve was performed. Eight patientsreceived a HeartMate I (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA), threepatients received a HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation), and two patientsreceived a Thoratec VAD (Thoratec Corporation). Among nine mechanical valvepatients, six patients were anticoagulated with warfarin, and one patient withheparin, while two patients did not receive anticoagulation due to bleeding. Ten patients were successfully transplanted at an average of 123 days post-VADimplant, one died after 48 days from multiorgan failure, and two remained on VAD support. No clinical thromboembolic events were observed. No intracardiacthrombus was detected by echocardiogram or on the pathology of the explantedhearts. Five patients had experienced a bleeding event (postoperative mediastinalbleeds, gastrointestinal bleedings, retroperitoneal hematoma, and subconjuctival bleeding).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mitral valve prostheses who require VAD support,leaving the prosthesis intact does not increase the incidence of adverse events. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
