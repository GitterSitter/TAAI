Technical developments incardiac support systems, the variation in results depending on the indication,and the findings with respect to quality of life are all discussed on the basisof a selective review of the literature and the authors' own clinical experience.RESULTS: The waiting list for heart transplantation in Germany has grown to arecord size of nearly 800 patients, while fewer than 400 hearts are transplanted each year. Technical advances have improved outcomes in VAD therapy, but theoutcome depends on the patient's preoperative condition. The physical performanceof patients who have received VAD is comparable to that of HTx patients;nonetheless, HTx patients have a better quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic VAD therapy has become a clinical reality. Because of thegreater number of patients awaiting HTx, many will not receive their transplants in time. When the decision to treat with VAD is made early, it can be used as an alternative form of treatment with a comparable one-year survival (>75%).PMCID: PMC2735711
