The aim of thisprospective, multicenter clinical trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of a third-generation LVAD, the VentrAssist, in a BTT cohort.METHODS: Patients (n = 33) with end-stage chronic heart failure who requiredcirculatory support as BTT therapy were implanted with a VentrAssist device. The primary outcome was survival until transplant or transplant eligibility with the device in situ at trial end-point (Day 154 after implant). The secondary outcomeswere pump flow index and end-organ function. Safety, patient functional statusand resource use were also assessed.RESULTS: At trial end-point, the success rate was 82% (39.4% transplanted, 42.4% transplant-eligible). The LVAD pump flow index (median >or=2.7 liters/min/m(2))was sufficient to maintain an adequate circulation and significantly improveend-organ function. Of the 77 protocol-defined serious adverse events, mostoccurred within 30 days of implantation. No patients died as a direct result ofpump failure or malfunction. After implantation, patient functional statusimproved, with 70% of patients achieving hospital discharge, and resource use wasreduced.CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety profile for use of the VentrAssist LVAD in BTT patients.
