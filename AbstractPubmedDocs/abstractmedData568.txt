We undertook this study to examine the incidence andimpact of repeat sternotomies on OHT outcomes.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all adult OHT from 2institutions. Primary stratification was by the number of prior sternotomies. Theprimary outcome was survival. Secondary outcomes included blood productutilization and commonly encountered postoperative complications. MultivariableCox proportional hazards regression models examined mortality while linearregression models examined blood utilization.RESULTS: From January 1995 to October 2011, 631 OHT were performed. Of these, 25 (4.0%) were redo OHT and 182 (28.8%) were bridged to transplant with aventricular assist device; 356 (56.4%) had undergone at least 1 prior sternotomy.On unadjusted analysis, reoperative sternotomy was associated with decreased90-day (98.5% vs 90.2%, p<0.001), 1-year (93.1% vs 79.6%, p<0.001), and 5-year(80.4% vs 70.1%, p=0.002) survival. This difference persisted on multivariableanalysis at 90 days (hazard ratio [HR] 2.99, p=0.01), 1 year (HR 2.98, p=0.002), and 5 years (HR 1.62, p=0.049). The impact of an increasing number of priorsternotomies was negligible. On multivariable analysis, an increasing number ofprior sternotomies was associated with increased intraoperative blood productutilization. Increasing blood utilization was associated with decreased 90-day,1-year, and 5-year survival.CONCLUSIONS: Reoperative sternotomy is associated with increased mortality andblood utilization after OHT. Patients with more than 1 prior sternotomy do notexperience additional increased mortality. Carefully selected patients withmultiple prior sternotomies have decreased but acceptable outcomes.Copyright Â© 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
