Herein we describe atotal of 254 commercial HVAD implants according to labeled indications betweenFebruary 2009 and November 2012. Summary statistics included patients'demographics, adverse events, length of support and outcomes.RESULTS: Compared with the clinical trial supporting the CE Mark of the HeartWaresystem, patient selection differed in that patients were older, and there werehigher proportions of females and patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathies inthe ReVOLVE cohort. Duration of support ranged from 1 to 1,057 days, with a mean of 363 ± 280 days (median 299.5 days). Transplantation was done in 56 patients(22%), explant for recovery was performed in 3 patients (1%), 43 died while onsupport (17%), and 152 (60%) remain on the device. Success in patients with theHeartWare system was 87% at 6 months, 85% at 1 year, 79% at 2 years and 73% at 3 years. Adverse event rates were low, comparable or improved when compared to the CE Mark Trial.CONCLUSION: Real-world use of the HeartWare system continues to demonstrateexcellent clinical outcomes in patients supported with the device.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
