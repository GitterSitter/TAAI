Whether left ventricular (LV) unloadingand outcome in these devices is similar to pulsatile LVADs during long-termsupport has not been investigated. We compared LV unloading and mortality betweendifferent types of LVAD support (pulsatile versus nonpulsatile).METHODS: In 31 patients undergoing long-term LVAD implantation (nonpulsatile =10, pulsatile = 21) preoperative and postoperative echocardiographic andhemodynamic assessment with right heart catheterization had been obtained.RESULTS: All patients had similar echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and clinicalheart failure characteristics at baseline. The degree of LV pressure unloadingwas the same in both device types, caused by similar reduction of mean pulmonary pressure (18.6 +/- 5.1 versus 18.3 +/- 7.5 mm Hg) and pulmonary capillary wedgepressure (8.9 +/- 4.4 versus 8.0 +/- 7.0 mm Hg). Left ventricular volumeunloading was pronounced with a pulsatile device owing to a statisticallysignificant higher pump output (5.1 +/- 1.0 L/min) in comparison withnonpulsatile LVADs (3.6 +/- 0.9 L/min, p < 0.001). Echocardiographic-determinedend-systolic indicators confirm this augmentation in pulsatile LVADs. Etiology orthe time interval of hemodynamic reassessment had no impact in left ventricularpressure unloading, but LV volume unloading decreased between day 60 and 120 inpatients with nonpulsatile LVADs. The preoperative and postoperative transplantmortality was comparable in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular pressure unloading is similar in patients withnonpulsatile as compared with pulsatile implantable long-term assist devices.Left ventricular volume unloading is pronounced in pulsatile LVADs.
