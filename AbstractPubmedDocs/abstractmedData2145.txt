Medical Centersis reviewed. Thirteen adult and one pediatric patients were supportedpostcardiotomy, 10 LVAD, 3 BIVAD, and 1 RVAD. There were no equipment failuresover a mean perfusion time of 52 hr (range 12-140 hr). Seven of thirteen adultpatients were supported and weaned from 6 LVAD and 1 BIVAD. Three patientsunderwent orthotopic heart transplantation, and the other four recoveredventricular function, of whom five are longterm survivors at a mean followup timeof 16 months. In one patient bridged to transplantation, a prior infection causedthe patient to succumb after successful transplantation. All patients assistedfor transplantation are carefully screened, and would be excluded fromtransplantation if they developed significant infection, or irreversible renal orneurologic limitations.
