Nonfailing leftventricular wall samples procured from explanted hearts of patients with rightheart failure served as novel comparison samples. Metabolomic analyses uncovered a distinct pattern in heart failure tissue: 2.6-fold increased pyruvateconcentrations coupled with reduced Krebs cycle intermediates and short-chainacylcarnitines, suggesting a global reduction in substrate oxidation. Thesefindings were associated with decreased transcript levels for enzymes thatcatalyze fatty acid oxidation and pyruvate metabolism and for key transcriptionalregulators of mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis, peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1A, 1.3-fold) andestrogen-related receptor α (ERRA, 1.2-fold) and γ (ERRG, 2.2-fold). Thus,parallel decreases in key transcription factors and their target metabolic enzymegenes can explain the decreases in associated metabolic intermediates. Mechanicalsupport with left ventricular assist device improved all of these metabolic andtranscriptional defects.CONCLUSIONS: These observations underscore an important pathophysiologic role forseverely defective metabolism in heart failure, while the reversibility of these defects by left ventricular assist device suggests metabolic resilience of thehuman heart.© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.PMCID: PMC4394989 [Available on 2015-06-01]
