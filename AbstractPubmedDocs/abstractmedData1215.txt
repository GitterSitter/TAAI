We collected data regarding duration of support and reasons for pump failure, perioperative characteristics, and operative approach.RESULTS: On average, patients were supported 473 +/- 233 days with HeartMate XVE pumps. Seven early patients required both subcostal and sternotomy incisions; 7later patients had subcostal incisions only. Thirteen patients underwentsuccessful exchange to the HeartMate II; 1 patient died in the operating room.Another patient died in the perioperative period (30-day mortality, 14% [2 of14]). There were significant differences between the two groups. The patients whorequired only subcostal incisions had shorter operative times (187 versus 220minutes; p = 0.04) and required fewer transfused blood products (packed red bloodcells, 8.6 versus 28.7 units; p = 0.03; and fresh-frozen plasma, 12.4 versus 30.9units; p = 0.04). Additionally, the patients with subcostal incisions had shorterpostoperative intensive care unit stays (5.3 +/- 1.1 versus 8.4 +/- 3.1 days for redo sternotomy patients; p = 0.03). Of the survivors, average hospital stay was 22 +/- 14 days. Average long-term follow-up was 11.2 +/- 7.8 months; 71% (10 of14) of patients are currently alive.CONCLUSIONS: Exchange of a HeartMate XVE to a HeartMate II can be accomplishedwith relatively low morbidity and mortality through a subcostal approach.
