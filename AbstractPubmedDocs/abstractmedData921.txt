Epub 2010 Aug 26.Application of the Seattle Heart Failure Model in ambulatory patients presentedto an advanced heart failure therapeutics committee.Gorodeski EZ(1), Chu EC, Chow CH, Levy WC, Hsich E, Starling RC.Author information: (1)Section of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant Medicine, Kaufman Center forHeart Failure, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.BACKGROUND: We sought to assess the predictive value of the Seattle Heart FailureModel (SHFM) when applied to ambulatory patients with advanced heart failure (HF)presented to an advanced HF therapeutics committee at a tertiary care USinstitution.METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated model discrimination and calibration in 215consecutive ambulatory patients who were presented to the Cleveland Clinicadvanced HF therapeutics committee between 2004 to 2007 for evaluation foradvanced options including transplantation and ventricular assist device (VAD).Analyses were stratified by committee decision (not listed versus listed UnitedNetwork of Organ Sharing [UNOS] Status 2). Eighty-five percent had 1 or nomissing SHFM variables. The primary outcome was a composite of all-causemortality, VAD, or urgent (UNOS Status 1) transplantation. During a medianfollow-up of 24 months, 68 died, 18 received VAD support, and 81 underwent heart transplantation. Discrimination was modest both for those not listed (c-index,0.683 at 1 year and 0.648 at 2 years), and for those listed UNOS status 2(c-index, 0.629 at 1 year and 0.628 at 2 years). Calibration was acceptable amongthose patients not listed for heart transplantation but with substantialunderestimation of risk (ie, overestimation of survival free of VAD or urgenttransplantation) among UNOS status 2 patients.CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory patients presented to an advanced HF therapeuticscommittee for evaluation for heart transplantation, the SHFM offers modestdiscrimination of risk for the primary composite outcome of mortality, VAD, orurgent transplantation, with underestimation of risk in those patients listed fornonurgent transplantation. Interpretation of risk prediction by the SHFM in this patient population must be done with caution.
