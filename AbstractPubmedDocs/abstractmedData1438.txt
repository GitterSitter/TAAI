We report our experience with PDT in patientsreceiving mechanical cardiac assistance.METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwentventricular assist device implantation at our institution between July 2000 andJuly 2003, and who subsequently required long-term ventilatory support during thesame hospital admission. Data obtained from the records included demographic and biometric information, primary diagnosis, early (< or =30days) and late (>30days)complications, date and cause of death, type of anti-coagulation used at the timeof tracheostomy, and various coagulation measures.RESULTS: Thirty-one consecutive patients (29 men, 2 women; mean age, 56 years)had PDT after ventricular assist device implantation. Four minor complicationsoccurred among 3 of the patients (10%), including 3 early complications (2peristomal oozing and 1 peristomal cellulitis) and 1 late complication (recurrentperistomal cellulitis), none of which affected long-term outcome. No majoradverse events, long-term complications, or deaths resulted from the PDTprocedure.CONCLUSIONS: PDT is feasible for patients with mechanical support devices whorequire long-term ventilatory support. Although some of these patients arecoagulopathic, our results indicate that PDT is safe and effective in thischallenging patient population.
