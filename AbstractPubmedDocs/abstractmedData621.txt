Circulation. 2012 Jun 26;125(25):3069-72.BACKGROUND: Contemporary ventricular assist device therapy results in a high rateof successful heart transplantation but is associated with bleeding, infections, and other complications. Further reductions in pump size, centrifugal design, andintrapericardial positioning may reduce complications and improve outcomes.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a small, intrapericardially positioned,continuous-flow centrifugal pump in patients requiring an implanted ventricularassist device as a bridge to heart transplantation. The course of investigationalpump recipients was compared with that of patients implanted contemporaneouslywith commercially available devices. The primary outcome, success, was defined assurvival on the originally implanted device, transplantation, or explantation forventricular recovery at 180 days and was evaluated for both noninferiority andsuperiority. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of survival between groups and functional and quality-of-life outcomes and adverse events in theinvestigational device group. A total of 140 patients received theinvestigational pump, and 499 patients received a commercially available pumpimplanted contemporaneously. Success occurred in 90.7% of investigational pumppatients and 90.1% of controls, establishing the noninferiority of theinvestigational pump (P<0.001; 15% noninferiority margin). At 6 months, median6-minute walk distance improved by 128.5 m, and both disease-specific and global quality-of-life scores improved significantly.CONCLUSIONS: A small, intrapericardially positioned, continuous-flow, centrifugalpump was noninferior to contemporaneously implanted, commercially availableventricular assist devices. Functional capacity and quality of life improvedmarkedly, and the adverse event profile was favorable.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Uniqueidentifier: NCT00751972.
