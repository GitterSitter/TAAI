Accepted indications include bridging to transplantation orrecovery. The present study reviewed the results following MCSS implantation atthe Montreal Heart Institute (Montreal, Quebec).METHODS: From September 1987 to September 2006, 43 MCSS were implanted (32Thoratec [Thoratec Corporation, USA], nine CardioWest TAH [SynCardia Systems Inc,USA], two Novacor [WorldHeart Corporation, Canada]) in 43 patients (mean [+/- SD]age 44+/-13 years; range 19 to 64 years). Indications for implantation includedcardiogenic shock due to ischemic (n=19), viral (n=10) or other types ofcardiomyopathies (n=14).RESULTS: The mean ejection fraction before implantation was 17.6+/-6.5% (range10% to 45%). Before MCSS implantation, most patients showed signs of end-organfailure, including mechanical ventilation (77%), central venous pressure higherthan 16 mmHg (44%), oliguria (35%) and hepatic dysfunction (19%). The meanduration of MCSS support was 22.8+/-32.8 days (range one to 158 days). Survivalto transplantation or recovery was 74%. Only one patient was successfully bridgedto recovery. Complications were common during MCSS support. They includedreexploration for bleeding (47%), respiratory failure (44%), renal failurerequiring temporary dialysis (40%), infection (33%) and neurological events(16%). Only one patient had device failure. In patients successfully bridged totransplantation, early actuarial survival (one month) following transplantationaveraged 71+/-8% and was 57+/-9% at one year.CONCLUSION: MCSS support with a left ventricular assist device or a totalartificial heart provides an effective means of bridging terminally ill patients to transplantation or recovery. Early survival after transplantation showssatisfactory results. However, these results come at the expense of frequentdevice-related complications, and device failure remains a constant threat.PMCID: PMC2691912
