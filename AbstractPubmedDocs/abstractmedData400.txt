Epub 2013Jul 6.Four-year paracorporeal left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support for heartfailure after Rastelli operation.Inoue T(1), Nishimura T, Murakami A, Kinoshita O, Kyo S, Ono M.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo,Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan, takainoue-tky@umin.ac.jp.It is well known that heart failure can occur after a conventional Rastellioperation (using an anatomical right ventricle as a systemic ventricle) inpatients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA).At present, heart transplantation (HTx) is the only definitive therapy known tosave such patients. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been employedfor patients presenting with acute deterioration of chronic heart failure as abridge to transplantation when early HTx is not feasible. LVAD implantation inpostoperative cases and/or in patients with dextrocardia is often difficultbecause of the complex anatomy. We report the case of a 26-year-old male patient with CCTGA who presented with heart failure after a conventional Rastellioperation and in whom paracorporeal LVAD implantation was undertaken for themanagement of right (systemic) ventricular failure. The patient recovered fromthe heart failure and remained on the HTx list for approximately 4Â years withLVAD support.
