However, stroke (a well-known LVAD complication) and subclinicalcerebral ischemia may result in transient or permanent cognitive decline. Wesought to describe the incidence and predictors of cognitive decline after LVADusing a valid, sensitive assessment tool.METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 4419 patients in the Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support who underwent LVAD implantation betweenMay 2012 and December 2013, cognitive function was assessed in 1173 patients withthe Trail Making B Test before LVAD and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The test detects several forms of cognitive impairment, including subclinical stroke. Cognitivedecline was defined as a clinically important increase during follow-up using amoderate Cohen d effect size of 0.5×baseline SD (32 s). The cumulative incidence of cognitive decline in the year after LVAD implantation, treating death andtransplantation as competing risks, was 29.2%. In adjusted analysis, older age(≥70 versus <50 years; hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.46-3.44;Ptrend<0.001) and destination therapy (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidenceinterval, 1.05-1.92) were significantly associated with greater risk of cognitivedecline.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline occurs commonly in patients in the year after LVADand is associated with older age and destination therapy. These results couldhave important implications for patient selection and improved communication ofrisks before LVAD implantation. Additional studies are needed to explore theassociation between cognitive decline and subsequent stroke, health status, andmortality in patients after LVAD.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.PMCID: PMC4418227 [Available on 2016-10-29]
