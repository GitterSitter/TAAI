Ann Thorac Surg. 1998 Nov;66(5):1829-30.Alternative technique of right-sided outflow cannula insertion for rightventricular support.Dewey TM(1), Chen JM, Spanier TB, Oz MC.Author information: (1)Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York,USA.Right ventricular assist devices are an important part of the armamentarium ofcardiac surgeons for the treatment of right-sided circulatory failure aftercardiac transplantation or insertion of a left ventricular assist device.However, right ventricular assist device insertion can be technically challengingin the setting of pulmonary hypertension because of a number of concomitantanatomic and physiologic phenomena. We present a technique for the insertion ofthe right ventricular assist device outflow cannula that is easier and faster to insert, and safer to explant, especially if cardiopulmonary bypass is to beavoided.
