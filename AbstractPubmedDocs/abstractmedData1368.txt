Although individualcenters report good success, overall outcomes have remained poor. We investigatedwhether preoperative variables influenced survival and could be used to helpselect patients best served by referral. A retrospective chart review wasconducted on all patients transferred to our institution supported on cardiacassist devices. Between January 1995 and September 2003, 39 patients werereceived in transfer for continued care after the implantation of a cardiacassist device. Eighty-five percent of patients had the ABIOMED BVS 5000implanted. The most common indication was postcardiotomy shock. Sixty-fourpercent of patients were not candidates for heart transplantation due to medical or social contraindications. The 30-day mortality of this group was 62%.Survivors had less comorbidity and were less likely to have complex surgeries,neurologic impairment, and multisystem organ failure when presenting to ourcenter. Devices were weaned in 30% of cases. Only six patients (15%) weresuccessfully transplanted, and five of these patients have done well atfollow-up. Based on our experience, we believe that cardiogenic shock patientsbenefit from a regional referral system if they have not had complex cardiacsurgical procedures or developed multisystem organ failure. Furthermore, there isa survival advantage when using long-term devices because this allows possiblerecovery or transplantation.
