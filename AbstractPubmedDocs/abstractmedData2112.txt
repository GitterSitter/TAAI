Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania StateUniversity, Hershey 17033.Permanent circulatory support systems are required for patients in whommyocardial damage is irreversible and cardiac transplantation is not possible.Two systems are described which provide long term circulatory support: the leftventricular assist system and the total artificial heart. These systems are basedon the design of a pusher plate actuated blood pump, driven by a small brushless dc electric motor and rollerscrew driver. An implantable motor controllermaintains suitable physiologic flow rates for both systems and controlsleft-right balance in the total artificial heart. Other parts of the systeminclude an intra-thoracic compliance chamber, transcutaneous energy and datatransmission system, and internal and external batteries.
