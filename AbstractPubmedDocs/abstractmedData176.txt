We examined theefficacy of the PACT to assess psychosocial outcomes in LVAD patients.METHODS: We reviewed patients who received LVAD implants between June 2006 andApril 2011 and retrospectively applied the PACT. We determined the accuracy ofidentifying social success with the PACT and revised domains to reflect criteria influencing social success for LVAD patients.RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (72% men, 44% non-white, 50.4 years old) weredivided into high-scoring and low-scoring groups. Nine patients with low PACTscores were falsely categorized as high-risk, whereas 4 with high scores had poorsocial outcomes. The score had a high positive-predictive value (0.86) but lownegative-predictive value (0.31). The PACT was revised (modified [m]PACT) tomeasure indicators, such as social support and understanding of carerequirements, identified to more closely affect LVAD outcome. The mPACT exhibitedimproved accuracy. A reclassification table was developed, and the netreclassification index was 0.32. The percentage of patients incorrectlyclassified for social risk decreased from 27% with the PACT to 8% with the mPACT.Patients with higher mPACT scores had decreased 30-day readmission rates (26% vs 67%, p = 0.045) after device implantation.CONCLUSIONS: By emphasizing social support, psychologic health, lifestylefactors, and device understanding, the mPACT showed improved performance inrisk-stratifying candidates for LVAD therapy.
