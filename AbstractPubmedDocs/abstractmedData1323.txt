ASAIO J. 2007 Jan-Feb;53(1):97-102.Outcomes of pediatric patients bridged to heart transplantation fromextracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.BarZiv SM(1), McCrindle BW, West LJ, Edgell D, Coles JG, VanArsdell GS, Bohn D,Perez R, Campbell A, Dipchand AI.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children/University ofToronto, Canada.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used as a salvage therapy inchildren with irreversible myocardial failure who may be candidates for hearttransplantation (HTx) (at the Hospital for Sick Children). We retrospectivelyassessed outcomes of children wait-listed for HTx from ECMO, and risk factors forpatients (pts) bridged to HTx from January 1990 through December 2005. Of 205patients supported with cardiac ECMO, 46 were wait-listed for HTx. Sixteenpatients died before HTx: eight died while wait-listed on ECMO; eight weredelisted (clinical deterioration; all died); five were delisted (improved), and25 (54%) underwent HTx from ECMO. Of 25 patients who underwent HTx (median age7.0 years [10 days to 17 years]), 13 had myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, and 12had congenital heart disease. Median ECMO duration was 6.7 days (3-18 days).Median follow-up was 4.3 years (0.2-10.6 years). Four patients died <1 weekpost-HTx, and 21 survived until hospital discharge (84%). Post-transplantsurvival was 67% and 52% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Risk factors for earlydeath were older age, higher body surface area, higher creatinine before andduring ECMO, fungal infections, and exposure to blood products. In summary, fewrisk factors preclude HTx candidacy from ECMO. The impact of newer assisttechnology on ECMO, wait-list mortality, and HTx outcomes remains to beelucidated.
