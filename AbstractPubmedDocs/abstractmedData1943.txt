Artif Organs. 1996 Dec;20(12):1325-9.Current status of heart assist and replacement in Taiwan.Wang SS(1), Chu SH.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University, Taipei.The first clinical application of intraaortic balloon pumps (IABP) in Taiwan was in 1976 to treat post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock. It is now the most commonlyused circulatory assist. From 1991 to 1995, 186 patients received IABP supportwith an overall mortality rate 41.9%. The male patients had the best survivalrate, 67%, after coronary artery bypass grafting. The first extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) was in 1987 to treat intractable heart failure causedby severe acute rejection after heart transplantation. Because of poor outcome,patients only received ECMO sporadically during the past years. From November1994 to November 1995, 30 patients received ECMO support with 50% of themeventually weaned from ECMO and 27% discharged. For short-term support oremergency rescue, ECMO was a good choice. When long-term support was required,the ventricular assist device (VAD) was a more suitable assist. One patient whoreceived Thermedics VAD developed right heart failure and finally died of sepsis and multiple organ failure. VAD should be implanted before the secondary organfailure. The first successful clinical heart transplantation in Taiwan wasperformed on July 17, 1987. From 1991 to 1995, 102 patients underwent hearttransplantation. The operative mortality was 3.9%, and the 1 and 5 year actuarialsurvival rates were 86 +/- 3% and 77 +/- 5%, respectively. To improve the successrate of clinical heart transplantation, organ donation should be encouraged.
