It is possible that even higher successrates can be achieved with earlier use of VADs, particularly in patients whocannot separate from cardiopulmonary bypass. There are several importantquestions and problems that must be addressed before the wider application ofVADs in acute heart failure. How can one reliably and expeditiously distinguishpatients who will separate from bypass and survive if given additional time onconventional cardiopulmonary bypass from patients who are destined to requiremechanical assistance? How can the problems with post-bypass organ damage beminimized, and how can patients with irreversible organ injury be distinguishedfrom patients with reversible dysfunction? How can the problems with post-implantbleeding, infection, and thromboembolism be minimized? Perhaps the most importantproblem is how to treat patients who survive VAD implantation, but whose heartsfail to recover. The only alternatives at the present time are removal of thedevice with almost certain death, or cardiac transplantation. The development of chronically implantable VADs (ie, expected duration of support 5 years or more)will provide an excellent alternative for patients who are not optimal transplantrecipients or for whom there is not a donor heart available. The number ofpatients that will be in this category and the cost per patient year of survival are factors that will weight heavily in the decisions made by the federalgovernment regarding clinical application of this technology.
