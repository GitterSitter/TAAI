BIVADs provide mechanicalsupport for ventricular ejection in the failing heart and have become an acceptedtreatment for end-stage heart failure. They also have proved to be a successfulbridge to heart transplantation. As their popularity has grown, the number ofpatients with BIVADs presenting for noncardiac surgery is increasing. We reportthe successful management of an implanted extracorporeal BIVAD in a patient with end-stage heart failure and with pancreatic stents in a case of necroticpancreatitis. Historical, physical, laboratory, and imaging data allowedconservative management leading to a favorable outcome.
