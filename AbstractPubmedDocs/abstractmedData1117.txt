Attenuating or reversingremodeling is an accepted goal of heart failure therapy. Cardiac mechanicalsupport with left ventricular assist devices, in addition to its established roleas "bridge to transplantation" or "destination therapy" in patients not eligible for cardiac transplantation, offers the potential for significant and sustainedmyocardial recovery through reverse remodeling. This review discusses theemerging role of left ventricular assist devices as a "bridge to recovery".Clinical and basic aspects of cardiac remodeling and cardiac reverse remodelingenabled by mechanical unloading, potential candidates for this modality oftreatment as well as unresolved issues regarding the use of mechanicalcirculatory support as a bridge to recovery are discussed.
