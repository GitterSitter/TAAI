Garrahan",Buenos Aires, Argentina. guillermo.moreno1@gmail.comThe objective of this study was to describe our experience (1373 days of support)with the Berlin Heart Excor (BH) ventricular-assist device (VAD) as bridging tocardiac transplantation in pediatric patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. Thisstudy involved a retrospective observational cohort. Records of patientssupported with the BH VAD were reviewed. Data regarding age, sex, weight,diagnosis, preoperative condition, single versus biventricular support,morbidity, and mortality were collected. Criteria for single versus biventricularsupport and intensive care unit management were registered. The procedure wasapproved by our Institutional Ethics Committee, and informed consent wasobtained. Between March 2006 and March 2010, 12 patients with diagnosis ofdilated (n = 10) and restrictive (n = 2) cardiomyopathy were supported. Medianage was 56.6 months (range 20.1-165.9); mean weight was 18.3 kg (range 8.5-45);and nine patients were female. Every patient presented with severe heart failure refractory to pharmacological therapy. Biventricular support was necessary infour patients. Nine patients underwent heart transplantation. No child was weanedoff the BH VAD because of myocardial recovery. Mean length of support was 73 days(range 3-331), and the total number of days of support was 1373. Three patientshad fatal complications: 2 had thrombo-hemorrhagic stroke leading to brain death,and one had refractory vasoplegic shock. The BH VAD is a useful and reasonablesafe device for cardiac transplantation bridging in children with end-stage heartfailure. Team experience resulted in less morbidity and mortality, and time forimplantation, surgical procedure, anticoagulation monitoring, and patient careimproved.
