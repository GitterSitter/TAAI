Data concerning their effect on patienthaemodynamics, ventricular function and tissue perfusion is limited. We aimed to document these parameters following HeartWare centrifugal continuous-flow LVAD(HVAD) implantation and to assess the impact of post-operative right heartfailure (RHF).METHODS: We reviewed 53 consecutive patients (mean age 49.5 ± 14.1 yrs) with HVADimplanted in the left ventricle, at St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, betweenJanuary 2007 and August 2012. Available paired right heart catheterisation (n=35)and echocardiography (n=39) data was reviewed to assess response of invasivehaemodynamics and ventricular function to LVAD support.RESULTS: A total of 28 patients (53%) were implanted from interim mechanicalcirculatory support. Seventeen patients (32%) required short-term post-implantveno-pulmonary artery extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. At 100 ± 61 dayspost-implant, mean pulmonary artery pressure and mean pulmonary capillary wedgepressure decreased from 38.8 ± 7.7 to 22.9 ± 7.7 mmHg and 28.3 ± 6.4 to 13.4 ±5.4 mmHg respectively (p<0.001). LV end diastolic diameter decreased from 71.3 ± 12.7 to 61.1 ± 13.7 mm and LV end-systolic diameter from 62.7 ± 12.3 to 53.9 ±14.4mm (p<0.001). Aortic regurgitation remained trivial. Serum sodium increasedfrom 133.3 ± 5.7 to 139.3 ± 2.8 mmol/L and creatinine decreased from 109.1 ± 42.5to 74.3 ± 26.2 μmol/L (p<0.001). Across the entire cohort, the six-monthsurvival/transplant rate was significantly lower for RHF patients (72.2%, n=18)compared to those without (96.9%, n=35, p=0.01).CONCLUSIONS: HVAD support improves haemodynamics, LV dimensions and renalfunction. Following implantation with a centrifugal continuous-flow LVAD, RHFremains a significant risk with a tendency to worse outcomes in the short tomedium term.Crown Copyright © 2014.
