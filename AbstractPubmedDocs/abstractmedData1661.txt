Pharmacotherapy, atrio-biventricularresynchronization, myocardial revascularization, valve repair techniques,latissimus dorsi cardiomyopathy, acorn cardiac support device, hearttransplantation and mechanical assist devices do not cover all the needs. Therecent progress in cellular and molecular biology allows the development of newtherapies for heart failure.TRANSPLANTATION OF AUTOLOGOUS CELLS: One of the most innovative consists in thetransplantation of autologous ex-vivo expanded cells into the myocardium forheart muscle regeneration. This approach is called "cellular cardiomyoblasty".
