Dominating diagnoses were dilatedcardiomyopathy in 61% (n = 36) and ischemic cardiomyopathy in 18.6% (n = 11). Thepatients were supported with LVAD for a median time of 99.5 days (range, 1 to 873days). Forty-five (76%) patients received transplants, and 3 (5.1%) patients wereweaned from the device. Eleven patients (18.6%) died during LVAD treatment. Risk factor analysis for mortality before heart transplantation showed significancefor a high total amount of autologous blood transfusions (p < 0.001), days onmechanical ventilation postoperatively (p < 0.001), prolonged postoperativeintensive care unit stay (p = 0.007), and high central venous pressure 24 hourspostoperatively and at the final measurement (p = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively).Mortality with LVAD treatment was 18.6% (n = 11). High C-reactive protein (p =0.001), low mean arterial pressure (p = 0.03), and high cardiac index (p = 0.03) preoperatively were risk factors for development of right ventricular failureduring LVAD treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish experience with LVAD as a bridge to hearttransplantation was retrospectively collected into a database. This included datafrom transplant and nontransplant centers. Figures of mortality and morbidity in the database were comparable to international experience. Specific risk factorswere difficult to define retrospectively as a result of different protocols forfollow-up among participating centers.
