For each patient weight and BMI at time of VADimplantation and at 6 months post-operatively were documented. Between groupcomparison was achieved with Student's T tests.RESULTS: We identified 14 patients who had received the HeartMate XVE™ and 8 who had received the HeartMate II™. At 6 months, patients who received a HeartMateXVE™ demonstrated a significant reduction in mean body weight (249.6 ± 35.4lbsvs. 217.4 ± 20.5 lbs; P<0.05), while patients who received the HeartMate II™demonstrated no significant change in weight (234.5 ± 41.7 lbs vs. 234.7 ±43.0lbs; P=0.3).CONCLUSIONS: The HeartMate XVE™ results in significant reductions in weight at 6 months in obese patients with heart failure while the HeartMate II does not.Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of VADs on weight loss in obese HF patients.
