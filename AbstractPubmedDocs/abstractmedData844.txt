Circulatory mechanical support is sometimes required for thisdevastating condition. We analyzed our experience in managing AFM with mechanicalcirculatory support.METHODS: We applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a first-linerescue for AFM. The diagnosis was mainly derived from clinical results andbiopsy.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled in the age range of 29.6 ± 18.6years and the pediatric group (< 18 years) comprised 32% (n = 24) of our patient group. Thirty-five patients (47%) underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)before ECMO. The indication for ECMO included high inotropic support 69% (n = 54)and continuous CPR at ECMO setup 31% (n = 23). The ECMO duration was 171 ± 121 h.Survival to discharge was 64% (n = 48), 61% in adult group, and 70.8% inpediatric group. Six patients were later bridged to ventricular assist device use(5 left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 1 bi-ventricular assist device(BVAD)) but three died of multiple-organ failure. Three patients (4%) underwentheart transplantation and all of them survived to discharge. Resuscitation didnot have a significant factor for survival. Only two patients (3%) developed latemortality due to a cardiac event.CONCLUSIONS: AFM still carries high mortality rates in spite of advancedmechanical support. Most of the survivors did not require transplantation andcould return to good lifestyle. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, ECMO canbe a first-line tool to rescue this group of patients.Copyright © 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published byElsevier B.V.
