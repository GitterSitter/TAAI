Patient age ranged from 29 to 80 years. Of the 46 patients, 42were male. All were New York Heart Association (NYHA) IV predominantly withidiopathic dilated (n=22) or ischaemic (n=18) cardiomyopathy. The experience(2000-2008) included the learning curve of 10 centres.RESULTS: The internal components are imperceptible. The power/control system isuser friendly, allowing excellent QOL. There has been no pump malfunction. TheKaplan-Meier survival analysis is shown. The longest event-free survival is 7.5years. Support exceeded 3 years in five cases. The cumulative experience exceeds 50 years. Three patients were transplanted, and two pumps were replaced at 90 and203 days. Nineteen cases are ongoing (mean: 663 days), while 22 died duringsupport (mean survival: 402 days), of which five from non-device-relateddiseases. Temporary local infection occurred in three pedestals, and there hasbeen no pump infection. Incidence of thrombo-embolic events showed wide variationbetween centres.CONCLUSIONS: From this learning-curve experience, both left ventricular assistdevice (LVAD) and power delivery are reliable and promising for destinationtherapy. Early mortality is similar to other studies and relates to the severity of illness. Pump infection has not occurred and prolonged event-free survival is clearly possible with expert medical management.Copyright 2009. Published by Elsevier B.V.
