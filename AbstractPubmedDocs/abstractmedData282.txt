This study investigated whether LVADs can be implanted in selected patients over theage of 65 years with acceptable survival compared with published outcomes.METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted in 64consecutive patients ≥65 years of age implanted with a continuous-flow leftventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) as either bridge to transplantation ordestination therapy from August 2005 to January 2012. Baseline laboratory andhemodynamic characteristics and follow-up data were obtained. Median survival was1,090 days. Survival was 85%, 74%, 55%, and 45% at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3years, respectively. Our cohort had a baseline mean Seattle Heart Failure Model(SHFM) score of 2.6 ± 0.9. Observed survival was significantly better thanSHFM-predicted medical survival. Stratification by age subsets, renal function,SHFM, implantation intention, or etiology did not reveal significant differences in survival. The most common cause of death was sepsis and nonlethalcomplication was bleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with patients over the age of 65 receiving CF-LVADssuggests that this group demonstrates excellent survival. Further research isneeded to discern the specific criteria for risk stratification for LVAD support in the elderly.Published by Elsevier Inc.
