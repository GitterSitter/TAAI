Our approach has been to investigate the substitution or reinforcement of a ventricular wall by acontractile tissue. The experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of thistechnique and the long-term adaptability and adequate electrophysiologicalproperties of the Latissimus Dorsi flap transferred to a heterotopic positionover the heart. Long-term biocompatible fatigue resistant muscle stimulation has become possible in experimental and clinical cases as a result of the developmentof specially designed electrodes and the use of a progressive sequentialstimulation protocol to adapt the skeletal muscle to a cardiac support function. Autologous pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde was found to be a suitablematerial to close the ventricular cavity. Cardiomyoplasty with autologousskeletal muscle to restore ventricular contractility seems to be a validalternative in addition to current methods of treatment for irreversiblemyocardial failure.
