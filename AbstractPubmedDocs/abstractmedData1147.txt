Recognition of risk factors for mortality after biventricularassist device (BiVAD) implantation is important for patient selection and optimaloutcomes.METHODS: We reviewed our experiences between 1991 and 2005 in 44 patients whowere supported by both an LVAD and a right ventricular assist device.RESULTS: Thirteen patients (30%) survived until heart transplantation, and 31patients (70%) died while on support. The multivariate analysis shows thatpost-LVAD extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and worsening renal function areassociated with the highest postoperative mortality. The univariate analysis alsoincluded previous thoracic surgery and ischemic cardiomyopathy as potentialpreoperative indicators for poor outcome after BiVAD implants. No differenceswere observed in the rates for the need of preoperative support with aventilator, an intra-aortic balloon pump, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,or in the rates of postoperative complications between survivors andnonsurvivors.CONCLUSIONS: BiVAD implantation remains one of the challenges in treating severe heart failure. Previous cardiac surgery, elevated creatinine, and post-LVADextracorporeal membrane oxygenation were risk factors for mortality after BiVADimplantation. Dialated Cardiomyopathy on the other hand was associated with amore favorable outcome.
