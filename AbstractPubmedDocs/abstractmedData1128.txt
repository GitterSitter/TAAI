Tex Heart Inst J. 2008;35(4):462-5.TandemHeart insertion via a femoral arterial GORE-TEX graft conduit in ahigh-risk patient.Busch J(1), Torre-Amione G, Noon GP, Loebe M.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Methodist DeBakey Heart Center, Baylor College ofMedicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.The TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD), which providestemporary circulatory support of the left ventricle, can be used in high-risk andhemodynamically unstable patients. The easily inserted TandemHeart providescardiac support superior to that from the use of intra-aortic balloon pumps.Herein, we discuss TandemHeart implantation via end-to-side femoral arterialgrafting in a cardiac patient whose sepsis and multiorgan failure werecomplicated by coagulopathy and thromboembolism. A 47-year-old woman, onintra-aortic balloon and intravenous inotropic support after an acute myocardial infarction and emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, was transferred to our institution via helicopter. She developed sepsis and multiorgan failure. Hercondition was further complicated by coagulopathy and a left-lower-extremitythromboembolism. After 6 weeks of aggressive pharmacologic and intermittentintra-aortic balloon treatment, the patient developed cardiogenic shock andreceived a TandemHeart pVAD for short-term circulatory support. A GORE-TEX accessgraft, sewn end-to-side to the femoral artery because of the patient's legischemia and very small vessels, served as a conduit for the TandemHeart'sfemoral arterial inflow cannula. Her difficult circulatory, anatomic, andcoagulopathic status stabilized after 2 weeks of TandemHeart support, and she wasbridged to the long-term MicroMed DeBakey VAD Child in anticipation of hearttransplantation. The case of our patient shows that high-risk patients who haveexperienced cardiogenic shock with multiorgan failure and coagulopathy canbenefit from the TandemHeart pVAD as a bridge to other therapeutic options, even when creative approaches to treatment and to TandemHeart insertion are required.PMCID: PMC2607081
