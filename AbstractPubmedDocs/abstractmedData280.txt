Hearttransplantation can be postponed and for certain patients even replaced bysmaller implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Mechanical supportof the failing left ventricle enables appropriate haemodynamic stabilization and recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in these severely ill patients.These new devices may be of great help to bridge patients until a suitablecardiac allograft is available but are also discussed as definitive treatment forpatients who do not qualify for transplantation. Main indications for LVADimplantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to transplantation or destinationtherapy. An LVAD may be an important tool for patients with an expected prolongedperiod on the waiting list, for instance those with blood group O or B, with highor low body weight and those with potentially reversible secondary organ failure and pulmonary artery hypertension. However, LVAD implantation means an additionalheart operation with inherent perioperative risks and complications during thewaiting period. Finally, cardiac transplantation in patients with priorimplantation of an LVAD represents a surgical challenge. The care of patientsafter the implantation of miniaturized LVADs, such as the HeartWare® system,seems to be easier than following pulsatile devices. The explantation of suchdevices at the time of transplantation is technically more comfortable than afterHeartMate II implantation.
