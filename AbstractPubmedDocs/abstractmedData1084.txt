The duration of HF likely influences diseaseseverity and may introduce lead-time bias into analyses of outcomes. The aim ofthis study was to analyze a cohort in which the exact time of HF onset could bedetermined: patients in the University of Michigan subset of the acute coronarysyndromes (ACS) database of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) who developed new-onset HF (no history of HF and left ventricular ejectionfraction <or=40% or qualitatively diminished) with their index ACS events fromJanuary 1999 to March 2006 (n = 446). For analysis, body mass index (BMI) wascategorized as normal (18.5 to <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (25 to <30 kg/m(2)), and obese (>or=30 kg/m(2)). Underweight patients (BMI <or=18.5 kg/m(2)) wereexcluded. Separate multivariate Cox regression models were performed to examinethe effect of BMI group and other potential confounders on all-cause mortalityand on the combined outcome of all-cause death, cardiac transplantation, orventricular assist device implantation. BMI groups were not associated withdifferent risks for the combined outcome, although overweight BMI approachedstatistical significance for lower risk for the combined outcome. Overweight BMI was significantly associated with lower risk for all-cause death (hazard ratio0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.94, p = 0.02), although obese BMI was not(hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.64, p = 0.8). Inconclusion, these findings suggest a U-shaped relation between mortality and BMI in the setting of new-onset HF after ACS.
