Roger.J.Bick@uth.tmc.eduBACKGROUND: The use of left ventricular (LV) assist devices (LVADs) can improveperformance and recovery of failing human hearts.AIM: Following our alpha-adrenergic receptor work, we hypothesized thatmechanical unloading in patients with low output syndrome and LV failure wouldyield similar results with beta-adrenergic receptors ((beta)AR), that beingincreased numbers and intra-myocytic relocalization.METHODS: (beta)AR density and localization were investigated by fluorescencedeconvolution microscopy and compared at LVAD insertion and removal in 13 heartfailure patients, the patients therefore acting as their own control. (beta)ARdensities and distribution were determined in snap frozen sections of human core biopsy left ventricular apical tissue. Samples were probed with tagged CGP 12177 for visualization of (beta)AR and challenged with cold agonists and antagonists. (beta)AR density was measured by two independent methods. Localization ofreceptors was examined in reconstructed, deconvoluted, stacked section images.RESULTS: There was an increase in (beta)AR density following ventricularunloading in most of the patients, and also significant normalization in thelocation of the receptors in the myocardium comparing pre- and post-LVAD tissue.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that supporting an ailing heart via unloadinginitiates mechanisms and pathways responsible for myocardial recovery and repair.With appropriate pharmacological support, patients with LVAD might recover to thepoint where they no longer depend on eventual organ transplantation, and (beta)ARnumber, type, and distribution in pre-LVAD myocardial tissue, could predictoutcome with regard to recovery, repair, and improvement in cardiac function.
