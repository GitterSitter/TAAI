This study tested the hypothesis that reported normalization of LVdiastolic properties is primarily due to remodeling of chamber geometry.METHODS AND RESULTS: Hearts were obtained at transplantation from 8 patients withdilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 6 patients with DCM plus 33+/-5 days of LV assist, and 3 patients with no evidence of heart failure. LV assist normalized passivepressure-volume curves. Chamber dimensions decreased without a change in theratio of radius to wall thickness. Midwall stress-stretch relations predictedfrom pressure-volume and dimension data were not different for DCM and LV assist hearts. Passive stress-stretch relations were measured in endocardial trabeculae and were not different for DCM and LV assist hearts. Myocyte size and collagenarea fraction were unchanged at this brief duration of support.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are all consistent with the hypothesis that earlynormalization of diastolic properties after LV assist device support results fromremodeling of chamber geometry, not from changes in tissue stiffness. These data emphasize the importance of geometry to ventricular mechanics and demonstratethat reduction of heart size does not necessarily produce a reduction in wallstress.
