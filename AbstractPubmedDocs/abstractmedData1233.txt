Eighty-seven devices have been placed in North Americathrough February 2007. We describe our single-center experience in 8 children.METHODS: Eight children (ages 4 to 55 months), with median weight of 9.6 kg andbody surface area of 0.48 m(2), received the Berlin Heart VAD as a bridge totransplantation. All patients were in cardiogenic shock requiring multipleinotropes. Primary diagnoses were idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 4),congenital heart disease (n = 3) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 1). Afterdevice insertion, all patients were treated with an anti-coagulant (heparin orcoumadin) and one or more platelet inhibitors (aspirin with clopidogrel ordipyridamole).RESULTS: Five patients received support with a left ventricular assist device(LVAD) and 3 with a biventricular device (BiVAD). Duration of support ranged from2 to 234 days (median 57 days). Five patients (63%) were successfully bridged to transplantation; of these, 4 were discharged home and 1 died from early graftfailure. Five patients developed post-operative neurologic events. Of these 5events, 4 could be explained by embolism or hemorrhage. Device exchange wasperformed in 4 patients in the intensive care unit.CONCLUSIONS: In selected children, the Berlin Heart VAD can be used as a bridgeto transplantation. In contrast to the published European experience, neurologic events occur frequently. Anti-coagulation and platelet inhibition strategiescontinue to evolve. Device exchange is technically feasible at the bedside andshould be considered at the earliest visualization of thrombus formation.
