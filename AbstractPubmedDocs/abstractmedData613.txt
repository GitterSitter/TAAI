The 30-day mortality was 13.7% (7/51 patients), and the overall mortality was 23.5% (12/51patients). Meanwhile, 21 patients (21/51; 41.2%) have undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. The mean time of support was 314.5±235 days with a median of240 days at the time of closing this study. Echocardiographic evaluation of RVfunction pre- and post-implantation of an LVAD demonstrated septal deviationtowards the left ventricle in immediate postoperative phase, which correlatedwith acute RV dysfunction (p = 0.002). Preoperative RV dysfunction was asignificant predictor of postoperative right heart dysfunction followingimplantation of an LVAD (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Preoperative RV dysfunction is a predictor of RV failure in LVADpatients. The adjustment of septal deviation through gradual increase of the LVADflow can prevent the acute RV dysfunction following LVAD placement.PMCID: PMC3403957
