This study evaluated our strategy for right heart failure using atemporary right VAD (RVAD) with an extracorporeal centrifugal pump.METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2010, 108 patients underwent LVADimplantation at our institution and their clinical outcomes were studied.RESULTS: A temporary centrifugal RVAD was implanted in 26 patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed pre-operative extracorporeal life support (oddsratio [OR], 37.0), central venous pressure (OR, 1.2), mean pulmonary arterypressure (OR, 0.9), and serum total bilirubin (OR, 1.4) were the risk factors forRVAD requirement. RVAD-off test was conducted, and 11 of the 26 patients showedsignificant recovery of right heart function and were eventually removed fromRVAD support. The survival of patients with isolated LVAD was significantlybetter than those with a paracorporeal pulsatile BiVAD (80% vs 11% at 1 year, p <0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the survival ofpatients who underwent isolated LVAD support and those who were initiallyimplanted with temporary BiVAD but underwent the RVAD removal (80% vs 73% at 1year, p = 0.827).CONCLUSION: Our strategy with temporary RVAD for severe acute right heart failurewas effective in selecting the patients who could be weaned from RVAD support.Patient survival was improved by avoiding the long-term support with aparacorporeal pulsatile BiVAD.Copyright Â© 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
