The purpose of ourstudy was to examine differences in HRQOL from before mechanical circulatorysupport (MCS) through 1 year after surgery by Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) patient profiles.METHODS: Data from 1,559 adults with advanced heart failure who received primary continuous-flow pumps between June 23, 2006, and March 31, 2010, and wereenrolled in INTERMACS were analyzed. HRQOL data were collected using the EQ-5D-3Lsurvey before implantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation.Statistical analyses included chi-square and t-tests, using all available datafor each time period. Paired t-tests and sensitivity analyses were alsoconducted.RESULTS: HRQOL was poor before MCS implantation among patients with INTERMACSprofiles 1 to 7 and significantly improved after MCS implantation for allprofiles. Stratified by INTERMACS profile, problems within each of the 5dimensions of HRQOL (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, andanxiety/depression) generally decreased from before to after implantation. By 6months after implantation, patients with all INTERMACS profiles reported similar frequencies of problems for all HRQOL dimensions. Paired t-tests and sensitivity analyses supported almost all of our findings.CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is poor among advanced heart failure patients with INTERMACSprofiles 1 to 7 before MCS implantation and improves to similar levels forpatients who remained on MCS 1 year after surgery. Patients have problems inHRQOL dimensions before and after MCS; however, the frequency of reportingproblems decreases for all dimensions within most profiles across time.Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published byInternational Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.PMCID: PMC3966941
