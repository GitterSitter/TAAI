It comprises also a pneumatic driving unitcapable of operating in the "full to empty", EKG synchronized or asynchronousmodes. The system was tested "in vitro" to assess its mechanical durability,hydrodynamic performance and hemolysis. "In vivo" tests were performed in 22sheep and 8 calves aiming at optimizing cannulas and implant techniques. In theseexperiments, hemolysis and the device's capacity of restoring to normalhemodynamic parameters during induced cardiac failure were evaluated.RESULTS: The device was worked 4,000 hours without failure in a mock circulatory loop. Hydrodynamic performance was satisfactory for adult circulatory support. In"full to empty" mode it displayed a frequency mediated "Starling like"performance. Optimum output was achieved with a systole duration of 40% of thecycle. "In vitro" hemolysis index was 6.7 +/- 2.1. Hemolysis in animalexperiments was clinically non significant. In calves under induced cardiacfailure the VAD was able to normalize hemodynamic parameters within 120 minutes.CONCLUSION: This VAD is capable to circulatory assist for cardiogenic shock inconditions needed for an adult patient and the average time span anticipated for bridge to transplantation or post cardiotomy cardiogenic shock.
