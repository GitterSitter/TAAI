J Heart Lung Transplant. 2003 Sep;22(9):1046-53.Early and late results of left ventricular reshaping by passive cardiac-supportdevice in canine heart failure.Kashem A(1), Kashem S, Santamore WP, Crabbe DL, Margulies KB, Melvin DB, Goldman BI.Author information: (1)Cardiology Section, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.mkashem@temple.eduBACKGROUND: We tested whether the CardioClasp, a passive non-blood-contactingdevice could decrease excessive geometric burden in dilated cardiomyopathy andimprove left ventricular systolic function and contractility by reshaping theleft ventricle (LV) and by decreasing LV wall stress (LVWS) without decreasingarterial blood pressure.METHODS: In mongrel dogs (n = 6, the early group; n = 6, the chronic group; 25-27kg), 4 weeks of rapid right ventricular pacing (210 to 240 bpm) induced dilatedcardiomyopathy with heart failure. In the early group, we used hemodynamic dataand echocardiography to evaluate LV systolic function immediately after placingthe CardioClasp device. In the chronic group, we also evaluated LV systolicfunction immediately after placing the device on dilated hearts and then left thedevice in place for 30 days. At the end of 30 days, before explantation of thedevice, we again assessed LV systolic function. We measured fractional area ofcontraction (FAC), LVWS, and hemodynamic data in both groups.RESULTS: In the early group, use of the CardioClasp device decreased the LVend-diastolic anterior-to-posterior dimension by 27.8% +/- 2.6% at implantation(p < 0.05). In the chronic group, use of the CardioClasp decreased the LVend-diastolic anterior-to-posterior dimension by 19.4% +/- 2.0% at implantation(p < 0.05) and by 22.0% +/- 3.10% at explantation (p < 0.05). Use of theCardioClasp did not alter LV end-diastolic and peak pressure, LV dP/dts, orcardiac output at implantation or at explantation. In the early group, use of theCardioClasp decreased the LVWS by 43.4% +/- 3.1% at implantation (p < 0.05). Inthe chronic group, LVWS decreased by 28.8% +/- 2.1% at implantation (p < 0.05)and by 43.3% +/- 5.2% at explantation (p < 0.05). In the early group, FACincreased significantly, by 28.9% +/- 7.8% at implantation (p < 0.05). In thechronic group, FAC increased significantly, by 18% +/- 12% at implantation (p <0.05) and by 19% +/- 12% at explantation (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: As expected, use of the CardioClasp device increased FAC anddecreased LVWS by reshaping the LV. Use of the CardioClasp device maintainedcardiac output and arterial pressure. In 30-day experiments, the increased FACand decreased LVWS were maintained at explantation.
