A bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy wasmore common in the Northeast (31.7%; West, 18.5%; South, 26.9%; Midwest, 25.5%; p< 0.0001). In contrast, destination therapy (DT) was more likely in the South(40.6%; Northeast, 32.3%; Midwest, 27.3%; West, 27.3%; p < 0.0001). Although all regions showed a high 1-year survival rate, some regional differences inlong-term mortality were observed. Notably, survival beyond 1 year after LVADimplant was significantly lower in the South. However, when stratified by device strategy, no significant differences in survival for BTT or DT patients werefound among the regions. Finally, with the exception of right ventricularfailure, which was more common in the South, no other significant differences in causes of death were observed among the regions.CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in clinical profile and LVAD strategy exist in the United States. Despite an overall high survival rate at 1 year, differencesin mortality among the regions were noted. The lower survival rate in the Southmay be attributed to patient characteristics and higher use of LVAD as DT.Copyright Â© 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
