Percutaneous implantation of an extracorporeal life support (ECLS)system achieves immediate cardiopulmonary stabilization, sufficient end-organperfusion and reduction of subsequent multiorgan failure (MOF).METHODS: Forty-one patients undergoing percutaneous ECLS implantation forcardiogenic shock from February 2012 until August 2013 were retrospectivelyanalysed. Mean age was 52 ± 13 years, 6 (15%) were female. Mean pH valuesobtained before ECLS implantation were 7.15 ± 0.24, mean lactate concentrationwas 11.7 ± 6.4 mmol/l. Levels obtained 6 h after ECLS implantation were 7.30 ±0.14 and 8.7 ± 5.0 mmol/l, respectively. In 23 patients (56%) cardiogenic shockresulted from an acute coronary syndrome in 13 (32%) from cardiomyopathy, in 5(12%) from other causes. Twenty-seven (66%) had been resuscitated, in 14 (34%)implantation was performed under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Of note, 97% of the acute coronary syndrome patients underwent percutaneous coronaryintervention (PCI) either before ECLS implantation or under ECLS support.Extracorporeal life support implantation was performed on scene (EmergencyDepartment, Cath Lab, Intensive Care Unit) by a senior cardiac surgeon and atrained perfusionist, in 8 cases (20%) in the referring hospital.RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 51% [21 patients, due to MOF (n = 14), cerebralcomplications (n = 6) and heart failure (n = 1)]. Logistic regression analysisidentified 6-h pH values as an independent risk factor of 30-day mortality (P <0.001, OR = 0.000, 95% CI 0.000-0.042). Neither CPR nor implantation underongoing CPR resulted in significant differences. In 26 cases (63%), the ECLSsystem could be explanted, after mean support of 169 ± 67 h. Seven of thesepatients received cardiac surgery [ventricular assist device implantation (n =4), heart transplantation (n = 1), other procedures (n = 2)].CONCLUSIONS: Due to the evolution of transportable ECLS systems and percutaneous techniques implantation on scene is feasible. Extracorporeal life support mayserve as a bridge-to-decision and bridge-to-treatment device. Neurologicalevaluation before ventricular assist device implantation and PCI under stableconditions are possible. Despite substantial mortality, ECLS implantation inselected patients by an experienced team offers additional support toconventional therapy as well as CPR and allows survival in patients thatotherwise most likely would have died. This concept has to be implemented incardiac survival networks in the future.PMCID: PMC3930215
