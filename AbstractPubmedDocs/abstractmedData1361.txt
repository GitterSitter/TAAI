The acknowledged critical limitation of sufficientsuitable organ donors has resulted in the refinement and development of novelsurgical alternatives for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Theseapproaches include the extension of current conventional cardiac operations such as mitral valve repair to the failing ventricle, surgically reconstructing thesize and shape of the failing left ventricle in order to optimize geometry andrender it a more efficient pump, and partial or complete replacement of theventricle with a mechanical device. The continued evolution of such therapies is likely to one day have a significant epidemiologic impact on patients sufferingfrom end stage heart failure.
