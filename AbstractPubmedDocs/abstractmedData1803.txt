Product similarities include (1) LV apex, to pump, to ascending aorta flow patterns, (2) excellent hemodynamic support with reversal of heartfailure and neurohormone/cytokine milieu, and (3) the requirement of majorsurgery for device implantation and later explantation, with or withouttransplant. Two electrically powered models allow a tether-free existence andhospital discharge. All complications are being addressed, and in the pastdecade, device failure and thromboemboli have been reduced. Infection continuesto be an obstacle to more widespread adoption of therapy. Despite pre-LVAD shock,most patients (65% to 78% by Food and Drug Administration data) survive untiltransplant (averaging 80 to 96 days of LVAD support), and posttransplant survivalis equal to nonbridged patients. As the problem of infection is reduced, morewidespread LVAD use can be anticipated.
