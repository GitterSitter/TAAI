Sixteen ofthese patients were assisted with the 24F transthoracic Hemopump left ventricularassist device. The aim of the mechanical support was myocardial recovery as theunderlying conditions (age, arterial hypertension, diabetes, vascular andpulmonary disease) excluded heart transplantation.RESULTS: Hemodynamic improvement was apparent with a decrease in left atrialpressure (mean, 18.6 to 9.2 mm Hg), an increase in arterial blood pressure (mean,54.1 to 70.1 mm Hg), and an increase in cardiac index. Five patients died within the first 24 hours because of low cardiac output. Although the heart was wellunloaded (decrease in left atrial pressure of 8 +/- 4.69 mm Hg versus 9.3 +/-5.51 mm Hg for the other patients), the increase in cardiac index wassignificantly lower (+0.516 versus +1.377 L.min-1.m-2; p = 0.027). Three of these5 patients were known to have severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Of theremaining 11 patients, 2 were assisted for 1 week but failed to show recovery of the myocardium, 8 (50%) were weaned, and 4 (25%) were discharged. There were nodevice-related complications except the thrombosis of a cannula that was left for10 days.CONCLUSIONS: The transthoracic Hemopump is an easy-to-use and reliable assistdevice. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a relative contraindication for the useof the Hemopump.
