CVADs are smaller, more reliable, and less complex than the first-generation pulsatile-flow ventricular assist devices. Despite theirrecent clinical success, arteriovenous malformations, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, aortic valve insufficiency, and valve fusion have beenreported in heart failure patients supported by CVADs. It has been hypothesizedthat diminished arterial pressure and flow pulsatility delivered by CVAD may be acontributing factor to these adverse events. Subsequently, the clinicalsignificance of vascular pulsatility continues to be highly debated. Studiescomparing pulsatile-flow and continuous-flow support have presented conflictingfindings, largely due to variations in device operation, support duration, andthe criteria used to quantify pulsatility. Traditional measurements of pulsepressure and pulsatility index are less effective at quantifying pulsatility for mechanically derived flows, particularly with the growing trend of CVAD speedmodulation to achieve various pulsatile flow patterns. Kinetic measurements ofenergy equivalent pressure and surplus hemodynamic energy can better quantifypulsatile energies, yet technologic and conceptual challenges are impeding their clinical adaption. A review of methods for quantifying vascular pulsatility andtheir application as a research tool for investigating physiologic responses toCVAD support are presented.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
