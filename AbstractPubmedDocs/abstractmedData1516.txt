Between July of 1995 and October of 2002, 2847patients underwent congenital heart surgical repairs with the aid ofcardiopulmonary bypass at Texas Children's Hospital. During this period, 17patients required chronic mechanical circulatory assistance with Biomedicuscentrifugal pump (n=8) or Thoratec LVAD (n=4), and ECMO (n=5). Six out of 17patients required ECLS for postcardiotomy heart failure. Seven of the 17 patientshad congenital heart disease, six had cardiomyopathy, three had late acuterejection following heart transplantation, and one had myocardial infarction.Twelve patients survived and five patients expired. Six of 12 survivors recoveredsufficient cardiac function to allow device removal; and the remaining sixpatients underwent heart transplantation. Three out of five deaths were ECMOpatients. The need for ECLS following repair of congenital heart disease isextremely rare in our institution. The requirement for the use of ECMO confers a significantly higher mortality presumably because of associated combinedcardiopulmonary failure. Congenital heart disease appears to be associated withsignificantly higher mortality.
