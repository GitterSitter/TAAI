Both the numbers and ages of patientsin which they are used are rising worldwide, especially when used as a permanent support (bridge to destination, BTD). Due to the continuing lack of donor organs,these devices now represent a viable alternative to bridge patients totransplantation (BTT), with a 1-year survival rate of 86%. BTD, especially inlong-term support, might be a valid, and the sole, option for those patients inwhom heart transplantation is contraindicated. Patient selection, pre- andintra-operative preparation, as well as the timing of VAD implantation areimportant factors critical to successful circulatory support. While BTT remainsthe goal in the majority of patients, the number of permanent VADs (i.Â e. BTD) isrising significantly. Although explantation of a VAD system as a bridge torecovery (BTR) can be considered in only a small number of patients, itrepresents a very special part of this therapy modality.
