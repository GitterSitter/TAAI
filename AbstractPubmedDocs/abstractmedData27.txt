As the availability of LVADs for advancedheart failure has expanded to nontransplantation mechanical circulatory supportcenters, concerns have been expressed about maintaining good outcomes.Demographics and outcomes were evaluated in 276 patients with advanced heartfailure who underwent implantation of LVADs as bridge to transplantation ordestination therapy at 27 open-heart centers. Baseline characteristics, operativemortality, length of stay, readmission rate, adverse events, quality of life, andsurvival were analyzed. The overall 30-day mortality was 3% (8 of 276), andsurvival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were 92 ± 2%, 88 ± 3%, and 84 ± 4% for the bridge-to-transplantation group and 81 ± 3%, 70 ± 5%, and 63 ± 6%for the destination therapy group, comparable with results published by thenational Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support(INTERMACS). The median length of stay for all patients was 21 days. Bleeding wasthe most frequent adverse event. Stroke occurred in 4% (bridge totransplantation) and 6% (destination therapy) of patients. Quality-of-lifemeasures and 6-minute walk distances showed sustained improvements throughoutsupport. In conclusion, outcomes with LVAD support at open-heart centers areacceptable and comparable with results from the INTERMACS registry. Withappropriate teams, training, center commitment, and certification, LVAD therapyis being disseminated in a responsible way to open-heart centers.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
