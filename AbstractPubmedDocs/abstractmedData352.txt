Once medical management has hit its ceiling, attention is turned to surgicaloptions for mechanical support. The approach to these options has to bear in mindthat there may be many potential causes for pump failure, and that these occuroften in the context of pulmonary hypertension and poor gas exchange. Althoughextracorporeal life support has been the mainstay of treatment for acute heartfailure, in the last decade, attention has been focusing on longer-term optionsto bridge to recovery or eventual transplant. Added to this are more novelapplications of ventricular assist devices, notable in the management of thefailing Fontan circulation where there are no perfect solutions. There is growinginterest in the use of such devices to power this delicate circulation and extendthe functional capacity of patients without resorting to transplantation. In thisreview article, we explore the role each of these surgical modalities has to playin the management of the child with acute and chronic heart failure, and explore the recent developments in the rapidly growing field of pediatric ventricularassist.
