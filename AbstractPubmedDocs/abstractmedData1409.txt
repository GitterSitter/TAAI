Curr Opin Cardiol. 2006 Mar;21(2):120-6.Mechanical circulatory support therapy as a bridge to transplant or recovery (newadvances).Kirklin JK(1), Holman WL.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,Alabama, USA. jkirklin@uab.eduPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Large pulsatile left ventricular assist devices have been usedas bridge-to-transplant therapy for the past 20 years. Over the past 2 years, anumber of smaller rotary pumps have been introduced into clinical trials in theUnited States, Europe, and Australia. These devices offer the potential forsmaller operations, greater resistance to infection, and new opportunities forbridge-to-recovery therapy.RECENT FINDINGS: Ongoing trials with axial flow devices support greaterdurability and less device-related infection than the HeartMate XVE (ThoratecCorporation, Pleasanton, California, USA). A greater tendency for pump thrombusand a higher anticoagulation requirement, however, are disadvantages comparedwith the HeartMate device.SUMMARY: Large pulsatile left ventricular assist devices have been the mainstayof mechanical support. The combination of durability and smaller pump size hasbecome a focus of mechanical circulatory support in the current era. Ongoingclinical trials in the United States with three rotary pumps in bothbridge-to-transplant and destination trials will likely result in a majorincrease in options for circulatory support. At least five other small, durabledevices have recently entered non-US trials and are poised for clinical studiesin the US. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) will facilitate theintroduction of new technology and study patient and device outcomes.
