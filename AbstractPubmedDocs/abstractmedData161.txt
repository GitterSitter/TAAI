The composite Model for End-Stage Liver Diseaseexcluding INR (MELD-XI) is a robust scoring system of liver function, and a high score is associated with poor prognosis in advanced HF patients with a hearttransplantation and/or ventricular assist device. However, the impact of MELD-XI on the prognosis of HF patients in general remains unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 562 patients who were admittedto our hospital for the treatment of decompensated HF. A MELD-XI score wasgraded, and patients were divided into two groups based on the median value ofMELD-XI score: Group L (MELD-XI <10, n = 289) and Group H (MELD-XI ≥10, n = 273).We compared all-cause mortality and echocardiographic findings between the twogroups. In the follow-up period (mean 471 days), 104 deaths (62 cardiac deathsand 42 non-cardiac deaths) were observed. The event (cardiac death, non-cardiacdeath, all-cause death)-free rate was significantly higher in group L than ingroup H (logrank P<0.05, respectively). In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, a high MELD-XI score was found to be an independent predictor of cardiac deathsand all-cause mortality in HF patients. Regarding echocardiographic parameters,right atrial and ventricular areas, inferior vena cava diameter, and systolicpulmonary artery pressure were higher in group H than in group L (P<0.05,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The MELD-XI scoring system, a marker of liver function, can identifyhigh-risk patients with right heart volume overload, higher pulmonary arterialpressure and multiple organ failure associated with HF.PMCID: PMC4067358
