ASAIO Trans. 1990 Jul-Sep;36(3):M706-8.Clinical use of the Berlin Biventricular Assist Device as a bridge totransplantation.Schiessler A(1), Warnecke H, Friedel N, Hennig E, Hetzer R.Author information: (1)Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Herz-, Thorax- und Gef√§sschirurgie, WestGermany.The Berlin Artificial Heart System/Biventricular Assist Device (BVAD) was used in38 patients. 1) Twenty-eight patients were awaiting cardiac transplantation (Tx) (age 23-56 yrs). All patients had contraindications not allowing immediate Tx. 2)Five patients were emergency cases not on our Tx list (postcardiotomy cardiacfailure, acute myocarditis) (age 28-59). 3) Five patients were post Tx patientswith graft failure (age 22-52). Extracorporal circulation was used forimplantation of the BVAD. In group 1, 21 of 28 patients (pts) recovered, and all were subsequently transplanted after 6 hours to 39 days, when all organ function was restored. In 7 pts, mechanical circulation was terminated after 1-40 daysbecause of further deterioration. Five of the transplanted pts died, 14 ptssurvived (greater than 30 days), and 2 pts were just transplanted withsatisfactory postoperative courses. Of group 2 and 3 pts, two were successfullyweaned. In one patient the allograft recovered after 11 days of support.
