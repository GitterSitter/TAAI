A grading scale from 1 (abnormal staining of all myocytes, nocross-striation) to 5 (normal fiber anatomy and striation) was used. Thecross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes was also measured.RESULTS: The cardiomyocytes' cross-sectional area decreased after support, from519 +/- 94 microm(2) to 319 +/- 53 microm(2) (p < 0.001). Actin, tropomyosin,troponin C, troponin T and titin at the time of LVAD implantation showedwidespread distortion of architecture; their grades were 1.4 +/- 0.6, 2.3 +/-1.0, 2.1 +/- 0.9, 2.1 +/- 1.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.6, respectively. In contrast, myosin morphology was preserved (4.6 +/- 0.7). After LVAD support, actin, tropomyosin,troponin C, troponin T and titin showed improvement (grades 2.7 +/- 1.3 [p =0.004], 3.2 +/- 1.2 [p = 0.021], 3.3 +/- 0.9 [p = 0.004], 3.0 +/- 1.1 [p = 0.048]and 3.1 +/- 0.9 [p = 0.001], respectively), but no normalization. The myosinpattern deteriorated slightly (3.6 +/- 1.6 [p = 0.058]).CONCLUSIONS: After LVAD support, during a period of 213 +/- 135 days in patients with end-stage HF, despite a decrease in the size of the cardiomyocytes, severestructural myocyte damage persisted. This does not support complete recovery ofmyocyte histologic features.
