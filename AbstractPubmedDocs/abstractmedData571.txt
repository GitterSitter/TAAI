Epub2012 Sep 7.Implantation of the heartmate II in a patient of 34 years after a Mustardprocedure.Akay MH(1), Cooley DA, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiopulmonary Transplantation, Texas Heart Institute at St.Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston, Texas 77225-0345, USA.A growing number of patients have undergone the Mustard procedure fortransposition of the great arteries, after which the morphologic right ventricle serves as the systemic ventricle. If this ventricle fails, ventricular assistdevice support may be necessary, but implanting the inflow cannula can bechallenging in these patients because of the moderator band and trabeculation of the morphologic right ventricle. We describe successful assist deviceimplantation in a 34-year-old patient who had undergone the Mustard procedure in infancy.Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
