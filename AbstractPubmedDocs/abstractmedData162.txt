End points were HT, leftventricular assist device (LVAD), and death. Regression analysis was used toidentify AE risk factors.RESULTS: Fifty-three PICC AEs occurred in 35 patients (27%), consisting of 48infections, 4 thromboses, and 1 bleeding event. Median duration of PICC supportwas 63 (interquartile range [IQR] 34-131) days, and median time to first PICCinfection was 44 (IQR 14-76) days. Among PICC infections, 9% requireddefibrillator removal and 30% were inactivated on the HT list for a mean of 23 ± 17 days. Rate of HT, LVAD, or death was similar between groups (P > .05).Regression analysis found that a double lumen PICC was associated with a shorter time to first PICC infection (hazard ratio 7.59, 95% CI 1.97-29.23; P = .003).Median cost per PICC infection was $10,704 (IQR $7,401-$26,083).CONCLUSIONS: PICC infections were the most frequent AEs. PICCs with >1 lumen wereassociated with increased risk of infection. PICC AEs accounted for increasedintensive care unit admissions, HT list inactivations, and overall cost.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
