Electronic address: ssikder1@jhmi.edu.Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been increasingly used for 20 years in terminally ill patients with advanced heart failure or awaiting cardiactransplantation. Despite improvement in morbidity and mortality from use of thesedevices, quality of life may be limited by cataract. Access to cataract surgeryin this predominantly elderly population is essential but limited byunfamiliarity with these devices. We describe phacoemulsification and intraocularlens implantation in 2 patients with LVADs. The patients had extensivepreoperative cardiology evaluations and were instructed to continue warfarinthrough the day of surgery. Monitored sedation was used with fentanyl andmidazolam. Both patients experienced significant improvement in visual acuity andquality of life. Neither experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability.Cataract surgery may be safely performed in patients with LVAD support whenadequate monitoring resources are available.FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has afinancial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.Copyright Â© 2014 ASCRS and ESCRS.
