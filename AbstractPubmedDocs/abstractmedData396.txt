Epub 2013 Jul 10.The failing Fontan: what's NEXT...?Sanders DB(1), Sowell SR, Park SS, Derby C, Willis BC, Lane JE, Pierce CN, ArabiaFA, Pophal SG, Nigro JJ.Author information: (1)1Scott and Laura Eller Congenital Heart Center, St. Joseph's Hospital andMedical Center, Phoenix, AZ, USA.The Fontan procedure represents the final stage of the transition to singleventricle physiology. Conversion of very complex congenital heart anatomy, suchas hypoplastic left heart syndrome, double-outlet right ventricle or double-inletleft ventricle, to a single ventricle has grown in popularity as morbidity andmortality have improved. As these patients grow, survivors are at risk forimpaired ventricular dysfunction, plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy and late failure. Late failing Fontan patients represent a particularly vexingscenario for clinicians, as the only durable treatment option is cardiactransplantation. However, in the short-term, some of these patients requiresupport beyond medical management, with mechanical circulatory support viaextracorporeal life support or a ventricular assist device. We report thesuccessful bridge of an adolescent female post-Fontan conversion with late severecardiac failure. The patient was initially resuscitated with extracorporeal life support, transitioned to a single Berlin Heart EXCORÂ® ventricular assist deviceand, subsequently, underwent successful cardiac transplantation.
