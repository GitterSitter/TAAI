We determined the effect of renalfunction on outcomes after continuous flow LVAD implantation.METHODS: Eighty-six patients with advanced heart failure undergoing continuousflow LVAD implantation as bridge to transplantation from November 1998 to July2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Renal function was assessed using theModification of Diet in Renal Disease study-derived glomerular filtration rates(GFR [mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)]). Patients were categorized into two groupsbased on pre-LVAD GFR: those with normal renal function (GFR > 60, n = 46), andthose with renal dysfunction (GFR < 60, n = 40).RESULTS: Post-LVAD survival at 1, 3, and 6 months for GFR greater than 60 was91.3%, 79.9%, 72.6%, respectively, and for GFR less than 60, it was 92.5%, 66.5%,47.9%, respectively (p = 0.038). Bridge-to-transplant rate was lower for GFR lessthan 60 than for GFR greater than 60 (40.0% versus 63.0%, p = 0.033). For GFRless than 60, GFR improved on LVAD support: implant to month 6, 41.7 +/- 11.5 to 62.7 +/- 25.0 (p = 0.021). Post-LVAD survival was improved in GFR less than 60patients who after LVAD implantation recovered renal function to GFR greater than60 (p < 0.001). Patients with post-LVAD renal failure had significantly lowerpost-LVAD survival regardless of pre-LVAD renal function (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with renal dysfunction have poorer outcomes aftercontinuous flow LVAD implantation. However, renal function improves after LVADimplantation and is associated with improved survival. Our data underscore theimportance of end-organ function in patient selection for LVAD therapy.
