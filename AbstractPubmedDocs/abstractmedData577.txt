SALES@ccf.orgEnd-stage heart failure represents a highly morbid condition for the patient withlimited treatment options. From a surgical perspective, the treatment options foreffective long-term survival are usually limited to heart transplantation,heart-lung transplantation or implantation of a destination mechanicalcirculatory support device. Assuming an advanced heart-failure patient is indeed deemed a candidate for transplantation, the patient is subject to shortages indonor organ availability and thus possible further decompensation and potentialdeath while awaiting transplantation. Various extracorporeal and implantableventricular-assist devices (VADs) may be able to provide temporary or long-termcirculatory support for many end-stage heart-failure patients but mechanicalcirculatory support options for patients requiring long-term biventricularsupport remain limited. Implantation of a total artificial heart (TAH) currently represents one, if not the best, long-term surgical treatment option for patientsrequiring biventricular mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplant.The clinical applicability of available versions of positive displacement pumpsis limited by their size and complications. Application of continuous-flowtechnology can help in solving some of these issues and is currently beingapplied in the research towards a new generation of smaller and more effectiveTAHs. In this review, we discuss the history of the TAH, its development andclinical application, implications for anaesthetic management, published outcomesand the future outlook for TAHs.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
