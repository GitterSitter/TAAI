The paraaorticcounterpulsation device was implanted on the ascending aorta of three malepatients with intractable cardiogenic shock. Patients were assisted for 4 hoursand 8 and 54 days, respectively; the first patient died as a result ofnonresponding peripheral vasodilation and the other two died of septic shock. Thetwo patients who were assisted for 8 and 54 days were conscious and able tofunction in a limited manner during the mechanical assistance. Discontinuation ofthe mechanical support for a few seconds was followed by low systolic arterialpressure (30 to 60 mm Hg) and syncopal episodes. Biochemical tests and autopsyresults in these patients showed no evidence of blood cell destruction, thrombus formation, brain infarction, or other distal emboli. In conclusion, satisfactory hemodynamic effects, excellent biocompatibility, and simplicity of theimplantation procedure in these patients encourage the use of the paraaorticcounterpulsation device as a bridge to heart transplantation.
