Crit Care Nurs Clin North Am. 1993 Dec;5(4):649-59.Bridging to transplant: mechanical support for heart failure.Vargo RL.The success of cardiac transplantation is limited by the gap between the supplyand demand of donor hearts. This limitation increases the risk of patientmorbidity and mortality during the long waiting period. A variety of temporarysupport devices are in use as "bridges to transplant" to sustain cardiac functionuntil a suitable organ donor is found. A device to permanently replace thefailing heart is close to becoming a reality, as data from temporary supportdevices indicate that permanent devices are feasible. As reliability improves,the effectiveness of mechanical support may approach the survival rate of currenttransplant procedures. Successful permanent support may be an alternative totransplantation and may provide effective treatment for those patients withend-stage heart failure.
