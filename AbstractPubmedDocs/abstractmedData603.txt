Some of these patients will progress to need advanced therapies in the form of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Over the past few years,increased attention has been focused on clinical use of existing devices as well the development of pediatric-specific ventricular assist devices (VADs). As inadult populations, these devices offer unique opportunities to successfullysupport children as a bridge-to-transplant, but increasing data suggest thatbridge-to-recovery and bridge-to-destination are also viable options in selectpediatric populations. Herein, we will review existing approaches as welldescribe future potential MCS options.
