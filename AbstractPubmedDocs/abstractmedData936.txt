Left ventricular assist device support may lower it and bridgepatients to heart transplantation. The aim of the study was to investigate theoptimal parameters for treatment decisions and the time course of their potentialreversal to normal values during preoperative inotropic support.METHODS: Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance andtranspulmonary gradient were retrospectively analysed in 120 heart failurepatients with severe pulmonary hypertension (mean age 51.7 ± 1.1 years, 93.3%males) treated between 2000 and 2009 with inotropes before left ventricularassist device implantation. The population was divided into three groups:patients with mean pulmonary arterial pressure > 25 mm Hg (group A, n = 113),patients with pulmonary vascular resistance > 2.5 Wood units (WU) (group B, n =75) and patients with transpulmonary gradient > 12 mm Hg (group C, n = 55).Patients could be assigned to more than one group.RESULTS: After 24h of inotropic support, pulmonary vascular resistance decreased (4.1 ± 0.2 to 3 ± 0.1, -25%, p<0.001), as did the transpulmonary gradient (17 ±0.5 to 14 ± 0.7, -18%, p < 0.001). There was no significant decrease of meanpulmonary arterial pressure. Fifty percent of patients presented transpulmonarygradient < 12 mmHg on the 3rd day and pulmonary vascular resistance < 2.5 WU onthe 4th day. No further changes were observed in the following days. Leftventricular assist device support allowed 63 patients to be listed for hearttransplantation and 40 received transplantation. A 30-day mortality after hearttransplantation was higher in patients with fixed pulmonary hypertension, despiteinotropes, than in those with reversible hypertension in groups B and C (12.5%and 11.1% vs 0%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular resistance, but notmean pulmonary arterial pressure, are predictive parameters for successful heart transplantation in cases of severe postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. When no significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradientafter 3-4 days of pharmacological therapy is observed, mechanical circulatorysupport is the only option to bridge end-stage heart failure patients to hearttransplantation. Survival after heart transplantation is strictly related to the reversibility of pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient beforeassist implantation, but not related to mean pulmonary artery pressure.Copyright © 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
