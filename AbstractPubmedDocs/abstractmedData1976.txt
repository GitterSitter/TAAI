When is too late?Loisance DY(1), Pouillart F, Benvenuti C, Deleuze PH, Mazzucotelli JP, LeBesnerais P, Mourtada A.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Centre National de laRecherche Scientifique, Unité de Recherche Associée 1431, Hospital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.BACKGROUND: Optimal timing of implantation of a mechanical circulatory supportsystem in the treatment of acute cardiogenic shock is still unsettled. The issue has been addressed in a retrospective analysis of a group of 98 patients incardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy who were candidates for cardiactransplantation, admitted from 1987 to 1994.METHODS: The treatment included reinforced inotropic support by addition ofphosphodiesterase inhibitors to sympathomimetic agents. The patients who did not improve were immediately brought to the operating room for mechanical circulatorysupport system implantation.RESULTS: The overall survival in the group of 28 patients selected for mechanicalbridge is 50%. No predictive factors of death or multiorgan failure while on the device could be identified, suggesting a lack of contraindications to mechanical circulatory support system implantation.CONCLUSIONS: The high death rate in patients maintained on medical therapybecause of initial improvement as they are awaiting transplantation suggests the benefit of a rapid semielective implantation of an intracorporeal device.
