Nevertheless, in the same time frame, major advances havebeen observed in the technology and the clinical experience of various systems ofmechanical circulatory support (MCS), for the treatment of the most severe forms of cardiac failure. These systems are now used routinely in patients awaitingtransplantation who cannot receive a suitable donor heart, and in patients withreversible myocardial Lesions, who may recover an adequate native cardiacfunction. Eventually, in few selected cases, MCS systems will be the last majortherapy and allow a prolonged survival with a reasonable quality of Life. Thisexperience could be the ground for an important development of cardiac surgery inthe domain of chronic cardiac failure.
