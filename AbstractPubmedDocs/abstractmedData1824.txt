The aim of this study is todescribe our experience with implantation of the Thoratec ventricular assistdevice in more than 100 patients.METHODS: From March 1992 to June 1998, 114 patients (98 men and 16 women; meanage, 47.9 years) received the Thoratec ventricular assist device for a meanduration of 44.9 days. The patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 included 84 patients in whom the system was applied as a bridge-to-transplant procedure.Group 2 included 17 patients with postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock, and group 3included 13 patients with cardiogenic shock of other causes.RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of patients in group 1 survived to transplantationwith a posttransplant survival of 88%. The only independent risk factor affectingsurvival was age more than 60 years. Survivals in groups 2 and 3 were 47% and31%, respectively. Main complications in all groups were bleeding, multiple organfailure, liver failure, sepsis, and neurologic disorders.CONCLUSIONS: The Thoratec ventricular assist device has proved to be a reliabledevice for bridge to transplantation and postcardiotomy support. Further studies are required on patient selection and on patient and device management to reduce the incidence of complications in these patient populations.
