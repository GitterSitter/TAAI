Primary endpoint was a compositeof the need of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), transplantation, or death.RESULTS: Of the study cohort, 33.4% reached the primary endpoint. In detail, 19% were transplanted (the vast majority was listed "high urgent"), 8.8% died and5.6% received MCS implants. As determined by logistic regression analysis, allaforementioned biochemical parameters were independently related to the primaryendpoint. Results did not change substantially when transplanted patients werecensored. A risk score (0-5 points) was developed. Of the patients who scored 5points 89.5% reached the primary endpoint whereas of the patients with a zeroscore only 3.8% reached the primary endpoint.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that in addition to the well-known predictivevalue of disturbed sodium metabolism, derangements in calcium, phosphate, andmagnesium metabolism also predict midterm clinical outcome in end-stage heartfailure patients.
