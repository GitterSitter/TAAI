Epub 2010 Jul 23.Thrombosis of the ascending aorta during mechanical circulatory support in apatient with cardiogenic shock.Leontiadis E(1), Koertke H, Bairaktaris A, Koerfer R.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany.evanleon@yahoo.comCardiogenic shock after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is alife-threatening complication and is most often related to abrupt vessel closure.We present the case of a patient who developed cardiogenic shock after PCI andwas supported with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and the LevitronixCentriMag short-term mechanical circulatory support. He was evaluated forimplantation of a ventricular assist device as bridge-to-transplantation.Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed a massive thrombus of the aortic root and ascending aorta despite optimal anticoagulation regimen. Thepatient succumbed due to multiorgan failure.
