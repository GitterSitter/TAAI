Nihon Kyobu Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 1989 Sep;37(9):1873-9.Cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory assistance: the Texas HeartInstitute experience.Frazier OH, Nakatani T, Lammermeier DE, Igo SR.From January 1984 to September 1988, 245 heart transplants were performed at our institution. During this period, 53 staged cardiac transplant procedures wereperformed using an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), an extracorporeal centrifugalblood pump (ECBP), an intracorporal left ventricular assist device, and a totalartificial heart. Thirty-four (64%) patients underwent subsequent cardiactransplantation and 28 (53%) were discharged. Our data indicate that patients whosuffer rapid onset of heart failure and undergo early circulatory support aresuitable candidates for successful staged cardiac transplantation. We have alsoused mechanical support to treat severe heart failure after transplantation,using IABP and ECBP support, as well as an intraarterial axial flow pump. Inimmunosuppressed patients, infection is the critical issue affecting outcome.There is a need for development of smaller, simpler, less invasive devices withthe capacity to provide both systemic and pulmonary circulatory support.
