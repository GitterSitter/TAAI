The device has undergone significant evolution since its first implantation in 1984. This device provides a safe, and effective "bridge"to transplantation in select candidates. The world-wide experience as well as theexperience at the University of Pittsburgh Health System with this device arediscussed in this paper. The exciting results provide ample evidence for thepotential use of this device as an "alternative" to transplantation, or"alternative" to medical therapy in the near future.
