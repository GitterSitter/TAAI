Box 20345,Houston, TX 77225-0345, USA. knowlin@heart.thi.tmc.eduIn the 1960s, when LVADs and TAHs were introduced into clinical use, researchers estimated that, with this technology, the problem of heart failure could besolved within 20 years. Unfortunately, the evolution of these devices has takenmuch longer than anticipated. Nevertheless, significant advances have beenachieved in both cardiac assistance and replacement, and today's cardiac surgeonshave a wide range of devices from which to choose (Table 4). This progress haslargely been due to the support of the NHLBI, especially the Devices andTechnology Division headed by John Watson, and of the devoted commitment of theinvestigators. Because of the long-term commitment required for both basic andclinical research, commercial medical technology companies are unable to assumethis burden. Advances in mechanical circulatory support and replacement havebenefited numerous patients worldwide who would otherwise have died of heartfailure, and devices now exist for use as bridges to recovery, bridges totransplant, and destination therapy. The current challenge is to refine what wehave and to apply these technologies to broader patient populations with maximal safety and at a reasonable cost.
