We sought to describe the detailed effects of DLIs overtime in patients with continuous-flow VADs, including the onset, risk factors,organisms involved, association with invasive infections, and outcomes.METHODS: We reviewed data for patients with HeartMate II VADs (HMII) who wereimplanted at the Cleveland Clinic from October 2004 to September 2011 andfollowed through December 2011. DLIs were defined according to publishedcriteria.RESULTS: DLIs developed in 45 of 194 HMII VADs over a median period of 232 days(range 22 to 883 days). Hazard for DLI was 2.0%/month, but transiently peaked at 11%/month at 7.5 months after implant. Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 31%, 42% and 55% of initial, final and deep DLIs, respectively. Of the 40 superficial DLIs, 13 (32.5%) became deep. DLI-associated bacteremia and hospitalizationoccurred in 14 of 45 (31%) and 30 of 45 (67%), respectively. All patientsreceived antibiotics (median 171 days), but only 3 of 44 (6.8%) developed anantibiotic complication. DLIs increased the risk for death while on VAD support(HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.05; p = 0.01). Six and 12 months after DLI, mortality was 9.8% and 31%, but the competing event of transplantation occurredsuccessfully in 20% and 28%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Most DLIs begin superficially with peak hazard at 7.5 months afterimplant. Depth of infection and infecting organism may evolve over months onsupport, with Pseudomonas becoming more prominent. Although effectively managedfor prolonged periods, DLIs are associated with reduced survival on VAD support. Earlier transplantation is the most successful approach to treatment.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
