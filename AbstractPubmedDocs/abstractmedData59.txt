Hemodynamic,clinical, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic variables poorly discriminatepatients at risk of RVF. We examined the utility of 3-dimensionalechocardiography (3DE) right ventricular (RV) volumetric assessment to identifypatients at risk for RVF.METHODS AND RESULTS: RVF was defined as the need for inotropic infusion for >14days after LVAD surgery or the need for biventricular assist device support.Preoperative RV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were measured, blinded toclinical data, from transthoracic 3DE full volume data sets in 26 patients.Baseline variables and 3DE RV indices were compared between patients with andwithout RVF. Twenty-four patients received continuous-flow LVADs, and 2 required biventricular support devices. Ten patients required prolonged inotropes afterLVAD placement. Baseline characteristics associated with RVF included higherright atrial pressure, higher right atrial pressure to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio, and lower cardiac index and RV stroke work index (RVSWI).Echocardiographic indices associated with RVF included 3DE indexed RVend-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDVI and RVESVI) and RV ejectionfraction (RVEF). The relationship between 3DE quantification of RV volumes andthe development of RVF was independent from RVSWI: RVEDVI: odds ratio (OR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.33 (P = .04); RVESVI: OR 1.14, 95% CI1.01-1.28 (P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 3DE is a promising method for pre-LVAD RV assessment.RV volumes assessed by 3DE are predictive of RVF in LVAD recipients independentlyfrom hemodynamic correlates of RV function.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
