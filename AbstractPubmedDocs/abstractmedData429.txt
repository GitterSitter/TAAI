Ventricular assist devices (VADs) foradults have evolved dramatically over the last decade, both as a bridge totransplantation and for permanent support. In contrast, VADs designed forchildren, especially for all age groups, are still in their infancy. The MedosHIA and the Berlin Heart Excor are specially designed for children with a bodysurface area <1.2 m2. Increased experience with existing paediatric VADs and the introduction of third-generation VADs for the paediatric age group offer newpossibilities for children suffering from end-stage heart failure. We review the literature on this topic, summarise the indications and contraindications forlong-term support VADs and describe the decision-making algorithm used at ourinstitution for use of long-term VADs in children.
