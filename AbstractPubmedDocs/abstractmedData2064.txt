ASAIO J. 1992 Jul-Sep;38(3):M627-30.Non-pulsatile circulatory support in 90 cases.Moore CH(1), Dailey JW, Canon DS, Rubin JM.Author information: (1)Humana Heart Institute, San Antonio, Texas.Survival after cardiac arrest is reportably less than 10%; after cardiogenicshock it is less than 50%; and in failure to wean post-cardiotomy (even withcentrifugal pumps in several large series) it is only 11-21%. The authors'experience with non-pulsatile circulatory support in 90 consecutive cases from1986-91 has shown improved survival. The emergent cardiopulmonary bypass system(CPS) was used in 67 of the 90 patients, with 65 patients resuscitated, 34 (51%) weaned, and 19 (28%) transferred to other cardiovascular support therapies. Ofthe patients weaned or transferred, 34 (51%) survived > 24 hr, and 21 (31%)survived > 30 days. In the current series, 108 major cardiovascular procedureswere done during or after CPS implementation. An in-house trained nursing teamworking with surgeons and perfusionists contributed to early implementation ofthe CPS and the subsequent improved survival. The BioMedicus centrifugal pump(VAD) was used predominantly for post-cardiotomy failure to wean in 16 patientsand as a bridge to transplant in 7 patients. Fourteen patients (61%) were weaned or transplanted. Of these 14 patients, 11 (48%) survived > 30 days. Non-pulsatilecirculatory support devices are relatively inexpensive and available to mosthospitals. With careful patient selection and early implementation, one canexpect survival of 37% of patients who would otherwise not survive.
