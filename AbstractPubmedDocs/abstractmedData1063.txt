Newer second generation of nonpulsatile VADs shows less of such limitations.RECENT FINDINGS: As bridge to transplantation, we have seen a switch frompulsatile volume-displacement devices, like the HeartMate XVE LVAS and Novacorleft ventricular assist device (LVAD), (first generation) to continuous flowdevices like the HeartMate 2 and Berlin Heart Incor (second generation). Thesedevices are smaller, quiet and mechanically more durable. Better long-termsurvival, lower infection rates, excellent mechanical durability and acceptablequality of life together with shortage of donor organs led also to an increasing usage of these devices as alternative to transplantation. Recent studies show in this respect encouraging results, with actuarial survival rates at 1 and 2 years of 70% or higher. Another result of long-term cardiac support is a bridge torecovery. Initial results of even smaller implantable centrifugal pumps like the HeartWare VAD are promising.SUMMARY: An overview of recent developments in mechanical circulatory support is presented.
