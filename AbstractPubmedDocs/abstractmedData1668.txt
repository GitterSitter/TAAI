Of the 24 transplanted, nine haddilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction,giant cell myocarditis and previous Fontan procedure (group I, n = 13). Theothers had postcardiotomy shock (group II, n = 11); seven were transferred to ourcenter after device implantation. Age ranged from 8 to 67 years. Ten (77%)patients in group I were implanted without cardiopulmonary bypass. The meanduration of support was 6.7 (2-24) d. Twelve patients were extubated beforetransplantation and 13 (five in group I, eight in group II) received nonstandard donor organs. Survival to discharge and 1-year actuarial survival was 85 and 77% for group I and 73 and 64% for group II, respectively. Patients with post-implantserum bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dL had a tendency to expire from multiple systemicorgan failure. Patients not ventilator-dependent at the time of transplant hadthe best outcomes. Short-term bridge to transplantation using the BVS 5000 isfeasible in selected patients. Caution is recommended when directing suchpatients to transplant if they need ventilator support and have high serumbilirubin levels.
