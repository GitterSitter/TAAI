The intravenous administration of enoximone in thesepatients, in addition to previous inotropic support, should permit a 'buying oftime' strategy, leading to a reduction in the need for complex, invasive andcostly techniques, such as artificial hearts. In addition, it should permitimproved selection of candidates for cardiac transplantation. A prospective studywas started in 1985 to obtain data on the haemodynamic and clinical efficacy ofintravenous enoximone in these critically ill patients, and to determine the timegained for evaluation of the need for urgent transplantation. Cardiac index rose from 1.82 +/- 0.26 litres/minute/m2 to 2.67 +/- 0.56 litres/minute/m2 after 30minutes, while pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 29.9 +/- 7 mm Hgto 18.0 +/- 7 mm Hg (n = 30). This early beneficial effect waned progressivelyafter 6 hours. Prior to the next intravenous infusion at 8 hours, cardiac indexwas 2.07 +/- 0.53 litres/minute/m2 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 25 +/- 8.5 mm Hg. Only four patients could not wait for a biological graft and hadto be implanted with a complete artificial heart (3 patients), or a ventricularassist device (1 patient). In all, 30 patients improved and their increasedsurvival allowed a re-evaluation for cardiac transplantation itself; 13 wererapidly (1.7 days; range 0.5-5) confirmed as good candidates. As a whole, thisstrategy compares favourably with the results of a strategy based on mechanicalbridging alone.
