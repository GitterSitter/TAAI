In this study, 187 outpatients with HF referred to the DukeMedical Center for consideration of advanced HF therapies were retrospectivelyevaluated. All patients had undergone right-sided cardiac catheterization andcardiopulmonary exercise testing; the median cardiac index (CI) was 2.0 L/min/m2 (interquartile range 1.7 to 2.3), and the median peak oxygen consumption was 11.3ml/kg/min (interquartile range 9.2 to 13.8). Despite aggressive medical therapy, medical management had failed in 97 patients (52%) at 18 months, defined as left ventricular assist device implantation, cardiac transplantation, or death. After multivariate adjustment, factors associated with failure of optimal medicalmanagement included percentage achieved of predicted peak oxygen consumption, lowCI (i.e., <2 L/min/m2), left ventricular size, and exercise time. Patients withdiscordant findings on right-sided cardiac catheterization and cardiopulmonaryexercise testing were common, occurring in 88 patients (47%). The most commonprofile was preserved CI but reduced functional capacity, and these patientsremained at high risk for requiring advanced therapies, whereas patients withreduced CIs but preserved exercise capacity were uncommon. In conclusion, low CI was independently associated with higher rates of death, transplantation, andleft ventricular assist device implantation in this study. Also, patients withpreserved CIs at rest but poor functional capacity, so-called cardiacinsufficiency, were commonly encountered and had poor outcomes with medicalmanagement.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.
