We evaluated the surgical and long-term outcomes ofpatients with isolated RV failure that required right ventricular assist device(RVAD) support.METHODS: Between 1991 and 2002, a total of 30 patients received RVAD support for isolated RV dysfunction. We evaluated survival, duration of mechanical support,post-RVAD hemodynamics, and RV function.RESULTS: Right ventricular failure developed in patients after coronary arterybypass surgery alone or combined with valve surgery (12 patients), valvularsurgery (5), ascending aortic replacement (6), heart transplantation (3), andpulmonary endarterectomy (4). Mean age was 58 +/- 15 years, and 17 (57%) werewomen. Surgery was emergent in 5 (73%) patients. Centrifugal pumps were used in21, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation in 8, and as Abiomed pump in 1 patient. Overall, 17 (57%) patients died while receiving assist device support, 3 ofsepsis, 2 of stroke, and 12 of inability to wean from the device. We successfullyweaned RVAD support in 13 (43%) patients, with a median duration of support of 5 days (range, 2-8 days). Ten survived to hospital discharge. After RVAD removal,mean pulmonary artery pressure was 25.1 +/- 6.5 mmHg, cardiac output was 4.8 +/- 2.0 liters, and central venous pressure was 16.5 +/- 3.7 mmHg. Echocardiogramafter RVAD removal showed normal RV function in 2 patients and in 11 patientsdemonstrated improvement.CONCLUSION: After cardiotomy, patients with RV failure who require mechanicalsupport continue to have increased mortality. For patients successfully weanedfrom the RVAD, residual RV dysfunction is compatible with survival. More liberal use of RV mechanical support may be indicated for patients with acute RV failure.
