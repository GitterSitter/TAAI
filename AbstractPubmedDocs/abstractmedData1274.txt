When such organsfail, a ventricular assist device may salvage the patient waiting for eitherrecovery or for retransplantation. We describe a series of 12 patients whorequired circulatory support following orthotopic heart transplantation, with theuse of four different devices. Four patients survived. The aim of this study isto define: (1) what is the best timing for implantation; (2) which is the bestventricular assist device in this indication; and (3) a subgroup of acute rightheart failure with a specific outcome.
