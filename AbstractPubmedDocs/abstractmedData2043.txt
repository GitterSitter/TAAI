Ann Thorac Surg. 1993 Apr;55(4):876-82.High-risk cardiac operation: a viable alternative to heart transplantation.Johnson MR(1), Costanzo-Nordin MR, Heroux AL, Kao WG, Mullen GM, Pifarr√© R,Sullivan HJ.Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Loyola University of Chicago, Maywood, Illinois 60153.To determine if high-risk heart operation with circulatory support standby is an acceptable alternative to direct heart transplantation, we reviewed 21 patientswho were accepted as heart transplant candidates but offered a heart operationbecause of the availability of circulatory support. Preoperative left ventricularejection fraction was 0.25 +/- 0.08 (mean +/- standard deviation), and New YorkHeart Association functional class was 3.4 +/- 0.7. The patients underwent 16bypass graft operations, 4 mitral and 2 aortic valve replacements, and 4defibrillator implantations (combined procedures in 5 patients). An intraaorticballoon pump was placed in 12 patients. One patient required biventricular assistdevice support but was weaned in 11 days. Twenty patients were discharged 14.8+/- 11.5 days postoperatively. One patient died 15 days postoperatively ofamiodarone-induced respiratory failure, and 1 died suddenly 2 monthspostoperatively. At 10.5 +/- 6 months postoperatively, 19 patients (90%) arealive. Mean functional class is 1.9 +/- 0.9. None of the patients has undergonetransplantation, but 2 are awaiting donor organs. We conclude that in selectedheart transplant candidates high-risk heart operation is a viable alternative to direct heart transplantation.
