Am Heart J. 1995 Jan;129(1):173-7.Selection criteria for placement of left ventricular assist devices.Oz MC(1), Rose EA, Levin HR.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiac Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, ColumbiaUniversity, New York, NY.The 2,000 heart donors available annually continue to be inadequate for the50,000 patients with end-stage congestive heart failure who require hearttransplantation to survive. This discrepancy has led to the successful use oflong-term implantable LVADs as a bridge to transplantation and has raised theissue of permanent device implantation in lieu of transplantation. The recentsupport by Food and Drug Administration medical advisory panel for widespreadrelease of an implantable, long-term LVAD as a bridge to transplantation makesmore widespread of the devices likely and mandates improved clinician awarenessof the benefits and limitations of this new technology. We outline ourindications and contraindications for insertion of implantable LVADs based on our4-year clinical experience with 29 patients.
