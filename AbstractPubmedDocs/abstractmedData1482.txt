J Heart Lung Transplant. 2005 Mar;24(3):350-4.Left ventricular apical infection and rupture complicating left ventricularassist device explantation in 2 women with postpartum cardiomyopathy.Kotschet E(1), Aggarwal A, Esmore D, Kaye D.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Department, Royal Jubilee Hospital, Victoria, Canada.ekotschet@yahoo.caPostpartum cardiomyopathy is rare form of cardiac failure, with the potential forcardiac function to recover to normal. When medical therapy fails to controlsymptoms or haemodynamic stability, circulatory support with a ventricular assistdevice may be considered as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. We describe 2patients with severe postpartum cardiomyopathy, in whom cardiac functionrecovered sufficiently during mechanical circulatory assistance to enable device explantation. Bacteremia during device support was treated with chronicsuppressive antibiotics, yet after cannula explantation and ventricular repair,residual infection led to destruction of the primary repair, with formation of a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm. This is a complication of device support notpreviously reported. Surgery was necessary to repair the infected ventricularcannula site. Both patients recovered; however one patient developed recurrentcardiomyopathy 4 months later.
