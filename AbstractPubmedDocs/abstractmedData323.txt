Although availability of heartdonor for transplantation has declined over the past several years, innovationsin ventricular assist device (VAD) technology has provided an alternativetherapeutic option for patients with advanced heart failure. Initiated as amechanical option to "bridge" critically ill patients awaiting transplantation,VADs are being increasingly deployed as "destination" devices to providelong-term support. With technical advances resulting in improved mechanicalreliability, reduced postoperative morbidity and greater likelihood of patientacceptance, there is interest in expanding the applicability of VAD beyond thecurrent indication, as destination therapy for severely ill patients who are not candidates for transplant. This review examines the rational as well as thetechnical details of the different generation of VADs for mechanical cardiacsupport, implanted either surgical or percutaneously. These devices are atvarious stages of development and clinical investigation. One or more of thesenewer devices is likely to emerge as an important development in the treatment ofpatients with advanced heart failure.
