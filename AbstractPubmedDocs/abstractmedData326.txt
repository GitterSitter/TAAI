We evaluated the feasibility of low-molecular-weight heparin(LMWH) for initiation of anti-coagulation and transitioning to oralanti-coagulation after LVAD implantation.METHODS: This single-center study included 78 consecutive patients who underwent either Thoratec HeartMate II LVAD (n = 27) or HeartWare ventricular assist device(HVAD, n = 51) implantation. The LMWHs enoxaparin (n = 50) and dalteparin (n =28) were used. LMWH was started within 24 hours post-operatively in 79.5% ofpatients. No anti-coagulation was given before starting LMWH therapy. LMWHactivity was monitored by determination of anti-factor Xa levels in plasma.RESULTS: The majority of patients (80.7%) had peak anti-Xa activity within thedefined range of efficacy of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/ml by the second day of treatment.Mean effective peak anti-Xa activity was 0.28 ± 0.06 IU/ml. Mean duration ofanti-coagulation with LMWH was 25.8 ± 18 days. Ischemic strokes were observed in 3 patients (3.8%), with a total of 4 events. Three events occurred while on LMWH,and 1 event occurred during follow-up on oral anti-coagulation. There was 1 fatalstroke. No pump thrombus was observed. Major bleeding was observed in 5 patients (6.4%), with a total of 6 events. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most commoncomplication (n = 3). There were no fatal bleeding events.CONCLUSIONS: LMWH in the setting of LVAD shows rapid and constant biologicefficacy. Anti-coagulation with LMWH appears feasible after LVAD implantation.These findings support further evaluation of LMWH as an alternative tounfractionated heparin in this patient cohort.© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published byInternational Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.
