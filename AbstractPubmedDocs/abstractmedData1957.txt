The patients' mean age was 46 years (range, 22 to 64years); 17 had idiopathic and 14 had ischemic cardiomyopathy. Data (anatomic,physiologic, hemodynamic, histologic, and biochemical) were collected at the timeof HeartMate implantation, during support with the device temporarily off, and atthe time of device explantation.RESULTS: Routine chest roentgenogram showed improvement in cardiothoracic ratio(0.62 +/- 0.04 to 0.55 +/- 0.03; p < 0.0001). Echocardiography performed with thepump off showed a significant decrease in left ventricular end-diastolicdimension (6.81 +/- 0.87 cm to 5.39 +/- 1.08 cm; p < 0.0005) and a significantimprovement in ejection fraction (0.11 +/- 0.05 to 0.22 +/- 0.17; p < 0.02).Cardiac index increased (1.96 +/- 0.52 L.min-1.m-2 to 2.93 +/- 0.73 L.min-1.m-2; p < 0.0001), mean aortic pressure increased (71.40 +/- 10.63 mm Hg to 76.33 +/-16.84 mm Hg; p = 0.48), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased (24.18 +/-6.27 mm Hg to 14.48 +/- 3.01 mm Hg; p < 0.0001), and pulmonary vascularresistance decreased (3.34 +/- 2.00 Wood units to 2.51 +/- 0.88 Wood units; p <0.05). Comparisons of tissue samples taken at the time of implantation and at thetime of transplantation showed a marked reduction in myocytolysis. Calciumuptake, calcium-binding rates, and lipid levels normalized in patients studied.Plasma norepinephrine levels decreased to near normal levels.CONCLUSION: Prospective studies are now indicated to determine whether deviceremoval without transplantation may be beneficial in selected patients.
