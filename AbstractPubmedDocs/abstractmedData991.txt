Epub 2010Feb 19.Patient selection for left ventricular assist devices.Lund LH(1), Matthews J, Aaronson K.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, Section for Heart Failure, Karolinska UniversityHospital, N305 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. lars.lund@alumni.duke.eduHeart transplantation (HTx) improves symptoms and prolongs life in advanced heartfailure (HF), but organ supply is limited. In recent years, mechanicalcirculatory support and specifically implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have undergone technical improvements, and outcomes have improveddramatically. Left ventricular assist devices are now viable options for patientswith severe HF as bridge to transplantation, destination therapy, or as bridge torecovery. Many believe that LVADs may soon provide outcomes similar to, or betterthan, HTx, launching a new era of end-stage HF management. The key to improvingoutcomes is patient selection, but the field is changing rapidly and guidelinesand consensus are limited. This review summarizes recent reports of predictors ofpoor outcomes and provides an overview of selection for LVAD therapy.
