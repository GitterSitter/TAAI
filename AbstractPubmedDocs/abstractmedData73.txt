From its firstutilization, several implantation techniques have been elaborated, starting from a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support and moving towards a minimally invasive access with an off-pump strategy. Here we present thefavored surgical technique used in our department to implant the Jarvik-2000, in a step-by-step fashion.PMCID: PMC4229469
