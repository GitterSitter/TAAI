We compared our data to 40 healthy controlsand examined if MCS by either ventricular assist devices or total artificialhearts has an impact on plasma concentrations of remodeling biomarkers.METHODS & RESULTS: Plasma biomarkers were analysed pre and 30 days postimplantation of a MCS device using commercially available enzyme linkedimmunosorbent assays (ELISA). We observed that the plasma concentrations ofremodeling biomarkers: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), tenascin C (TNC), galectin 3 (LGALS3), osteopontin (OPN) and of neurohumoral biomarkerbrain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are significantly elevated in patients withterminal heart failure compared to healthy controls. We did not find elevatedplasma concentrations for matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and procollagen IC-terminal peptide (PCIP). However, only BNP plasma levels were reduced by MCS,whereas the concentrations of remodeling biomarkers remained elevated or evenincreased further 30 days after MCS. LGALS3 plasma concentrations at deviceimplantation were significantly higher in patients who did not survive MCS due tomulti organ failure (MOF).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that mechanical unloading in endstage heartfailure is not reflected by a rapid reduction of remodeling plasma biomarkers.
