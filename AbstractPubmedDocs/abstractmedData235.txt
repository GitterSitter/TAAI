The UnitedKingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton,CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed tocompare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program.METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Basewere analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomeswere time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences ofHT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistateeconomic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was fromthe NHS, discount rates were 3.5%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years(QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB£) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs HMII.RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulativeincidence of HT was low for both groups (11% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued4.99 lifetime QALYs costing £258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84QALYs costing £231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for HWvs HM II were £23,530 ($37,349) and £20,799 ($33,014), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a betterclinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was morecost-effective. This result needs to be reassessed in a randomized controlledtrial comparing the 2 devices.Crown Copyright © 2014. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
