Epub 2014 Jan 21.Recent advances in computational methodology for simulation of mechanicalcirculatory assist devices.Marsden AL(1), Bazilevs Y, Long CC, Behr M.Author information: (1)Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of CaliforniaSan Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.Ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide mechanical circulatory support tooffload the work of one or both ventricles during heart failure. They are used inthe clinical setting as destination therapy, as bridge to transplant, or morerecently as bridge to recovery to allow for myocardial remodeling. Recentdevelopments in computational simulation allow for detailed assessment of VADhemodynamics for device design and optimization for both children and adults.Here, we provide a focused review of the recent literature on finite elementmethods and optimization for VAD simulations. As VAD designs typically fall into two categories, pulsatile and continuous flow devices, we separately addresscomputational challenges of both types of designs, and the interaction with thecirculatory system with three representative case studies. In particular, wefocus on recent advancements in finite element methodology that have increasedthe fidelity of VAD simulations. We outline key challenges, which extend to theincorporation of biological response such as thrombosis and hemolysis, as well asshape optimization methods and challenges in computational methodology.Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.PMCID: PMC3947342
