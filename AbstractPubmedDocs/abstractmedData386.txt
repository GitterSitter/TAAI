Accordingly, the role of implantablecardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in this patient population remains undefined.METHODS AND RESULTS: Records of 106 consecutive patients undergoing implantation of the HeartMate II LVAD at a single center were reviewed. For patients surviving>30 days postimplant (98 patients), the impact of VAs and ICDs on survival wasanalyzed. Mean age was 56.6Â±11.4 years, 82.1% were male, 42.5% had an ischemiccardiomyopathy, 87.7% were bridge to transplantation, and median length ofsupport was 217 days. Twenty-one (19.8%) patients died, 60 (56.6%) survived totransplantation, and 25 patients (23.6%) reached the end of study, had the LVADexplanted, or were lost to follow-up. Post-LVAD VAs occurred in 37 patients(34.9%) but were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.58[0.18-1.90]). Sixty-two (63.3%) patients had an active ICD, and 36 (36.7%)patients had no ICD or an inactivated ICD post-LVAD. Patients with an ICD weremore likely to be INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically AssistedCirculatory Support) level 3 or 4 at the time of implant (54.8% versus 33.3%;P=0.04). An appropriate shock was delivered in 27.3% of patients, but thepresence of an active ICD was not associated with improved survival (hazardratio, 1.12 [0.37-3.35]).CONCLUSIONS: VAs are common in patients with continuous flow LVADs. Although someepisodes may be clinically significant, VAs are not associated with a worseprognosis, and concomitant ICDs in these patients may not reduce mortality.
