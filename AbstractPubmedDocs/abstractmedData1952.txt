ASAIO J. 1996 Sep-Oct;42(5):M735-8.Mechanical circulatory support for post cardiotomy cardiogenic shock in infants.Ishino K(1), Alexi-Meskishvili V, Weng Y, Loebe M, Uhlemann F, Lange PE, HetzerR.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, German Heart InstituteBerlin, Germany.Eleven infants weighing 2.3 to 7.8 kg underwent mechanical circulatory supportfor post cardiotomy cardiogenic shock. Initiated pre-operatively in two patients,extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in a total of eight patients aged 6 days to 3 months in association with repair of cyanotic congenital heart disease with increased pulmonary blood flow or with a right sided obstructive lesion.Ventricular assist devices were used in three other patients: a centrifugal left ventricular assist device in Patient 1 (10 months, 5.7 kg) after repair of theanomalous left coronary artery, and a pneumatic biventricular assist device(stroke volume 12 ml) in Patient 2 (6 months, 7.0 kg) for cardiac arrest afterclosure of ventricular septal defect and in Patient 3 (10 months, 7.8 kg) forpost transplant graft failure. Duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenationduration ranged from 26 to 192 hr (mean, 88 hr). Three patients were weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and two survived. Two others were separatedfrom extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of bleeding, but bothsubsequently died. Patient 1 was weaned from the left ventricular assist deviceafter 192 hr and discharged from the hospital. Support was discontinued after 45 hr in Patient 2 who exhibited irreversible brain damage. Patient 3 was weanedfrom a biventricular assist device after 174 hr, but suffered recurrent graftfailure. Our results show that an appropriate circulatory support system shouldbe selected according to the cardiac anatomy in infants.
