Am J Transplant. 2002 Jul;2(6):539-45.Recent trends in early outcome of adult patients after heart transplantation: asingle-institution review of 251 transplants using standard donor organs.Tsai FC(1), Marelli D, Bresson J, Gjertson D, Kermani R, Ardehali A, Esmailian F,Hamilton M, Fonarow GC, Moriguchi J, Plunkett M, Hage A, Tran J, Kobashigawa JA, Laks H.Author information: (1)Heart Transplant Program, University of California, Los Angeles, Center forHealth Sciences, 90095-1741, USA.Older age, prior transplantation, pulmonary hypertension, and mechanical support are commonly seen in current potential cardiac transplant recipients. Transplantsin 436 consecutive adult patients from 1994 to 1999 were reviewed. There were 251using standard donors in 243 patients (age range 18-69 years). To emphasizerecipient risk, 185 patients who received a nonstandard donor were excluded from analysis. The indications for transplant were ischemic heart disease (n = 123,47%), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 82, 32%), and others (n=56, 21%). One hundredand forty-nine (57%) recipients were listed as status I; 5 and 6% were supported with an intra-aortic balloon and an assist device, respectively. The 30-dsurvival and survival to discharge were 94.7 and 92.7%, respectively; 1-yearsurvival was 89.1%. Causes of early death were graft failure (n = 6), infection(n = 4), stroke (n = 4), multiorgan failure (n = 3) and rejection (n = 2).Predictors were balloon pump use alone (OR= 11.4, p =0.002), pulmonary vascularresistance > 4 Wood units (OR = 5.7, p = 0.007), pretransplant creatinine > 2.0mg/dL (OR = 6.9, p = 0.004) and female donor (OR = 8.3, p = 0.002). Recipient ageand previous surgery did not affect short-term survival. Heart transplantation inthe current era consistently offers excellent early and 1-year survival forwell-selected recipients receiving standard donors. Early mortality tends toreflect graft failure while hospital mortality may be more indicative ofrecipient selection.
