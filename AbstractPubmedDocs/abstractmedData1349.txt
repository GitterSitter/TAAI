Congest Heart Fail. 2006 Sep-Oct;12(5):250-3.Brain natriuretic peptide levels and response to cardiac resynchronizationtherapy in heart failure patients.Delgado RM(1), Palanichamy N, Radovancevic R, Vrtovec B, Radovancevic B.Author information: (1)Center for Cardiac Support, Texas Heart Institute at St Luke's EpiscopalHospital, Houston, TX 77225-0345, USA.Erratum in    Congest Heart Fail. 2006 Nov-Dec;12(6):342. Vrtotec, Bojan [corrected to Vrtovec,Bojan].The authors used brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a reliable marker to identifynonresponders to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients withadvanced heart failure. The study included 70 patients with left ventriculardysfunction (mean ejection fraction, 21+/-4%) and left bundle branch block (QRSduration, 164+/-25 milliseconds) treated with CRT. The authors reviewed data onNew York Heart Association functional class, baseline ejection fraction, sodium, creatinine, QRS duration, and BNP levels 3 months before and after CRT therapy.The authors compared results of 42 patients who survived (973+/-192 days) afterCRT implantation (responders) to those of 28 patients (nonresponders) who either expired (n=21) or underwent heart transplantation (n=5) or left ventricularassist device implantation (n=2) after an average of 371+/-220 days. Mean BNPlevels after 3 months of CRT decreased in responders from 758+/-611 pg/mL to479+/-451 pg/mL (P=.044), while in nonresponders there was increase in BNP levelsfrom 1191+/-466 pg/mL to 1611+/-1583; P=.046. A rise in BNP levels was associatedwith poor response (death or need for transplantation or left ventricular assist device and impaired long-term outcome), which makes it a good predictor toidentify such patients.
