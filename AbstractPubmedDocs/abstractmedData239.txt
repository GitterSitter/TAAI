Weassessed short- and long-term right heart function in 69 of these patients whounderwent tricuspid valve repair because of moderate-to-severe tricuspidregurgitation (TR) or severe dilatation of the tricuspid annulus. RVF was definedas the need for a right ventricular assist device or >30 days of intravenousinotropic support. TR was graded from 0 to 4, while fibrosis in myocardial biopsysamples was graded pathologically from 0 to 3.RESULTS: The average duration of LVAD support was 595 days. Twenty-seven patientsdeveloped RVF and their survival rate was significantly worse than that ofpatients who did not develop RVF (65 vs 91% at 1 year). RVF was significantlyrelated to high preoperative ratio of central venous pressure (CVP) to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, high total bilirubin, high fibrosis score and high TRgrade. In patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair, the TR grade wassignificantly reduced from 2.6 to 1.0, and this decrease was maintained for 2years. Although patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair had significantlyhigher TR grades, ratios of CVP to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure andfibrosis scores preoperatively, no survival impairment was seen.CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid valve repair is a useful and durable adjuvant procedurefor restoring deteriorated right ventricular function in patients requiring LVAD implantation.Â© The Author 2014.
