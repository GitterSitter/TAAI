J Card Fail. 2006 Oct;12(8):616-20.Right ventricular dysfunction and adverse outcome in patients with advanced heartfailure.Field ME(1), Solomon SD, Lewis EF, Kramer DB, Baughman KL, Stevenson LW, TedrowUB.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis Street,Boston, MA 02115, USA.BACKGROUND: In patients with heart failure (HF) from left ventricular systolicdysfunction, the presence of coexistent right ventricular (RV) dysfunction isassociated with poor exercise capacity and reduced survival. We sought todetermine whether a simple measure of RV function, the RV myocardial performance index (RV MPI), is associated with adverse outcome in a population of advancedheart failure patients selected to receive cardiac resynchronization therapy(CRT).METHODS AND RESULTS: The RV MPI was measured on 77 consecutive preimplantationechocardiograms. The relationship between RV MPI and the end point of all-causemortality, transplantation, or ventricular assist device placement was evaluated.The end point occurred in 28 patients (36%) during a median follow-up of 21months. The median RV MPI was 0.73 (interquartile range 0.51-0.89). Worse RVfunction, as demonstrated by a higher RV MPI, was seen in those patients whoreached the end point compared with those who did not (0.83 vs. 0.69, P = .004). The highest tercile of RV MPI was associated with a 3.3-fold increased risk ofpoor outcome (95% CI 1.3-8.5). Each 0.1 unit increase in RV MPI was associatedwith a 16% increased risk (95% CI 8-26). After adjusting for otherechocardiographic variables, RV MPI remained significantly associated with theoutcome.CONCLUSION: In a population of advanced HF patients selected to receive CRT, RVdysfunction, as assessed by the RV MPI, is associated with adverse outcome. Wideruse of this simple nongeometric parameter may help to identify patients for whom options for further intervention should be carefully evaluated.
