After 4 weeks, the failing hearts and right lungs wereheterotopically transplanted into the abdomen of the recipients by anastomosingtheir ascending aorta to the recipients' descending aorta in the hearttransplantation group. Two weeks after transplantation, heart weight, leftventricular weight, myocyte diameter and myocardial fibrosis were determined ,and β adrenergics receptors mRNA expression was essayed by real-time polymerasechain reaction (PCR). Seven normal Lewis rats served as control.RESULTS: The weight of the enlarged heart, left ventricular weight and myocytediameter of the failing hearts were decreased to normal after transplantation.The levels of β1- and β2- adrenergic receptors mRNA expression were significantlylowered in heart failure group compared with that of normal group(0.09 ± 0.03 vs.0.18 ± 0.04, 0.07 ± 0.06 vs. 0.12 ± 0.02, both P <0.05). The level of β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA expression in heart transplantation group (0.11 ± 0.05) rose to normal (P>0.05), but β1- adrenergic receptor mRNA expression (0.08 ±0.06) was lower in heart transplantation group than that in normal group(P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Myocardium reverse remodeling after left ventricular unloading isaccompanied by the change in cardiomyocyte in molecular level , such as thechange in β adrenergic receptors , which may involve in the improvement of heart function after being supported by left ventricular assist device.
