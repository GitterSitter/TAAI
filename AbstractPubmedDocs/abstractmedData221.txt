Twenty-three of these patients (19men and 4 women; mean age, 47 ± 16 years) had advanced hepatic dysfunction, ascharacterized by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST)levels five times normal; serum total bilirubin levels three times normal; and/ornecessity for a liver biopsy before or during device implantation. Of this group,17 patients received the LVAD as a bridge to transplantation, and six patientsreceived it for destination therapy.RESULTS: Nine of the 23 patients required either a transjugular or a core liverbiopsy during LVAD implantation. Three patients died within the firstpostoperative month; the 20 surviving patients had significant improvements intheir hepatic parameters. The ALT decreased from 238 ± 296 to 27 ± 13 U/L(p = 0.022), AST decreased from 209 ± 199 to 29 ± 8 U/L (p = 0.009), and totalbilirubin level decreased from 6.9 ± 6.0 to 0.6 ± 0.1 mg/dL (p = 0.044). Theserum albumin level increased from 3.2 ± 0.6 to 4.3 ± 0.3 g/dL (p = 0.003), andcreatinine clearance increased from 77.6 ± 35.2 to 110.2 ± 35.7 mL/min/1.73 m2(p = 0.101).CONCLUSION: Continuous-flow LVAD support may significantly improve hepaticfunction, allowing patients with poor preimplant liver function to become better candidates for heart transplantation.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
