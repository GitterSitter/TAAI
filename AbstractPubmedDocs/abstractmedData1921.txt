Both the Novacor and the vented electric HeartMate LVADs are currently being evaluated under "discharge to home" protocols forpatients awaiting heart transplantation; the results will have tremendouseconomic and quality-of-life implications. Currently available devices haveachieved a level of reliability that will allow for protocols involving deviceimplantation as an alternative to transplantation in the near future. Physicians will then have an effective therapy available for the increasing number of heart failure patients awaiting a limited number of donor hearts, as well as for those patients not considered to be candidates for transplantation by traditionalcriteria.
