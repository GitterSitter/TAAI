Eighty-five patients were implanted with the device as a bridge to transplant (BTT); the remaining (n = 43) were ondestination therapy (DT). Each group was divided into patients <65 years old and ≥65 years old at device implantation. Patients were followed up for at least 24months or until transplant or death.RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (66%) received a CF-LVAD as BTT. Patients ≥65 yearsold (n = 8) had a lower preoperative cardiac index and prothrombintime-international normalized ratio (P = 0.009), and a longer stay in theintensive care unit (P = 0.008). Adverse events including infections,re-exploration for bleeding, ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, renal failure andright heart failure were comparable in both age groups. Eighty-two percent (n =63) of the young patients and 75% (n = 6) of the older patients, who were on LVADas BTT, underwent heart transplant within the first 24 months of LVADimplantation. Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 95, 95, 77 and 70%,respectively, post-CF-LVAD implantation as BTT for the younger group and 73% for the older group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P = 0.35). Forty-three patients (34%)received a CF-LVAD as DT. Patients ≥65 years old (n = 14) on DT had a higherincidence of peripheral vascular disease (P = 0.048), higher serum sodium (P =0.004) and serum creatinine values (P = 0.002), preoperatively. There were morestrokes in the older patients post-LAVD implantation (14 vs 0%; P = 0.048).Overall survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 85, 79, 75 and 62%, respectively,for the younger group and 93, 77, 67 and 34% for the older group, respectively (P= 0.26).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that LVAD therapy can be used in the olderpatients with acceptable mortality and morbidity, and age alone should not beused as the sole criterion for exclusion from LVAD implantation.© The Author 2015.
