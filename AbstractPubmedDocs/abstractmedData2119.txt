Circulation. 1989 Nov;80(5 Pt 2):III174-82.T cells in ventricular assist device patients.Termuhlen DF(1), Pennington DG, Roodman ST, Ruzevich SA, Swartz MT, Reedy JE,McBride LR, Miller LW, Tsai CC, Kennedy DJ.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, St. Louis University Medical Center, Missouri.Levels of T lymphocytes were measured in 20 consecutive patients, 18 men and two women, supported with ventricular assist devices or an artificial heart.Indications for support were bridge to transplantation (n = 10), postcardiotomycardiogenic shock (n = 8), and acute myocardial infarction shock (n = 2). Controllevels were from healthy volunteers not undergoing cardiac operation.Preoperatively, numbers of total lymphocytes and subclasses CD3, CD4, and CD8, aswell as the interleukin-2 receptors (IL2R), were the same as controls(cells/microliters): lymphocytes, 1,940; CD3, 1,413 +/- 410; CD4, 894 +/- 318;CD8, 490 +/- 185; IL2R, 96. From implant to postoperative day 5, levels werebelow control values (p less than 0.001), reaching a nadir on postoperative day 2(lymphocytes, 896 +/- 599; CD3, 489 +/- 267; CD4, 309 +/- 207; CD8, 183 +/- 107; IL2R, 43 +/- 47). Data from 10 patients (group 1) who survived (four weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, six transplanted) were compared with those from 10patients (group 2) who died of multiorgan failure, sepsis, or both. Frompreimplant through postoperative day 6, levels did not differ between groups.However, from postoperative day 7 to the last day of ventricular support (group1, 24-90 days; group 2, 7-29 days), group 1 levels (lymphocytes, 2,364 +/- 618;CD3, 1,825 +/- 553; CD4, 1,013 +/- 187; CD8, 796 +/- 402) were significantlyabove (p less than 0.01) group 2 levels (lymphocytes, 1,290 +/- 463; CD3, 746 +/-295; CD4, 534 +/- 253; CD8, 221 +/- 106). These data indicate that lymphocytesand particularly T cells 1) decrease after ventricular assist device insertion,reaching a nadir at postoperative day 2, 2) return to control values afterpatients whose clinical status improves, and 3) remain low in severely illpatients. T-cell depression in ventricular assist device patients is related tothe severity of the patient's condition rather than the presence of the device.
