Epub 2010Dec 4.Safety and effectiveness of low dosing of double antiplatelet therapy duringlong-term left ventricular support with the INCOR system.Attisani M(1), Centofanti P, La Torre M, Campanella A, Sansone F, Rinaldi M.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiac Surgery, San Giovanni Battista Hospital, University ofTurin, C.so Bramante 88, 10127, Turin, Italy. matteoatti@libero.itAdverse events due to anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during leftventricular assistance device (LVAD) support are very common, and every effortmust be made to reduce their impact. We report our experience using a low dose ofdouble antiplatelet therapy for patients provided with the INCOR LVAD system as abridge to transplantation. Twelve patients (10 males, 35-60 years old) with acuteor end-stage heart failure were included in this study. The mean follow-up was10 months (cumulative 4.9 years). For antiplatelet therapy, we use an associationof variable doses of aspirin and clopidogrel. The use of a platelet aggregationtest (PAT) allows reducing the dose of the drugs to the minimum needed. Theprimary end point was to check the safety of the therapy, analyzing the incidenceof major and minor bleeding complications. The secondary end point was to checkthe effectiveness of the therapy, evaluating the incidence of major and minorthromboembolic events. We had three (25%) cases of early postoperativemediastinal bleeding. On the contrary, no episodes of major bleeding occurredduring the follow-up period. The rate of minor bleeding complications was low:0.2 events per patient/year. The rate of major and minor thromboembolic eventswas acceptable (respectively 0.09 and 0.2 per patient/year). During LVAD support,double antiplatelet therapy with a low dose of aspirin and clopidogrel was safeand effective. PAT allows reducing the dose of antiplatelet drugs, avoidingcomplications related to excessive or insufficient dose administration.
