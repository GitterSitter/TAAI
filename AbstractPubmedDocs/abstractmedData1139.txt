The purpose of the present study was to compare theprognostic ability of the partial pressure of Petco2 at rest to other commonlycollected resting variables in patients with systolic HF.METHODS: A total of 353 patients (mean age 58.6+/-13.7, 72% male) with systolicHF were included in this study. All patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercisetesting where New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, resting Petco2, peakoxygen consumption, and the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slopewere determined. Subjects were then followed for major cardiac events (mortality,left ventricular assist device implantation implantation, urgent hearttransplantation).RESULTS: There were 104 major cardiac events during the 23.6+/-17.0-monthtracking period. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed NYHA class (chi228.7, P<.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (residual chi2 21.7, P<.001),and resting Petco2 (residual chi2 14.1, P<.001) were all prognosticallysignificant and retained in the regression. In a separate Cox regressionanalysis, left ventricular ejection fraction (residual chi2 8.8, P=.003), NYHAclass (residual chi2 7.7, P=.005), and resting Petco2 (residual chi2 5.7, P=.02) added prognostic value to the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope (chi2 26.0, P<.001).CONCLUSION: Resting Petco2 can be noninvasively collected from subjects in ashort period, at a low cost, and with no risk or discomfort to the patient. Giventhe prognostic value demonstrated in the present study, the clinical assessmentof resting Petco2 in the HF population may be warranted.PMCID: PMC3730838
