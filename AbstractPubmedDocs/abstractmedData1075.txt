J Am Coll Cardiol. 2009 Jul 21;54(4):322-4.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the use of a continuous-flow rotaryleft ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation.BACKGROUND: LVAD therapy is an established treatment modality for patients withadvanced heart failure. Pulsatile LVADs have limitations in design precludingtheir use for extended support. Continuous-flow rotary LVADs represent aninnovative design with potential for small size and greater reliability bysimplification of the pumping mechanism.METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter study, 281 patients urgently listed(United Network of Organ Sharing status 1A or 1B) for heart transplantationunderwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD. Survival and transplantationrates were assessed at 18 months. Patients were assessed for adverse eventsthroughout the study and for quality of life, functional status, and organfunction for 6 months.RESULTS: Of 281 patients, 222 (79%) underwent transplantation, LVAD removal forcardiac recovery, or had ongoing LVAD support at 18-month follow-up. Actuarialsurvival on support was 72% (95% confidence interval: 65% to 79%) at 18 months.At 6 months, there were significant improvements in functional status and 6-minwalk test (from 0% to 83% of patients in New York Heart Association functionalclass I or II and from 13% to 89% of patients completing a 6-min walk test) andin quality of life (mean values improved 41% with Minnesota Living With HeartFailure and 75% with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaires). Major adverseevents included bleeding, stroke, right heart failure, and percutaneous leadinfection. Pump thrombosis occurred in 4 patients.CONCLUSIONS: A continuous-flow LVAD provides effective hemodynamic support for atleast 18 months in patients awaiting transplantation, with improved functionalstatus and quality of life.
