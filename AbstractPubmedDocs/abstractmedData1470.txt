High levels of iNOS expression are present in the myocardium of failing hearts, suggesting a potential role for iNOS in HFprogression.METHODS: Inducible NOS protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting andcardiomyocyte apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nickend-labeling (TUNEL) in myocardial samples from failing hearts. Included in theseanalyses were tissues from 9 patients at the time of transplantation(HF-transplant group), 10 patients at the time of VAD insertion (pre-VAD group), and 11 patients undergoing transplant after VAD support (post-VAD group). Sevencontrol samples were obtained at autopsy.RESULTS: Low or undetectable levels of iNOS were present in controls (0.005 +/-0.002). The HF-transplant and pre-VAD myocardial specimens exhibited a markedincrease in iNOS expression (1.48 +/- 0.34 and 1.29 +/- 0.26, respectively; p <0.01 for both vs. controls). The increase in iNOS expression was reversed in the post-VAD group (0.36 +/- 0.16; p < 0.01 vs. HF-transplant and pre-VAD groups).The rate of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes was high in the pre-VAD group andsignificantly lower in the post-VAD group (0.64 +/- 0.15% in pre-VAD group and0.16 +/- 0.07% in post-VAD group; p < 0.01). The iNOS levels correlatedsignificantly with cardiomyocyte apoptosis (r = 0.66, p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with VAD normalizes iNOS expression in association withdiminished cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the failing heart. Further work is requiredto define whether a causal relationship exists between iNOS and cardiomyocyteapoptosis.
