Innovative counterpulsationdevices based on the established principle of the intra-aortic balloon pump have been developed, and of these, the CardioVad and the C-Pulse System have beenintroduced in clinical practice with convincing evidence of haemodynamicefficacy. The evolution from pulsatile to continuous-flow left ventricular assistdevices has been associated with improved survival rates during the first 2Â yearsof support with the potential of matching heart transplantation outcomes.However, blood contact with the device remains a significant challenge despitethe highly sophisticated technology currently available. Innovativeextra-vascular counterpulsation devices have been shown to overcome thelimitations of the intra-aortic balloon pump and rend the device suitable forprolonged support. Monitoring of the performance of these novel devices isessential, and carotid Doppler ultrasonography is of utility in assessing thehaemodynamic performance of the devices in a clinical setting. Computationalmodelling has played a role in the simulation of these devices and shouldcontinue to assist with their optimisation and implementation in clinicalpractice.
