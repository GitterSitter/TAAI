We sought to investigate whether a similarassociation exists in patients undergoing emergency heart transplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: By means of the Spanish National Heart Transplant Registrydatabase, we identified 704 adult patients treated with emergency hearttransplantation in 15 Spanish centers between 2000 and 2009. Post-transplantoutcomes were analyzed pertaining to patient preoperative INTERMACS profiles,which were retrospectively assigned by 2 blinded cardiologists. Beforetransplantation, INTERMACS profile 1 (critical cardiogenic shock) was present in 207 patients, INTERMACS profile 2 (progressive decline) in 291, INTERMACS profile3 (inotropic dependence) in 176, and INTERMACS profile 4 (resting symptoms) waspresent in 30 patients. In-hospital postoperative mortality rates were,respectively, 43%, 26.8%, and 18% in patients with profiles 1, 2, and 3 to 4(P<0.001). INTERMACS 1 patients also presented the highest incidence of primarygraft failure (1: 31.3%, 2: 22.3%, 3-4: 21.8%; P=0.03) and postoperative need fordialysis (1: 33.2%, 2: 18.9%, 3-4: 21.5%; P<0.001). Adjusted odds-ratios forin-hospital postoperative mortality were 4.38 (95% confidence interval,2.51-7.66) for profile 1 versus 3 to 4, 2.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.56-3.97)for profile 1 versus 2, and 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.03) for profile2 versus 3 to 4. Long-term survival after hospital discharge was not influencedby preoperative INTERMACS profiles.CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative INTERMACS profiles determine outcomes after emergencyheart transplantation. Results call for a change in policies related to themanagement of heart transplant candidates presenting with INTERMACS profiles 1and 2.
