Atotal of 78 patients supported with ECMO for more than 48 h due to cardiac originwere included in this study. Patients were categorized into two groups based onthe outcomes: the poor outcome group (n = 33) consisted of for those who laterdied or were later excluded from VAD or HTx; the favorable outcome group (n = 45)consisted of those who were weaned off ECMO finally and survived or were deemedsuitable candidates for VAD or HTx. Seven risk factors were significant accordingto univariate analyses. Based on the regression coefficients of multivariateanalysis, the RFSS was developed: (lung dysfunction x 7) + (systemic infection x 3) + (peak lactate > 3 mmole/L x 3) + (kidney dysfunction x 2) + (creatine kinase> 10,000 U/L x 1). Patients with an RFSS of 7 or more were be allocated to thepoor outcome group. The RFSS was validated by another group of 30 patients withgood correlation. The RFSS provides a way to predict which ECMO-supportedpatients are suitable candidates for VAD implantation or HTx.
