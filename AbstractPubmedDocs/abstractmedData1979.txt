We report our clinical experience with the Hemopump 31or sternotomy Hemopump.METHODS: From 1992 to 1994, 15 patients received a Hemopump 31. All sufferedpostcardiotomy cardiogenic shock either after coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 14) or after heart transplantation (n = 1). Patients enrolled had refractoryheart failure despite the use of optimal inotropic support. Three groups can beidentified: group 1 (n = 2 patients), double Hemopump right and left; group 2 (n = 4), patients with delayed insertion after intraaortic balloon pump failure; andgroup 3 (n = 9 patients), immediate insertion. The average support of durationfor the survivors was 5 days.RESULTS: No mechanical failure or device-related complication was noticed. There were striking differences between groups 1 and 2 as opposed to group 3, as only 1patient survived in group 2 and none in group 1, as opposed to 5 patients ingroup 3. Overall survival is 40%. All patients were discharged from the hospital.CONCLUSIONS: Factors showing adverse effect are biventricular failure,vasoconstrictor requirement, and delayed insertion. We believe the Hemopump is a more efficient device than the intraaortic balloon pump, and that early use afteronset of heart failure achieves better results.
