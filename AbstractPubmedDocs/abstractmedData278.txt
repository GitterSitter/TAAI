Theindications and subsequent benefits of performing valvular procedures in thesepatients are unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of performing concurrent surgical valve procedures in a large cohort of patientsreceiving LVADs.METHODS: One thousand one hundred six patients received the HeartMate II (HMII)LVAD in the bridge to transplant (n = 470) and destination therapy (n = 636)clinical trials. Of these, 374 patients (34%) had concurrent cardiac surgeryprocedures as follows: 242 patients (21%) with 281 concurrent valve procedures(VP) (aortic 80, mitral 45, and tricuspid 156), and 641 patients had only HMIILVAD. The focus of this study was to determine the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing HMII + VP compared with those who received HMII alone.RESULTS: Patients undergoing HMII + VP were significantly older, had higher bloodurea nitrogen levels and central venous pressure, and decreased right ventricularstroke work index; intraoperatively, the median cardiopulmonary bypass times werealso longer. The unadjusted 30-day mortality was significantly higher in patientsundergoing HMII + VP (10.3% vs 4.8% for LVAD alone, P = .005). Subgroup analysis of individual VPs showed that higher mortality occurred in patients with HMIIplus 2 or more VPs (13.5%, P = .04) followed by trends for increased mortalitywith HMII plus mitral alone (11.5%, P = NS), HMII plus aortic alone (10.9%, P =NS), and HMII plus tricuspid (8.9%, P = NS) procedures. Of these various groups, only patients undergoing HMII + isolated aortic VP (P = .001) and HMII + multipleVPs (P = .046) had significantly worse long-term survival compared with patients undergoing HMII alone. Right heart failure and right ventricular assist deviceuse was increased in patients undergoing VPs, but there was no difference in the incidence of bleeding or stroke.CONCLUSIONS: Patients frequently require concurrent VPs at the time of LVADplacement; these patients are sicker and have higher early mortality.Furthermore, right ventricular dysfunction is increased in these patients.Further studies to develop selection criteria for concurrent valve interventions are important to further improve clinical outcomes.Copyright Â© 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
