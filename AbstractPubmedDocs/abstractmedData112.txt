Epub 2014 Sep 16.Over 1200-day support with dual Jarvik 2000 biventricular assist device.Yoshioka D(1), Toda K(2), Yoshikawa Y(2), Sawa Y(2).Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School ofMedicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan djason55@gmail.com. (2)Department of CardiovascularSurgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.We report the successful longest biventricular support using dual Jarvik 2000biventricular assist device (BVAD; Jarvik Heart, Inc., New York, NY, USA) as abridge to transplant. A 27-year old woman with arrhythmogenic right ventricularcardiomyopathy underwent implantation of two Jarvik 2000s as a left ventricularassist device and right ventricular assist device. Although several BVAD-related complications including haemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, heart failure andpulmonary valve insufficiency developed at a very late stage, she wassuccessfully bridged to heart transplantation after 1245 days of biventricularsupport, which is the longest in the literature. Despite advances incontinuous-flow ventricular assist devices, their long-term use for biventricularsupport remains limited. We report a successful case of 1245 days ofbiventricular support with dual Jarvik 2000 axial flow pumps in a patient with a small body surface area.Â© The Author 2014.
