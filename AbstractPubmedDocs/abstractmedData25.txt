[Epub ahead of print]Clinical outcomes in sensitized heart transplant patients bridged withventricular assist devices.Kidambi S(1), Mohamedali B, Bhat G.Author information: (1)Division of Advanced Heart Failure and Clinical Transplantation, AdvocateChrist Medical Center, Oak Lawn, IL, USA.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to transplant(BTT) have been known to cause allosensitization, as measured by panel-reactiveantibody (PRA) levels. The goal of this study was to measure the impact of thisallosensitization on outcomes.METHODS: Panel-reactive antibodies were analyzed in BTT patients, withsensitization defined as peak PRAs ≥ 10%. Baseline characteristics and outcomesin the two patient groups were evaluated using descriptive statistics,Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis.RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47% vs. 10%,p = 0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellularrejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized).Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection(AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meierlog-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality. Thismortality appears to be concentrated in patients with AMR, and we postulate that the development of AMR in a sensitized patient may be a predictor of mortality.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
