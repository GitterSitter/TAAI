A new pneumatic portable driver for use withthe HeartMate Implantable Pneumatic Left Ventricular Assist System.Tamez D(1), Myers TJ, Inman RW, Miller KA, Frazier OH.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Surgical Research Laboratories, Texas Heart Institute, Houston 77225-0345, USA.The HeartPak Portable Pneumatic Driver was designed for use with the HeartMateImplantable Pneumatic Left Ventricular Assist Device (IP-LVAS) (ThermoCardiosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA). The HeartPak measures 48 x 23 x 15 cm, weighs9.3 kg with batteries, and can be carried by a handle, by a shoulder strap, or ona trolley. Four 12 V batteries provide power for as long as 8 hr. To test theHeartPak in the hospital environment, seven men were studied who werebridge-to-transplant patients (mean age, 59.8 +/- 8.87 years) undergoingHeartMate IP-LVAS therapy. They were supported by the HeartPak for 429 days with a cycle count of 57,826,560. To normalize the mean pump flow rate, we used thebody surface area to obtain a pump flow index in each case. The mean flow ratewas 2.65 +/- 0.57 L/min/m2 for the HeartPak vs. 2.64 +/- 0.45 L/min/m2 for theHeartMate 1000, the conventional driver previously used in these patients. Theonly potentially serious problem with the HeartPak was console failure in onecase. The patient took appropriate backup measures, and the HeartPak wasreplaced. In no case did the device cause any adverse effects or interruption of LVAS support. Compared with HeartMate 1000, the HeartPak was more convenient,easier to operate, and allowed better patient mobility.
