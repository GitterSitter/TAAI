Epub 2015 Mar 26.Is a Bioprosthetic Valve in the Aortic Position Desirable with a Continuous Flow LVAD?Doi A(1), Marasco SF, McGiffin DC.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne,Australia.Commissural fusion of the native aortic valve in a patient with a continuous flowleft ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a known phenomenon. This may result inaortic insufficiency (AI) leading to symptomatic heart failure. In patients with AI at the time of LVAD implantation, repairing, or replacing the aortic valve is advisable. We describe a patient who had a severe dilated cardiomyopathy andmoderate AI who underwent implantation of an LVAD and aortic valve replacementwith a bioprosthesis that subsequently developed commissural fusion which wasfound at the time of heart transplantation. This case highlights the conundrum ofthe management of AI in patients requiring LVAD support. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12541 (J Card Surg 2015;30:466-468).Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
