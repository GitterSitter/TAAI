The SHFM is a validated multivariate risk model that uses NYHAclassification to assess functional capacity rather than peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)).METHODS: Outpatients (n = 1,240) evaluated for transplant at three centers hadtheir SHFM score calculated and peak VO(2) measured. The outcomes assessed weredeath/LVAD/urgent transplant with censoring at the time of elective transplant.RESULTS: Over the course of 4.0 (mean) years of observation, there were 571events. Both the SHFM score (χ(2) = 227) and peak VO(2) (χ(2) = 88, both p <0.0001) were highly predictive of outcomes. The SHFM and peak VO(2) were modestlycorrelated (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate Cox model, peak VO(2) added to the SHFM with a hazard ratio of 0.949 (p < 0.0001) for each 1-ml/kg/minincrease. Peak VO(2) improved both the net reclassification improvement andintegrated discrimination index (both p ≤ 0.0002). Peak VO(2) provided additiveprognostic information within each SHFM score (p < 0.05). The 1-year areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were obtained for peak VO(2) (0.645, 95% CI 0.606 to 0.684), SHFM (0.758, 95% CI 0.721 to 0.795) and SHFM with peakVO(2) (0.766, 95% CI 0.731 to 0.802). The SHFM-predicted vs actual survival free of LVAD/UNOS Status 1 transplant at 1 year (86% vs 83%) and 4 years (63% vs 63%) were similar.CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate SHFM is a powerful predictor of death/LVAD/urgenttransplant. Peak VO(2) adds prognostic information across the spectrum of theSHFM, but changes in decision regarding transplant listing occur mainly inmoderate-risk patients.Copyright © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
