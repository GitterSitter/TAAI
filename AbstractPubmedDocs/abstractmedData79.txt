The associations of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)and persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF) with survival, heart failure (HF)hospitalization, bleeding, and thromboembolism were examined using Kaplan-Meiersurvival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression.RESULTS: Mean age was 56.6 ± 11.4 years, 87.7% of the implants were intended as abridge to transplantation, and median length of support was 217 days (range: 1 to952 days). AF was present in 55 patients (51.9%); 36 patients (34.0%) had PAF and19 (17.9%) had PeAF. Twenty-one patients (19.8%) died, and 18 (17.0%) werehospitalized for HF. There were 0.75 major bleeding events and 0.28thromboembolic events per patient year of follow-up. PAF was not associated with increased mortality, HF hospitalization, bleeding, or thromboembolism. PeAF,however, was an independent predictor of the composite endpoint of death or HFhospitalization (hazard ratio: 3.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.52 to 8.25; p <0.01). Although there was no increase in bleeding or thromboembolism, patientswith AF had thromboembolic events at higher international normalized ratios(INRs).CONCLUSIONS: Although PAF is not associated with worse outcomes in patients with the HMII LVAD, PeAF may be associated with increased mortality and HFhospitalization. Patients with AF also may have thromboembolic events at higherINR levels.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by ElsevierInc. All rights reserved.
