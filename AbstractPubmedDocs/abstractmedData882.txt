We report onour experience in the pediatric population. A retrospective review of 17consecutive children offered mechanical support with Berlin Heart as a bridge to heart transplant from February 2002 to April 2010 was conducted. The medianpatient age was 3.9 years (75 days to 13.3 years). The median patient weight was 14.1 kg (2.9-43kg). Before VAD implantation, all children were managed bymultiple intravenous inotropes and mechanical ventilation (14) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (3). All patients had right ventricular dysfunction. Ninepatients required biventricular mechanical support (BVAD), but in all other casesa single left ventricular assist device proved sufficient (47%). The medianduration of VAD support was 47 days (1-168 days). The median pre-VAD pulmonaryvascular resistance index (Rpi) was 5.7 WU/m(2) (3.5 to 14.4WU/m(2) ). Elevenpatients (65%) were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median duration of mechanical support of 68 days (6-168 days). Six deaths occurred(35%), three for neurological complications, one for sepsis, and two others fordevice malfunctioning. Since 2007, the survival rate of our patients hasincreased from 43% to 80%, and the need for BVAD has decreased from 86% to 30%.In two patients with Rpi >10WU/m(2) , unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilatatortherapy, Rpi dropped to 2.2 and 2WU/m(2) after 40 and 23 days of BVAD support,respectively. Seven patients (41%) required at least one pump change. Of 11patients undergoing heart transplant, four developed an extremely elevated (>60%)panel reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed byLuminex. All of them experienced at least one acute episode of rejection in thefirst month after heart transplant, needing plasmapheresis. The survival rateafter heart transplantation was 100% with a median follow-up of 25.4 months (6days to 7.7 years). Mechanical support in children with end-stage heart failureis an effective strategy as a bridge to heart transplantation with a reasonablemorbidity and mortality. BVAD support may offer an additional means to reverseextremely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.© 2010, Copyright the Authors.
