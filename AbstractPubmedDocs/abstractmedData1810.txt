In this study,the results of implantation were evaluated in patients supported with one type ofdevice, including 85 supported with a Thoratec, 61 with a Novacor, and 37 with a HeartMate. The mean support time was 49, 148, and 124 days, respectively.Successful transplantation and weaning rates were 64. 7% with Thoratec, 59.0%with Novacor, and 62.0% with HeartMate. Cerebral embolism and drive-line andpocket infection were major causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Werecommended that a Thoratec system be employed as a bridge to hearttransplantation for patients with biventricular heart failure, and that a Novacoror HeartMate system be implanted in patients requiring a long-term circulatorysupport.
