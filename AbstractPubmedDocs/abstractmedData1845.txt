In this study we describe our experience withshort-term and mid-term application of the ABIOMED and Thoratec device.METHODS: Since 1990 the ABIOMED BVS and since 1992 the Thoratec VAD have beenapplied to 75 and 103 patients, respectively, with postcardiotomy heart failure, as a bridge-to-transplant procedure, and with different other indications.RESULTS: In the ABIOMED collective 25 of 50 patients (50%) with postcardiotomyheart failure and 1 of 4 patients with miscellaneous other indications could bedischarged from hospital, 7 of 14 bridge-to-transplant patients (50%) underwenttransplantation with a posttransplant survival of 86%. In the Thoratec collective6 of 10 patients (60%) with postcardiotomy heart failure and 4 of 8 patients(50%) with miscellaneous indications could be discharged from hospital, 48bridge-to-transplant patients (74%) underwent transplantation with aposttransplant survival of 90%.CONCLUSIONS: The results show the versatility of the Thoratec VAD for short-term and mid-term application in patients with postcardiotomy heart failure and as abridge-to-transplant procedure. The use of the ABIOMED device is not indicatedfor bridging patients to transplantation. Although in case of postcardiotomyheart failure, Thoratec is also superior to ABIOMED, the high costs of theThoratec VAD limits its wide acceptance in this patient cohort.
