This study offers an overview of the presentstate of the art. Institutions with a mechanical circulatory assist programusually dispose of a decision chart for the various systems. There are deviceswith intra- or extracorporeal pump positions and with long- or short-termapplication. The various possibilities of mechanical circulatory assistance arepresented, along with their technical properties, indications, and results.Currently, the application is concerned with technical reliability and limitedbiocompatibility with thrombembolic, neurological, and infectious complications. With some further developments, the present state of the art is supposed toenable a widespread application as bridging systems and as long-term therapy ofheart failure within the next few years.
