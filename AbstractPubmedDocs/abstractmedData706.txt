We implanted 28 devices in children and infants using a consistentanticoagulation protocol. We performed a retrospective review of all childrenimplanted in our program with mechanical assist devices since 1997. Heparin,dipyridamole, and aspirin were used for anticoagulation and antiaggregation.Coagulation monitoring included thromboelastography (TEG), platelet aggregration studies, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, andplatelet count. Twenty-eight children, ages 1 month to 16 years (mean 5.3; median2.4 years), were implanted for 3-107 days (mean 27; median 17). Eighteen receivedleft ventricular assist devices, seven received biventricular assist devices, andthree received total artificial hearts. Adverse events during the 720 days ofdevice support included the following: six (21%) reoperations for bleeding; sevenstrokes (25%): two fatal, two with a mild residual deficit, and three withoutdeficit; and three (11%) visceral emboli: two fatal and one nonfatal. There were eight deaths (29%). Causes of death were embolic (four), graft failurepost-transplantation (one), preimplant anoxic brain damage (two), and postexplantheart failure (one). 24/28 (86%) survived to transplantation or weaning fromdevice and 20/28 (71%) were discharged from the hospital, 10 aftertransplantation and 10 after native heart recovery. All 20 early survivorssurvived long term. We describe an anticoagulation protocol based upon TEG andplatelet aggregation studies and using heparin, aspirin, and dipyridamole.Adequate anticoagulation is more difficult in children. However, 71% of thepatients in our study survived long term.© 2011, Copyright the Authors.
