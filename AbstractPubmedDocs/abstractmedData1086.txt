In this study we document our institutional long-term results andrecent improvements in BTT therapy.METHODS: We retrospectively studied 531 consecutive heart transplant recipientsbetween January 1990 and August 2007. The cohort was divided into old orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) without device (oOHT; n = 399, January 1990 to July 2003),old BTT (oBTT; n = 41, January 1990 to July 2003), new OHT without device (nOHT; n = 58, August 2003 to August 2007) and new BTT (nBTT; n = 33, August 2003 toAugust 2007) groups. Demographics and post-transplant outcomes were assessed.RESULTS: Post-transplant survival in the nBTT group improved significantlycompared with the oBTT group (log-rank test, p = 0.01) and survival in the nOHTgroup tended to be higher than in the oOHT group (p = 0.19). Survival in the oBTTgroup was significantly worse than in the oOHT group (p < 0.01). However, therewas no difference between the nBTT and nOHT groups. The mean period of BTTsupport was 113 (range 5 to 524) days in the oBTT group and 148 (range 38 to 503)days in the nBTT group. Multivariate analysis revealed diabetes (p < 0.01) andbiventricular support (p = 0.04) as significant independent predictors ofpost-transplant mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Post-transplant survival has improved in recent BTT patients.Indeed, recent outcome for OHT after BTT has become equivalent to that for OHTwithout VAD. These data suggest that advances in device technology and ourinstitutional multidisciplinary program have improved survival and allow BTTcandidates to have an outcome equivalent to that of non-VAD patients in therecent era.
