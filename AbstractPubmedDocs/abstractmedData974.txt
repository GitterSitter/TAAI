Clearly, there is a definitive role for widerapplication of temporary circulatory support in such patients. Questions remainas to the ideal device, the optimal duration of temporary support, and the ideal timing to bridge these patients to a long-term device. There are currentlyseveral options available for circulatory support and include surgicallyimplanted ventricular assist devices, percutaneous assist devices, andextracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This review includes a brief summary of the current assist devices available along with the University of Minnesota'sexperience with the Levitronix CentriMag system.
