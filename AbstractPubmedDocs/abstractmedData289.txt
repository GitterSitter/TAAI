Epub 2014Jan 3.Acute pulmonary injury with refractory hypoxaemia after implantation ofLevitronix CentriMag ventricular assist device: successful treatment withveno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.Chen JL(1), Sung SY, Hsu PS, Tsai CS, Tsai YT, Lin CY, Ke HY, Lin YC.Author information: (1)Department of Anesthesia, Tri-Service General Hospital, National DefenseMedical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.Although acute pulmonary injury after cardiopulmonary bypass has been detailed inthe literature, it was seldom mentioned in the context of following implantation of a ventricular assist device. We report on a 65-year-old male with end-stageischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent implantation of Levitronix CentriMag(Levitronix, Waltham, MA) for cardiac support and was listed for hearttransplantation. Acute pulmonary injury with profound hypoxaemia was noted 6 hafter the implantation. Despite optimal medical treatment and maximal ventilator support, refractory hypoxaemia persisted, and veno-venous extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (oxygenator: Affinity-NT; centrifugal pump: BPX-80 Bio-Pump,Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was applied for ventilation support. The patientwas weaned from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 4 days later and from theventilator on the next 2 days. He underwent a successful orthotopic hearttransplant after a total of 77 days on Levitronix left ventricular device cardiacsupport.
