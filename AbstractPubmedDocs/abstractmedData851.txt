Epub 2011 Feb 9.Implantable mechanical circulatory support: demystifying patients withventricular assist devices and artificial hearts.Shah KB(1), Tang DG, Cooke RH, Harton S, Flattery M, Katlaps GJ, Kasirajan V,Hess ML.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, The Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation Programof Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298-0204, USA.kshah@mcvh-vcu.eduEngineering advancements have expanded the role for mechanical circulatorysupport devices in the patient with heart failure. More patients with mechanical circulatory support are being discharged from the implanting institution and willbe seen by clinicians outside the immediate surgical or heart-failure team. This review provides a practical understanding of device design and physiology,general troubleshooting, and limitations and complications for implantable leftventricular assist devices (pulsatile-flow and continuous-flow pumps) and thetotal artificial heart.Â© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
