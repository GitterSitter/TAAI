On postoperative day 54, hewas evaluated for recurrent dyspnea on exertion that was due to a severe stenosisat the site of the pulmonary artery anastomosis. Balloon angioplasty wasperformed, and a 10-mm stent was deployed, with marked clinical improvement.Fourteen months later, he presented with recurrent symptoms due to in-stentrestenosis. Multiple attempts at catheterization and balloon angioplasty of thestent failed. Due to the technical difficulty involved in maneuvering the balloonwhile maintaining stability, it was decided to repeat the angioplasty with theassistance of a Hansen Sensei remote robotic navigation system. The robotic armmarkedly enhanced stability and facilitated successful navigation of the stented site. A 16-mm-diameter Wallstent was placed through the previously placedballoon-expandable stent and postdilated.CONCLUSION: A remote robotic catheter navigation system was able to assiststenting of an anastomotic pulmonary artery stenosis following failure ofconventional interventional techniques.
