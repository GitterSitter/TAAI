The surgicaltechnique of heart transplantation, popularized by Dr. Norman Shumway, has led toits success and currently remains the best treatment options for patients withend-stage. However, with the continued limitation of donor organs and the rapiddevelopment of ventricular assist device technology, the number of patientsbridged to transplant with mechanical circulatory support has increasedsignificantly. This has created some new technical challenges for hearttransplantation. Therefore, it is now important to be familiar with multiple new technical challenges associated with the surgical techniques of hearttransplantation with an ultimate goal in reducing donor heart ischemic time,recipient cardiopulmonary bypass time and post-operative complications. In thisreview, we described our technique of heart transplantation including the timing of the operation, recipient cardiectomy and donor heart implantation.PMCID: PMC4133541
