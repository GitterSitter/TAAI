Neverthelessearly and late morbidity and mortality are influenced by acute rejection, cardiacallograft vasculopathy (CAV), malignancy, renal failure, and graft failure.METHODS: We evaluated our results after HTx in children under the age of 18 yearswith 23 years of follow-up. Perioperative characteristics, probability ofsurvival, and time-related morbidity were retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: We included 169 pediatric HTx recipients, transplanted between 05/1986and 05/2010. One hundred and one were males with a median age of 8.7 (0.02-23.2) years at the time of HTx. Main preoperative diagnoses were cardiomyopathy (CMP)(n = 139) with a median survival of 7.0 (0-23.2) years and congenital heartdisease (CHD) (n = 30), median survival 11.3 (0-19.9) years. Overall survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 87%, 76%, 68%, and 50%, respectively. Patient survivalwas significantly reduced in patients with 0-1 year at the time of HTx versus1-10 and 11-18 years: 2.3 (0-13.2) years versus 1-10 years = 8.6 (0-23.2) years; 11-18 years = 5.9 (0.003-18.5) years. Fifty-one patients were on mechanicalcirculatory support as a bridge-to-HTx with increased early but not latemortality. Ten patients underwent retransplant due to acute or chronic graftfailure after a median posttransplant time of 12.25 (0.3-17.45) years. Latemortality was influenced by rejection, infection, posttransplantlymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) (11.8%), or CAV with an incidence of 25% at 5 years, 50% at 10 years, and approximately 75% at 15 years.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric HTx is a safe and effective treatment for terminal heartfailure. In our experience, there is no adverse effect of previous cardiac assistdevice implantation in long-term follow-up. Virtually all anatomic malformations are amenable to orthotopic HTx. Significant progress has been achieved incontrolling rejection through improved immunosuppression and noninvasiverejection monitoring.Copyright Â© 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
