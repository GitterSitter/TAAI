Surgical procedureswere uneventful, and both patients had an uneventful postoperative course, withfast weaning from mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. No thromboembolicevents, infective complication, hemolysis, or mechanical failure occurred. Todate, both patients are in New York Heart Association class I.CONCLUSIONS: In our initial experience the CorAide LVAS blood pump isnonthrombogenic, nonhemolytic, and easy to implant. Both patients have improvedtheir functional status. Further follow-up is needed to assess long-term results.
