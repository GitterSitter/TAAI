The use of RV assist devices (RVAD) as a bridge to recovery has been reported. However, early changes of RV structure and anatomy after RVADimplantation have yet to be described. We report a case of RV failure aftertransplantation requiring RVAD implantation. After 3 weeks of gradual weaning of inotropic and RVAD support, the device was explanted successfully.Transesophageal echocardiography documents RV hypertrophy and remodeling between RVAD implantation and removal, suggesting a rapid adaptive response of the right ventricle in the presence of pulmonary hypertension.
