Epub2011 Sep 26.Preexisting mitral valve prosthesis in patients undergoing left ventricularassist device implantation.Schweiger M(1), Stepanenko A, Vierecke J, Drews T, Potapov E, Hetzer R, KrabatschT.Author information: (1)Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Berlin, Germany. mschweiger@dhzb.deExperience with patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD)implantation with preexisting mitral valve prostheses is limited. Patients withmechanical heart valves might have an increased risk of thromboembolism; inpatients with biologic valves, there might be a risk of structural deterioration of the leaflets. Out of 597 patients supported with a LVAD system between 2000and 2009, 18 patients had mitral valve surgery prior to implantation. We excludedall patients below 18 years of age, those with postcardiotomy failure, andpatients who had had mitral valve reconstruction. Only 1% of the studied patient population (n= 6) had mitral valve replacement. The mitral valve implantation hasbeen performed 7.4 ± 9.4 years prior to LVAD insertion. None of the valves (onebiologic, five mechanical) were exchanged or explanted. LVAD implantation wasdone either with left lateral thoracotomy (n= 5) or with midline resternotomy (n=1). Temporary right ventricular assist device support was necessary in one case(16.6%); 30-day mortality was 16.6% (n= 1). Median support time was 14 ± 15months. Two patients received heart transplantation after 6 and 26 months on the device; four patients died on mechanical circulatory support after 1, 2, 5, and40 months. No valve or pump thrombosis or other clinically relevantthromboembolic events were observed. Only a small number of patients (1%) had apreexisting mitral valve prosthesis prior to LVAD implantation. No severe adverseevents were observed when the prosthesis was left in place. Attention should bepaid to the anticoagulation regime.© 2011, Copyright Prof.Dr.Roland Hetzer Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin.
