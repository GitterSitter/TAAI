Eleven patients, aged 2 weeks 15 yearsand weighing 3.2-52 kg received a left ventricular assist device or abiventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (bridgegroup). Nine of them had liver, kidney, or lung dysfunction before deviceimplantation. Three patients were supported with a biventricular assist devicefor myocardial recovery (recovery group): a 6-month-old girl for postcardiotomyshock, a 10-month-old girl for allograft failure after cardiac transplantation,and a 4-year-old boy with acute myocarditis.RESULTS: In the bridge group, eight patients were transplanted after a bridgeduration of 6-98 days (mean, 32 days) with five long-term survivors. Organfunctions were normalized during bridging in all of the transplant recipients. Inthe recovery group, the first patient was removed from support after 2 daysbecause of irreversible brain damage. The second patient was weaned frombiventricular support after 8 days, but suffered from recurrent allograftfailure. The third patient received biventricular support for 21 days followed byextracorporeal membrane oxygenation and was subsequently discharged from thehospital.CONCLUSIONS: The 'Berlin Heart' VAD can keep selected infants and children withlife-threatening heart failure for weeks or months.
