The mediansurvival for patients with heart failure on ionotropic support alone is a meager 6 months. Historically, the only option for these patients was to be listed forheart transplantation. Out of medical necessity, the idea of left ventricularassist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation was born. Since theirapproval by the US FDA, LVADs have quadrupled the survival in patients with heartfailure. The increase in survival has also been accompanied by decreasedperioperative morbidity, better biocompatibility and longer device life overfirst-generation LVADs. Undoubtedly, LVADs have changed the landscape of heartfailure treatment and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. In thisreview, we will highlight the landmark studies that have established LVADs as atherapeutic option for heart failure, as well as reviewing the current LVADsavailable and speculating on the advancements that will be made in the upcomingyears.
