The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) is a20-variable model that combines clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data.Although both models have excellent accuracy, only the HFSS was derived andvalidated in patients referred for transplantation, and the HFSS and SHFM havenot been directly compared.METHODS: We tested the accuracy of the SHFM and compared the HFSS and SHFM in 715patients referred for heart transplantation.RESULTS: Over a follow-up of 962 ± 912 days, 354 patients died or received anurgent heart transplantation or a ventricular assist device. One-year event-free survival was 89%, 72% and 60%, respectively, for the low-, medium- and high-risk HFSS strata, and 93%, 76%, and 58%, respectively, for the low-, medium- andhigh-risk SHFM strata. The HFSS and SHFM were modestly correlated (R = -0.48, p <0.001). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under thecurves (AUCs) for the HFSS and SHFM were comparable (1 year: 0.72 vs 0.73;2-year: 0.70 vs 0.74, respectively) and incremental to New York Heart Associationclass. The 1- and 2-year combined HFSS+SHFM AUCs were 0.77 and 0.76,respectively, significantly better than the HFSS or SHFM alone.CONCLUSIONS: The HFSS and SHFM provide accurate and comparable riskstratification in CHF patients referred for transplantation. Combining the HFSSand SHFM improves predictive ability.2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. Published byElsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
