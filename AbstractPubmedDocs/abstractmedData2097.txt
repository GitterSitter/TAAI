This has significantly prolongedthe waiting period and consequently has resulted in increased mortality of thepatients with end-stage heart disease who are awaiting transplantation. Between1984 and 1987, 104 orthotopic heart transplants were performed at LoyolaUniversity Medical Center. During the same period, 25 patients died while waitingfor a suitable donor. To reduce the mortality of our patients waiting fortransplantation, we began using the total artificial heart and a ventricularassist device as a bridge to transplantation in 1988. Of 29 patients whounderwent transplant procedures in 1988, 18 required either a total artificialheart (15) or a ventricular assist device (3) as a bridge to transplantation. Theunderlying heart conditions were ischemic cardiomyopathy (11), dilatedcardiomyopathy (5), giant cell myocarditis (1), and allograft failure (1). Theaverage duration of mechanical support was 10 days (range, 1 to 35 days).Seventeen of the supported patients had successful transplants. One patient hadbrain death and did not receive a heart transplant. Of the 17 patients whosurvived surgery, two died within 30 days: one at 17 days because of acuterejection, the other at 14 days because of a cerebral vascular event. Fifteenpatients (83%) were long-term survivors. Nine of the supported patients required reoperation because of bleeding after device implantation. There was nomediastinal or incisional infection. While the mechanical device was in place,the activated clotting time was maintained between 170 and 200 seconds with theadministration of heparin (400 to 1000 units per hour).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250WORDS)
