This multi-institutional study evaluated safety,effectiveness, and outcomes of the CentriMag in patients with cardiogenic shock.METHODS: Thirty-eight patients were supported at 7 centers. Patients included 12 after cardiotomy, 14 after myocardial infarction, and 12 with right ventricularfailure after implantable left ventricular assist device placement. Devices were implanted in left (n = 8), right (n = 12), or biventricular (n = 18)configuration. Support was continued until recovery, transplantation, orimplantation of long-term ventricular assist device.RESULTS: Mean support duration for the entire cohort (n = 38) was 13 days (1-60days), with 47% of patients (18/38) surviving 30 days after device removal. Mean CentriMag biventricular support (n = 18) duration was 15 days (1-60 days), with44% (8/18) surviving at 30 days. Mean CentriMag right ventricular support with a commercially available left ventricular assist device (n = 12) duration was 14days (1-29 days), with 58% (7/12) surviving at 30 days. Complications includedbleeding (21%), infection (5%), respiratory failure (3%), hemolysis (5%), andneurologic dysfunction (11%). There were no CentriMag or pump failures.CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, the CentriMag provided short-term supportfor patients with cardiogenic shock with a low incidence of device-relatedcomplications and no device failures.Copyright Â© 2011 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.
