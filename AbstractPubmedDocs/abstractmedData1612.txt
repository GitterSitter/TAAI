In the United States, an estimated 5 million personsalready have heart failure, and more than 500,000 new cases are being diagnosedeach year [ 1]. Today, cardiovascular physicians can choose from a wide range of mechanical circulatory systems, depending on the desired degree of support,length of support, extent of postoperative mobility and other factors. Thisarticle describes the growing problem of heart failure and the future prospectsfor patients with heart disease. It discusses current mechanical circulatorysupport devices and their changing applications, newer devices still in theexperimental stages, and some hurdles to the use of mechanical circulatorysupport.
