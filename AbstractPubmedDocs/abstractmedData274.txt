Peak values for each marker were identified, and 2 hemolysis definitionswere applied to the cohort: Hemolysis according to Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) criteria (sfHg > 40 mg/dlwith signs/symptoms) and/or hemolysis defined by an LDH ≥ 600 IU/liter (2.5-timesthe upper limit of laboratory normal). Kaplan-Meier survival free from death,urgent United Network of Organ Sharing 1A transplant for thrombosis, deviceexchange for thrombosis, and stroke/peripheral embolism was estimated, and Coxhazard ratios (HR) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated.Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for predicting1-year event-free survival were calculated.RESULTS: Hemolysis occurred in 32 patients (18%) by INTERMACS criteria and in 68 (37%) patients by LDH criteria. Over a median (25(th), 75(th)) support of 427days (245, 793 days), there were 78 events. One year event-free survival afterthe onset of INTERMACS-defined hemolysis was 16% ± 8.3% compared with 85% ± 3.2% in non-hemolyzers (HR, 14.7; 95% CI, 7.9-27; AUC 0.70 ± 0.05; p < 0.001; ). Oneyear event-free survival after the onset of LDH-defined hemolysis was 32% ± 7.2% compared with 89% ± 3.2% in those with persistent LDH values < 600 IU/liter (HR, 8.0; 95% CI, 4.4-14; AUC 0.87 ± 0.04; p < 0.001). Patients who met the LDHhemolysis definition had longer times from hemolysis onset to clinical events andlarger magnitudes of risk for embolism and device exchange for thrombosis thanthose with INTERMACS hemolysis.CONCLUSIONS: Serum hemolysis marker elevations are associated with increasedevents in LVAD patients. LDH monitoring provides an earlier diagnosis of adverse events than sfHg, supporting need for a new INTERMACS definition ofVAD-associated hemolysis.© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Published byInternational Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.
