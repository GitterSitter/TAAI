We conducted arandomized, double-blind, controlled trial to determine the effect of iNO onpost-operative outcomes in the setting of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)placement.METHODS: Included were 150 patients undergoing LVAD placement with pulmonaryvascular resistance ≥ 200 dyne/sec/cm(-5). Patients received iNO (40 ppm) orplacebo (an equivalent concentration of nitrogen) until 48 hours after separationfrom cardiopulmonary bypass, extubation, or upon meeting study-defined RVD. Forethical reasons, crossover to open-label iNO was allowed during the 48-hourtreatment period if RVD criteria were met.RESULTS: RVD criteria were met by 7 of 73 patients (9.6%; 95% confidenceinterval, 2.8-16.3) in the iNO group compared with 12 of 77 (15.6%; 95%confidence interval, 7.5-23.7) who received placebo (p = 0.330). Time onmechanical ventilation decreased in the iNO group (median days, 2.0 vs 3.0; p =0.077), and fewer patients in the iNO group required an RVAD (5.6% vs 10%; p =0.468); however, these trends did not meet statistical boundaries ofsignificance. Hospital stay, intensive care unit stay, and 28-day mortality rateswere similar between groups, as were adverse events. Thirty-five patients crossedover to open-label iNO (iNO, n = 15; placebo, n = 20). Eighteen patients (iNO, n = 9; placebo, n = 9) crossed over before RVD criteria were met.CONCLUSIONS: Use of iNO at 40 ppm in the perioperative phase of LVAD implantationdid not achieve significance for the primary end point of reduction in RVD.Similarly, secondary end points of time on mechanical ventilation, hospital orintensive care unit stay, and the need for RVAD support after LVAD placement werenot significantly improved.Copyright © 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
