J Heart Lung Transplant. 2000 Sep;19(9):819-24.Expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the failing human heart: comparison ofrecent-onset and end-stage congestive heart failure.Kubota T(1), Miyagishima M, Alvarez RJ, Kormos R, Rosenblum WD, Demetris AJ,Semigran MJ, Dec GW, Holubkov R, McTiernan CF, Mann DL, Feldman AM, McNamara DM.Author information: (1)Cardiovascular Institute of the UPMC Health System, University of PittsburghMedical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.BACKGROUND: Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, are elevated in patients withcongestive heart failure (CHF). Recent studies suggest that the failing humanheart is a source of proinflammatory cytokines in the end-stage failing heart.However, the relevance of plasma levels to those of the myocardium remainsundefined. We sought to compare cytokine expression in early and end-stage CHF,and to evaluate the correlation of tissue expression to plasma levels.METHODS: Two patient populations were studied: patients with recent-onset CHF,all with symptoms less than 6 months (n = 17, duration of symptoms 2.1 +/- 1.6months, range of New York Heart Association (NYHA) 1 to 3), and end-stageheart-failure patients (n = 7) who underwent left-ventricular assist-device(LVAD) implantation (Duration of symptoms 47.1 +/- 28.0 months, all NYHA class4). Plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 proteins were evaluated by anEnzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA), while myocardial levels of cytokinetranscripts were assessed by ribonuclease (Rnase) protection assay.RESULTS: In patients with end-stage heart failure, TNF-alpha and IL-6 wereincreased in the plasma as well as in the myocardium (plasma: TNF-alpha = 7.7 +/-2.3 pg/ml, IL-6 = 45.0 +/- 47.1 pg/ml; myocardium: TNF-alpha = 0.31 +/- 0.15% of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression, IL-6 = 1.56 +/-1.54% ). In contrast, despite elevated plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, themyocardium of patients with the recent onset of symptoms demonstrated minimalexpression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (plasma:TNF-alpha = 4.3 +/- 1.7 pg/ml, IL-6 = 3.3 +/- 1.8 pg/ml; myocardium: TNF-alpha = 0.13 +/- 0. 04%, IL-6 = 0.02 +/- 0.04%). Plasma levels of TNF-alpha weresignificantly correlated with those in the myocardium when both populations were combined. (r = 0.69, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Cytokines are expressed in the myocardium in end-stage heart failureto a much greater degree than in patients with the recent-onset of symptoms. Thissuggests that induction of cytokines in the myocardium is a relatively late eventin the pathogenesis of CHF. Furthermore, plasma levels of TNF-alpha correlateswith mRNA expression in the myocardium and thus may serve as an appropriatemarker of myocardial cytokine activation. Whether the production of cytokines in the failing human heart precedes the elevation of cytokines in the plasma remainsundefined. Therefore, we studied expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in themyocardium as well as in the plasma in patients with early and end-stage CHF. Theresults have demonstrated that cytokines are expressed in the myocardium inend-stage heart failure to a much greater degree than in patients with the recentonset of symptoms. This suggests that induction of cytokines in the myocardium isa relatively late event in the pathogenesis of CHF.
