With the evolution of LVAD support, prior risk prediction models have become less valid.METHODS: Patients enrolled into the HMII bridge to transplantation anddestination therapy trials (N = 1,122) were randomly divided into derivation (DC)(n = 583) and validation cohorts (VC) (n = 539). Pre-operative candidatepredictors of 90-day mortality were examined in the DC with logistic regression, from which the HMII Risk Score (HMRS) was derived. The HMRS was then applied tothe VC.RESULTS: There were 149 (13%) deaths within 90 days. In the DC, mortality (n =80) was higher in older patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1.3, 95% confidence interval[CI]: 1.1 to 1.7 per 10 years), those with greater hypoalbuminemia (OR: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.31 to 0.76 per mg/dl of albumin), renal dysfunction (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4to 3.2 per mg/dl creatinine), coagulopathy (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7 to 5.8 perinternational normalized ratio unit), and in those receiving LVAD support at lessexperienced centers (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2 to 4.4 for <15 trial patients).Mortality in the DC low, medium, and high HMRS groups was 4%, 16%, and 29%,respectively (p < 0.001). In the VC, corresponding mortality was 8%, 11%, and25%, respectively (p < 0.001). HMRS discrimination was good (area under thereceiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.75).CONCLUSIONS: The HMRS might be useful for mortality risk stratification in HMIIcandidates and may serve as an additional tool in the patient selection process.Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
