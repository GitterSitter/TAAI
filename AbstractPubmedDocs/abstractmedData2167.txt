Annu Rev Med. 1978;29:571-82.Cardiac assist devices.Lamberti JJ, Resnekov L.We reviewed current concepts and techniques of cardiac assistance, includingorthotopic and heterotopic cardiac allografting. Whereas intraaortic ballooncounterpulsation has had the greatest clinical use, other techniques are nowbecoming available, including the implantable abdominal left ventricularassistance device, and much effort is being expended on the development ofartificial hearts and their power sources. Despite the present technicalshortcomings, exciting advances have occurred in the clinical management ofintractable acute or chronic ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock since the introduction of circulatory assistance in man. The continued development andimplementation of these techniques will help reduce the still unacceptably highmortality rate in this group of patients.
