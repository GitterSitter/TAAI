Oftentimes a patient presents with limited history and refractory cardiogenic shock,where a full transplant work-up for contraindications cannot be safely performed.The use of short-term mechanical support can be used to help filter out manypatients who have easily identifiable contraindications to heart transplant.Nevertheless, patients need to be listed for a heart transplant before theimplantation of some of these devices. This paradigm needs to be altered, becausethere are many instances where mechanical support can be used to support apatient for an intervention to "make" them a transplant candidate where theyotherwise would not have been. Long-term mechanical support can overcome thecardiac contraindication to the surgical/interventional therapy to "cure" them ofthe process that would have prevented them from being a good cardiac transplantcandidate in the first place. Noncardiac surgical procedures are well toleratedin these patients [11]. The FDA is currently evaluating the Vented ElectricHeartmate system for use as destination therapy for patients who are nottransplant candidates. Approval for this indication (with a device that isalready approved for bridge to transplantation) will allow this paradigm shift.This system could be used in the group who may be good candidates, but notdetermined. If they were subsequently determined to not be a good surgicalcandidate, they would be chronically supported with the LVAD as destinationtherapy.
