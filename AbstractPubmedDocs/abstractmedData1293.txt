Curr Heart Fail Rep. 2007 Jun;4(2):103-9.Heart transplantation: assessment of heart failure mortality risk.Matthews JC(1), Dardas TF, Aaronson KD.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center,Women's L3623, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0271, USA.Heart failure (HF) presents with a wide spectrum of disease severity and with abroad risk of associated morbidity and mortality. Identification of individualsat high risk for HF death is important for assessment of candidacy for hearttransplantation and mechanical circulatory assistance and, more broadly, forguiding pharmaceutical, surgical, or palliative interventions. In this article,we review and compare several of the HF risk prediction tools currentlyavailable, highlighting their clinical utilities and potential shortcomings. Riskprediction tools must be carefully selected, recognizing that their accuracy islikely to be greatest when used in patients most similar to those from whom thetool was developed. As HF is a dynamic condition, serial risk assessment atregular intervals and as patient clinical status changes is warranted, althoughclinical evidence to support this practice is limited.
