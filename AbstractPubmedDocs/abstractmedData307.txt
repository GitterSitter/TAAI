Furthermore, they are critical to the arsenal of the heart failurecardiologist, given the supply/demand mismatch for donor organs. Unfortunately,these devices present their own complications. Despite antiplatelet agents andsystemic anticoagulation, a number of patients present with pump thrombosis, alife-threatening event requiring either pump exchange or treatment with systemic thrombolytics. In an effort to avoid these morbid therapies, glycogen IIb/IIIainhibitors, which have both antiplatelet and thrombolytic properties, have beenproposed to treat pump thrombosis. We report here the largest case series usingthese agents and document a previously unreported high failure rate with thistherapy.
