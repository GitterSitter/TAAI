Severe pulmonary dysfunctionmay preclude their use, leaving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as themost frequently used option for combined cardiac and respiratory failure. Thereare few case reports describing the use of an oxygenator in combination with VAD support, but none that describes long-term utilization. We report the successful use of a low-resistance oxygenator placed into the right-sided VAD (RVAD) circuitof an infant with life-threatening respiratory failure. The oxygenator enabledimmediate reversal of hypoxaemia and hypercarbia and recovery of the RVADfunction. The oxygenator remained within the VAD circuit for 15 days,facilitating complete lung recovery. An oxygenator used in conjunction with a VADmay be a life-saving therapy, allowing adequate oxygenation and ventilation insevere respiratory and cardiac failure. Extended use may facilitate theprevention of ventilator-associated lung injury and organ dysfunction. Thistherapy may be an attractive intermediate step in the transition from, oralternative to ECMO, in patients requiring VAD placement with associated acutelung injury.PMCID: PMC3686397
