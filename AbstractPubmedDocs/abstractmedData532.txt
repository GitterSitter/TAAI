Prog Transplant. 2012 Dec;22(4):351-9.Variability in infection control measures for the percutaneous lead amongprograms implanting long-term ventricular assist devices in the United States.Cannon A(1), Elliott T, Ballew C, Cavey J, O'Shea G, Franzwa J, Puhlman M,Bennett J, Ryan T, Lockard K, Avrahami N, Brennan P, Kurien S, Andrus S, Dick S, Davis E.Author information: (1)University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, CO, USA. anne.cannon@uch.eduVentricular assist devices (VADs) are a surgical treatment for heart failure.These devices may be implanted as a bridge to transplant or as destinationtherapy. After surgical recovery and education regarding device care, patientsare discharged home. Meticulous care of the driveline must be taken to preventinfection and trauma of the site throughout the perioperative event and for theduration of support. Currently a standardized protocol for care of the driveline and exit site does not exist. VAD coordinators from across the country discussed the variability in care at different centers in the United States through aseries of conference calls. A survey consisting of 16 questions was developed.The survey included questions on preoperative antibiotic recommendations,driveline placement and exit site suturing, frequency of dressing changes, andshowering practices. VAD coordinators shared center-specific dressing protocolsand any driveline success stories. This survey was sent to 73 centers; 38 centers(52%) responded. The purpose of the survey was to define current practice inorder to move toward a standard of practice or protocol based on expert opinionfor VAD driveline care and to assess the need for future studies.
