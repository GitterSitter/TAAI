Equal extended survival for patients undergoing LVADsupport when compared with long-term medical management.Mehta SM(1), Boehmer JP, Pae WE Jr, Aufiero TX, Davis D, Pierce WS.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Pennsylvania State University-College ofMedicine, University Hospital-Children's Hospital, Hershey, USA.Implantation of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to support patients awaitingcardiac transplant has become an effective means of assuring that thesecritically ill patients survive to transplant. The authors undertook aretrospective analysis of 115 consecutive patients listed for cardiac transplant from January 1992 through June 1995. A VAD was implanted in 19 of these patients.Survival was calculated by intent to treat from the time of transplant listingthrough heart transplant, if it occurred. The analysis demonstrates that thepatients who underwent implantation of a VAD as bridge to transplant had survivaltimes similar to those of patients with medical management. These survivalstatistics demonstrate the utility of VADs as an effective means to bridgecritically ill patients until a suitable donor organ becomes available. Inaddition, as previous studies have suggested for acute results, earlierimplementation and better patient selection may lead to improved long-termsurvival.
