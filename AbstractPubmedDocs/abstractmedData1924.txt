Today, a broad spectrum of circulatory assist devices for short- andlong-term application is available. Three major indication groups for the use of support devices are established. In low-cardiac-output syndrome after cardiacsurgical procedures, short-term devices are utilised to enable myocardialrecovery. In transplantation candidates suffering from drug-resistant pumpfailure, the implantation of long-term devices as a bridge to hearttransplantation is indicated, and in NYHA class IV patients withcontraindications to heart transplantation, the implantation of long-term devicesas an alternative to transplantation is under discussion. In the literature,post-cardiotomy support survival is less than 30% on average. About 70% ofmechanically bridged patients have survived to undergo heart transplantation and were transplanted with over 90% survival. Major problems during mechanicalsupport are infection, bleeding, and thromboembolism. In view of patients'natural course without support, these clinical results are favourable.
