The impact of CHF medication optimization following CRT,however, has never been comprehensively evaluated. In the current study, wetherefore investigated the effect of CHF medication dosage on morbidity andmortality in CHF patients after CRT implantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Chronic heart failure medication was assessed in 185patients after CRT implantation. During an overall mean follow-up of 44.6 months,83 patients experienced a primary endpoint (death, heart transplantation, assist device implantation, or hospitalization for CHF). Treatment with higher dosagesof angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptorblockers (ARBs) (P = 0.001) and beta-blockers (P < 0.001) as well as with lowerdosages of loop diuretics (P < 0.001) was associated with a reduced risk for the primary combined endpoint as well as for all-cause mortality. Echocardiographicsuper-responders to CRT were treated with higher average dosages of ACE-I/ARBs(68.1 vs. 52.4%, P < 0.01) and beta-blockers (59 vs. 42.2%, P < 0.01). Duringfollow-up, the average dosage of loop diuretics was decreased by 20% insuper-responders, but increased by 30% in non-super-responders (P < 0.03).CONCLUSION: The use of higher dosages of neurohormonal blockers and lower dosagesof diuretics is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality following CRTimplantation. Our data imply a beneficial effect of increasing neurohormonalblockade whenever possible following CRT implantation.
