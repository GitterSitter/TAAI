We sought to determine CRT response inpatients with a prior history of CVS.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectivelyacquired cohort of CRT patients with history of CVS. Echocardiographic responsewas evaluated at baseline and 6 months. The coprimary endpoints were time tofirst heart failure (HF) hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality, transplantation and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) assessed over a 3-year follow-up period. The study group consisted of 569 patients undergoing CRT. Ofthese, 86 patients had a history of CVS (46.5% aortic, 37.2% mitral, 16.3%combined, and tricuspid), and were compared to 483 patients with no history ofCVS. Baseline clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were notsignificantly different between the groups except for a higher incidence ofatrial fibrillation (AF; 74.4% vs. 55.3%; P = 0.001), coronary artery bypasssurgery (CABG; 58.1% vs. 38.7%; P = 0.001), and longer QRS duration (167.6 ± 29.3milliseconds vs. 159.4 ± 27.5 milliseconds; P = 0.01) in those with prior CVS.Survival with respect to HF hospitalization and composite outcome was comparable in both groups. Echocardiographic response (improvement in left ventricularejection fraction of ≥10%) was similar. No difference in clinical orechocardiographic outcome was found by type of valve surgery performed.CONCLUSION: Despite a higher incidence of AF, CABG, and longer QRS duration,history of CVS is not associated with worse clinical or echocardiographic outcomeafter CRT.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
