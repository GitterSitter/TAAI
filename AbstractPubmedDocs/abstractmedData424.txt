As the field of mechanical circulatory supporthas evolved in children, the frequency of ventricular assist device use has been increasing steadily with excellent results. Ventricular assist devices are being used with increasing frequency in children with cardiac failure refractory tomedical therapy for primary treatment as a long-term bridge to recovery ortransplantation. This review, part of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive CareSociety/Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Joint Consensus Statement onMechanical Circulatory Support, focuses on ventricular assist device implantationand management, as well as anticipation and management of complications.
