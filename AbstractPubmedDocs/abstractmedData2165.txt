Artif Organs. 1978 Nov;2(4):413-20.Partial artificial heart (ALVAD) use with subsequent cardiac and renalallografting in a patient with stone heart syndrome.Norman JC, Dacso CC, Reul GJ, Massin EK, Klima T, Kahan BD, Keiser JT, Cooley DA.The abdominal left ventricular assist device (ALVAD) is an order of magnitudemore effective than conventional intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) in unloadingand providing circulatory support to the failing left ventricle. This is a reportof a unique case which demonstrates that in the absence of pulmonary vascularobstruction or constriction, the ALVAD can substitute for both left and rightheart function. A 21-year-old patient with a congenital bicuspid aortic valvedeveloped acute valvular endocarditis which rapidly progressed to congestiveheart failure. An operation was undertaken, the mitral and aortic valves wereexcised and replaced by porcine heterografts, and a fistula from the right sinus of Valsalva to the right ventricle was closed. When coronary circulation wasrestored, irreversible ischemic contracture of the left ventricle, or "stoneheart" syndrome, developed and emergency ALVAD or partial artificial heartimplantation was effected. This device functioned as a total artificial heart fornearly six days, while a donor heart was sought. The patient then underwentremoval of the ALVAD and cardiac and renal allografting. The transplanted heartfunctioned well, but the patient expired fifteen days later from gram-negativesepsis.
