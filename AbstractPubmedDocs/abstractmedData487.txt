Thirty-four subjects were enrolled after CF-LVAD and weremanaged with aggressive, bi-weekly up-titration of HFMED.RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (8 with coronary artery disease, 13 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) were included in this LVAD weaning investigation.Overall, combined CF-LVAD and HFMED resulted in significant reverse remodelingwith a decrease in left atrial volume index (44.7±16.0 to 31.6±12.1 ml/m(2), p < 0.001) and LV internal diastolic diameter (6.7±1.5 to 6.0±1.6 cm, p = 0.003) and an increase in LV ejection fraction (17.4±6.5 to 33.1±16.2%, p < 0.001) duringLVAD weaning (6,200 rpm). Five of 21 (24%) subjects demonstrated recovery ofbiventricular function. Exploratory analysis showed that recovered subjects hadshorter duration HF, less myocardial fibrosis and less myocyte hypertrophy, andwere supported at higher LVAD speeds.CONCLUSIONS: CF-LVAD support in combination with HFMED leads to significantreverse remodeling in patients with advanced HF. Using this approach, one quarterof patients demonstrated complete recovery of cardiac function. Our resultssuggest that bridge to recovery in the current device era is a clinicallymeaningful phenomenon and merits further investigation.Copyright © 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
