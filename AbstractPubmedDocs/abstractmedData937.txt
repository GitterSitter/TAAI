We report a retrospective review of our experience in very smallchildren (<10 kg of body weight).METHODS: Ten consecutive children weighing less than 10 kg were offeredmechanical support with Berlin Heart (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) as abridge to heart transplant from March 2002 to March 2010.RESULTS: The median patient age was 10.4 months (38 days to 2.2 years). Themedian patient weight was 6.4 kg (2.9 to 10 kg). Prior to VAD implantation, allchildren were managed by multiple intravenous inotropes and mechanicalventilation (8) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (2). The median pre-VADpulmonary vascular resistance index was 5.7 Woods units/m(2). Three patientsrequired biventricular mechanical support, but in all other cases a single leftVAD proved sufficient. The median duration of VAD support was 61 days (2 to 168days). Four deaths occurred; from stroke in three and sepsis in one. Fivepatients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a medianduration of mechanical support of 89 days (37 to 168 days) and another is stillwaiting a suitable organ after 77 days of VAD support. There were nocomplications related to postoperative bleeding. Five patients required at least one pump change. Of 5 patients undergoing heart transplant, 3 developed anextremely elevated (>60%) panel reactive antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed by Luminex (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX). All 3 experienced atleast one acute episode of rejection in the first month after heart transplant,needing plasmapheresis. The survival rate after heart transplantation was 100%with a median follow-up of 7.5 months.CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical support in very small children with end-stage heartfailure is an effective strategy of bridge to heart transplantation with areasonable mortality rate. The high rate of complications suggests to optimizeindications and timing of VAD implantation.Copyright 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc. Allrights reserved.
