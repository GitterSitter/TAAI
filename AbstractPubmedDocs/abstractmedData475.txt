This study investigates whether these therapeutic advanceshave translated into improvement in outcomes for patients with advanced HFreferred to a heart transplant center.METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HF (n=2507) referred to a single universitycenter were analyzed in three 6-year eras during which medical and devicetherapies were evolving: 1993 to 1998 (era 1), 1999 to 2004 (era 2), and 2005 to 2010 (era 3). Impaired hemodynamics and comorbidities were more frequent at time of referral in later eras, whereas other HF severity parameters where similar or improved. Successive eras had greater usage of angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, Î²-blockers, aldosterone antagonists,implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy,consistent with evolving evidence and guideline recommendations over the studyperiod. All-cause mortality and sudden death were significantly lower in era 2and 3 compared with era 1. After multivariable risk adjustment, era 3 hadsignificantly decreased 2- and 3-year all-cause mortality risk and significantly decreased 1- and 3-year sudden death risk compared with era 1. However,progressive HF death and the combined outcome of mortality/urgenttransplant/ventricular assist device were modestly increased in the latter eras.CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 2 decades, patients with advanced HF referred to andmanaged at a tertiary university referral center have benefited from advances in HF medications and devices, as evidenced by improvements in overall survival and sudden death risk.PMCID: PMC3674961
