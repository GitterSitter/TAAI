However, currentevidence does not support their widespread application for this indication. Otherindications such as cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction, or severemyocarditis may possibly be more fruitful. The use of these devices in thechronic support of patients with end-stage heart failure has recently beenevaluated in patients excluded for heart transplantation. Patients treated withan assist device had a better quality of life than patients on drug treatment,and a greater number of them were still alive after two years (23% versus 8%). Inthe future, novel options such as skeletal muscle cell transplantation, may offera feasible alternative to heart transplantation.
