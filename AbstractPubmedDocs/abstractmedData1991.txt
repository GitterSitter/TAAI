ASAIO J. 1995 Jul-Sep;41(3):M522-5.Clinical experience with long-term use of the Toyobo left ventricular assistsystem.Masai T(1), Shimazaki Y, Kadoba K, Miyamoto Y, Sawa Y, Yagura A, Matsuda H, SatohM, Kashiwabara S.Author information: (1)First Department of Surgery, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.The Toyobo-NCVC extracorporeal pneumatic left ventricular assist system (LVAS)was used in four patients with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy. The duration ofsupport ranged from 46 to 390 days (mean, 206 days). In all patients, stablehemodynamics were achieved with 3.5-5.5 L/min flow rates. Two patients survivedlong term. One was transported to the United States by a chartered jet while onLVAS and successfully underwent heart transplantation after 119 days of support. The other is on LVAS and is doing well for 390 days. The remaining two patientsdied of multi-organ failure while their hemodynamics were quite stable underLVAS. In these two patients, severe hepatic failure had developed before LVASimplantation. Minor cerebral embolisms occurred in the two survivors, but neitherof them experienced permanent neurologic deficits. In only the initial patientwere major thrombi noted on the diaphragm of the pump; the thrombi required pump exchange four times during 119 days. In the patient supported for 390 days, asmall tear in the diaphragm was observed after 209 days of support, and the pump was safely exchanged. It is suggested that the Toyobo LVAS can provide consistentand reliable performance for long-term use.
