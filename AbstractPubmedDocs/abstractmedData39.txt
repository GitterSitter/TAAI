Because very few data exist examining the influence of significantpre-operative MR on outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD)implantation, we evaluate our experience.METHODS: Between October 1996 and August 2013, 756 patients underwent primaryLVAD implantation at our institutions. Of these, 508 patients received acontinuous-flow LVAD and represent the contemporary cohort for this analysis.Devices implanted included the HeartMate II in 410 patients (81%) and HeartWareHVAD in 98 patients (19%). Based on availability of pre-operativeechocardiography, 491 patients were divided into 2 study groups according todegree of pre-operative MR; 189 patients (39%) had moderate to severe or greater MR (MR group), and 302 (61%) had less than moderate to severe MR (less MR group).Median age at operation (60 years in MR group vs 58 years in less MR group, p =0.19), male sex (78% in MR group vs 81% in less MR group, p = 0.42), and ischemicetiology (46% in MR group vs 51% in less MR group, p = 0.35) were similar betweengroups.RESULTS: There were 40 early deaths (7.9%), and follow-up was available in all468 early survivors for 641 patient-years of support. Patients in the MR grouphad higher late survival (2 years, 75%; 4 years, 65%) compared with patients inthe less MR group (2 years, 66%; 4 years, 48%; p < 0.04). Cox proportionalhazards model confirmed the independent interaction between MR and late survival (hazard ratio 0.62, p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: There was improved survival in patients with severe pre-operative MRafter continuous-flow LVAD implantation in our cohort. These findings may lendinsight into the possible lack of value of addressing significant MR at the time of LVAD implantation.Copyright Â© 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
