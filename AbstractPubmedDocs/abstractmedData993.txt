Intractable ventricular arrhythmia is arare but well-established indication for heart transplantation. We report a case of persistent ventricular fibrillation (VF) that was rescued by insertion ofperipheral veno-arterial ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whichprovided support for 30 h of continuous VF and subsequently permitted urgentheart transplantation.
