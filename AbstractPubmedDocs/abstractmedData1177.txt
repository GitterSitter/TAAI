There were no differences in treatment preferencesbetween NYHA II and NYHA IV patients. Patient preferences correlated poorly with MLHFQ, symptom and overall health scores. Although not statistically significant,there was a trend toward patients with worse quality of life and symptom scorespreferring more aggressive treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study identified two distinct groups of patients:one group preferring treatments that prolonged survival time and another groupthat favored strategies that improved quality of life but reduced survival time. Treatment preferences were independent of functional or symptom status,suggesting that preferences may be decided early in the course of illness.
