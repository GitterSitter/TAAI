Epub 2011Nov 25.Myocardial G protein receptor-coupled kinase expression correlates withfunctional parameters and clinical severity in advanced heart failure.Agüero J(1), Almenar L, Montó F, Oliver E, Sánchez-Lázaro I, Vicente D,Martínez-Dolz L, D'Ocon P, Rueda J, Salvador A.Author information: (1)Heart Failure and Transplant Unit, Department of Cardiology, La Fe University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. jaimeaguero30@hotmail.comBACKGROUND: In heart failure (HF), sympathetic hyperactivation inducesdeleterious effects in myocardial β-adrenergic signaling, with receptordown-regulation and desensitization mediated by G protein receptor-coupledkinases (GRKs). We hypothesised that changes in GRK isoforms may be associatedwith clinical status in advanced HF, using the Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) scale.METHODS: We included 31 patients with advanced HF undergoing transplantation.According to INTERMACS profiles, mRNA and protein levels of GRK isoforms in left ventricular (LV) myocardium were analyzed and compared with nonfailing LVsamples.RESULTS: In failing LV myocardium, GRK2 and GRK5 (but not GRK3) protein wasup-regulated compared with control samples. Among HF patients, an increase inGRK2 and GRK5 mRNA and protein abundance was observed in β-agonist-treatedpatients (vs β-blockers: P < .05) and in higher-risk INTERMACS status (profiles 2and 3 vs 4 and 5: P < .05). A significant negative correlation of GRK2 expressionwith LV stroke volume supported these findings.CONCLUSIONS: Increased GRK2 correlates with clinical severity using the INTERMACSscale and LV stroke volume, supporting it as a potential target in advanced HF.These changes are paralleled by GRK5 expression in the failing myocardium,suggesting a relevant role in human HF.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.
