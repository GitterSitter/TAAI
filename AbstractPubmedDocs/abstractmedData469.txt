LVAD support can cause reverse left ventricular (LV)remodeling that results in the improvement of LV function and allows LVADremoval. We present a case of successful removal of a DuraHeart LVAD because ofsufficient recovery of LV function. Before LVAD removal, we conducted an "LVADweaning test" by decreasing pump speed and performing an additional normal salineinfusion test. We consider that the LVAD weaning test can be used in place of the"pulsatile LVAD off test."
