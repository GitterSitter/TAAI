Eur J Heart Fail. 2010 May;12(5):420-2.AIMS: Myostatin inhibits myoblast differentiation/proliferation and may play arole in heart failure (HF) and reverse remodelling after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. This study sought to characterize myostatin expression andactivation in advanced HF before and after LVAD support.METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular tissue pairs were collected at LVADimplantation (core) and at cardiac transplantation/LVAD explantation in patients with advanced ischaemic (ICM-ischaemic cardiomyopathy) and non-ischaemic(DCM-dilated cardiomyopathy) HF. Normal cardiac tissue (control) was obtainedfrom hearts not placed for transplantation. Serum was collected independentlyfrom patients with stable DCM HF and from healthy controls. Full-length andcleaved propeptide myostatin levels were quantified by western blot analysis.Dilated cardiomyopathy propeptide levels at core were significantly higher thancontrol and significantly increased after LVAD support. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy propeptide levels were higher than control, but did not change after LVADsupport. No changes in full-length levels were seen. Serum myostatin levels were significantly higher in DCM HF patients than in healthy controls.CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical evidence that myostatin activation isincreased in HF. Myostatin may affect cardiac hypertrophy and may mediateregression of cellular hypertrophy after mechanical unloading.PMCID: PMC2857990
