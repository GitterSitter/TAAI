Thepreoperative cardiac index averaged 1.6 L/min per square meter with a pulmonarycapillary wedge pressure of 29 mm Hg. Because of a high incidence of hepatic orrenal dysfunction, or both (total bilirubin: 3.5 +/- 6.2 mg/dL; creatinine: 2.0+/- 1.3 mg/dL), biventricular support was used in most patients (28/32). A total of 30 preoperative and 4 perioperative variables were evaluated for theirassociation with survival and liver recovery.RESULTS: Nineteen patients (59.4%) survived to transplantation and 13 died. All19 patients undergoing transplantation were discharged alive with a 1-yearsurvival of 94.4%. All patients without liver recovery died of multiorganfailure. Direct and indirect bilirubin measurements were the only significantpredictors for survival to discharge (P = .036, .045); all other factors failedto show significance. As direct bilirubin levels increased (normal range, 3 timesnormal, and >3 times normal), patient survival decreased (82 %, 56%, and 33 %,respectively). In addition, bilirubin and liver enzyme levels before insertion ofthe assist device were significantly associated with liver recovery duringsupport with the device.CONCLUSION: In our patient population with ventricular assist devices, liverfunction is the most predictive factor of patient survival in bridging totransplantation.
