Thecontinuous-flow (C-LVAD) group included 12 patients bridged to transplant witheither a Jarvik 2000 or a Thoratec HeartMate II LVAD. The pulsatile (P-LVAD)group included 58 patients supported by a Thoratec HeartMate I LVAD. Follow-upwas up to 15 months after LVAD implantation. Average duration of LVAD support was370 +/- 182 days (range 180 to 754) for the C-LVAD group and 315 +/- 111 days(range 180 to 1,334) for the P-LVAD group.RESULTS: Patients from both groups were comparable for age, gender, body weight, cardiac index, ejection fraction, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinineclearance, albumin, total bilirubin, and transaminase levels before implantation.C-LVAD patients had a lower pre-operative hemoglobin than did P-LVAD patients(10.5 +/- 1.7 g/dl vs 12.2 +/- 1.9 g/dl; p = 0.01). In both groups, albumin,blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatinine clearance, total bilirubin, andtransminase levels either improved or stayed within the normal range at 6, 9, 12,and 15 months after LVAD implantation. Four of the 12 C-LVAD patients and 28 ofthe 58 P-LVAD patients underwent cardiac transplantation. Actuarial survival,censored for transplant, at 9, 12, and 15 months was 90% for the C-LVAD group and88%, 78%, and 74% for the P-LVAD group (p = not statistically significant).CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these data, it appears that continuous- andpulsatile-type LVADs provide adequate blood flow to maintain proper end-organfunction during prolonged circulatory support.
