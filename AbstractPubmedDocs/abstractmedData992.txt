Risk factors for infection wereearly on the former implanted period (odds ratio (OR) 3.30), Toyobo (OR 2.25),mechanical right heart support (OR 2.30) and cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR1.01). Left atrium as the inflow site was the risk factor for cerebrovascularevents (OR 2.84). Older age (OR 1.04) and mechanical right heart support (OR4.70) were risk factors for mortality. Risk factors for requiring mechanicalright heart support were preoperative extracorporeal membranous oxygenationsupport (OR 5.641), serum total bilirubin (OR 1.11) and serum creatinine (OR2.46). On the basis of the risk analysis for mortality, patients were dividedinto 2 subgroups (low and high risk) and the respective cumulative survival at 1 year after LVAS implantation was 75.2% and 25.0%.CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate selection of device, patient and the timing ofimplantation and less invasive operation are important for successful long-termLVAS support.
