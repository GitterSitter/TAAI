Epub 2014 Jan 25.Initial experience in Japan with HeartWare ventricular assist system.Nishi H(1), Toda K, Miyagawa S, Yoshikawa Y, Fukushima S, Saito S, Yoshioka D,Saito T, Ueno T, Sakaguchi T, Sawa Y.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School ofMedicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.We describe the first clinical experiences in Japan with the HeartWareventricular assist device (HVAD: HeartWare Inc., Miami Lakes, FL, USA) inpatients awaiting heart transplantation. Nine patients (6 males, 3 females; mean 33.5 ± 7.8 years; New York Heart Association class III or IV) received the HVADas a bridge to transplantation between 2011 and 2012. Six had dilatedcardiomyopathy, 2 secondary cardiomyopathy, and 1 dilated phase hypertrophiccardiomyopathy. All operations were uneventful, with a mean operation time of269 ± 77 min and cardiopulmonary bypass time of 121 ± 40 min. One required atemporary right ventricular assist device and was weaned on postoperative day 20,while another required pump exchange due to foreign tissue in the inflow. Meansupport duration was 245 ± 162 days (range: 50-535 days) and mean pump blood flowat 1 month postoperatively was 4.8 ± 0.8 l/min. There was no mortality after30 days, though 1 patient died during support due to cerebral hemorrhage.Presently, the others are waiting for heart transplantation without problems,except 1 who suffered from an active infection. There was no pump mechanicalfailure in any case. The HeartWare pump enables quick implantation withacceptable morbidity and mortality. Our preliminary results indicate that thisleft ventricular assist device is safe for circulatory assistance for hearttransplant candidates in Japan.
