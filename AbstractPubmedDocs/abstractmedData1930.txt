Vascular conductance was calculated asthe ratio of forearm blood flow and mean arterial pressure.RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure and cardiac output increased to normal values in the early and late recovery phases after LVAD implantation. Resting forearm bloodflow and vascular conductance were similar to normal subjects in the early andlate recovery phases after LVAD implantation. Peak forearm blood flow andvascular conductance were significantly less than control subjects in the earlypreoperative recovery phase (p < 0.05) but were similar to control subjects inthe late postoperative recovery phase after LVAD implantation.CONCLUSIONS: In spite of early normalization of cardiac output, mean arterialpressure, and resting forearm blood flow during chronic circulatory support with the LVAD, peak forearm blood flow, and peak vascular conductance did not increaseto values similar to those observed in normal subjects until the latepostoperative recovery period. The delayed effect of the LVAD on metabolicvasodilation may be related to flow-dependent changes in the peripheralvasculature of patients with heart failure.
