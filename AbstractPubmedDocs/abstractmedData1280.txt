In thepresent study, we describe outcomes of DT in the post-REMATCH era in the UnitedStates.METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study included 280 patients who underwentHeartMate XVE LVAD implantation between November 2001 and December 2005. Apreoperative risk score for in-hospital mortality after LVAD implantation wasestablished in 222 patients with complete data. All patients were followed upuntil death or December 2006. The 1-year survival after LVAD implantation was56%. The in-hospital mortality after LVAD surgery was 27%. The main causes ofdeath included sepsis, right heart failure, and multiorgan failure. The mostimportant determinants of in-hospital mortality were poor nutrition,hematological abnormalities, markers of end-organ or right ventriculardysfunction, and lack of inotropic support. Stratification of DT candidates into low (n=65), medium (n=111), high (n=28), and very high (n=18) risk on the basisof the risk score calculated from these predictors corresponded with 1-yearsurvival rates of 81%, 62%, 28%, and 11%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate selection of candidates and timing of LVAD implantation are critical for improved outcomes of DT. Patients with advanced heart failurewho are referred for DT before major complications of heart failure develop have the best chance of achieving an excellent 1-year survival with LVAD therapy.
