The increased applicability and excellent results with LVADs have revolutionized the treatment options available for suchpatients. Success with LVADs as bridge-to-transplant therapy has led to theirsuccessful use as an alternate to a transplant (ie, as destination therapy [DT]).The use of these devices as DT represents a relatively newer but growingindication. Until recently, most patients who have undergone LVAD implantationhave been supported by pulsatile devices. Newer continuous-flow (CF) pumps haveresulted in superior outcomes, including significantly reduced complication rateswith improved durability over first-generation pulsatile design pumps. However,as with all new technology, the newer LVADs have introduced management challengesthat were either unimportant or absent with pulsatile LVADs. This article reviewsthe current state of left ventricular devices, focusing on the CF pumps thatcurrently dominate the field, including clinical outcomes, the physiologic andpathologic effects that are associated with CF pumps, and their unique managementissues and complications.
