Ann Thorac Surg. 1992 Dec;54(6):1059-63; discussion 1063-4.Postcardiotomy centrifugal mechanical ventricular support.Golding LA(1), Crouch RD, Stewart RW, Novoa R, Lytle BW, McCarthy PM, Taylor PC, Loop FD, Cosgrove DM 3rd.Author information: (1)Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195.From August 1979 through August 1991, 91 patients were supported with centrifugalmechanical ventricular assist. Major indications for its use were postcardiotomy ventricular failure (79) or as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (12). Inpostcardiotomy use (0.2% of all cardiac procedures), there were 54 male (68.4%)and 25 female patients (31.6%) with a mean age of 54.8 years and a mean duration of use of 3.56 days (range, 1 hour to 19 days). Forty-nine patients (62%) weresuccessfully weaned, and 20 (25.3%) were hospital survivors. In 57 patients thedevice was inserted to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass, whereas in 22 it wasemployed later in the postoperative period because of low cardiac output orsudden arrest. Thirty-four (59.6%) of the 57 patients in the former group wereweaned, and 15 (26.3%) were discharged, results similar to those in the lattergroup with 15 (68.2%) weaned and 5 (22.7%) discharged. Morbidity associated with use of centrifugal blood pumps included bleeding (87.3%; mean transfusionrequirement, 53.2 units), renal failure (46.8%), cerebrovascular accident(12.7%), thromboembolism (12.7%), and hepatic insufficiency (12.7%). After a meanfollow-up of 45.4 months (range, 2 to 142 months), 7 patients had died (35% late mortality), 1 patient is in functional class IV, and all others are in functionalclass I or II. Lower survival was associated with biventricular failure and renalfailure but not with age or sex of the patient.
