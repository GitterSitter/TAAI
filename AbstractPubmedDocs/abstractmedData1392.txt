It isbecoming more frequent due to the increasing use of marginal donors. In thesedifficult cases a ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to recovery or as abridge to re-transplantation can be used. The recently introduced LevitronixCentrimag centrifugal pump might be an ideal device for this purpose.METHODS: In this study we describe 2 patients with primary graft failure whoreceived a Levitronix in the last 2 years, immediately after failure to wean fromcardiopulmonary bypass. Biventricular support was necessary in both patients.RESULTS: One patient was successfully re-transplanted after 2 days of support,and subsequently discharged. After 16 months she has good ventricular functionwith no symptoms of cardiac failure. The second patient showed signs ofventricular recovery after a few days and was weaned from the device after 7days, with good graft function. No device-related complications were recorded.After 14 days he was discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU), and apost-operative echocardiogram showed normal dimensions, good ejection fractionand no valvular regurgitation. He was discharged home 26 days after thetransplant.CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the Levitronix Centrimag seems to be safe andeffective in the treatment of primary graft failure, achieving effectivecirculatory support and ventricular off-loading. We propose its use in isolatedor biventricular graft failure either as bridge to re-transplant or as a bridgeto recovery.
