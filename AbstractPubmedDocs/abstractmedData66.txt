Cellularproteases, such as cathepsins, are involved in the progression of HF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of cathepsin system in HF patients supported by LVAD, in order to determine their involvement in cardiac remodeling.METHODS: The expression of cysteine (CatB, CatK, CatL, CatS) and serine cathepsin(CatG), and relative inhibitors (Cystatin B, C and SerpinA3, respectively) wasdetermined in cardiac biopsies of 22 patients submitted to LVAD (pre-LVAD) andcompared with: 1) control stable chronic HF patients on medical therapy at themoment of heart transplantation without prior LVAD (HT, n = 7); 2) patientssupported by LVAD at the moment of transplantation (post-LVAD, n = 6).RESULTS: The expression of cathepsins and their inhibitors was significantlyhigher in pre-LVAD compared to the HT group and LVAD induced a further increasein the cathepsin system. Significant positive correlations were observed between cardiac expression of cathepsins and their inhibitors as well as inflammatorycytokines. In the pre-LVAD group, a relationship of cathepsins with dilatativeetiology and length of hospitalization was found.CONCLUSIONS: A parallel activation of cathepsins and their inhibitors wasobserved after LVAD support. The possible clinical importance of thesemodifications is confirmed by their relation with patients' outcome. A betterdiscovery of these pathways could add more insights into the cardiac remodelingduring HF.PMCID: PMC4274696
