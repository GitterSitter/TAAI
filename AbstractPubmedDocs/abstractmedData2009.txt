Nihon Kyobu Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 1994 Oct;42(10):1984-9.[A successful use of VAS for bridge to heart transplantation after overseatransportation in a 18-year-old patient with dilated cardiomyopathy].[Article in Japanese]Matsuda H(1), Kaneko M, Masai T, Matsuwaka R, Miyamoto Y, Sakakibara T.Author information: (1)First Department of Surgery, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.An 18-year-old boy with dilated cardiomyopathy developed a relatively rapiddeterioration and went into severe congestive heart failure. After short-whileuse of percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system (PCPS) and IABP, LVAS wasindicated because of persisting low cardiac output syndrome and deterioration of organ functions. An LVAS (TOYOBO) was implanted on June 26, 1992 in a fashion of left atrium to ascending aorta bypass. Satisfactory circulatory support (flowrates of 4-5 L/min) was achieved resulting in complete recovery of the organfunctions. After two months of LVAS support, the patient was transported toU.S.A.. The LVAS system was working well without any problems during 17 hrsflight under low atmospheric pressure (0.8 atm) in the plane. The patientsuccessfully underwent heart transplantation (HTx) at Texas Heart Institute after119 days support of LVAS. The patient is doing well enjoying active life afterHTx. This is the first case of successful bridge use of extracorporeal LVAS toHTx in Japan.
