However, the effect of hemodynamic unloading with a LVAD on myocardial viability and LV function in chronically supported LVAD patients hasnot been fully characterized. We aimed to develop a non-invasive imaging protocolto serially quantify native cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viabilitywhile at reduced LVAD support.METHODS: Clinically stable (n = 18) ambulatory patients (83% men, median age, 61 years) supported by a HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD (mediandurations of heart failure 4.6 years and LVAD support 7 months) were evaluated byechocardiography and technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)-sestamibi single photon emissioncomputed tomography (SPECT) imaging at baseline and after an interval of 2 to 3months. Echocardiographic measures of LV size and function, including speckletracking-derived circumferential strain, were compared between ambulatory andreduced LVAD support at baseline and between baseline and follow-up at reducedLVAD support. The extent of myocardial viability by SPECT was compared betweenbaseline and follow-up at reduced LVAD support.RESULTS: With reduction in LVAD speeds (6,600 rpm; interquartile range: 6,200,7,400 rpm), LV size increased, LV systolic function remained stable, and filling pressures nominally worsened. After a median 2.1 months, cardiac structure,function, and the extent of viable myocardium, globally and regionally, wasunchanged on repeat imaging while at reduced LVAD speed.CONCLUSIONS: In clinically stable chronically supported LVAD patients, intrinsic cardiac structure, function, and myocardial viability did not significantlychange over the pre-specified time frame. Echocardiographic circumferentialstrain and (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT myocardial viability imaging may provideuseful non-invasive end points for the assessment of cardiac structure andfunction, particularly for phase II studies of novel therapies aimed at promotingreverse remodeling and myocardial recovery in LVAD patients.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
