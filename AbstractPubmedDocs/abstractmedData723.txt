[Epub ahead of print]Update on the Management of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure.Majure DT(1), Teerlink JR.Author information: (1)University of California, San Francisco, Box 0131, 505 Parnassus Ave., RoomU127a, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA, DMajure@medicine.ucsf.edu.OPINION STATEMENT: Treatment goals of acute decompensated heart failure are todecrease congestion, afterload, and neurohormonal activation in order to improve hemodynamics and symptoms and, perhaps, reduce in-hospital events,re-hospitalizations, and mortality while avoiding toxicities of therapy such ashypotension, arrhythmias, and renal dysfunction. Relief of congestion throughintravenous loop diuretics is a mainstay of therapy. In cases where diuretics arenot effective, ultrafiltration may be used to achieve euvolemia. Beta-blockersshould be continued or reduced in dose at admission but should not typically beheld. In patients with normotensive or hypertensive heart failure, afterloadreduction with vasodilators should be instituted at presentation. Choice of aparticular agent such as nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or nesiritide depends onpatient characteristics such as presence of ischemia, degree of congestion, andrenal function. Nitroprusside may be preferable in patients with congestion andlow cardiac output, but with caution in patients with significant hypotension.Intravenous inotropes/inodilators, such as dobutamine and milrinone, should belimited to hypotensive patients with evidence of poor tissue perfusion. Milrinonemay be preferable in patients who have significant pulmonary venous hypertension.In patients who do not respond to initial medical therapy and who are candidates for either cardiac transplantation or destination left ventricular assist device,mechanical circulatory support should be considered early, prior to thedevelopment of end-organ damage.
