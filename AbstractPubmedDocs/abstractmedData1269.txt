Fifty-five patients with NewYork Heart Association functional class IV symptoms who failed weaning frominotropic support were offered a Novacor LVAD. Eighteen of these patients did notreceive an LVAD owing to patient preference (n = 14) or unavailability of thedevice (n = 4) but consented to follow-up and constitute a contemporaneouscontrol group.RESULTS: The LVAD and OMT patients were well matched for demographic and disease severity measures, except OMT patients had a lower mean serum sodium (128 mg/dlvs. 134 mg/dl; p = 0.001) and a higher mean blood urea nitrogen concentration (59vs. 40; p = 0.02). The LVAD-treated patients had superior survival rates at 6months (46% vs. 22%; p = 0.03) and 12 months (27% vs. 11%; p = 0.02). Adverseevent rates were higher in the OMT group. Eighty-five percent of the LVAD-treatedpatients had minimal or no heart failure symptoms. Five LVAD patients and 1 OMTpatient improved sufficiently while on therapy to qualify for cardiactransplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Inotrope-dependent heart failure patients who are ineligible fortransplantation have a high short-term mortality rate and derive a significantsurvival advantage from "destination" mechanical circulatory support.
