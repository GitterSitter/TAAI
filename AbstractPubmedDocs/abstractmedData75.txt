However, the importance of this newertechnique for chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still open to discussion. To date, there are few studies that extensively explore thepsychological and cognitive profiles of patient with ventricular assist devices(VADs).METHODS: We studied the psychological aspects, quality of life (QOL) andcognitive profiles of 19 patients with HF before VAD implantation and then attwo, five and 16 months post-implantation.RESULTS: Our results showed that after VAD implantation, patients did not showany psychopathological problems such as anxiety and/or depression. Moreinterestingly, despite the constant risk of neurological events determined by thecontinuous-blood-flow pump (CBFP), patients' cognitive functioning did notworsen. In fact, significant enhancements were observed over time.CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and cognitive deficits are common in advanced HF andoften worsen over time. Appropriately designed and randomized studies are needed to demonstrate whether earlier VAD implantation is warranted to arrest cognitive decline and encourage better post-implantation adaptation.PMCID: PMC4229472
