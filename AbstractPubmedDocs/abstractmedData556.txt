The average clinicalprofile of the Spanish heart transplantation patient in 2011 was that of a53-year-old male who had been diagnosed with nonrevascularizable ischemic heartdisease accompanied by severely depressed ventricular function and poorfunctional status. The implanted heart was typically from a 38-year-old donor whohad died from brain hemorrhage. The average waiting list time was 122 days. Mean survival time has progressively increased over the years. For the overall series,the probability of survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 77%, 66%, 53%, and 39%,respectively, whereas over the past 5 years the probability of survival at 1 and 5 years was 80% and 73%, respectively. The most frequent cause of death was acutegraft failure (16%), followed by infection (15.6%), the combination of graftvascular disease and sudden death (14%), tumors (12.3%) and acute rejection(7.7%).CONCLUSIONS: The survival rates obtained in Spain from heart transplantation,especially in recent years, place heart transplantation as the treatment ofchoice in irreversible heart failure patients without other established medicalor surgical options.Copyright © 2012 Sociedad Española de Cardiología.
