Critical care nurses are integrally involved in the care ofpatients with severe heart failure who may benefit from cardiac transplantationand are in a special position to recognize potential candidates fortransplantation. Understanding patient selection criteria, the evaluationprocess, and how patients are managed while awaiting transplantation is key tothe knowledge and skills required. It is also important to understand theallocation of donor hearts as part of this process. The waiting period for asuitable donor heart can be long and a patient's condition may deteriorate,requiring an increase in pharmacologic bridges with intravenous inotropic agents or mechanical bridges with circulatory assist devices. Critical care nursesbecome important as a personal bridge to transplantation through their education of patients and families and helping them cope with their fears during thewaiting period. Critical care nurses who possess knowledge of patient selectionand organ allocation processes along with the skills of caring for this complexpatient population can contribute to better outcomes for patients with heartfailure who may be candidates for cardiac transplantation.
