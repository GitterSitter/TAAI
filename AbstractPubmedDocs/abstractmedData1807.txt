The patient quickly improves and is brought in an optimal state for transplantation. A fewpatients have been able to omit the subsequent heart transplantation. Thepatient's own heart improved during the treatment and the native heart functionedagain after the system was explanted. The main complications during treatment arebleeding, infection, thromboembolic events and systemic failure. Permanent, fullyimplantable mechanical circulatory pumps are under development--which may herald the beginning of a whole new era for treatment of cardiac failure.
