Lacking prospectiverandomized studies for different devices, we believe that comparison of riskfactor analyses may give the surgeon a tool more powerful than current studiesfor matching a patient with an appropriate device. In this paper, we report risk factor profiles for bridge to transplantation with the CardioWest totalartificial heart and summarize reports for other devices.METHODS: A multiinstitutional risk factor analysis of the CardioWest totalartificial heart, as a bridge to transplantation in 81 patients, was conducted.Univariate analyses were performed on 43 preimplantation prognostic factors. Fromthis group, eight factors were chosen for multivariate analysis. Our results werecompared with all recent risk factor analyses for other devices.RESULTS: Independent predictors for death at three intervals by multivariateanalysis were as follows: "implant to transplant": history of smoking (oddsratio, 34); "implant to 30 days after transplant": history of smoking (oddsratio, 10.00), prothrombin time greater than 16 seconds (odds ratio, 4.76); and"implant to 1 year after transplant": prothrombin time greater than 16 seconds(odds ratio, 3.85). The major difference between this experience and multiplereported experiences with left ventricular assist devices is that for leftventricular assist devices, but not for the temporary CardioWest total artificialheart, right heart failure, high central venous pressure, and being on aventilator (with or without sepsis) were independent predictors of mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for bridge to transplantation with the CardioWest totalartificial heart are different from those reported for left ventricular assistdevices. Recognition of these risk factor differences may facilitate appropriate device selection.
