Hewas deemed ineligible for heart transplantation and a left ventricular assistdevice (LVAD) was thought to be high risk due to persistent right heart failure. To determine if he could tolerate left ventricular support alone, a trans-septal cannula was placed via the left femoral vein. Transition from veno-arterial ECMO to isolated left-sided support allowed for risk assessment for LVAD implantation and extubation, providing the patient an opportunity to participate in furtherclinical decision making.
