Epub2013 May 2.The impact of mechanical circulatory support on outcomes in paediatric hearttransplantation.Botha P(1), Solana R, Cassidy J, Parry G, Kirk R, Hasan A, Griselli M.Author information: (1)Department of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle uponTyne, UK.Comment in    Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2013 Nov;44(5):840-2.OBJECTIVES: Internationally, the number of donors for cardiac transplantation hasremained static, while the number of patients requiring transplantation forcongenital heart disease (CHD) has increased. Although the availability ofmechanical circulatory support (MCS) may increase the number of transplantsperformed by reducing deaths while waiting, it may also lead to increasedmorbidity post-transplantation. We sought to assess the impact of mechanicalsupport on post-transplant outcomes in a single centre.METHODS: We assessed the outcomes of paediatric (age â‰¤16 years) hearttransplantation in a single unit in the era of mechanical support (1998-2012) by retrospective cohort study. Outcomes before (1998-2005) and after (2005-2012) theroutine use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR device were contrasted.RESULTS: A total of 167 patients underwent heart transplantation during thisperiod. The diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathy in 61.7%, two-ventricle CHD in11.4%, single ventricle CHD in 16.8% and miscellaneous in 10.1%. Sixty-nine (41%)were bridged to transplant by mechanical support; with extracorporeal membraneoxygenation in 19 (28%), ventricular assist device in 40 (58%) and a combination in 10 (14.0%). Post-transplant mortality at 30 days was significantly greater in those supported by MCS than without (7 vs 1%, P < 0.05), and a greater proportionof patients had neurological (23 vs 8%, P < 0.01) and major respiratory sequelae (20 vs 4%, P < 0.001). There was no significant increase in the need forpost-transplant mechanical support (10 vs 6%, P = 0.3) in those supported priorto transplant. The number of transplants performed increased from 67 in 1998-2005to 100 in the most recent era (2005-2012), and an increased proportion of thesepatients have been supported mechanically prior to transplantation (51 vs 27%, P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Along with strategies to increase donor utilization, MCS has allowed an increase in cardiac transplant activity at the expense of a higher earlymortality and morbidity.
