De Gasperis, Niguarda Ca'GrandaHospital, Milan, Italy. agaratti@tiscali.itThe Impella Recover left direct (LD) is a new intravascular microaxial bloodpump, intended as a short-term mechanical support especially in case of acutelyreduced left ventricular function. From September 2002 to October 2004, Impellawas used to support 12 patients: six patients were supported as bridge-to-hearttransplant (HTx); three patients were treated for fulminant acute myocarditis,and three patients for postcardiotomy low-output syndrome. Mean support time was 8.8 +/- 2.3 days. Overall mortality was 50%. Four patients were successfullyHTxed; two patients supported as bridge-to-HTx died on left ventricular assistdevice. Two patients with myocarditis died of septic shock; two patients in thegroup of postcardiotomy died of multiorgan failure. The latter two patients were slowly weaned from the device, and at 3-months follow-up showed good improvement of the left ventricular function. Our initial experience with Impella Recover LD as mechanical support for patients in cardiogenic shock of various etiology ispromising, yielding a good survival in a population of particularly compromisedpatients.
