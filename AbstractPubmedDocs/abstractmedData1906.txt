Increased ventilatory support improves gas exchange, but may compromiseventricular function. From July 1994 to February 1997, nine patients weresupported with veno-venous (V-V) extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for postcardiotomy respiratory failure. The mean age was 53 +/- 13 years (range: 37-80years), and eight (89%) were men. Pre-operatively, five of nine (56%) wereintubated, three (33%) were supported with an intra-aortic balloon pump, and five(56%) were on veno-arterial ECLS. Four patients were post left ventricular assistdevice (LVAD) implantation, one each after resection of an aortic aneurysm,mitral valve replacement and bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement, andpulmonary embolectomy and heart transplantation. Mean duration of support was 2+/- 1 days (range: 1-4 days). Patients were intubated for a mean of 2 +/- 22 days(range: 4-71 days). One patient (11%) required mediastinal re-explorationsecondary to bleeding, two patients underwent hemodialysis or ultrafiltration,and seven (77%) developed bacterial pneumonia. All patients were weaned fromECLS. Six patients (67%) survived to hospital discharge. Cause of death wasmultiple organ failure in two patients; one died from respiratory failure. V-VECLS is a useful alternative to open sternotomy for ventilatory inducedhemodynamic compromise post cardiotomy, especially in patients with LVADs.
