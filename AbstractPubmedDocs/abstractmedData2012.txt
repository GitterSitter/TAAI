Pre-operative statusand outcome.Schiessler A(1), Friedel N, Weng Y, Heinz U, Hummel M, Hetzer R.Author information: (1)Klinik für Herz, Thorax- und Gefässchirurgie, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin,Germany.Between July 1988 and December 1993, 118 patients waiting for hearttransplantation underwent mechanical circulatory support by an extracorporeal,pneumatically driven assist device (the Berlin Heart System) to maintain asufficient circulation and to restore impaired organ function (109 patientsrequiring a biventricular assist device [BVAD], 9 patients requiring a leftventricular assist device [LVAD]). Before implantation, all patients were insevere cardiogenic shock, despite maximum inotropic support; all had end organfailure. The aim of a retrospective study in 70 patients (for whom pre-operative parameters were available) was to identify patients who would permit from thisprocedure and could undergo successful transplantation. After a mean bridgingtime of 34.8 days, 75 (63.5%) patients underwent transplant, and 52 (44.1%) were discharged. Pre-operative coagulation parameters (fibrinogen, antithrombin III,platelet count, and kinetics) were correlated to post-operative blood loss andoutcome. Patients who had no or mild coagulation disorders because of a shorterphase of low cardiac output before implantation of the assist device proved togain faster restitution of organ function and most underwent transplantation. As a result of these observations, implantation of an assist device beforeshock-induced coagulopathy could occur allowed a greater number of patients toundergo successful bridging and be discharged after heart transplantation.
