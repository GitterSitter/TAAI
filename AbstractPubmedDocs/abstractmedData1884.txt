Althoughthe incidence in the general adult population in the Western world is between 1% and 2%, the frequency increases rapidly in the elderly affecting more than 10% ofthe individuals over the age of 75 years. The treatment of patients withend-stage chronic heart failure (CHF) is difficult. The two major goals in thetreatment of heart failure are to increase the duration (slow its progression)and quality of life (relief of symptoms). Understanding the severity of thesyndrome of heart failure in terms of its prognosis can be particularly importantin planning long-term management and in counselling the patient. The introductionof aggressive interventional therapies such as active haemodynamic support withventricular assist devices, or heart transplantation emphasizes the importance ofquantitating the risk of death in order to properly select patients for thesemore aggressive treatments. In large-scale trials it has been possible toidentify markers that serve as significant predictors of mortality. Of these, thedetection and quantification of neurohumoral activation have gained the mostrecent attention. Here, we discuss some of the prognostic tools in current usefor heart failure patients and their applicability to patients with advancedheart failure.
