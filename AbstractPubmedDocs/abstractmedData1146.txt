Ventricular assistdevices are being used with increasing frequency in the pediatric population, andnewer devices allow even young infants to be supported. Ventricular assist deviceimplantation and maintenance, however, is quite expensive, and thecost-effectiveness of VAD use in adults has been questioned. To date, an economicanalysis of VAD support in children has not been undertaken.METHODS: We used Pediatric Health Information System, an administrative database of the Child Health Corporation of America (a consortium of Children's Hospitals in North America), to determine the outcomes and costs related to VAD use inchildren. Data on patients younger than 18 years of age from 2002 to 2007 werereviewed. Hospital charges were converted to costs based on cost-to-chargeratios. Projected survival for subjects who were successfully bridged to hearttransplant was derived from published data. The model assumed that if a VADstrategy were not used, the majority of subjects would have requiredextracorporeal membrane oxygenation support as a bridge to transplantation.Cost-utility was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life years saved. Allfuture costs and benefits were discounted at 3%.RESULTS: There were 145 children who underwent VAD implantation at 19 centers in North America. The median age at admission was 8.5 years; the range was newbornto 17.7 years. The median duration of VAD support was 43 days (range, 1 to 465days). Ninety-four patients (65%) survived to heart transplantation. Thirty-nine (27%) patients died during hospitalization. There were 12 patients (8%) who hadVAD explantation and survival to hospital discharge. The mean hospital cost was$624,798. When compared with a strategy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenationsupport, the calculated cost-utility for VAD as a bridge to transplantation was$119,937 per quality-adjusted life year saved. When key assumptions were changed,the cost-utility varied from $88,304 to $282,320 per quality-adjusted life yearsaved.CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular assist devices allow an effective bridge to hearttransplantation in children. Under base-case assumptions, the cost-effectiveness ratios exceed the threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. Thecost-utility of this strategy, however, is comparable to a number of otherlife-saving technologies.
