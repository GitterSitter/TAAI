Group 2,consisting of 11 consecutive patients (age 50 ± 11 years; 6 men) with sinusrhythm and "true" decompensation, was used to create "critical values" of WI.There were no demographic or somatic (weight and height) differences between the groups. The follow-up period of ambulatory patients was 31 ± 8 months.Non-invasive WI was studied in the common carotid artery. Complete invasive andnon-invasive data were also recorded on the day of investigation. Duringfollow-up 44 pts were lost; there were 15 cardiac deaths (10%), life-savingventricular assist device implantation in 10 (6.6%) and transplantation in 19(12.7%). For statistical purposes this group was named the "events" Group B (n = 44). A predisposing factor for events (death, "true" decompensation and "urgent" transplantation in ambulatory patients) was low first peak ("cut-off value"assessed in Group 2 < 4100 mmHg*s³) (OR 45.6, CI 14.5-143.3, p < 0.001). Lesspowerful predictors of the risk of deterioration were pulmonary capillarypressure (PCP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and E/A mitral waverelation (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The new ventricular-arterial coupling parameter 1st peak of WI canpotentially be used to distinguish patients at high risk for true deteriorationand death. This parameter can be used to predict the need for assist deviceimplantation.PMCID: PMC4031013
