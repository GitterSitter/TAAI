This studyinvestigates the potential role of stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor(c-Kit) in promoting the recruitment of mast cells during heart failure and afterLVAD support.METHODS: Myocardial samples were collected from 10 end-stage heart failurepatients undergoing LVAD implantation (pre-LVAD) and paired with samples taken atthe time of orthotopic heart transplantation (post-LVAD). Biopsies of normalhearts served as controls. We assessed gene expression of SCF and c-Kit. Inaddition, we stained for SCF, c-Kit, tryptase and chymase, and utilized in situhybridization to determine the origin of SCF.RESULTS: SCF mRNA and overall mast cell numbers were significantly increased (p <0.01/p < 0.001) after LVAD support as compared with paired heart failure tissues.c-Kit mRNA was significantly increased post-LVAD compared with normal tissues (p < 0.05). The c-Kit protein was expressed only in cardiac mast cells. SCF mRNA wasfound in endothelial cells, myocytes and interstitial cells, as confirmed byantibody staining.CONCLUSIONS: LVADs cause an increase of SCF and c-Kit gene expression, whichcoincides with a surge of mast cells after ventricular unloading. This suggeststhat SCF functions as an important mediator for the recruitment of mast cells to the mechanically unloaded human heart.
