All patients on the Eurotransplanthigh-urgent status (HU) have to be treated in intensive care units and have to berelisted every 8 weeks. Long-term continuous inotropes are associated withtachyphylaxia, arrhythmias and even increased mortality. In this retrospectiveanalysis, we report our single center experience with HU patients treated withintermittent inotropes as a bridging therapy.METHODS AND RESULTS: 117 consecutive adult HU candidates were treated at ourintensive care heart failure unit between 2008 and 2013, of whom 14 patients(12 %) were stabilized and delisted during follow-up. In the remaining 103patients (age 42 ± 15 years), different inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone,adrenaline, noradrenaline, levosimendan) were administered based on the patient'sspecific characteristics. After initial recompensation, patients were weaned frominotropes as soon as possible. Thereafter, intermittent inotropes (over 3-4 days)were given as a predefined weekly (until 2011) or 8 weekly regimen (from 2011 to 2013). In 57 % of these patients, additional regimen-independent inotropicsupport was necessary due to hemodynamic instabilities. Fourteen patients (14 %) needed a left- or biventricular assist device; 14 patients (14 %) died whilewaiting and 87 (84 %) received heart transplants after 87 ± 91 days. Cumulative 3and 12 months survival of all 103 patients was 75 and 67 %, respectively.CONCLUSION: Intermittent inotropes in HU patients are an adequate strategy as abridge to transplant; the necessity for assist devices was low. These dataprovide the basis for a prospective multicenter trial of intermittent inotropesin patients on the HU waiting list.
