Hillenbrand Biomedical Engineering Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.This study describes the use of electrical impedance Z to continuously measurethe stroke volume SV of a skeletal muscle-powered ventricle (SMV). An SMV wasconstructed surgically in four anaesthetised dogs. The rectus abdominis (twodogs) or latissimus dorsi (two dogs) muscle was wrapped around a compressiblepouch, the ends of which were connected to a saline-filled (0.9 per cent) mockcirculation. The motor nerves to the muscle were stimulated to produce tetaniccontractions at a rate of 10 min-1. Z was measured between brass sleeveelectrodes within the end conduits of the pouch. To derive a simple expressionrelating pouch volume V to Z, the pouch was represented as two truncated coneswith their bases joined. For V ranging from 53 to 103 ml, the relationshipbetween Z and 1/square root of V was nearly linear; i.e. Z = m(1/square root ofV) + b. Impedance-derived stroke volume SV (delta Z) was calculated using thislinear approximation and the impedance measured just before and after musclecontraction. The stroke volume SV (EM) ejected by the pouch during musclecontraction was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. The linear regressioncoefficients ranged from 0.99 to 2.55; the correlation coefficients ranged from0.90 to 0.98. In general, SV(delta Z) tracked SV(EM) very well, although SV(deltaZ) tended to overestimate SV(EM).
