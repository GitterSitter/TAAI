The apoptotic cell is not inevitably committedto death, and appropriate therapy like left ventricular assist device (LVAD)support could offer a rescue of cellular functions. Literature data regarding themodulation of the apoptotic process during LVAD support are still controversial.METHODS: To assess whether LVAD implantation modifies the apoptotic profile inthe heart, cardiac tissue was collected from end-stage HF patients before LVADimplant (pre-LVAD, n=22) and at LVAD removal (post-LVAD, n=6) and from stable HF patients on medical therapy without prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at hearttransplantation as control. Caspase (Casp)-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and Hsp72 cardiac mRNA and protein expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting (WB) in the three groups of patients. Immunohistochemicalanalysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingassay, and DNA laddering analysis were performed; cellular size and interstitial fibrosis content were also determined.RESULTS: All the apoptotic indices were increased in the post-LVAD group comparedto pre-LVAD, specially antiapoptotic Hsp72 and proapoptotic Bax (Hsp72: 3.27±0.41vs. 0.76±0.14, P<.001; Bax: 2.15±0.38 vs. 1.10 ± 0.29, P=.035; post-LVAD vs.pre-LVAD, respectively). The significant increase in Hsp72 was confirmed by WBand immunohistochemical analysis.CONCLUSION: LVAD appears to induce an activation of apoptotic mediators, mainlyat the mitochondrial level, while the following activation of Casp-3 is reducedby the significant increase of Hsp72, whose enhancement could be an importantfactor in cardiac remodeling associated with LVAD support.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
