Mark.Slaughter@louisville.eduBACKGROUND: Direct measurement of blood flow output has been incorporated intoventricular assist devices (VADs), but long-term reliability of the additionaldevice components has raised concerns regarding sensor drift and failure. As analternative approach, the HeartMate II axial VAD (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) estimates device flow output from power consumption and rotational speed of thedevice motor. This study evaluated the accuracy of HeartMate II flow estimationat the time of implantation.METHODS: In 20 patients, intraoperative blood flow measurement of the HeartMateII flow estimator was compared with flow values obtained with an ultrasonic flow probe placed around the device outflow graft. Estimated and measured VAD flowdata were simultaneously recorded and digitally stored while the device motorspeed varied from 7,800 to 11,000 rpm and while achieving device flow outputs of 2 to 7 liters/min. Estimated and measured flows were compared using linearregression analyses and root mean square error.RESULTS: HeartMate II flow estimation (FE) demonstrated a linear correlation withultrasonic flow probe (FP) measurements: FE = 0.74 FP + 0.99 (R(2) = 0.56, p =0.0001). A root mean square error of 0.8 liters/min was observed between flowestimation and direct flow measurement and suggests a 15% to 20% difference atflows of 4 of 6 liters/min.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HeartMate II flow estimation may be used to provide directional information for trend purposes rather than absolute valuesof device blood flow output. Patient management should include but not be limitedto this information.
