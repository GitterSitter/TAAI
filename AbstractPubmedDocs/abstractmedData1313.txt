De Gasperis Departmentof Cardiology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy. emanuele.catena@tin.itMechanical circulatory support is, nowadays, a well established treatmentmodality for end stage heart failure. Patients candidate for cardiactransplantation who decompensate while awaiting graft can be supported bylong-term left ventricular assist devices (long-term LVAD). These devices areintracorporeal pumps, expensive and complicated to install, but offer theadvantages of a high cardiac output and a good patient mobility. Echocardiographyis usually applied to any kind of LVAD to accomplish: preoperative evaluation to exclude contraindications, intraoperative when circulatory support starts toassess left ventricular (LV) filling and unloading, postoperative evaluationduring intensive care unit course to prevent hypovolemia, cardiac tamponade andright ventricular failure, controls during assistance for suspected devicemalfunction. Short-term devices are utilized as acute support after the initialresuscitation of the patient. These devices are bedside extracorporeal pumps,less expensive and less complicated to install. They provide a brief butsufficient time to wait patient recovery (''bridge to recovery'') or to evaluate further therapies (''bridge to long-term device'' or ''bridge totransplantation''). Echocardiography has an important role during implantation toguide cannulae positioning, to prevent insufficient LV unloading, to detect echo contrast enhancement with blood stagnation and intracardiac clot formation, totitrate pharmacologic support, and to assess myocardial recovery.
