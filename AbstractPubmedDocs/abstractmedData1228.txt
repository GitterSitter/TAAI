Curr Opin Cardiol. 2008 Mar;23(2):91-6. doi: 10.1097/HCO.0b013e3282f4cd9c.New devices for pediatric mechanical circulatory support.Pauliks LB(1), Undar A.Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Penn State College of Medicine, Penn StateChildren's Hospital, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033-0850, USA.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In adult patients with advanced heart failure, mechanicalcirculatory support devices (MCSDs) offer a valid treatment option. MCSDs canserve as a bridge to transplant, bridge to recovery or destination therapy. Inthe REMATCH trial, MCSDs outperformed medical management for long-term support ofend-stage heart failure. Until recently, pediatric patients could not fullybenefit from this development due to lack of suitable devices. This reviewprovides an overview of pediatric MCSDs currently available in the US and thosein the development stage. We discuss the emerging role of extracorporeal membraneoxygenation compared with MCSDs.RECENT FINDINGS: Small patients with a body-surface area below 0.7 m now haveaccess to the pediatric Berlin Heart Excor. For larger children, several adultMCSDs may be suitable, including the Abiomed BVS-5000, Thoratec, HeartMate andDeBakey MCSD. Five pediatric MCSDs supported by NIH contracts issued in 2004 are now in preclinical testing. Other pediatric MCSDs are already in clinical useabroad on a small scale.SUMMARY: There is mounting experience with MCSDs in children with advanced heart failure. MCSDs will increasingly have to be considered as a treatment option for pediatric heart-transplant candidates and may serve as a bridge to recovery.
