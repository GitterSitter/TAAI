RHF was definedusing previously described criteria, including post-operative inotropes,pulmonary vasodilator use, or right-sided mechanical support. Patients were also categorized according to clinical outcomes after LVAD insertion.RESULTS: LVADs were implanted as a bridge to transplantation (BTT) in 33 patientsand as destination therapy in 7. Before LVAD implant, 22 patients wereInteragency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)level 1, and 17 were at level 2. Temporary mechanical assistance was present in50% of the cohort at LVAD implantation. The 6-month survival/progression totransplant was 92.5%. Average LVAD support time was 385 days (range, 21-1,011days). RHF developed postoperatively in 13 of 40 patients (32.5%). RHF patientshad more severe pre-operative tricuspid incompetence than non-RHF patients. TheBTT patients with evidence of RHF had poorer survival to transplant (6 of 11[54.5%]) than those without RHF (20 of 22 [90.9%]), p = 0.027). There were noother hemodynamic or echocardiographic predictors of short-term RHF. After LVAD, 22 of the 40 patients (55%) thrived clinically. For BTT patients, 20 of 21 (95%) of those who thrived progressed to transplant or were alive at latest follow-upvs 6 of 12 (50%) of those who failed to thrive (FTT; p < 0.005). The thrivers hadlower New York Heart Association class (1.5 vs 2.9, p < 0.001), spent less timein the hospital, and had less ventricular tachycardia than the FTT patients.However, no differences were noted in pre-operative INTERMACS level,echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and biochemical indices, or in earlypost-operative RHF. Age was the only significant predictor: the thrivers weresignificantly younger (43.7 ± 15.9 vs 60.3 ± 12.6 years; p < 0.001). This agedifference was unchanged after exclusion of destination strategy patients. RVfunction deteriorated in the FTT patients and remained stable in those whothrived.CONCLUSIONS: Early post-operative RHF results in poorer survival/progression totransplantation for BTT patients and is predicted by greater pre-operativetricuspid incompetence. The most important predictor for those who willclinically thrive longer-term after LVAD insertion is younger age.Crown Copyright © 2011. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
