Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations,Mann-Whitney U tests, and forward, stepwise multiple regression.RESULTS: Overall satisfaction with quality of life was quite high as determinedfrom the total score on the Quality of Life Index (mean = 0.69). Patients werevery satisfied with the implantation and thought that they would do well afterfuture heart transplant surgery. Patients had a moderate level of stress.Significant predictors of overall quality of life were psychological symptoms,stress, and race; these accounted for 46% of variance in quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Patients were satisfied with their quality of life at 1 month after implantation of a left ventricular assist device. However, they were leastsatisfied with their health and functioning and yet were optimistic about howwell they thought they would do after heart transplantation. Psychologicalfactors were the strongest predictors of satisfaction with overall quality oflife.
