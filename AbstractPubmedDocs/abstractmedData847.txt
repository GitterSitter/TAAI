Whether patients with non-coronary reasons for circulatoryarrest benefit of percutaneous emergency circulatory support (PECS) in the sameway is still unclear.METHODS: We included 22 consecutive patients who were treated by PECS during aregistry period of two years. Primary study endpoint was 30-day mortality rate.RESULTS: Circulatory arrest was caused by AMI in 14 patients (64%). The remaining8 patients suffered from cardiomyopathy/myocarditis, 4; pulmonary embolism, 2;acute pulmonary failure, 1; and tumor lysis syndrome, 1. Revascularization ratewas 93% in the AMI group under PECS support. Overall survival rate was 36.4% atone month: it reached 62.5% among non-coronary patients, but only 21.4% in theAMI group (P = 0.02). Weaning was possible by direct heart transplantation in twopatients. Additional two patients required implantation of a left ventricularassist device. Pumpless extracorporeal lung assist was used in one case.CONCLUSION: In this small retrospective study percutaneous emergency circulatory support provided sufficient hemodynamic stabilization in emergency situations.One fifth of AMI patients were saved by immediate restoration of circulation and causal treatment when other means of resuscitation failed. Higher survival rates were noted in non-coronary patients.
