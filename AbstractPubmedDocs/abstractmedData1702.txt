From 1988 through 2000 we mechanically supported 47 patientswith a bridge to heart transplantation. Within the same time frame 118 patientswere mechanically supported for recovery of the heart. Most presented in acutecardiac failure, and the severe shock leads to high early mortality. Mortalityduring mechanical support is 36%. During the early experience patients underwent transplantation urgently. With the more recent implantable devices, patients are fully mobilized and given transplants electively. Long-term survival of thesepatients bridged to transplantation is excellent and does not differ from thatfor non-bridged patients (5-year survival is 82% for the bridged patients and 84%for the non-bridged patients; p = 0.43). The most frequent device-related problemis excessive bleeding (38%). Thromboembolic phenomena are the most cumbersomecomplications (11%). The strategy of bridging to heart transplantation hasevolved from acute resuscitation and urgent transplantation to medium- andlong-term support to optimize the patient's condition. New experience withlong-term support and alternative support strategies has created possibilities inthe field of "alternatives to heart transplantation."
