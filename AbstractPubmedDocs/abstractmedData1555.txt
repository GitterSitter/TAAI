Status I, Class IV heartfailure patients have a 66% 1-year mortality rate and a survival approximatingour worst cancers. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) first successfullybridged a patient to transplantation in 1978. LVADs have since functionedprimarily thus, minimizing end-organ damage and providing rehabilitationpotential for individuals awaiting transplantation. In this role, theireffectiveness is well-established: they gain time for patients awaiting donors,preserve end-organ function, and provide potential for a high quality of life in and out of the hospital. This success has been the result of numerous advances inVAD technology, which this article discusses.
