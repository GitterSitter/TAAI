Hershey Medical Center, ThePennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (cfLVADs) have been proven safeand effective for bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy (DT) in patientswith advanced heart failure. However, the fixed pump speed of these devices maylack response to activity and oxygen demand, thereby limiting exercise tolerance.The objective of this observational study was to describe exercise capacity asmeasured by peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) that may be expected duringsupport with a cfLVAD. Peak VO2 was measured in patients (mean age: 58.3 ± 11.7years; 66.7% ischemic and 33.3% DT) before cfLVAD support (11.2 ± 3.0 ml/kg/min, n = 25), between 3 and 6 months (12.7 ± 3.5 ml/kg/min, n = 31), at 1 year (10.7 ±2.6 ml/kg/min, n = 16), and longer than 1 year (11.2 ± 1.7 ml/kg/min, n = 10).There was no statistical improvement in peak VO2 at any time point afterimplantation. In addition, ventilatory efficiency remained poor after LVADimplantation at all time points. Although studies have shown an increase insurvival and patient's quality of life, exercise capacity as measured bycardiopulmonary exercise testing remains low during cfLVAD support.
