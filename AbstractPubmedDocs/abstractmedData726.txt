The purpose of thisanalysis was to determine changes in posttrial outcomes in widespread commercial use since the clinical trial.METHODS: We compared outcomes of 486 patients who received a continuous flow LVADas a bridge to transplantation at 36 centers during the clinical trial (March2005 to April 2008) with outcomes of 1,496 posttrial patients who received acontinuous flow LVAD at 83 centers (April 2008 to September 2010 as reported tothe Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support).RESULTS: Baseline data were comparable between groups. Cumulative follow-up was511 and 1,082 patient-years for trial and posttrial patients, respectively, andaverage support duration was 12.6 ± 14.0 and 8.7 ± 7.1 months. Kaplan-Meiersurvival improved at 1 year from 76% (trial) to 85% (posttrial). The percentageof patients undergoing transplantation in the first year decreased from 48% inthe trial period to 39% in the posttrial period. Quality of life metrics improvedby 3 months in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate of a large group of continuous flow LVAD patients in a real-world setting after Food and Drug Administration market approval forbridge to transplantation has improved since the clinical trial. These data show that excellent outcomes have been maintained with dissemination of new LVADtechnology from a clinical trial phase to more broad based use in the periodafter market approval.Copyright © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
