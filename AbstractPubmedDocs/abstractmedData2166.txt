Circulation. 1978 Sep;58(3 Pt 2):I133-46.Prolonged mechanical support of the left ventricle.Pierce WS(1), Donachy JH, Landis DL, Brighton JA, Rosenberg G, Migliore JJ,Prophet GA, White WJ, Waldhausen JA.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, The Milton S. Hershey MedicalCenter, The Pennsylvania State University, 500 University Drive, Hershey,Pennsylvania 17033, USA.An interdisciplinary group has developed a left ventricular assist pump systemcomposed of a modified sac type pump, a pneumatic power unit, and a synchronizer.The pump fills from the left ventricle and discharges into the aorta. The system was employed for left ventricular assistance in a series of 12 normal calves,with an average pumping period of 70 +/- 8 days. The system was then evaluated ina series of calves in whom profound left ventricular failure had been produced.These studies indicate that the assist pump is effective in supporting thecirculation and completely unloading the left ventricle. The assist system hasnow been employed in four patients who could not be weaned from cardiopulmonarybypass following cardiac valve replacement. The assist pump supported thecirculation in three instances. In one patient, the assist pump was employed for 8 days until left ventricular function had improved sufficiently to permit pumpremoval; the patient was subsequently discharged from the hospital.
