In June 2006, the patient arrived at our outpatient clinic with anacute renal impairment and all manifestations of acute heart failure. He wasalready registered on the waiting list for heart transplantation (Eurotransplant)as a highly urgent request. The patient underwent heart transplantation but thereperfused allograft was totally akinetic and we decided to place a biventricularassist device immediately. The patient fully recovered after seven days ofbiventricular circulatory support and was discharged on the 38th day after thetransplantation. Three years later, he is in good general condition without anymanifestation of rejection. We conclude that biventricular assist deviceimplantation is a good indication after post-cardiotomy failure and it should be started as early as possible before shock and possible irreversible organ damage.
