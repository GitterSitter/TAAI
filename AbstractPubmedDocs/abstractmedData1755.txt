Clinical trials began in Europe in November 1998 and in theUnited States in June 2000.METHODS: To qualify for the study, the patients must be listed for cardiactransplantation and must have demonstrated profound cardiac failure. There wereno exclusions to the MicroMed DeBakey VAD implant other than those patients whowould typically be excluded from cardiac transplantation.RESULTS: As of September 2000, 51 patients have been implanted with the MicroMed DeBakey VAD. A detailed evaluation of the first 32 patients has been completed.With current data, the probability of survival at 30 days after VAD implant is81%.CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trial demonstrated that the MicroMed DeBakey VAD iscapable of providing adequate circulatory support in patients with severe heartfailure, sufficient to recover and return to normal activities while awaiting aheart transplantation. Much has been learned about the function of the device andits continuous flow in humans.
