Connecting these cannulae to either atria or ventricles induces major changes in flow dynamics; however, there are little dataavailable on precise quantification of these changes. The objective of thisinvestigation was to quantify the difference in ventricular/vascular hemodynamicsduring a range of left heart failure conditions with either atrial (AC) orventricular (VC) inflow cannulation in a mock circulation loop with a rotary leftVAD. Ventricular ejection fraction (EF), stroke work, and pump flow rates werefound to be consistently lower with AC compared with VC over all simulated heart failure conditions. Adequate ventricular ejection remained with AC under lowlevels of mechanical support; however, the reduced EF in cases of severe heartfailure may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. AC is therefore moresuitable for class III, bridge to recovery patients, while VC is appropriate for class IV, bridge to transplant/destination patients.© 2010, Copyright the Authors.
