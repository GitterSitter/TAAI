Epub 2007 Oct 1.Pre-operative redox state affects 1-month survival in patients with advancedheart failure undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation.Caruso R(1), Garatti A, Sedda V, Milazzo F, Campolo J, Colombo T, Catena E,Cighetti G, Russo C, Frigerio M, Vitali E, Parodi O.Author information: (1)CNR Clinical Physiology Institute of Milan, Milan, Italy.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation has proveneffective as a bridge to transplantation in end-stage heart failure patients(ESHFPs), although survival during device support is critical. Oxidative stresshas been implicated in the development of heart failure, but the influence ofredox state on in-hospital post-LVAD outcome has not been clarified.METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report we describe the oxidant/anti-oxidant profilesof 15 ESHFPs before LVAD placement, 5 of whom did not survive to 1 month, and in 30 subjects without cardiac disease, representing the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that adequate activity of theGPx-1-based anti-oxidant system before device placement is associated withpatient survival up to 1 month, despite comparable baseline oxidative stress inpatients who both survived and died (within 2 weeks post-LVAD).
