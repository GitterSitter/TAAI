J Heart Lung Transplant. 1997 Jun;16(6):629-35.Long-term left ventricular assist device support: a novel pump rate challengeexercise protocol to monitor native left ventricular function.Deng MC(1), Wilhelm M, Weyand M, Hammel D, Kerber S, Breithardt G, Scheld HH.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Muenster UniversityHospital, Germany.A novel, hemodynamically guided exercise protocol with two different leftventricular assist device settings in two long-term recipients is presented. Thisprotocol allows for quantitation of the contribution of the native left ventricleto total cardiac output. It facilitates estimation of the risk associated withdevice dysfunction, as well as prediction of left ventricular recovery and thepotential for weaning.
