Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 1991;5(6):330-3.Mechanical left ventricular support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation inchildhood.Warnecke H(1), Berdjis F, Hennig E, Lange P, Schmitt D, Hummel M, Hetzer R.Author information: (1)German Heart Center, Berlin.The mechanical extrathoracic "Berlin Heart" cardiac assist device was used forleft ventricular support in an 8-year-old child of 27 kg body weight. Terminalleft ventricular failure and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias inthis child were sequelae of coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis andresultant severe left ventricular dilatation, hypokinesia and fibrosis. With the assist device, cardiogenic shock could be reversed. The child was extubated andmobilized during an 8-day waiting period for orthotopic heart transplantation.This case illustrates that the use of ventricular assist devices can besuccessfully extended to children and may be advantageous compared to othertechniques of mechanical circulatory support, such as balloon pumping orextracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
