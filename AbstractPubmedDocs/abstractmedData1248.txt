Herein we report the incidence, clinical presentation, treatmentstrategies and early and late outcome after this complication.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 149 consecutive patients (mean age 53 +/- 16years, 113 [76%] males) who underwent OHT between January 1998 and December 2005.Mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 +/- 6 kg/m(2) and 30 (20%) patients werediabetics. Sixty (40%) patients had prior cardiac surgery, 11 (7%) underwentprevious ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation, and 10 (7%) were in acritical hemodynamic state requiring inotropic support.RESULTS: DSWI occurred in 13 (8.7%) patients as compared with 1.7% of patients inour general cardiac surgery population (p < 0.001). Predictors of DSWI inunivariate analyses were BMI >30 kg/m(2) (p = 0.02), previous heart surgery (p = 0.03), previous VAD (p = 0.006) and inotropic support (p = 0.04). Hospitalmortality after DSWI was significantly increased as compared with patientswithout this complication (31% vs 8%, p = 0.03). One- and 5-year survival afterDSWI was 100 +/- 12% and 80 +/- 18% as compared with 92 +/- 3% and 82 +/- 4% inpatients without DSWI (p = 0.8).CONCLUSIONS: DSWI after OHT is a common complication and carries high mortalityand morbidity rates. We were able to identify specific risk factors for thiscondition, such as prior VAD insertion and pre-operative inotropic support.Long-term survival after DSWI remains similar to that of transplant patientswithout this complication.
