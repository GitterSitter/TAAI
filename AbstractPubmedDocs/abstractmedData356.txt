The timing of bleeding events, relationship tocoagulation status, and effect on post-operative survival are incompletelyunderstood.METHODS: From October 2004 to June 2010, 139 HMII recipients at the ClevelandClinic received 145 devices as a bridge to transplant or destination therapy for advanced heart failure. Major bleeding was defined using Interagency Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support criteria, with an additional categorycreated to maximize sensitivity for events. Pre-operative variables, coagulation status, and bleeding recurrence were assessed for correlation to primary eventsusing modulated renewal within a multivariable analysis.RESULTS: The cumulative occurrence of major bleeding was 58% during 171patient-years of follow-up. There were 1.14 major bleeds per patient-year, with44% occurring as repeat bleeding events. A first bleed did not predict subsequentbleeding. The greatest risk of bleeding was noted within 2 weekspost-implantation. The international normalized ratio profile correlated poorlywith the risk of bleeding. Bleeding early after surgery was associated withreduced survival while on HMII support.CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bleeding peaks early after HMII implantation. Bleedingof thoracic and gastrointestinal sources dominates these events, although manypatients undergo transfusions for anemia without an apparent source of hemolysis or bleeding.Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
