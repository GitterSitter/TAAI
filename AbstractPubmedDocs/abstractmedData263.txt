A model was developed to predict the risk for waiting listmortality within 90 days, and listed patients were stratified into 10 risk groups(deciles). All groups were followed for 1 year to assess cumulative 1-yearmortality while on the waiting list. Models of 90-day and 1-yearpost-transplantation mortality were developed using recipient data, and theserisks were estimated at listing in all listed candidates.RESULTS: Of 10,159 patients listed for HT, 596 (5.9%) died within 90 days and1,054 (10.4%) within 1 year without undergoing transplantation. Of 5,720recipients of transplants with 1-year follow-up, 576 (10.1%) died within 1 year. The risk for death while on the waiting list within 90 days increased from 1.6%to 19% across the 10 risk groups. The survival benefit from HT increasedprogressively with higher risk for death without transplantation (p < 0.001 fortrend), but there was no benefit in the first 6 risk groups.CONCLUSIONS: The risk for waiting list mortality varies considerably among HTcandidates. Although the survival benefit of HT generally increases withincreasing risk for waiting list mortality, there is no measurable benefit inmany candidates at the lower end of the risk spectrum.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
