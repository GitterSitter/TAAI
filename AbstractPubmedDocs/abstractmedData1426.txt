Pulsatile paracorporeal ventricular assist devices arelife-saving options for such patients, allowing for bridge to transplantation or cardiac recovery. From March 1997 to July 2004, 12 patients underwentimplantation of Thoratec biventricular assist devices (BVADs) for refractoryheart failure. Mean age was 14.9 (range 7-20) and mean BSA was 1.7 (range1.1-1.9). Indications for support included end-stage cardiomyopathy (n=10),myocarditis (n=1), and postcardiotomy heart failure (n=1). Preimplant variablesincluded 50% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (mean 4.2 days),hyperbilirubinemia in 58%, and acute renal failure in 50%. Mean duration ofsupport was 64.5 (range 2-175) days. Overall survival was 83%, with nine patientssuccessfully bridged to transplantation (75%). One patient exhibited recoveryallowing for device explantation, and two patients died while on BVADs.Complications included bleeding requiring reoperation in 25% (n=3), stroke in 8% (n=1), driveline infections in 17% (n=2), and device malfunction in one patient. Pulsatile paracorporeal BVADs can be used successfully in children andadolescents with heart failure. These results warrant consideration of usingavailable miniaturized technology in the United States for the support of smallerchildren with intractable biventricular failure.
