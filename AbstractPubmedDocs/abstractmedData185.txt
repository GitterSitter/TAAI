The aim was to assess the use of levosimendan vs.conventional inotropes and the use as planned repetitive vs. acute treatment, in Sweden.METHODS: We performed a descriptive study with individual patient validationassessing the use of levosimendan and conventional intravenous inotropes,indications for levosimendan, clinical characteristics and survival in theSwedish Heart Failure Registry between 2000 and 2011. For repetitivelevosimendan, we assessed potential indications for alternative interventions.RESULTS: Of 53,548 total registrations, there were 655 confirmed with inotropeuse (597 levosimendan, 37 conventional, 21 both) from 22 hospitals responding to validation, and 6069 in-patient controls with New York Heart Association III-IVand ejection fraction <40%. The indications for levosimendan were acute HF in 384registrations (306 patients), and planned repetitive in 234 registrations (87patients). Planned repetitive as a proportion of total levosimendan registrationsranged 0-65% and of total levosimendan patients ranged 0-54% in differenthospitals. Of planned repetitive patients without existing cardiacresynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, transplantand/or assist device, 46-98% were potential candidates for such interventions.CONCLUSION: In HF in cardiology and internal medicine in Sweden, levosimendan wasthe overwhelming inotrope of choice, and the use of planned repetitivelevosimendan was extensive, highly variable between hospitals and may havepre-empted other interventions. Potential effects of and indications for planned repetitive levosimendan need to be evaluated in prospective studies.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
