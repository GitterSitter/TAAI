The HeartMate II is a small(350 g), implantable, axial-flow pump (nonpulsatile flow), which is designed tosupport the left ventricle for extended periods of time. Here we have reportedour initial single-center clinical experience with this device as a bridge toheart transplantation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2002 and December 2008, 18 transplantableadult patients were supported on long-term HeartMate II LVAS at our institution. The cohort included 15 men with an overall mean age of 52 +/- 8.4 years (range,31-64 years). Primary indications for implantation were ischemic cardiomyopathy(CMP; n = 13) and idiopathic CMP (n = 5). All heart failure patients were NewYork Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV. None of them had undergoneprior open heart surgery. Implantation was performed via cannulation of the left ventricular apex and ascending aorta, and in each case was an elective procedure.RESULTS: Mean support time was 217 +/- 212.3 days (range, 1-665 days). Early(30-day) mortality was 27.7% (n = 5) due to multiple organ failure and sepsis as main causes of death. Bleeding requiring reoperation occurred in 6 cases (33.3%).Cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1 case. There were 2 driveline infections and no device failure. Twelve subjects (66.6%) were successfully discharged home.Overall, 9 patients (50%) underwent transplantation and 3 are awaiting a suitableorgan (2 were discharged home and 1 is in hospital). At latest follow-up, thesurvival rate after heart transplantation was 66.6% (n = 6).CONCLUSIONS: Long-term HeartMate II LVAS can successfully bridge patients toheart transplantation. Good mid- and long-term results may support the use ofthis device even for a permanent solution in nontransplantable subjects.
