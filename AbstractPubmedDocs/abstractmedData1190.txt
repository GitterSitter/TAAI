Ventricular assist devices (VADs), acommon bridge-to-transplant solution in adults, are becoming a viable option for pediatric patients. A major obstacle faced by VAD designers is thromboembolism.Previous studies have shown that the interrelated flow characteristics necessary for the prevention of thrombosis in a pulsatile VAD are a strong inlet jet, alate diastolic recirculating flow, and a wall shear rate greater than 500 s(-1). Particle image velocimetry was used to compare the flow fields in the chamber of the 12 cc Penn State pediatric pulsatile VAD using two mechanical heart valves:Bjork-Shiley monostrut (BSM) tilting disk valves and CarboMedics (CM) bileafletvalves. In conjunction with the flow evaluation, wall shear data were calculated and analyzed to help quantify wall washing. The major orifice inlet jet of thedevice containing BSM valves was more intense, which led to better recirculation and wall washing than the three jets produced by the CM valves. Regurgitationthrough the CM valve served as a significant hindrance to the development of the rotational flow.
