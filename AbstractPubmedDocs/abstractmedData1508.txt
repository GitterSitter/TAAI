The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate theeffectiveness of two different mechanical circulatory support systems for thisindication.METHODS: From 1984 to 2003, 28 heart transplant recipients exhibited rightventricular failure resistant to drug therapy. Right ventricular assist device (n= 15) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 13) was implanted to supportthe failing heart.RESULTS: Overall in-hospital survival was 43%. In the right ventricular assistdevice group, only 2 patients (13%) could be weaned from mechanical circulatorysupport compared with 10 patients (77%) in the extracorporeal membraneoxygenation group (p = 0.001). Retransplantation was necessary in 6 patients inthe right ventricular assist device group and in 1 patient in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group (p = 0.049). There was no difference in patientsurvival between groups, but graft survival was significantly better in theextracorporeal membrane oxygenation group (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: In view of these results, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation seems to be the better option as mechanical circulatory support for right ventricularfailure in heart transplantation.
