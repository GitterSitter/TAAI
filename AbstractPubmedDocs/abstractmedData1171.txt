More than 30 years of engineering development andclinical research have led to a level of efficacy and reliability of ventricular assist devices, which allows promotion of this approach for the most difficultpatients. Uses include a gaining-time strategy as a bridge to cardiactransplantation or recovery of native cardiac function, as well as permanentsupport with the device. The large variety of devices permits every cardiacsurgical unit, even those not used to cardiac transplantation, to propose thisoption to the patient. Recent experience with small silent implantable pumpssuggests that the pioneering period of mechanical circulatory support is probablyover, and the time has come for precise prospective trials to optimize bothpatient selection and the timing for utilization. In countries where cardiactransplantation has not developed, there is now an easily accessible techniquefor management of patients with cardiac failure.
