Although LVADs have beenshown to increase quality of life and survival, the associated treatment burdens and complications deserve careful consideration. The current study illustratesmyriad clinical challenges that can arise during long-term mechanical supportusing an older adult case history. Current data on LVAD use in older adults isreviewed, and a discussion of relevant points to consider before LVADimplantation in older adults, including advance care planning, assessment of gaitand cognition, and the potential for substantial caregiver burden, is undertaken.© 2012, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2012, The American GeriatricsSociety.
