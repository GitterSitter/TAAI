However, a certain number of patients continue to havesignificant mitral regurgitation (MR) under LVAD support. We investigatedpre-operative echocardiographic features associated with persistent MR after LVADimplantation.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 82 consecutive patients undergoingcontinuous-flow LVAD implantation between 2007 and 2010. We obtainedechocardiograms performed within 2 weeks before and 1 week after surgery. Weinvestigated the pre-operative echocardiographic findings associated withsignificant MR post-LVAD and compared 1-year mortality after LVAD surgery betweenpatients with and without significant MR post-LVAD.RESULTS: MR was significant in 43 patients (52.4%) before LVAD surgery. Amongthose, 5 underwent concomitant mitral valve repair (MVr) at the time of LVADimplantation. Of the remaining 38 patients, 25 (65.8%) showed improvement of MR, whereas 13 patients (34.2%) continued to have significant MR post-LVAD.Multivariate analysis revealed that posterior displacement of the coaptationpoint of mitral leaflets was significantly associated with significant MRpost-LVAD (hazard ratio, 1.335; 95% confidence interval, 1.035-1.721; p = 0.026) even after adjusting for the amount of pre-operative MR flow. Post-LVAD 1-yearsurvival of patients with and without significant MR post-LVAD was notsignificantly different (92.3% vs 89.1%, p = 0.826).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-LVAD posterior displacement of mitral leaflets may be indicativeof post-operative significant MR, which would help identify echocardiographicfeatures of functional MR refractory to simple volume reduction of the ventricle.Copyright Â© 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
