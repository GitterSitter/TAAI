However, the left ventricular assist deviceis not widely recognized in the medical community as being reliable enough tosupport a patient at home. We reviewed our experience with these patients at hometo assess the safety and the benefits of such a program.METHODS: Our institutional 6-year experience with 90 consecutive recipients of a wearable left ventricular assist device was analyzed.RESULTS: Forty-four (49%) of the 90 patients who received TCI vented-electricleft ventricular assist devices (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, Mass) weredischarged, spending a total of 4546 days (12.5 years) at home with an average of103 +/- 16 days of outpatient support (range 9-436 days). Of these 44 patients,all were successfully bridged to transplantation (42 patients, 96%) or plannedexplantation (2 patients, 4%). None of the outpatients died. The cumulativeevents per outpatient month were 0.020 for bleeding, 0.053 for device infection, 0.0068 for thromboembolus, and 0.020 for major malfunctions. Our estimatedaverage cost to bridge a patient to transplantation or explantation oncedischarged is $13,200 and as an inpatient over the same length of time, includingonly room and board, is $165,200. Thirty percent of outpatients were able toreturn to work or school, 33% to sexual activity, and 44% to driving. Alloutpatients performed activities of daily living.CONCLUSION: Current left ventricular assist device technology provides effective and economical outpatient support and is associated with limited morbidity and a satisfactory quality of life.
