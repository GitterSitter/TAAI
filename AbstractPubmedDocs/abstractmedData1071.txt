Epub 2009 Jun 28.Design of a protective cage for an intravascular axial flow blood pump tomechanically assist the failing Fontan.Throckmorton AL(1), Kishore RA.Author information: (1)Department of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University,Richmond, VA, USA. althrock@vcu.eduCurrently, no long-term mechanical bridge-to-transplant or bridge-to-recoverytherapeutic alternative exists for failing single ventricles. A blood pump thatwould augment pressure in the cavopulmonary circulation is needed, and would leadto a reduction in elevated systemic venous pressure, and improve cardiac output. Thus, we are developing a collapsible, percutaneously inserted, axial flow blood pump to support the cavopulmonary circulation in adult patients with a failingsingle ventricle physiology. This collapsible axial flow pump is designed forpercutaneous positioning. The outer protective cage will be designed withradially arranged filaments as touchdown surfaces to protect the vessel wall fromthe rotating components. This study examined the geometric characteristics of theprotective cage of filaments and the impeller through the development andnumerical analysis of 13 models. A blood damage analysis was also performed onselected geometric models to assess the probability of blood trauma. All modelsdemonstrated an acceptable hydraulic performance by delivering 2-6 L/min at arotational speed of 6000-10 000 rpm and generating pressure rise of 5-20 mm Hg.Expected trends in the hydraulic performance of the pump models were found. This study represents the initial first design phase of the impeller and protectivecage of filaments. Validation of these flow and performance predictions will becompleted in the next round of experimental testing with blood bag evaluation.
