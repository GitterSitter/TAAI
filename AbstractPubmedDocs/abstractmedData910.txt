So far, educated attempts at achievingtransplanted stem cell-induced myogenesis have largely failed outside of theembryonic stem cell realm, and we present the rationale for also consideringacellular techniques, which may enhance the potential of endogenous progenitorpopulations.SUMMARY: In today's cardiovascular field, once a cardiomyocyte is lost it is lostfor good, without any form of direct therapeutic option. For these reasons, cell therapy justifies our continued attention and efforts, and may constitute theholy grail of cardiovascular therapeutics.
