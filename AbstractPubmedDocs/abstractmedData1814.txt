Patients were compared with 101healthy control subjects. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed, andventilatory efficiency was defined as the slope of the linear relationship ofV(CO(2)) and ventilation (VE). Results are presented in percent of age- andsex-adjusted mean values. Forty-four events (37 deaths and 7 instances of hearttransplantation, cardiomyoplasty, or left ventricular assist device implantation)occurred. Among VO(2)max, NYHA class, LVEF, total lung capacity, and age, themost powerful predictor of event-free survival was the VE versus V(CO(2)) slope; patients with a slope </=130% of age- and sex-adjusted normal values had asignificantly better 1-year event-free survival (88.3%) than patients with aslope >130% (54.7%; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The VE versus V(CO(2)) slope is an excellent prognostic parameter.It is easier to obtain than parameters of maximal exercise capacity and is ofhigher prognostic importance than VO(2)max.
