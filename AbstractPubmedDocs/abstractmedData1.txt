The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome ofend-stage RCM patients after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantationand to determine factors that may be associated with improved survival.METHODS: This investigation is a retrospective study of prospectively collecteddata that include 28 consecutive patients with end-stage RCM who receivedcontinuous-flow LVADs at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Outcome wasassessed by survival with LVAD support until heart transplantation or all-causemortality.RESULTS: The mean follow-up time post-LVAD implantation was 448 ± 425 days. Themean hospitalization time was 29 ± 19 days and was complicated mainly bypost-operative right ventricular (RV) failure requiring short-term medicalsupport. The short-term in-hospital mortality was 14%. Ten patients underwentheart transplantation with 100% survival post-transplant during the follow-upperiod. One-year survival for patients with LVADs without transplantation was64%, and was not significantly different between amyloidosis and non-amyloidosis patients. Larger left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensionswere significantly associated with improved survival rates (RR = 0.94 and 0.95, p< 0.05, respectively), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) ≤46 mmwas associated with increased mortality post-LVAD implantation.CONCLUSIONS: LVAD is a feasible, life-saving therapy for end-stage heart failure related to RCM, especially as a bridge to transplant and in patients with larger LV dimensions.Copyright © 2015 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
