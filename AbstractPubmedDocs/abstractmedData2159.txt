J Heart Transplant. 1985 Sep-Oct;4(5):481-8.Clinical spectrum of mechanical circulatory assistance.Richenbacher WE, Pierce WS.Mechanical blood pumps can provide effective circulatory support in a variety of clinical settings. Ventricular assist devices are single ventricle blood pumpsdesigned to work in parallel with the natural heart. These devices can be poweredby air pulses or an electric motor to provide temporary or permanent circulatory assistance, respectively. Unlike ventricular assist devices, artificial heartsreplace the natural heart. In doing so, they provide complete support of both thesystemic and pulmonary circulation. Air-driven artificial hearts will primarilysupport patients with profound biventricular failure prior to hearttransplantation. Electrically assisted artificial hearts with their implantableenergy converters are in the earliest stages of development. These devices willultimately serve as permanent heart replacements in patients who do not qualifyfor heart transplantation.
