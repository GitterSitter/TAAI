Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl:S11-7.Will permanent LVADs be better than heart transplantation?Massad MG(1), McCarthy PM.Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cleveland ClinicFoundation, OH, USA.Current interest in permanent mechanical support systems has been renewed as aresult of the present shortage of human heart donors, and in view of thesatisfactory results obtained with their use as a bridge-to-transplant. As thenumber of donors is unlikely to increase dramatically in the near future, thereis an urgent need to develop mechanical alternatives to transplantation.Preliminary data on the use of the implantable electric LVAD as abridge-to-transplant indicate that the adverse clinical and mechanical events in outpatients are few and do not preclude use of the device on a permanent basis.Except for infections, transplant issues relating to need for endomyocardialbiopsies, rejection, malignancies, and graft arteriosclerosis do not apply toLVAD recipients who face important issues relating to device durability, cost,and potential need for concomitant right heart support. This lack of data onlong-term durability contrasts with a yearly mortality rate of about 5% after thefirst year of transplant. With the initiation of clinical trials on the permanentuse of the electric LVAD, several design modifications and upgrading of thecurrently available devices are expected. Completely sealed systems with steadilyimproving durability will hopefully appear. Inductive coupling techniques underinvestigation and development appear to be able to transmit energy without damageacross the skin. It is anticipated that with more reliable electronicmicroprocessors, the future generation of implantable LVADs will be smaller, morereliable and longer lasting.
