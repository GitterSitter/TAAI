Pulsatile LVADs are associated with commissural fusionof the aortic valve, yet little is known about this association with newergeneration continuous axial flow LVADs.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pathologic samples from 9 patients enrolled in the HeartMate II Bridge to Transplantation Trial. Echocardiograms at 1, 6 and 12 months after device placement were evaluated for aortic valve opening andaortic insufficiency. At the time of transplantation, explanted hearts wereexamined for gross pathologic valvular abnormalities and histologic analysis.RESULTS: All but 1 explant had evidence of commissural fusion of the nativeaortic valve leaflets. Over time there was a decreasing prevalence of aorticvalve opening and an increasing prevalence of mild to moderate aorticinsufficiency independent of pump speed. All patients had improvements in theirfunctional status and were successfully bridged to orthotopic hearttransplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Commissural fusion of the native aortic valve leaflets occursfrequently with an increasing prevalence of aortic insufficiency duringcontinuous flow LVAD support. With the potential broader use of non-pulsatileLVADs and the prospect of using LVADs as means to assist in myocardial recovery, special attention should be given to evaluating aortic valve function during LVADsupport.
