Epub 2010 May 21.Physiologic benefits of pulsatile perfusion during mechanical circulatory supportfor the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure in adults.Guan Y(1), Karkhanis T, Wang S, Rider A, Koenig SC, Slaughter MS, El Banayosy A, Undar A.Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, PennState College of Medicine, Penn State Children's Hospital, Hershey, PA17033-0850, USA.A growing population experiencing heart failure (100,000 patients/year), combinedwith a shortage of donor organs (less than 2200 hearts/year), has led toincreased and expanded use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices. MCSdevices have successfully improved clinical outcomes, which are comparable withheart transplantation and result in better 1-year survival than optimal medicalmanagement therapies. The quality of perfusion provided during MCS therapy mayplay an important role in patient outcomes. Despite demonstrated physiologicbenefits of pulsatile perfusion, continued use or development of pulsatile MCSdevices has been widely abandoned in favor of continuous flow pumps owing to the large size and adverse risks events in the former class, which pose issues ofthrombogenic surfaces, percutaneous lead infection, and durability.Next-generation MCS device development should ideally implement designs thatoffer the benefits of rotary pump technology while providing the physiologicbenefits of pulsatile end-organ perfusion.
