According to Carrier (2005), individuals with damaged hearts areliving longer, and lives are being successfully saved with the surge ofcardiovascular assist devices developed in recent years, which are increasinglyused as a bridge to transplant. Despite the lifesaving capabilities ofventricular-assist devices, these innovations pose risks and complications thatcan be debilitating for patients and their families (Carrier, 2005). As thiscomplex trajectory is navigated, nurses provide care and support to the patientand family while playing a unique role in the assessment and monitoring of these devices. A family-centred nursing model provides a framework for practice whennursing patients and families are in crisis. The foundations of the McGill Model of Nursing are focused on a strengths-based approach, revolving aroundcollaboration between patients, family resources, and tailored interventions(Gottlieb & Feeley, 2005). As students placed in a critical care setting, webegan to realize the complexity of care required to nurse these patients andtheir families. In this paper, a case study is used to describe and share ourlearning experiences of caring for a patient with a biventricular assist device, as well as the principles that guided our interventions.
