By shunting blood from the femoral veinto the left ventricular assist device, cardiac output can be increased, butarterial oxygen saturation will decrease.METHODS: To determine the effects on O2 delivery, a model was developed on thebasis of O2 uptake in the lungs and whole body O2 consumption. An equation wasderived that related cardiac output, pulmonary venous O2 saturation, O2consumption, and the ratio of shunt-to-systemic blood flow to systemic O2delivery.RESULTS: When total cardiac output increases, the shunt will increase systemic O2delivery while decreasing arterial O2 saturation and leaving systemic venous O2saturation unaltered. When total output does not increase, the shunt willdecrease systemic O2 delivery, arterial O2 saturation, and systemic venous O2saturation.CONCLUSIONS: The analysis suggests that measuring systemic venous oxygensaturation may be a useful way to monitor patient safety. A decrease in systemic venous O2 saturation when creating the shunt implies an inadequate increase incardiac output.
