Epub 2012Mar 17.Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy in Barth syndrome: an example of anundulating cardiac phenotype necessitating mechanical circulatory support as abridge to transplantation.Hanke SP(1), Gardner AB, Lombardi JP, Manning PB, Nelson DP, Towbin JA, JefferiesJL, Lorts A.Author information: (1)Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 BurnetAvenue-ML 2003, Cincinnati, OH 45213, USA.Barth syndrome (BTHS) is associated with myocardial disease, frequently leftventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, which may necessitate cardiactransplantation or lead to death in some patients. We report a child with BTHSwho had an "undulating cardiac phenotype" and ultimately developed decompensated heart failure requiring mechanical circulatory support with a ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation. His course was complicated by acute lunginjury requiring placement of an in-line oxygenator to maintain end-organfunction. Not only was his course complicated by cardiac and respiratory failure but his BTHS associated comorbidities complicated the management of his therapyusing mechanical assist device support. He was successfully supported andsubsequently was transplanted. Here we discuss the management of a child withBTHS using mechanical circulatory support and describe the use of an in-lineoxygenator, Quadrox, with the Berlin Excor device.
