J Heart Transplant. 1985 May;4(3):348-52.Mechanical assistance for biventricular failure following coronary bypassoperation and heart transplantation.Zumbro GL Jr, Shearer G, Kitchens WR, Galloway RF.From September 1983 to March 1985, five patients who could not be weaned fromextracorporeal circulation or who deteriorated in the recovery room have beentreated with biventricular mechanical support using two vortex pumps, standardcannulas and tubing. One patient was supported for six hours following hearttransplantation and acute graft failure until another donor heart could be found.Intraaortic balloon pumping was utilized in each patient to augment thecirculation and produce pulsatile flow. Four of the five patients were weanedfrom the device. Only one patient is currently a long-term survivor. Althoughlong-term survival has been low, the ability of the myocardium to recover wasimpressive and warrants the efforts at assisting the heart in biventricularfailure.
