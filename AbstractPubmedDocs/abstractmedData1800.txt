Curr Opin Cardiol. 2000 May;15(3):166-71.Development and clinical application of the MicroMed DeBakey VAD.Noon GP(1), Morley D, Irwin S, Benkowski R.Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.A miniaturized axial flow pump to provide left ventricular assistance has beendeveloped. Such a device has the potential to address limitations of the largerpulsatile devices. Clinical trials of the MicroMed DeBakey VAD (ventricularassist device) began in Europe in November 1998. As of December 1, 1999, 18patients have been implanted with the MicroMed DeBakey VAD. Hemodynamicevaluations along with blood chemistry analysis were recorded routinely. Exercisetolerance was observed. In most patients, end-organ function has improved and hasnot deteriorated in any patient. Patients have been able to perform normallow-level activity and have tolerated positional changes without evidence ofpostural hemodynamic changes. Select patients have taken supervisedout-of-hospital excursions. This initial clinical experience with the MicroMedDeBakey VAD suggests that the miniaturized axial flow pump can provideventricular support to bridge patients to cardiac transplant and may provide animproved quality of life for the end-stage heart failure recipient.
