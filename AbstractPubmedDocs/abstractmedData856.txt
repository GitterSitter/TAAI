More women continued on support after 18 months (p = 0.007). Median duration ofsupport was 238 days for women and 184 days for men (p = 0.003). Mortality was20% for women and 19% for men (p = 0.89). Adverse events were similar, with theexception of hemorrhagic stroke, which occurred more frequently in women (0.10 vs0.04 events/patient-year, p = 0.02), and device-related infections, whichoccurred less frequently in women (0.23 vs 0.44, p = 0.006). Functional capacity and quality of life at 6 months improved significantly in women and men.CONCLUSIONS: Continuous-flow left ventricular assistance as a bridge totransplantation is associated with similar survival rates in women and men.Differences observed in higher stroke rates and fewer infections among womenrequire further study.Copyright © 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
