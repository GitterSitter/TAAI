Moststudies examining risk stratification have been limited to pulsatile devices. We use the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support(INTERMACS) to stratify patients with continuous-flow devices and assess outcomesin less severe, but functionally impaired, heart failure patients.METHODS: This study included 101 bridge-to-transplant and destination-therapypatients at 3 centers. Three groups were studied: Group 1, cardiogenic shock(INTERMACS Profile 1); Group 2, inotrope-dependent (INTERMACS Profile 2 or 3);and Group 3, ambulatory advanced heart failure (INTERMACS Profiles 4 to 7). Theoutcomes of interest were actuarial survival, survival to discharge and length ofstay.RESULTS: Survival at 36 months was better in Group 3 than in Group 1 (95.8% vs51.1%, p = 0.011), but not between Groups 2 and 3 (68.8 vs 95.8%, p = 0.065).Lengths of stay for Groups 1 to 3 were 44, 41 and 17 days: Groups 1 vs 3, p <0.001; Groups 2 vs 3, p < 0.001; and Groups 1 vs 2, p = 0.62. Lengths of stay forsurvivors were 49, 39 and 14 for the 3 groups: Groups 1 vs 3, p < 0.001; Groups 2vs 3, p < 0.001; and Groups 1 vs 2, p = 0.28.CONCLUSION: INTERMACS classification is a useful metric for risk-stratifyingcandidates for MCS. Less acutely ill but functionally impaired heart failurepatients receiving continuous-flow LVADs had longer short- and long-term survivaland shorter lengths of stay compared with patients who were more acutely ill.Copyright Â© 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
