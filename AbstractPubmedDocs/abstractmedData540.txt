The aim of the present study is to review ourinstitutional experience with this novel device.METHODS: We reviewed the files of 50 patients (39 men, 11 women) with a mean age of 50.6 ± 11.8 years (range, 19 to 70 years) who underwent HVAD implantationbetween July 2009 and November 2011. Two patients underwent HeartWare BIVADimplantation. The underlying heart diseases were end-stage ischemic heart disease(n = 12), acute myocardial infarction (n = 9), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 27)and acute myocarditis (n = 2). Interagency Registry for Mechanically AssistedCirculatory Support (INTERMACS) profiles were level 1 (n = 11), 2 (n = 5), 3 (n =10), and 4 (n = 24).RESULTS: After a cumulative support duration of 11,086 days, Kaplan-Meieranalysis revealed a survival of 82.0%, 77.9%, 75.5%, at 1, 12, and 24 months,respectively. Causes of early death were right heart failure (n = 4), multiorgan failure (n = 2), septic shock (n = 2), and major neurologic complications (n =4). One late death occurred due to a right heart failure. Comparison betweenpatients operated on in cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS 1 and 2) and patients whounderwent elective HVAD implantation (INTERMACS 3 and 4) revealed a survival of61.5% and 44.1% for the INTERMACS 1 and 2 group and 90.3% and 87.1% for theINTERMACS 3 and 4 group at 1 and 12 months, respectively (odds ratio, 4.67; p =0.003). One patient was weaned from the system after 2 years. Eleven patients(22%) were successfully bridged to transplantation. Mean time to transplantation was 209 days (range, 72 to 427 days). Posttransplant survival at the 1-yearfollow-up was 90.9% (11 patients).CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with HVAD shows satisfying results with an excellent posttransplantation survival. Moreover, the stratified survival based on thelevel of preoperative stability shows better outcomes in patients undergoingelective HVAD implantation.Copyright © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.
