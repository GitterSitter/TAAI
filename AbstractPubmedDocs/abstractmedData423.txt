This review provides an overview of these two modalities, including adiscussion of indications, contraindications, timing, and device selection, aspart of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society/Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Joint Statement on Mechanical Circulatory Support. DATA SOURCES,STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION: PubMed was searched using the following terms: ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ventricular assist device, VAD, andpediatric. Case reports, single-center series, multicenter studies, and registry reports were reviewed.CONCLUSIONS: The two technologies have unique advantages and disadvantages andmay be considered complementary devices, although they are frequently used insequence. Either modality may be used as bridge-to-transplant orbridge-to-recovery, and the choice of device and device timing is influenced bythe acuity of illness, comorbidities, potential for recovery, and anticipatedduration of support.
