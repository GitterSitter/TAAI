Z Gesamte Inn Med. 1989 Nov 1;44(21):633-7.[Current status of the use of the artificial heart and ventricular assistsystems].[Article in German]Urbaszek W(1), Schmitz KP, Emmrich K, Klinkmann H.Author information: (1)Klinik für Innere Medizin, Bereich Medizin der Wilhelm-Pieck-UniversitätRostock.The state of the technical development of the mechanical assist systems and theartificial heart, respectively, guarantees a sufficient support of thecirculatory system up to the improvement of the own heart function or to thepossible heart transplantation. There is the necessity for the temporarilylimited support of the heart, but also for the long-term one. Independent of the underlying etiology in acute conditions of cardiac failure in many cases theexternal supporting system may be sufficiently helpful. The antithrombotictherapy and the prophylaxis of infections demands particular carefulness. Thereis still no representable release for the long-term use of the hitherto availablecardiovascular supporting systems. The question is controversial, whether then anexperiment on patients or an already accepted therapeutic intervention is stilltaken into consideration. Essential prerequisites for the long-term use would be a full implantability of the systems in transcutaneous energy transmission, afurther biologization of the blood-contacting materials, a clarification of theimmune phenomena, a possibly automatic mode of action adapted to the need as wellas a reliable strategy of antithrombotic therapy. The increased risk of infectionshould be taken into consideration.
