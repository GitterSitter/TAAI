Epub 2013 Jun10.The Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device: history, NorthAmerican experience, and future directions.Fraser CD Jr(1), Jaquiss RD.Author information: (1)Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.cdfraser@texaschildrens.orgOptions for long-term mechanical circulatory support to sustain pediatric heartfailure patients requiring cardiac transplantation while they wait for donorhearts have been unsatisfactory. The conventional approach has been to useextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but its lack of feasibility forlong-term use and the major complications associated with the technology havelimited its use, especially in light of lengthy waiting lists for donor hearts.With the advent of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric ventricular assist device(VAD), pediatric heart failure specialists have gained an important tool forhelping this patient population survive until a donor heart can be identified.The EXCOR Pediatric VAD is designed to support pediatric patients of all agegroups, from newborns to teenagers, and can be used successfully for many months.This paper describes the early experience with the EXCOR Pediatric VAD and thechallenging journey undertaken to gain U.S. FDA approval, including successfulcompletion of the first worldwide prospective clinical study of VADs in apediatric population.© 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.
