It is not an etiological diagnosis, but may have differentunderlying causes and pathogenetic processes - viral, bacterial, toxic, andautoreactive. Clinical management of the disease entity at the acute stageinvolves hemodynamic monitoring in an intensive care unit or similar setting.Rapid routine work-up is mandatory with serial EKGs, echocardiography, cardiacMRI, heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy for histology,immunohistology, and molecular analysis for the underlying infection andpathogenesis. Heart failure therapy is warranted in all cases according tocurrent guidelines. For fulminant autoreactive myocarditis, immunosuppressivetreatment is beneficial; for viral myocarditis, IVIg can resolve theinflammation, reduce the viral load, and even eradicate the microbial agent.ECMO, IABP, ventricular assist devices, LifeVest, or ICD implantation can bridge to recovery or to heart transplantation.
