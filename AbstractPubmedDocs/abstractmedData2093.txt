Thecirculatory support was used as a bridge to heart transplantation. The patientwas in cardiogenic shock and was on assisted circulation for 18 days after which he underwent cardiac transplantation. While receiving support from theventricular assist device, the patient's condition improved remarkably and 50days after transplantation he was discharged from hospital. We give a detaileddescription of the surgical technique, with special emphasis on the proceduresfor air extraction. We describe the evolution of the hemodynamic status beforeand after implantation. Final inspection of the device and cannulae after removalshowed no thrombi and only small fibrin deposits in the membrane-wall junction.
