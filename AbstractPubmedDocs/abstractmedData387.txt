Electronic address:Cchrprinz@aol.com.OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether left ventricular dyssynchrony (LVD) at baseline is predictive for long-term outcome in heart failure (CHF) patients with leftventricular (LV) dysfunction and conduction disturbances treated with cardiacresynchronization therapy (CRT).METHODS: In 535 consecutive individuals with CHF scheduled for implantation of a CRT device, LVD was assessed by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), defined as anelectromechanical delay (EMD) difference of ≥40 ms in 2 opposed left ventricular wall regions (septal vs. lateral, anterior vs. inferior). All-cause mortality,heart transplantation, or assist device implantation was defined as combinedprimary end point. Secondary end points were measures of reverse LV remodelingand of symptomatic improvement.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 68 ± 36 [range: 4-150] months. LVD at baseline waspresent in 308 patients (61%). Of these, 24% reached the combined primaryendpoint in contrast to 58% of patients without LVD (p < 0.001). Furthermore,patients with LVD showed pronounced improvement of all secondary end pointparameters. In our cohort LVD was an independent predictor for outcome (hazardratio [95% CI]: 0.30 [0.21-0.42], p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: LVD at baseline as assessed by TDI is associated with a morepronounced clinical improvement and is a predictor for transplant-free long-term survival in CRT recipients.© 2013.
