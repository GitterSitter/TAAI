We report the clinicaloutcomes of 68 patients implanted with the DuraHeart as a bridge to cardiactransplantation in Europe.METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with advanced heart failure (six females), who wereeligible for cardiac transplantation were implanted with the DuraHeart betweenJanuary 2004 and July 2008. Median age was 58 (range: 29-74) years with 31% over 65 years. Thirty-three of these patients received the device as a part of theEuropean multi-center clinical trial. Survival analyses were conducted for 68patients and other safety and performance data were analyzed based on 33 trialpatients.RESULTS: Mean support duration was 242+/-243 days (range: 19-1148, median: 161)with a cumulative duration of 45 years. Thirty-five patients (51%) remainongoing, 18 transplanted, 1 explanted, and 14 died during support with a mediantime to death of 62 days. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate during support was 81%at 6 months and 77% at 1 year. Of the 13 patients (21%) supported for >1 year, 4 supported for >2 years, 1 supported >3 years, 2 transplanted, 2 died, and 9ongoing with a mean duration of 744+/-216 days (range: 537-1148, median: 651).Major adverse events included driveline/pocket infection, stroke, bleeding, andright heart failure. There was no incidence of pump mechanical failure, pumpthrombosis, or hemolysis.CONCLUSIONS: The DuraHeart was able to provide safe and reliable long-termcirculatory support with an improved survival and an acceptable adverse eventrate in advanced heart failure patients who were eligible for transplantation.
