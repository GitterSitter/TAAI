The study design was a retrospective reviewof prospectively collected data. Included were 42 patients who underwent cf-LVAD implantation (64.3% HeartMate II, 35.7% HeartWare) between July 2007 and May 2013with preoperative hepatic failure defined as elevation of greater than or equalto two liver function parameters above twice the upper normal range. Mean patientage was 35 ± 12.5 years, comprising 23.8% females. Dilated cardiomyopathy waspresent in 92.9% of patients (left ventricular ejection fraction 17.3 ± 5.9%).Mean support duration was 511 ± 512 days (range: 2-1996 days). Mean preoperative laboratory parameters for blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, total bilirubin,and alanine aminotransferase were 9.5 ± 5.4 mg/dL, 110.3 ± 42.8 μmol/L,51.7 ± 38.3 mmol/L, and 242.1 ± 268.6 U/L, respectively. All parameters decreasedsignificantly 1 month postoperatively. The mean preoperative modified Model forEndstage Liver Disease excluding international normalized ratio score was16.03 ± 5.57, which improved significantly after cf-LVAD implantation to10.62 ± 5.66 (P < 0.001) at 7 days and 5.83 ± 4.98 (P < 0.001) at 30 dayspostoperatively. One-year and 5-year survival was 75.9 and 48.1%, respectively.21.4% of the patients underwent LVAD explantation for myocardial recovery, 16.7% were successfully transplanted, and 7.1% underwent LVAD exchange for devicefailure over the follow-up period. Patients with preexisting acute hepaticfailure are reasonable candidates for cf-LVAD implantation, with excellent rates of recovery and survival, suggesting that cf-LVAD therapy should not be denied topatients merely on grounds of "preoperative elevated liver enzymes/hepatopathy."Copyright © 2014 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantationand Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
