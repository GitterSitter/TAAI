From this panel, we calculated aparsimonious multimarker score and assessed its performance in predicting risk ofdeath, cardiac transplantation, or ventricular assist device placement incomparison to an established clinical risk score, the Seattle Heart Failure Model(SHFM). During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, there were 317 outcomes: 187patients died; 99 were transplanted; and 31 had a ventricular assist deviceplaced. In unadjusted Cox models, patients in the highest tertile of themultimarker score had a 13.7-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes comparedwith the lowest tertile (95% confidence interval, 8.75-21.5). These effects were independent of the SHFM (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.80; 95% confidence interval,4.18-11.1). Addition of the multimarker score to the SHFM led to a significantly improved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803 versus0.756 (P=0.003) and appropriately reclassified a significant number of patientswho had the outcome into a higher risk category (net reclassificationimprovement, 25.2%; 95% confidence interval, 14.2-36.2%; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory chronic heart failure patients, a score derived frommultiple biomarkers integrating diverse biological pathways substantiallyimproves prediction of adverse events beyond current metrics.PMCID: PMC3387487
