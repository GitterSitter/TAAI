Heart Fail Clin. 2007 Jul;3(3):349-67.Destination therapy: does progress depend on left ventricular assist devicedevelopment?von Bayern MP(1), Cadeiras M, Deng MC.Author information: (1)College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032,USA.The role of therapy using mechanical circulatory support devices has evolvedrapidly over the last two decades. New developments in the field achieved smalleradverse events, but, currently, only minor improvements in survival were observedin published observational data. The authors discuss the development ofmechanical circulatory support devices as a "destination therapy" option forpatients who have end-stage heart failure and are ineligible for hearttransplantation as it relates to left ventricular assist device development.
