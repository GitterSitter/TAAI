Forty-three patients (mean age 62+/- 14 years) were supported after balloon pumping and pressors provedinadequate. Twenty-eight patients could not be weaned from cardiopulmonarybypass, 12 patients deteriorated in the intensive care unit after cardiacsurgery, and three had a bridged to transplantation. Overall, 47% (20/43) ofpatients could not be weaned from the ventricular assist devices, and 26% (11/43)were weaned but died before discharge, resulting in a hospital mortality rate of 72% (31/43). The remaining 28% (12/43) of patients were discharged and havesurvived 9 to 62 months. Early institution of ventricular assist devices (p less than 0.01), use of biventricular support (p less than 0.01), use of ventricularassist devices as a bridge to transplantation (p less than 0.05), and increasedoperator experience (p less than 0.05) were associated with improved survival.When patient and disease-related variables were analyzed, only age less than 60years (p less than 0.01) and unexpectedly preoperative myocardial infarctionassociated with shock (p less than 0.05) were related to improved survival. Deathwas caused by insufficient ventricular recovery, stroke, multiple organ systemfailure, sepsis, or a combination of these complications. During long-termfollow-up, two patients have died of congestive heart failure, and one issignificantly impaired from a stroke. Two other patients are functional class IIIand seven patients are class I. Although hospital mortality was high (72%), theuse of ventricular assist device support resulted in overall "long-term" survivalof a significant percentage (28%) of patients, 47% (8/17), in the past 12 months,all of whom would have died without it. Therefore we currently recommend a trial of ventricular assist devices support for most patients who fail to be weanedfrom cardiopulmonary bypass, deteriorate in the perioperative period, and as abridge to transplantation. Long-term survival is determined by the complications from ventricular assist devices support and functional status of the remainingmyocardium.
