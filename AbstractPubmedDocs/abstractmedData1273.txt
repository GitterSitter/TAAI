The aim of this study is to evaluate theefficacy of temporary support with a centrifugal blood pump as bridge to heartfunction recovery or bridge to transplantation. Heart recovery is achieved byimproving ventricular mechanical working conditions with proper modifications of preload and afterload. This article assesses the advantages of a novel 'cardiacchambers' cannulation setting versus the traditional one, in the case ofbiventricular or isolated right ventricular failure. The study was conductedusing a numerical computer model based on the work by Guyton, Sagawa, Westerhof, and Noordergraaf. Simulation of the planned trials was achieved by changing themodel parameters, the pump angular velocity, and the inflow and outflow settings.
