J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1994 Feb;107(2):472-80; discussion 480-1.Eight years' experience with bridging to cardiac transplantation.Pennington DG(1), McBride LR, Peigh PS, Miller LW, Swartz MT.Author information: (1)Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, St Louis, University Health SciencesCenter, Mo.Although bridging to cardiac transplantation has become a therapeutic option for transplant candidates whose condition deteriorates while they are awaiting adonor heart, short-term efficacy has not been proved and long-term survival hasnot been reported. We retrospectively reviewed data on 44 patients who hadcirculatory assist devices placed as a bridge to transplantation between May 1985and April 1993. The 35 male and nine female patients ranged in age from 12 to 65 years (mean 43.8 years). Thirty-one patients were supported with 32 Thoratec (18 left ventricular, 14 biventricular), 11 Novacor, and two Jarvik J-7-70 devices.The duration of device support was from 4 hours to 440 days (mean 45.5 days).Fifteen patients did not receive a donor organ because of infection (tenpatients), renal failure (five patients), bleeding (nine patients),cerebrovascular accident (three patients), ventricular fibrillation (onepatient), and right heart failure (one patient), and all died. Two patients were weaned from support and survived without transplantation. Twenty-seven patientsunderwent transplantation, and 26 survived (96%). Overall survival was 64%(28/44). Duration of survival ranged from 2 to 96 months (mean 35 months). Among the 28 hospital survivors, there were four late deaths (all transplantrecipients) at 3, 6, 14, and 68 months. Posttransplantation actuarial survivalsat 1, 5, and 8 years are 88%, 83%, and 66%. Twenty-three of the 24 patientspresently alive are in New York Heart Association functional class I. These data demonstrate the short- and long-term efficacy of bridging to transplantation withcirculatory support devices. The excellent survival and full functional recovery of patients undergoing transplantation ensure that donor organs are not being"wasted" on the sickest patients.
