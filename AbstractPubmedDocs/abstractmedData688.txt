Clin Transpl. 2012:135-43.Heart transplantations at the Heart Center IKEM, Prague, Czech Republic.Pirk J(1), Malek I, Netuka I, Hoskova L, Pokorna E, Kotulak T, Urban M.Author information: (1)Heart Center of Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (lKEM),Prague, Czech Republic. japx@ikem.czThe heart transplant program at the Institute for Clinical and ExperimentalMedicine in Prague was established on January 31, 1984. Through November 2012,881 orthotopic cardiac transplantations have been performed, with an annual rate of about 40 procedures. Current legislation concerning solid organtransplantations in the Czech Republic is described. Like other centers, we have noticed an increasing age of donors, and, reflecting the shortage of grafts, wehave expanded our selection criteria for heart transplantation. The advent of amechanical circulatory support program at our center in April 2003 has given usanother valuable tool in the management of chronic heart failure patients.Currently, around half of our patients are transplanted from mechanical support. Nonischemic etiology of heart failure is a leading cause of transplantation atour center, followed by ischemic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart lesions, andadult congenital heart diseases. Our current immunosupression protocol, includinginduction therapy, is outlined in detail and survival rates, as well as mostcommon complications and our treatment strategies, are also discussed.
