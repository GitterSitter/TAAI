The LVAD support improved force generation in response to beta-adrenergicstimulation in isolated LV (increase in developed force from 6.3 +/- 0.6 to 18.5 +/- 4.4 mN/m(2), p < 0.01) and RV (increase in developed force, from 10.9 +/- 2.0to 20.5 +/- 3.1 mN/m(2), p < 0.05) trabeculae. The LVAD patients had highermyocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density in LV (p < 0.01) and RV (p < 0.01).Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor 2(RyR2)/calcium release channel was significantly reduced by LVAD in both RV andLV (p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Improved beta-adrenergic responsiveness, normalization of the RyR2PKA phosphorylation, and increased beta-adrenergic receptor density in LV and RV after LVAD support suggest a primary role of neurohormonal environment indetermining reverse remodeling of the beta-adrenergic pathway.
