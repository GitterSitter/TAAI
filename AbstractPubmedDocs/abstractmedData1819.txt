In this patient group, the perioperative risk is elevated because of the pre-existing pathophysiology.Detailed evaluation and interdisciplinary differential therapeutic considerationson the basis of the comparative benefit rationale, with cardiac transplantationalternative, is mandatory.METHODS: Among 7275 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graftingbetween 1990 and 1998 in our institution, we found 51 patients who had had anejection fraction <20%, and thus were candidates for transplantation (groupCABG); these were compared with 163 patients who were listed for cardiactransplantation because of ischemic cardiomyopathy (group HTX). The survivalanalysis was performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principleindependent of subsequent transplantation.RESULTS: Both groups were comparable with regard to left-ventricular ejectionfraction; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and serum creatinine, but patientsin the CAGB group were older (63+/-11 vs 56+/-8; p = 0.001) and included a higherpercentage of women (m/f: 42/9 vs 152/11; p = 0.03). Nevertheless, there was asimilar 1-year survival in both groups (group BP 71.9% vs group HTX 66.3%; p =ns). Looking at the CABG group, the internal thoracic artery was used in 36/51patients, an intra-aortic balloon pump was used preoperatively in 26 patients,and intraoperatively in 6. Left-ventricular assist devices had to be inserted in three patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation once. Perioperative (30 day) survival was 88.2 %. An elevated preoperative serum creatinine and the nonusageof the internal thoracic artery predicted an adverse outcome. In the long-termcourse, the NYHA functional class improved in most cases from III preoperatively to I after 26 (2-66) months.CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, viablemyocardium, and graftable vessels can be revascularized with acceptable risk.Since for these patients a standby of mechanical circulatory support must beanticipated perioperatively, this infrastructure should be established within thecenter.
