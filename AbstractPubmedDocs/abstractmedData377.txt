We hypothesized that RVdysfunction is linked to weight loss, abnormal body composition, and worsenedprognosis in advanced HF.METHODS: Subjects with advanced HF (n = 408) underwent prospective assessment of body composition (skinfold thickness, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry),comprehensive echocardiography, and blood testing. Subjects were followed up for adverse events (defined as death, transplantation, or circulatory assist device).RESULTS: Subjects with RV dysfunction (51%) had lower body mass index, lower fat mass index, and were more likely to display cachexia (19%). The extent of RVdysfunction correlated with greater antecedent weight loss and a lower fat/leanbody mass ratio. Over a median follow-up of 541 days, there were 150 events(37%). Risk of event was greater in subjects with RV dysfunction (hazard ratio:3.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18 to 4.45]) and cachexia (hazard ratio:2.90 [95% CI: 2.00 to 4.12]) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Increasedbody mass index was associated with a lower event rate (HR per kg/m(2): 0.92 [95%CI: 0.88 to 0.96]), and this protection was mediated by a higher fat mass (0.91[95% CI: 0.87 to 0.96]) but not a fat-free mass index (0.97 [95% CI: 0.92 to1.03]).CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction and cardiac cachexia often coexist, have additiveadverse impact, and might be mechanistically interrelated. Wasting of fat but notof lean mass was predictive of adverse outcome, suggesting that fat loss iseither a surrogate of enhanced catabolism or adipose tissue is cardioprotectivein the context of HF.Copyright © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
