The costs and effectiveness of these drugshave yet to be compared in a prospective, randomized study.METHODS: We compared clinical outcomes and costs associated with the use ofdobutamine or milrinone in 36 hospitalized patients awaiting cardiactransplantation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either dobutamine or milrinone at the time of initial hospitalization and were followed until death,transplantation, or placement of mechanical cardiac support (intra-aortic balloonpump or left ventricular assist device).RESULTS: Seventeen patients were randomly assigned to receive dobutamine (meandose 4.1 +/- 1.4 microg/kg/min) and 19 patients received milrinone (mean dose0.39 +/- 1.0 microg/kg/min). Therapy lasted 50 +/- 46 days for those in thedobutamine group and 63 +/- 45 days in the milrinone group. We did not detectdifferences between the 2 groups in right heart hemodynamics, death, need foradditional vasodilator/inotropic therapy, or need for mechanical cardiac support before transplantation. Ventricular arrhythmias requiring increasedantiarrhythmic therapy occurred frequently in both groups. Total acquisition costof milrinone was significantly higher than that of dobutamine (16,270 dollars +/-1334 vs 380 dollars +/- 533 P <.00001).CONCLUSIONS: Both dobutamine and milrinone can be used successfully aspharmacologic therapy for a bridge to heart transplantation. Despite similarclinical outcomes, treatment with milrinone incurs greater cost.
