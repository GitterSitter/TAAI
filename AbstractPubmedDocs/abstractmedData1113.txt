With improved devices and increasing experience, thelength of time that children can be supported has increased. Donor organs remain scarce and there is significant associated morbidity.METHODS: Retrospective review of all children offered mechanical support as abridge to heart transplant over 10 years in one of the two UK pediatric hearttransplant centers. Outcomes during the years 1998 to 2002 were compared withoutcomes during the years 2003 to 2007.RESULTS: Forty children in 41 separate patient episodes received mechanicalsupport as a bridge to transplantation or, in 1 case, to recovery. Survival totransplant or recovery was achieved in 29 of 41 (71%); 26 of 40 children (63%)survived to hospital discharge. Devices used were extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (ECMO), the Medos HIAA, the Berlin Heart (from November 2005) and theLevitronix ventricular assist device (VAD) from 2007. All 3 children supportedwith the Levitronix survived to transplant (median duration of support 10 days). Ten of 13 children (77%) supported by the Berlin Heart survived to transplant or recovery (median duration of support 44 days). Four of 7 (57%) children supportedusing the Medos device survived to transplant (median duration of support 7days). Neurologic events were the most common cause of death in both eras (1998to 2002 and 2003 to 2008).CONCLUSIONS: Waiting times to pediatric cardiac transplant in the UK haveincreased. The Berlin Heart allows children to be bridged to transplant over longperiods. Neurologic morbidity remains as a major concern.
