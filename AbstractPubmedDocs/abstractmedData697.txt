Epub 2011 Dec 8.Mechanical circulatory support for right heart failure: current technology andfuture outlook.Hsu PL(1), Parker J, Egger C, Autschbach R, Schmitz-Rode T, Steinseifer U.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Engineering Institute of Applied MedicalEngineering, Helmholtz Institute, RWTH Aachen University, Germany.hsu@hia.rwth-aachen.deThe increasing global prevalence of congestive heart failure is a majorhealthcare concern, accounting for a high morbidity rate worldwide. Inparticular, isolated right heart dysfunction after cardiotomy has a poorprognosis and is associated with a high mortality rate. The occurrence ofpostoperative right heart failure may develop in more than 40% of patientsundergoing implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and cardiactransplantation. To date, mechanical cardiac assistance in the form of VADs hasbecome accepted as a therapeutic solution for end-stage patients when a donorheart is not available. However, right ventricular (RV) assistance is still inthe early phase of development when compared with LVAD technology.State-of-the-art RVADs, both in clinical use and under development, are reviewed in this manuscript. Clinical RVADs include the extracorporeal pulsatile AbiomedBVS 5000 and AB5000, Thoratec PVAD, MEDOS VAD, BerlinHeart Excor, thepercutaneous continuous flow CentriMag and TandemHeart systems, and theimplantable Thoratec IVAD. Devices on the horizon, including the wear-freeimplantable DexAide and the minimally invasive Impella RD, are additionallyreviewed. In addition to the current status of RV assistance, as well as thedevice categorization, the outlook and considerations for successful development of future RVADs were discussed.© 2011, Copyright the Authors.
