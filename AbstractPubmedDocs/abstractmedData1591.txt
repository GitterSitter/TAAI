Ventricular assist device induced systemic response.Thompson LO(1), Loebe M, Noon GP.Author information: (1)Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery, Division of Transplant Surgery andAssist Devices, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.Use of ventricular support systems has been associated with myriad systemiccomplications. Engendered by the blood-biomaterial interface of a uniquehost/device relationship, these complications include diverse humoral dyscrasias that frequently culminate in episodes of bleeding, hemolysis and thrombogenicity,heightened susceptibility to inflammation and infection, and transient immunalcompromise. Recent endeavor in biocompatibility research has served to illustratethe critical role played by cellular, humoral, and neurohormonal components inregulating cytokine expression and has provided insight into the complexitiesinvolved in such biomechanical juxtapositions. The following is intended as areview of current literature attempting to address the many aspects of thishost/device interaction and their consequences for the supported patient.
