According to the rapid development in the possibilities formechanical circulatory support (MCS), the increasing use of left ventricularassist devices (LVADs) as bridge to transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy (DT) reflects a change in the up-to-date therapy of HF. This article gives abroad overview concerning indications, patient selection, choice of the deviceand mainly a study update. It is clearly shown, that VAD therapy has become aneffective tool in the treatment of HF, and that the modern continuous flow pumps have replaced the older, bulky, pulsatile devices, especially in the LVAD sector.Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York.
