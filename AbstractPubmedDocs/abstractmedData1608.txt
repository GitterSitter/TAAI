The aim was to evaluate this novel mechanical circulatorysupport system in regard to overall outcome.METHODS: Prospective study in 15 HTx candidates (mean age 40+/-7 years) withterminal heart failure and maximal medical treatment due to ischemiccardiomyopathy (CMP, n=5), dilated CMP (n=3), restrictive CMP (n=2), unclassifiedCMP (n=1), metabolic CMP (n=1), valvular CMP (n=1) and congenital CMP (n=2). All patients were implanted with a MicroMed DeBakey LVAD. A rescue procedure wasnecessary in eight critical patients, while seven underwent elective LVADimplantation. Procedures were performed via median sternotomy, in normothermfemoro-femoral CPB (mean duration 59+/-1 min). Oral Marcoumar (INR 2.0-3.0) andAspirin (100 mg daily) were started as soon as possible. Patients were dischargedinto a specialized rehabilitation clinic from which it was possible to releasethem home after a few weeks.RESULTS: Successful implantation and discharge from ICU (mean stay 10+/-7 days)was possible in 11 patients. Seven were transplanted (mean support 50.7 days) andone is awaiting HTx (support >310 days) in the comfort of his home (NYHA I).Survival was 100% among the transplanted patients. Of the seven electiveimplants, five, and of the eight rescue procedures three patients underwentsuccessful HTx. Four patients died early, while three patients died late on pump support due to intracranial hemorrhage (n=2, 73 and 76 days) and chest infection (n=1, 124 days). All survivors were discharged from hospital, with significantdecrease in NYHA class (mean 3.8-2.4 (n=11)). Treadmill testing showed increased exercise tolerance, from 35 to 71W (n=4). Plasma BNP values (mean 950-162 ng/l(n=4)) and pulmonary resistance (mean 316-194.5 dyne s/cm(5) (n=3)) decreasedsignificantly during LVAD support.CONCLUSIONS: The MicroMed DeBakey LVAD is simple to implant; outpatient treatmentis safe and efficient. Patients' condition and pulmonary resistances normalizewithin 6 weeks, making previously considered inoperable patients amenable forHTx. HTx can be performed in low-risk situation, allowing better donor-recipient matching and improving overall outcome.
