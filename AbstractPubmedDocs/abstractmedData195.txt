However, its effectiveness has not been evaluatedsince approval. In this study we evaluated the EVAHEART device in a commercialsetting in Japan.METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients enrolled in the Japanese Registry forMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (J-MACS), who were listed fortransplant or likely to be listed and who received an EVAHEART device, wereenrolled from 2011 to 2013 at 14 Japanese centers. Patients' survival rates,adverse events and quality-of-life data were obtained from the J-MACS Registry.RESULTS: Patients' median age was 43 years (85% male). The Interagency Registryfor Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profiles revealed 12 patients inLevel 1, 45 in Level 2, 37 in Level 3 and 1 in Level 4. The mean support durationwas 384.7 days, with a cumulative duration of 101.2 years. The Kaplan-Meiersurvival rate during support was 93.4% at 6 months, 87.4% at 1 year and 87.4% at 2 years. Seventy-seven patients (80.2%) currently remain on support, 7 received atransplant and 10 died during support. Major adverse events included drive-lineinfection (14.6%) and neurologic events such as ischemic stroke (17.7%),hemorrhage (13.5%), transient ischemic attack (3.1%), pump thrombosis (1%) andhemolysis (1%). There was no gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or right heartfailure requiring right ventricular assist device (RVAD). There was no pumpexchange due to mechanical failure.CONCLUSIONS: The EVAHEART device provides safe, reliable and long-termcirculatory support with improved survival in commercial settings of BTT inJapan, where the transplant waiting period is much longer. Incidences of GIbleeding, hemolysis, right ventricular failure, device thrombosis and mechanical failure were extremely rare in patients on EVAHEART devices.Copyright Â© 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.Published by Elsevier Inc.
