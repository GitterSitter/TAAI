We evaluated structural changes at the time of leftventricular assist device implantation in heart failure patients who had beenexposed to anthracycline, and we correlated those changes with clinicalpresentation. We retrospectively studied left ventricular core samples taken atimplantation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device in 12 heartfailure patients (mean age, 46 ± 16 yr) who had histories of anthracyclineexposure. We evaluated those samples for hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and fibrosis.Histopathologic findings showed moderate-to-severe myocyte hypertrophy, moderate myocytolysis, and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis with areas ofreplacement fibrosis. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked decreases inmyofibrils, diffuse mitochondrial swelling, and disorganization of thesarcoplasmic reticulum. The interval between anthracycline therapy and heartfailure was a mean of 6.8 ± 5.7 years; duration of heart failure symptoms, 38 ±47 months; and duration of device support, 414 ± 266 days. Four patients arecontinuing on device support, 3 have undergone transplantation, 3 have undergone device explantation, and 2 have died. The time of heart failure onset and theduration of symptoms did not correlate with the severity and extent of thehistopathologic changes. The histopathologic findings and the clinical coursevaried in heart failure patients with anthracycline exposure. No correlation was observed between anthracycline therapy and the development or duration of heartfailure symptoms, severity of histopathologic changes, or outcomes.PMCID: PMC4382876
