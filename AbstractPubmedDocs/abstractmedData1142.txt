In theera of destination therapy and the total artificial heart, predicting post-LVADRV failure requiring mechanical support is extremely important.METHODS: We reviewed patient characteristics, laboratory values and hemodynamicdata from 266 patients who underwent LVAD placement at the University ofPennsylvania from April 1995 to June 2007.RESULTS: Of 266 LVAD recipients, 99 required RV assist device (BiVAD) placement(37%). We compared 36 parameters between LVAD (n = 167) and BiVAD patients (n =99) to determine pre-operative risk factors for RV assist device (RVAD) need. By univariate analysis, 23 variables showed statistically significant differencesbetween the two groups (p < or = 0.05). By multivariate logistic regression,cardiac index < or =2.2 liters/min/m(2) (odds ratio [OR] 5.7), RV stroke workindex < or =0.25 mm Hg . liter/m(2) (OR 5.1), severe pre-operative RV dysfunction(OR 5.0), pre-operative creatinine > or =1.9 mg/dl (OR 4.8), previous cardiacsurgery (OR 4.5) and systolic blood pressure < or =96 mm Hg (OR 2.9) were thebest predictors of RVAD need.CONCLUSIONS: The most significant predictors for RVAD need were cardiac index, RVstroke work index, severe pre-operative RV dysfunction, creatinine, previouscardiac surgery and systolic blood pressure. Using these data, we constructed an algorithm that can predict which LVAD patients will require RVAD with >80%sensitivity and specificity.PMCID: PMC3235680
