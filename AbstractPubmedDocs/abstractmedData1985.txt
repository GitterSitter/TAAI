Circulation. 1995 Nov 1;92(9 Suppl):II191-5.Effect of the implantable left ventricular assist device on neuroendocrineactivation in heart failure.James KB(1), McCarthy PM, Thomas JD, Vargo R, Hobbs RE, Sapp S, Bravo E.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.BACKGROUND: The HeartMate left ventricular assist device has been successfullyused as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Because many patients exhibit markedclinical improvement in their heart failure after HeartMate implantation, westudied the physiological effect of this device on the neurohormonal axis.METHODS AND RESULTS: In 13 patients awaiting transplant (mean cardiac index, 1.7 +/- 0.3 L.min-1.m-2) who underwent HeartMate implantation, venous atrialnatriuretic peptide, epinephrine, norepinephrine, plasma renin activity,angiotensin, and arginine vasopressin were measured immediately before insertion and at explant/transplantation. Mean time to explant was 86 +/- 40 days. Allpatients were taken off inotropic medications within 1 month. Mean cardiac index on support before explant was 3.1 +/- 0.9 L.min-1.m-2. Plasma renin activitydecreased from 57 +/- 56 ng.mL-1.h-1 at baseline (before insertion) to 3 +/- 3ng.mL-1.h-1 at explant (mean percent change, 92%; P < .001). Angiotensin II leveldecreased from 237 +/- 398 U/L at baseline to 14 +/- 14 U/L at explant (meanpercent change, 73%; P < .001). Plasma epinephrine level fell from 6800 +/- 1323 pg/mL at baseline to 46 +/- 46 pg/mL at explant (mean percent change, 86%; P <.001). Norepinephrine level decreased from 2953 +/- 1457 pg/mL at baseline to 518+/- 290 pg/mL at explant (mean percent change, 79%; P < .001). Atrial natriureticpeptide fell from baseline values of 227 +/- 196 to 168 +/- 40 pg/mL at explant(mean percent change, -49%; P = 519); and arginine vasopressin level decreasedfrom 6 +/- 6 pg/mL at baseline to 0.8 +/- 0.5 pg/mL (mean percent change, 69%; P = .002).CONCLUSIONS: We provide data supporting that the neurohormonal axis markedlyimproves after HeartMate implantation, providing biochemical confirmation of the improvement in hemodynamic status.
