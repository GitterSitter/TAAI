Primarily on the basisof these animal data, the notion that chronic left ventricular assist device(LVAD)-induced unloading will result in atrophy has dominated the clinical heart failure field, and anti-atrophic drugs have been used to enhance the cardiacrecovery potential observed in some LVAD patients. However, whetherunloading-induced atrophy in experimental normal heart models applies to failing and hypertrophic myocardium in heart failure patients unloaded by continuous-flowLVADs has not been studied.OBJECTIVES: The study examined whether mechanical unloading by continuous-flowLVAD leads to myocardial atrophy.METHODS: We prospectively examined myocardial tissue and hemodynamic andechocardiographic data from 44 LVAD patients and 18 untransplanted normal donors.RESULTS: Cardiomyocyte size (cross-sectional area) decreased after LVAD unloadingfrom 1,238 ± 81 μm(2) to 1,011 ± 68 μm(2) (p = 0.001), but not beyond that ofnormal donor hearts (682 ± 56 μm(2)). Electron microscopy ultrastructuralevaluation, cardiomyocyte glycogen content, and echocardiographic assessment ofmyocardial mass and left ventricular function also did not suggest myocardialatrophy. Consistent with these findings, t-tubule morphology, cytoplasmicpenetration, and distance from the ryanodine receptor were not indicative ofongoing atrophic remodeling during LVAD unloading. Molecular analysis revealed noup-regulation of proatrophic genes and proteins of the ubiquitin proteasomesystem.CONCLUSIONS: Structural, ultrastructural, microstructural, metabolic, molecular, and clinical functional data indicated that prolonged continuous-flow LVADunloading does not induce hypertrophy regression to the point of atrophy anddegeneration. These findings may be useful in designing future investigationsthat combine LVAD unloading and pharmaceutical therapies as a bridge to recovery of the failing heart.Copyright © 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
