Wereport early and mid-term outcomes of surgical interventions including leftventricular restoration for patients with cardiogenic shock.METHODS: From April 2001 to June 2007, 10 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathywho developed cardiogenic shock underwent left ventricular restoration combinedwith mitral annuloplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting. All had beensupported by a maximum dose of inotropic agents, 8 had required an intraaorticballoon pump, and 1 had required extracorporeal life support. Mean leftventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices were 142 +/- 33 mL/m(2)and 113 +/- 28 mL/m(2), respectively, and ejection fraction was 0.21 +/- 0.059.RESULTS: There was no mortality at 30 days. Five patients demonstratedsignificant recovery after the operation. Three patients simultaneously underwentleft ventricular assist system (LVAS) implantation with left ventricularrestoration because of preexisting severe end-organ failure, and 2 of them weresubsequently weaned from LVAS, although 1 required reimplantation. The other 2patients eventually underwent LVAS implantation in the early postoperativeperiod. Two patients who required prolonged LVAS support underwent successfulheart transplantation. Seven patients are alive at a mean follow-up of 1.9 years.Patients who required prolonged LVAS support had significantly longer duration ofheart failure symptoms (p = 0.04) and higher mean pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.02) preoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: Early combined surgical interventions including left ventricularrestoration can be a choice of treatment even in patients with ischemiccardiomyopathy complicated with cardiogenic shock. Additional use of the LVASfollowed by bridge to recovery or transplantation should be appropriately appliedin these critically ill patients.
