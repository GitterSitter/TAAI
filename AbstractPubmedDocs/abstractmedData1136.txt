Perioperative transesophageal echocardiographyis becoming an invaluable tool to investigate device function during implantationand in case of mechanical malfunction. Most malfunctions are due to inflow graft occlusion, or device malfunction, while outflow graft dysfunction is rare. Here, we present a case of severe outflow conduit obstruction by a rare environmentalfungus, Myceliophthora thermophila. After replacement of the infected device and intensive antifungal treatment, heart transplantation was performed 2 yr later.
