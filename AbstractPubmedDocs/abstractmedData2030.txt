J Heart Lung Transplant. 1994 Jan-Feb;13(1 Pt 1):93-100; discussion 100-1.Preoperative predictors of survival in patients with Thoratec ventricular assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation. Thoratec Ventricular Assist Device Principal Investigators.Farrar DJ(1).Author information: (1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, California Pacific Medical Center, SanFrancisco 94115.Approximately two-thirds of patients implanted with ventricular assist devicesrecover sufficiently to requalify for heart transplantation, and the otherone-third die of complications that are often secondary to delayed ventricularassist device implantation and subsequent end-organ failure. To determine whetherany preoperative predictors of survival exist, univariate statistics andmultivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis were performed onpre-ventricular assist device demographics, hemodynamics, and blood chemistry in 186 patients receiving Thoratec ventricular assist devices (Thoratec LaboratoriesCorp., Berkeley, Calif.) while awaiting transplantation. The duration ofcirculatory support averaged 19.6 days (maximum, 226 days). One hundredthirty-seven patients (74%) received biventricular support, 47 received isolated left ventricular assist devices, and two received right ventricular assistdevices. The average blood flow was 5.0 +/- 0.9 L/min. One hundred eighteenpatients (63%) ultimately received heart transplants, of whom 96 patients weredischarged. Age, gender, weight, and diagnosis were not related to survival, nor were preoperative cardiac index, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, intraaortic balloon pumps, or cardiac arrests. Pre-ventricular assist device creatininelevels (p = 0.24) and total bilirubin levels (p = 0.09) were not significant, butblood urea nitrogen level (p = 0.02) and previous operations (p = 0.05) wererelated to survival, using univariate techniques. Patients with cardiacoperations more than 30 days previously had the lowestsurvival-to-transplantation (39%) compared with patients with no previousoperations (67%) or operations within the previous 30 days (61%). Blood ureanitrogen level was the only parameter found to be significant (p = 0.016) in amultivariate model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
