However, thromboembolism remains a leading cause of mortality in this population. We describe the successful treatment ofnative aortic valve thrombosis with bivalirudin in a patient with factor V Leidenmutation, who had undergone left ventricular assist device implantation,preventing the need for further surgical intervention.
