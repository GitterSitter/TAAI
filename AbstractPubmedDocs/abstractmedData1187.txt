All patients survived formore than 1 year. One patient was successfully transplanted and another wasbridged to an adequate degree of recovery; unfortunately, the third patient died on postoperative day 375 while waiting for a suitable donor heart. Consistentwith the complications associated with left ventricular assist devices in adults,the main complications in these pediatric patients were infection andthromboembolism.CONCLUSIONS: The VentrAssist may provide a major advancement in the management oflarger children and adolescents with end-stage heart failure.
