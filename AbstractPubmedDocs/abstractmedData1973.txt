The size and geometryare based on human anatomic measurements and fluid dynamic studies. Atranscutaneous energy transfer powers the system and recharges the implantablenickel-cadmium battery pack. Autotuning circuitry optimizes energy transferefficiency over a range of transcutaneous energy transfer coil spacings andmisalignments. An infrared diaphragm position sensor detects end-systole anddiastole points.RESULTS: In vitro and acute in vivo tests have demonstrated flow rates greaterthan 6 L/min. The transcutaneous energy transfer system demonstrated powertransfer efficiencies of 60% to 80% for power demands from 5 to 60 W. Thirteensystems are currently undergoing durability testing; one has run for more than750 days failure-free. The system recently sustained circulation in an acute calfimplantation for 96 hours.CONCLUSIONS: Results of the in vitro and in vivo testing to date havedemonstrated that the developed system can function effectively as a totallyimplantable ventricular assist device. Chronic in vivo evaluation is planned.
