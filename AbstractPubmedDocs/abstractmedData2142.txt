J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1988 Jul;96(1):62-71.Isolated left ventricular assist as bridge to cardiac transplantation.Starnes VA(1), Oyer PE, Portner PM, Ramasamy N, Miller PJ, Stinson EB, BaldwinJC, Ream AK, Wyner J, Shumway NE.Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Stanford University Medical Center94305.The electrically driven Novacor implantable left ventricular assist device hasbeen implanted in six patients (four men and two women) since Sept. 7, 1984. Infour of the six patients (67%) the device was a successful bridge to cardiactransplantation. One patient died of multiple organ failure and Candida sepsisafter 16 days of support with the device. One patient died in the operating room of uncontrollable hemorrhage and biventricular failure caused by severe cardiacrejection. Three patients are alive with cardiac transplants 38, 17, and 10months after transplantation. One patient died after cardiac transplantation ofpresumed sepsis. The Novacor left ventricular assist device performed in allcases without mechanical or electrical failure. Excluding the intraoperativedeath, assist duration ranged from 2 to 16 days. The cardiac index (synonymouswith device output) ranged from 2.4 to 3.4 L/min/m2. No embolic events(cerebrovascular or systemic) occurred during assistance with the device. Minimalred cell hemolysis was documented during the period of support. The Novacor left ventricular assist device is a safe and effective bridge to cardiactransplantation in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock.
