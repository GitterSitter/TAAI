Implantation of left or bi-ventricular assist device (LVAD/BiVAD) as abridge to HTx may save many of these doomed patients' lives.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 1994 and December 2006, 29 terminally illpatients (age 2.5-65 years, mean 48 years) underwent VADs implantation as bridge to HTx. The HeartMate VE LVAD was used in 18 patients, Thoratec pneumatic BiVADin 7, Berlin Heart Excor BiVAD in one, and HeartMate II axial flow, Thoratecpneumatic and Biomedicus centrifugal LVADs in one each. Indications for VADsimplantation were CS in 16 patients (55%) and intractable THF in 13 pts (45%).Etiologies were ischemic in 20 patients, idiopathic dilated, myocarditis andcongenital in 2 patients each, and valvular, post partum and HTx graftvasculopathy in one patient each.RESULTS: Seventeen patients (59%) survived VADs implantation and underwent HTx orare ongoing. Mean survival on VADs was 72 days (range 1-353 days, total 5.2patient years). Seven patients (24%) were discharged home while on LVAD supportfor a mean of 146 days. Nine of the transplanted patients (64%) were dischargedhome. In 4 LVAD patients the cause of death was RV failure necessitating laterimplantation of RVAD.CONCLUSIONS: VADs implantation as bridge to HTx in CS or THF saves many of these doomed patients, sometimes providing quality out-of-hospital life while waitingfor HTx. Early recognition of RV failure and liberal use of BiVAD is important.
