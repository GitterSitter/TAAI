There is no clearlyproven policy to manage end-stage heart failure patients with valvularpathologies. The aim of this report was to analysis our experience with combined approach of VAD implantation and valvular procedures among patients with valvularheart disease and end-stage heart failure.METHODS: We evaluated the clinical records of 67 patients who underwent MCS from April 2007 to September 2011. We identified 12 patients (17.9%) who receivedconcomitant valvular procedures, four of whom had significant aorticinsufficiency and received a simple coaptation stitch at the center toapproximate the fibrous nodules of Arantius. The mechanical aortic valve wasreplaced with a stentless bioprosthesis in three patients. Mitral valvecommissurotomy was performed in one patient with mitral stenosis and sevenpatients underwent tricuspit valve repair using an annuloplasty ring.RESULTS: All 12 patients were males, of mean age 50.3 ± 11.5 years (range =25-66). Eleven of them (91.6%) survived the early and late postoperative periods.Ten subjects (83.3%) continue to be supported with VAD; 1 (8.3%) was successfullybridged to transplantation. Each study participant regression of the valvularpathologies by early echocardiography demonstrated.CONCLUSION: Concomitant valve surgery during VAD implantation appeared to be areasonable option in end-stage heart failure patients with valvular heartdisease.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.
