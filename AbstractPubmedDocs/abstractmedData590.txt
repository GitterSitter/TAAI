The patient did not meet the criteria for hearttransplantation and declined left ventricular assist device implantation. Wedecided to conduct cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D)implantation. Under general anaesthesia for CRT-D implantation, cardiac function worsened. Due to deteriorating haemodynamics, CRT-D implantation was aborted and emergent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) implantationwas performed. Subsequent weaning from ECMO was not possible. We decided toproceed with CRT-D implantation while still on ECMO support. With biventricularstimulation, cardiac function improved promptly and the patient could be weanedfrom ECMO the same day.PMCID: PMC3480607
