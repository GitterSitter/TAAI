Anesthesia wasinduced and maintained with midazolam and fentanyl. Transesophagealechocardiography (TEE) and a PA catheter were useful for hemodynamic monitoringand management of the patients. Furthermore, TEE is useful for the earlydetection of inflow of the air which is absorbed by negative pressure derivedfrom high LVAD support pressure. On starting LVAD support, evaluation of rightventricular function and treatment for right ventricular failure were importantand necessary for the patients. Added to conventional therapy usingcatecholamines, inhaled nitric oxide may provide a favorable effect for rightventricular failure.
