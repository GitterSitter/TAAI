Five patients in our center had amechanical aortic valve at the time of device implantation and were studiedregarding thromboembolic complications.DESIGN: Five patients operated upon with an LVAD (1 HeartMate I™, 4 HeartMateII™) between 2002 and 2011 had a mechanical aortic valve at the time ofimplantation. The first patient had a patch closure of the aortic valve. In four patients, the prosthesis was left in place. Anticoagulants included aspirin,warfarin, and clopidogrel.RESULTS: The average and accumulated treatment times were 150 and 752 days,respectively. Three of the five patients showed early signs of valve thrombosison echo with concomitant valve dysfunction. Four patients were transplantedwithout thromboembolic events during pump treatment. One patient died from ahemorrhagic stroke after 90 days on the LVAD.CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of leaving a mechanical heart valve in place at thetime of LVAD implantation in five patients led to valvular thrombosis in threebut did not provoke embolic events. It increased the complexity of postoperative anticoagulation.
