The study spans from July 2005 to July 2010. We transplanted 11 patients of mean age 11.8 ± 4.49 years, 3 of whom with critical hemodynamic situationswere bridged to heart transplantation by VAD implantation. Despite the poor rightventricular systolic functions, they did not require right rVAD. In addition, 2patients who underwent VAD implantation are still awaiting a donor heart. Themean follow-up was 825.27 ± 630.23 days (range, 21-1,888 days).RESULTS: There was no serious complication during VAD support. The overall heart transplantation mortality rate was 9.1% (1/11). In all patients, impairedend-organ functions were improved by VAD implantation before the hearttransplantation. Cardiac biopsies revealed 4 grade 2R rejection episodes, whichwere successfully controlled in 3 patients.CONCLUSION: Heart transplantation is highly effective therapy for pediatricpatients with end-stage heart failure. Pediatric VAD implantation providedsatisfactory safe circulatory support for small children in poor condition on thewaiting list. This option should be considered for all pediatric candidates whoshow a poor hemodynamic status.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
