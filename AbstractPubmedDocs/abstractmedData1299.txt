The treatmentobjective was bridge-to-transplantation. All patients received LMWH intherapeutic doses according to body weight, in combination with daily aspirin 160mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and three times dipyridamole 75 mg. Effectiveness of thelow molecular weight regime was monitored through measurement of antifactor Xaactivity (base and peak levels). Antiplatelet therapy was monitored throughweekly platelet function tests. Within this group of 10 patients, six patientssuccessfully received transplants and four patients died, the latest death after 405 days of INCOR support. Causes of death were sepsis, intestinal hemorrhage,acute right ventricular failure, and one major stroke. Long-term management ofINCOR assist devices using a combination of LMWH and antiplatelet therapy isfeasible. This treatment strategy can serve as an alternative to oralanticoagulants.
