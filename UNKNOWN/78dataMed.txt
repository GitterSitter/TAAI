We report the outcomes of obese patients who underwentimplantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) using a pulsatile(HeartMate XVE [XVE]) or continuous flow (HeartMate II [HMII]) design and theeffect on body mass index (BMI).METHODS: Of 37 patients with BMI >30Â kg/m(2) who underwent LVAD implantation, 29 survived at least 30 days and were followed for weight change. In the 30-daysurvivors, end points of the study were continued LVAD support, heart transplant,or death. One patient underwent gastric bypass surgery and was excluded.RESULTS: In the 28 patients who met inclusion criteria, BMI was 35.6 Â±4.4Â kg/m(2) at baseline, and at follow-up was 33.1 Â± 5.5Â kg/m(2) (mean BMIchangeÂ -2.5Â kg/m(2); PÂ = .063), with a mean follow-up time of 301.6 Â± 255.5 days.The XVE group showed a significant BMI reduction of 3.9Â kg/m(2) (PÂ = .016 vsbaseline); however, the HMII group showed 0.1Â kg/m(2) increase in BMI.BMIÂ <30Â kg/m(2) at follow-up was achieved in 6 patients (21\%), 5 of 19 (26\%) inXVE group, and 1 of 9 (11\%) in HMII group. In the 14 patients (12 XVE, 2 HMII) or50\% who received a heart transplant, the mean decrease in BMI was 4.6Â kg/m(2)(PÂ = .003).CONCLUSIONS: LVAD placement in patients with BMI >30Â kg/m(2) provided significantweight loss in the pulsatile XVE group, but not in recipients of the continuousflow HMII. In patients successfully bridged to a heart transplant after LVADinsertion, mean reduction in BMI was 4.6Â kg/m(2) (PÂ = .003). LVAD implantationprovides a period of hemodynamic support for obese patients with advanced heartfailure, during which time opportunity may be available for weight loss.Pulsatile devices appear to be associated with greater weight loss thannonpulsatile continuous flow devices. Additional therapies may be necessary toachieve significant weight loss in recipients of the continuous flow LVAD.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.
